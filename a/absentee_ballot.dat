The VRI has instituted a “Grads Vote” program which supplies voter registration forms to all graduating high school seniors. The VRI has also partnered with the U.S. Postal Service to include voter registration forms in government moving packets {{and with the}} Overseas Vote Foundation to improve online <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> applications for overseas and military voters.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of absentee ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> voting results. The 2010 election race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E
5|$|All ballots, <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> envelopes, {{and voting}} {{machines}} were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, absentee ballots were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{reports say}} Florida, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., (and {{possibly}} other states) have received record numbers of requests for <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> for this election. <b>Absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> are counted differently {{based on the}} state, [...] with most states counting them on election day, but with some exceptions, the last deadline being 10 days after the election (all Washington, D.C. <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots,</b> and oversea <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> in Ohio and Florida). Washington State allows 15 days after the election for out of country <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> to come in. It is possible that <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> are being requested due to concerns about electronic voting, or simply due to an expected high overall voter turnout.|$|R
50|$|<b>Absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> {{were also}} an issue. There were reports of <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> being mailed out {{too late for}} some voters to {{complete}} and return them in time. In some instances, officials argued that last-minute litigation over Ralph Nader’s ballot status or other issues had prevented them from finalizing the <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> as early as they wanted to. In Broward County, Florida, some 58,000 <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> were delivered to the Postal Service to be mailed to voters, according to county election officials, but the Postal Service said it had never received them.|$|R
50|$|The {{provisional}} {{result on}} 22 May gave Hofer 51.9% of the votes, {{not counting the}} <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots,</b> which were expected to favour Van der Bellen. Hence the outcome remained unclear pending the counting of <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> on Monday 23 May. The final result, including <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots,</b> gave Van der Bellen 50.3%. He was to succeed Heinz Fischer as president on 8 July 2016.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the threat}} from Iselle, {{lieutenant}} governor candidate Warner Sutton requested that Governor Neil Abercrombie postpone the August9 primary. The governor declined the request, and the primary election occurred as scheduled. However, the storm damaged roads leading to two polling stations on the Big Island, prompting officials to decide the election by <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> in those areas. After a close campaign between incumbent Senator Brian Schatz and Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa, the senate primary, held {{on the same day}} as the gubernatorial primary, was too close to call after Schatz led by only 1,635votes. As a result, the election hinged on the two closed polling stations, where more than 8,000people had the option to vote by mail. This was later changed to an in-person vote for August15, despite a challenge from the Hanabusa campaign with regards to storm damage, and Schatz ultimately won. The Hawaii American Civil Liberties Union later sued the state over how they handled the election.|$|E

He ran for the now vacant position of Senate Minority Leader, but was defeated by South Dakota Senator Tom Daschle by one vote. The vote was tied 23–23, and it was Colorado Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell who cast the deciding vote by <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> in favor of Daschle.|$|E
25|$|The count {{that took}} place on {{election}} night gave Flood a one-vote lead. On March 18, the Westchester County Board of Elections recounted the votes, giving Malloy a one-vote lead. Turning to two unopened absentee ballots, the board found that one was for Flood, resulting in a tie. The other <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> was not opened as {{the name on the}} envelope did not match any names on the voter-registration list. Susan B. Morton, who had registered to vote as Susan Brenner Morton, stepped forward three days later and demanded that her vote for Malloy be counted. For several months afterward, various suits, motions, and appeals were filed in state courts. On October 20, the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, denied requests by Malloy and Morton, leaving the election in a tie. To comply with state law, the village had to use random lots to decide the winner.|$|E

25|$|Virginia {{election}} {{authorities were}} ordered {{by a federal}} judge to preserve late-arriving <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by the McCain campaign. It alleged that the state sent <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> late to service members. According to federal law, <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> must be mailed to troops in foreign countries at least 45 days before an election. The charge against Virginia was that the ballots were not printed until after the deadline and therefore were mailed late to soldiers abroad.|$|R
25|$|Pauker's {{testimony}} stressed that, {{during the}} electoral campaign, {{much of the}} formerly landless peasantry was becoming suspicious of the BPD. She attested that, in several counties in Moldavia, the <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> was becoming a widespread solution {{among members of the}} latter social category ("Asked whom they would vote for, peasants answer: «We'll think about it some more» or «We shall not be voting»"). While disheartened by the government's apparent failure to provide help, they also dismissed the opposition's PNŢ, whom they saw as representative of the landlords and opposed to the land reform. According to Pauker, they predicted that the Groza cabinet had carried out a previous land reform only as a preliminary step to collectivization ("Peasants answer that in Russia as well, in the beginning the land was divided, then taken away and kolkhozy were set up. We have no convincing arguments against such objections from the peasants").|$|E
25|$|Re-elected in 2012, she was {{assigned}} to the judiciary committee. Additionally, {{as a member of the}} joint committee tasked with revising the constitution, she advocated that the <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> and a voting age of sixteen be enshrined in the document. In 2013, she joined the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. For the second half of 2014, she was the PNL's spokeswoman. In December 2014, PNL president Klaus Iohannis, previously elected President of Romania, resigned from the party prior to taking office, as required under the constitution. Gorghiu ran to succeed him, earning his endorsement in the process. She was elected on a vote of 47 to 28, defeating Ludovic Orban and thus becoming both the party's youngest leader and the first female in the position. In addition to leading the PNL, she was also, alongside Vasile Blaga, the co-president of a revamped PNL that is scheduled to formally merge with the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) in 2017. Following the PNL's defeat in the 2016 election, Gorghiu resigned as party leader. At the same time, she advanced to the Senate, winning a seat for Timiș County.|$|E

According to Coleman's attorney, this left approximately 3,500 ballots still open for consideration. The order also specified that parties must demonstrate that disputed ballots were legally cast, not just that they should not have been rejected, making it more difficult to argue in favor of counting remaining <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots.</b>|$|R
25|$|On February 3, {{the panel}} allowed Coleman to {{introduce}} evidence {{that as many as}} 4,800 <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> were wrongly rejected and should now be counted.

5000|$|In February 2014, the Ohio House {{approved}} {{a bill that}} eliminated the so-called [...] "Golden Week" [...] during which Ohio voters could register and vote on the same day. The bill also cut six days from Ohio's early voting period. In a separate bill, the House {{made it easier for}} registrars to reject <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> for missing information. This bill ends a program that mailed <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots</b> to all registered voters. Under the new law, Ohio's secretary of state would have to get lawmaker approval to mail these <b>absentee</b> <b>ballots.</b>|$|R
500|$|During the {{election}} season, the CRNC focuses on developing a [...] "mass based youth effort" [...] directed toward electing Republican candidates. The CRNC often sends paid field representatives to individual campuses {{to assist in}} organizing {{the election}} efforts. Generally the hired field representative or chapter chair begins the school year with membership tables on campus for recruitment. Members use door-to-door canvassing and word of mouth to identify and register as many Republican voters among the student body as possible. These individuals are encouraged to vote through an <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> and assist the candidates with election day Get Out The Vote efforts.

500|$|In 2008 Ohio {{experienced}} an unintended {{consequence of a}} new statute {{that resulted in a}} brief period of overlap voting, when absentee voting has started and before the close of voter registration. [...] This period ran from September 30 until October 6, due to the newly instituted early voting policy. On August 13, 2008, Brunner ordered county election board officials to establish procedures to enable voters who register to be immediately issued an <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot.</b> [...] Because a voter could show up with only a cell phone bill, give any four digits and claim they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number, and then immediately vote and have such ballots put into the same pool as other votes with no procedure for more rigorous scrutiny of their validity, the Republican Party opposed the same day voting plan and fought it in several Ohio Courts. Ohio Republican Party officials and Republican voters argued in separate lawsuits that Ohio law requires voters to be registered for 30 days before they cast an <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot.</b> On September 29, 2008 (a day after lower state and federal courts overruled GOP objections to same-day registration and voting or GOP requests for mandated ballot segregation and verification) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio rejected Republican efforts to stop the plan. [...] United States district court judge James Gwin in Cleveland, Ohio also ruled against the Republicans and issued a restraining order to enforce Brunner's plan. In Columbus, Ohio, U.S. District Judge George Smith declined to rule on another statewide challenge, deferring to the state Supreme Court's decision. The rulings, which opened a window to register and vote on the same day until the <b>absentee</b> <b>ballot</b> deadline on October 6, 2008, was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision in which two Republican jurists who were on the November 2008 ballot recused themselves and were replaced by one Republican and one Democrat by Chief Justice Thomas Moyer. [...] The normal roster of Ohio Supreme Court jurists is all Republican and the lone Democrat replacement, William H. Wolff, Jr., cast the tie-breaking vote. [...] The dissenters noted that Ohio's Constitution requires that a person register to vote 30 days in before voting. Brunner ordered segregation of same-day-registration ballots and verification of them before counting them on Election Day, November 4, 2008. [...] In related proceedings on September 30, 2008, Judge Smith of The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Columbus had granted an Ohio Republican Party request for a restraining order that would mandate election observers during early voting. [...] Brunner prevailed in the appellate court which ruled that the district court “abused its discretion” in granting the restraining order.|$|E
