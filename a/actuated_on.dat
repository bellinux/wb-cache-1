Unlike the water tank retained at Grandchester station, the Murphy's Creek tank features a high flow water delivery system utilising a water jib or crane. An electric pump {{is used to}} reticulate water into the tank being supplied from mains power. A swing jib is situated on the north tank face adjacent to the mainline, and is used to deliver water through a gravity-fed pipe-work system into a corresponding filling hole on the tender water tank of a steam locomotive. A canvas hose is used to direct {{the flow of water}} into the tender tank. The jib is operated manually by a locomotive fireman standing on the tender tank, swinging the jib to a position 90 degrees {{from the face of the}} tank and controlling the flow of water from the jib via a valve and float system <b>actuated</b> <b>on</b> the filling pipe.

We {{identify}} {{two kinds of}} tracking problems in which: (i) the tracker is static or does not <b>actuate</b> <b>on</b> the tracked object and (ii) the tracker <b>actuates</b> <b>on</b> the object. This thesis focuses on the latter problem. Tracking is performed by a robot executing specific tasks acting over the object being tracked, such as a Segway RMP soccer robot grabbing and kicking a ball. Object tracking efficiency completely depends on {{the accuracy of the}} motion model and of the sensory information. The motion model of the target becomes particulary complex in our case and highly dependent on the robot’s actions. In addition, this thesis also considers the challenging environment of multiple team members actuating the object being tracked. In this case, the motion can become highly discontinuous and nonlinear. We assume that robots know their own actions, and robots in a team are collaborating according to the coordination plans. We claim that the knowledge in terms of the single robot control strategy and the multi-robot coordination plan can be a valuable source of information for tracking. Communication between robots is another interesting information source. This thesis contributes an approach to incorporate prior an...|$|R

We aimed to evaluate a prototype portable calf active compression brace (ACB) designed to improve orthostatic haemodynamic control. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over, double-blind study. Testing consisted of head-upright tilting and walking on a treadmill conducted on two consecutive days {{with a pair of}} ACBs wrapped around both calves. The ACB was <b>actuated</b> <b>on</b> one test day, but not on the other (placebo). Wearability, comfort, and ambulatory use of the ACB were assessed using questionnaires. The average calf pressure exerted by the ACB was 46. 3 ± 2. 2 mmHg and the actuation pressure was 20. 7 ± 1. 7 mmHg. When considering the differences between ACB actuation and placebo during tilt after supine rest there were trends for a larger stroke volume (+ 5. 20 ± 2. 34 %, p = 0. 05) and lower heart rate (- 5. 12 ± 2. 41 %, p = 0. 06) with ACB actuation, with no effect on systolic arterial pressure (+ 4. 86 ± 3. 41 %, p = 0. 18). The decrease in stroke volume after ten minutes of tilting was positively correlated with the height:calf circumference (r = 0. 464; p = 0. 029; n = 22; both conditions combined). The increase in heart rate after ten minutes of tilting was negatively correlated with the height:calf circumference (r = - 0. 485; p = 0. 022; n = 22; both conditions combined) and was positively correlated with the average calf circumference (r = 0. 539; p = 0. 009; n = 22; both conditions combined). Participants reported good ACB wearability and comfort during ambulatory use. These data verify that the ACB increased stroke volume during tilting in healthy controls.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted into developing a portable Braille device {{which would allow}} visually impaired individuals to read electronic documents by actuating Braille text on a finger. Braille books tend to be bulky in size due to the minimum size requirements for each Braille cell. E-books can be read in Braille using refreshable Braille displays connected to a computer. However, the refreshable Braille displays are expensive, bulky and are not portable. These factors restrict {{blind and visually impaired}} individuals from accessing much of the literature which isn’t available in Braille. The proposed device overcomes the problem of carrying bulky Braille books by allowing multiple e-books to be saved in a portable memory device. By convert text from Latin characters into Braille patterns, it will give the blind access to books which were never published in Braille. The single Braille cell design reduces the bulk of the device allowing it to be portable and reducing the cost. An additional benefit of the device is that it can be integrated into a glove and worn thus giving the user freedom to carry on with other tasks while reading.

40|$|Self-assembly is {{the process}} of {{spontaneous}} organization of a set of interacting components. We examine how particle shape drives the self-assembly of colloids in three different systems. When particles interact only via their shape, entropic crystallization can occur; we discuss a design strategy using the Voronoi tesslelation to create “Voronoi particles,” (VP) which are hard particles in the shape of Voronoi cells of their target structure. Although VP stabilize their target structure in the limit of infinite pressure, the self-assembly of the same structure at moderate pressure is not guaranteed. We find that more symmetric crystals are often preferred due to entropic contributions of several kBT from configurational degeneracies. We characterize the assembly of VP in terms of their symmetries and the complexities of the target structure and demonstrate how controlling the degeneracies through modifying shape and field-directed assembly can improve the assembly propensity. With the addition of non-adsorbing, polymers, hard colloids experience an attraction dependent on polymer concentration, the form of which is dictated by the colloid shape; we study a system of oblate, spheroidal colloids that self-assemble thread-like clusters. In both simulation and experiment the colloids condense into disordered droplets at low polymer concentrations; at higher concentrations we observe kinetic arrest into primarily linear clusters of aligned colloids. We show that the mechanical stabilty of these low-valence structures results from the anisotropic particle shape. Particle surfaces can be patterned with metal coatings, introducing enthalpic attraction between particles; we study a system of prolate spheroidal colloids, half-coated in gold. We show with experiments and computer simulations that Janus ellipsoids can self-assemble into self-limiting one-dimensional fibers with shape-memory properties, and that the fibrillar assemblies can be <b>actuated</b> <b>on</b> application of an external alternating-current electric field. Actuation of the fibers occurs through a sliding mechanism (allowed by the curved ellipsoidal surface) that permits the reversible elongation of the Janus-ellipsoid chains by ~ 36 %. In each case, we find shape plays a critical role. By understanding and isolating its impact, we enhance shape's utility as a parameter for the design of self-assembling colloids...|$|E
40|$|Most valves {{available}} in the fluid power industry today are capable of achieving either a large flow rate or a quick response time; however, often {{they are unable to}} deliver both simultaneously. Commercially available valves that can produce {{both at the same time}} require complex geometries with multiple actuation stages and piloting pressures, making them expensive components. To establish their active usage in applications across the fluid power industry, a reduction in price for these components is paramount. The Energy Coupling Actuated Valve (ECAV) is capable of solving the large flow rates with fast actuation speeds trade-off by utilizing a new, high performance actuation system. The Energy Coupling Actuator (ECA) is an innovative actuation system that separates the kinetic energy source mass from the actuation mass. Intermittently coupling the actuator to a constantly rotating disk creates an energy transfer from the rotating disk’s kinetic energy to the normally stationary actuator. This intermittent coupling process is controlled by changing the magnetic field inside the actuator’s two coils. Magnetorheological (MR) fluid resides in a 0. 5 mm fluid gap between the spinning disk and the actuator, and when the magnetic flux builds across this gap, it causes the actuator to move rapidly in a translational movement. The MR fluid changes to a solid between the gap and frictionally binds the actuator to the disk, causing the actuator to move up or down, depending on which coil is <b>actuated</b> <b>on</b> the spinning disk. The liquid-solid conversion from the MR fluid occurs in less than one millisecond and is completely reversible. The shear strength of the fluid is proportional to the magnetic field strength inside the system. The actuator is connected to either a poppet or spool assembly for valve actuation, and the position is controlled through intermittently binding the actuator to the disk. ^ Two valve prototypes, one poppet and one spool type, were machined, and concept validation has been done in both simulation and experimentally. Experimental results show that the poppet reaches a 4 mm displacement in 19. 8 ms opening and 17 ms in closing under 33 L/min flow. The spool valve experimentally transitioned in 4. 8 ms at the same flow rate. ...|$|E

The phenomena of increasing land prices, stricter national environmental protection regulations and landowners that are unwillingly to live next to a dump are forcing costs through the roof, in turn, this is draining municipal budgets which are not prepared for the changing solid waste industry. These fiscal drains and stiffening regulation are forcing local legislators to modify {{the way in which they}} treat solid waste disposal. Cities and towns are setting up systems that treat waste as a utility that is paid for incrementally and based on usage. This report provides a broad overview of the solid waste disposal in the United States including a brief history, and a synopsis of solid waste disposal policies at the national and state level. Long-term solid waste management concerns and a discussion of current programmatic trends (including Enterprise Funds, Pay As You Throw (PAYT) systems) and complementary services (such as recycling and green waste pickup) are discussed in detail. The City of Tucson’s solid waste policies are used as a framework for the possible restructuring of the smaller municipality, the City of South Tucson’s Sanitation Services. Current sanitation practice in the City of South Tucson and preliminary findings for the FY 2002 - 03 Sanitation Services cost benefit analysis demonstrate the need for in-depth documentation of all revenues and expenditures. Programmatic and fiscal recommendations for the City of South Tucson include the tracking of all Sanitation Services revenues and expenditures (Base Study), the formation of a self-standing Sanitation Services enterprise fund, the implementation of once a week trash pick up with the integration of complementary services (recycling and green waste), and the eventual implementation of a Pay-As-You-Throw fiscal program.
