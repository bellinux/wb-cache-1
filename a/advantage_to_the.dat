5|$|As {{a result}} of its thick frontal armour, {{flanking}} manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tiger II in most engagements. Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, {{which ended}} {{the war on}} the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany, {{the main focus of}} the Ottoman Army turned to the Anatolian provinces and territories lost in 1877–1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. The Ottoman Army {{embarked}} on a series of territorial conquests in the Caucasus beginning in northern Persia. Erzerum which had been captured by the Russians in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. Reoccupation of these former possessions brought little strategic <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire, compared with the potential benefits of military success in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Plasmid {{stabilising}} toxin-antitoxin {{systems have}} been used as examples of selfish DNA as part of the gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} host organism. Other theories propose the systems have evolved to increase the fitness of plasmids in competition with other plasmids. Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy.

No breakaway had won La Flèche Wallonne since 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposition}} {{adopted in}} the battle was one which recurs in many sea-fights of the Middle Ages where a fleet had to fight on the defensive. Olaf lashed his ships side to side, with his own, the Long Serpent, {{in the middle of}} the line, where her bows projected beyond the others. The advantages of this arrangement were that it left all hands free to fight, that a barrier could be formed with the oars and yards, and that it limited the enemy's ability to make its superior numbers count. The Long Serpent was the longest ship and so also the tallest—another <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defenders, who could rain down arrows, javelins and other missiles while the enemy would have to shoot upwards. Olaf, in effect, turned his eleven ships into a floating fort.|$|E

The match against Hartlepool Clubs, one of the strongest teams in northern England, was won 63–0 by the All Blacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} in 1411 with the Peace of Thorn, in which neither Poland nor Lithuania drove home their {{negotiating}} <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full, {{much to the}} discontent of the Polish nobles. Poland regained Dobrzyń Land, Lithuania regained Samogitia, and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the Wkra river. Most of the Teutonic Order's territory, however, including towns that had surrendered, remained intact. Władysław then proceeded to release many high-ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms. The cumulative expense of the ransoms, however, proved a drain on the Order's resources. This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles' satisfaction provoked growing opposition to Władysław's regime after 1411, further fuelled by the granting of Podolia, disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Vytautas, and by the king's two-year absence in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the Greeks, with over 300,000 soldiers, were the single largest {{component}} of the Allied army on the Macedonian front. The Greek army gave the much needed <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies that altered the balance {{between the two sides}} on the Macedonian front. On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army. After the first serious battle (see battle of Skra) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command. The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south. The participation of the Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war, earning Greece a seat at the Paris Peace Conference under Venizelos.|$|E

5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E
5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|If the bid was rejected, the NPB team {{retained}} {{rights to}} the player.

If the player and the MLB team agreed on contract terms before the 30-day period expired, the NPB team received the bid amount as a transfer fee within five business days. The player was then free to play for his new MLB team in the coming season. The transfer fee was not included when calculating an MLB team's total payroll, which is subject to a luxury tax when it exceeds $155million. If the MLB team could not come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee was paid and the {{rights to the}} player reverted to his NPB team. A player could request to be posted again in subsequent years, and the process would be repeated with no <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club that had won the bidding the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Texas {{separated}} from Mexico in 1836; Tyler, {{a firm believer}} in manifest destiny, saw its annexation as providing an economic <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, and worked diligently to make it happen. He initially sought election to a full term as president, but after failing to gain the support of either Whigs or Democrats, he withdrew in support of Democrat James K. Polk, who favored annexation. Polk won the election, and Tyler signed a bill to annex Texas three days before leaving office. Under Polk, the process was completed. After the American Civil War began in 1861, Tyler won election to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death. Although some have praised Tyler's political resolve, his presidency is generally held in low regard by historians. He is considered an obscure president, with little presence in American cultural memory.|$|E
5|$|The area {{south of}} Lake Ladoga is a heavily forested area with many {{wetlands}} (especially peat deposits) {{closer to the}} lake. In addition the forest shielded both sides from visual observation. Both of these factors greatly hindered the mobility of artillery and vehicles in the area, providing a considerable <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defending forces. One of the key locations were the Sinyavino heights which were some 150 metres higher than the surrounding flat terrain, which {{were some of the}} few dry and clear areas, and in addition provided good observation. Since the front line had changed very little since the blockade was established, the German forces had built a dense defensive network of strong points, interconnected by trenches and protected by extensive obstacles and interlocking artillery and mortar fire. The Neva River and marshes were partially frozen in winter which allowed infantry to cross it, but not heavy vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attacks on}} the final climb came from Barguil and Van Avermaet, {{followed}} by Yates, while Rodríguez and Valverde waited in the main group. Yates passed Barguil and was chasing Van Avermaet, {{who was in the}} lead of the race. Towards the top of the climb, however, Van Avermaet was hit from behind by one of the motorbikes providing television coverage of the race. He was knocked to the ground and the frame of the bike was broken; Van Avermaet was unable to finish the race. Yates therefore led the race alone {{at the top of the}} final climb as the race descended into San Sebastián. Unlike in the 2014 race, when he had crashed out of the lead group on the final descent, Yates extended his lead to 15 seconds as the road flattened out and was able to keep this <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the race. As he crossed the finish line, Yates was unaware that he had won the race, as he believed that the initial breakaway had not been caught. It took some time for the message to come through from his team that he had won. In the group behind, Gilbert sprinted to second place ahead of Valverde.|$|E
5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue <b>advantage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E
