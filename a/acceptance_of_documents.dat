40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse the {{technical}} development performed in SCIENTIA, digital repository of the Ministry of Health. SCIENTIA project arises from {{the will of the}} Ministry of Health to provide open, free and permanent access to scientific knowledge generated by the different entities of the Catalan Public Health Administration, with the aim of increasing the visibility, impact and recognition of the research that is being conducted. Material and methods The operating characteristics of SCIENTIA have been defined: a) Context: community and audience, content typology, general conditions for the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and intellectual property; b) User policy: roles and access levels; c) Flows and processes: documental channel and preservation policies; d) Software technical characteristics and requirements, functionalities of content and collection management system, technical administration and services for users. To make the repository interoperable and to exchange data with other data collection and exploitation system of scientific output, metadata schemes based on the reference Open Archival Information System (OAIS), Dublin Core’s metadata standards, DRIVER guidelines, Creative Common licenses and a permanent URL were applied. Results With {{the development and implementation of}} SCIENTIA, we have obtained a tool that allows: to create and share knowledge, collect and preserve scientific output, increase the public value of participating institutions, and to maximize the visibility and the impact of scientific output. Conclusions The digital revolution has changed the way of disseminating scientific information. Access to scientific output is basic for research, innovation and scientific heritage preservation. To have a tool that promotes an open, free and permanent access and enables scientific knowledge to be disseminated, shared and preserved over time is basic. ...|$|E

However, software-based protection can allow for more flexible security models, with potentially significant performance improvements over traditional hardware-based solutions.

Implementations exist for all three strategies: several vendors have adapted capabilities to Java, Netscape Communicator extended Java's stack introspection, and we built a typehiding system as an add-on to Microsoft Internet Explorer. 1 Introduction The growth of the World Wide Web has enabled the Internet to reach new levels of popularity and ease of use.

5000|$|The United Nations Earth Summit Conference on Environment and Development catalysed the {{formation}} of EU environmental policy into a policy that was centred on the environmental consequences of integration. The conference organized by the United Nations saw the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> various <b>documents</b> and charters governing the natural environment and sustainable development. In its inception phase, EU environmental policy was a reaction to normalise competition with the markets. Having a common policy would ensure that member states were bound to directives that would regulate their production methods thus affect production output and competitive advantage. Focus was directed on air pollution from industries, {{and other forms of}} tangible, measurable, and traceable pollution that could be isolated to an event or a process, such as acidification Swedish lakes in the 1970s and 1980s caused by high sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants. Such forms of pollution were often governed with bans, quotas and economic instruments such as taxes and fines. [...] With improvements in technology, access and delivery of information and changes in global conceptualisation of the environment, EU environmental policy has evolved to become more responsive and bespoke, and has also increased its scope to various sources and sinks of pollution.|$|R

40|$|Aims—(1) To {{establish}} whether gastroenterologists wish {{to train}} in abdominal ultrasound {{according to the}} Royal College <b>of</b> Radiologists' <b>document,</b> Guidance for the training in ultrasound of medical non-radiologists. (2) To determine whether the ultrasound workload generated by gastroenterologists differs from that by other clinicians.  Methods—A postal questionnaire was sent to all 278 gastroenterology trainees. The indications and findings of 100 consecutive gastroenterologist requested scans were compared with 100 scans requested sequentially by other clinicians through a teaching hospital radiology department.  Results— 82 % of the survey forms were returned. 77 % of trainees wished to train in abdominal ultrasound and 68 % were prepared to train in the manner outlined in the guideline document. However, 86 % felt that they would ideally prefer not to assess renal or pelvic pathology, restricting to hepatobiliary diagnosis only. 73 % of trainees did not anticipate that a further scan by a radiologist would be required. Comparison of gastroenterology scans with those requested by other clinicians revealed a relative excess of hepatobiliary indications and findings, and a notable paucity of renal and pelvic pathology in gastroenterology practice.  Conclusions—There is general interest in abdominal ultrasound training among gastroenterology trainees and broad <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the guideline <b>document.</b> However, most trainees perceive a focus of training restricted to hepatobiliary disease to be most appropriate. The case mix study provides support for this viewpoint. It is suggested that a more focused ultrasound training for gastroenterologists be considered. ...|$|R
