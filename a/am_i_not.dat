25|$|Sweet Honey in the Rock {{recorded}} Truth's song in 1993 {{on their}} 20th anniversary album, Still on the Journey. Bernice Johnson Reagon, Sweet Honey's founder, renamed the song “Sojourner's Battle Hymn.” Truth's biographers Erlene Stetson and Linda David describe the song as “rousing, brashly defiant, irreverent and joyous,” and characterized Sweet Honey's version as “stirringly performed.” In 2006 the Sojourner Truth Institute and Heritage Battle Creek produced a CD, <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> a Man and a Brother? Songs of Freedom North and South, with talented local singers and musicians from Battle Creek, Michigan, including a rendition of “The Valiant Soldiers” by Carolyn Ballard.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked {{where he was going}} (fourth apparition); Juan Diego {{explained}} what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (<b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's tilma, or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumárraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
500|$|After Harriet Adams died in 1982, her protégé, Nancy Axelrad, oversaw {{production}} of the Nancy Drew books briefly before the Stratemeyer Syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers. The books and Nancy's character began to change as a result, although there is disagreement {{on the nature of}} this change. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes [...] "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [...] since 1956." [...] Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and [...] " [...] of pre-feminist [...]" [...] For example, volume 78 in the series Update on Crime (1992) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, [...] "Am I or <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> in love with Ned Nickerson?" [...] Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: [...] "'I saw ... You don't have to apologize to me if some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni doesn't turn me on!... Won't you please let me explain.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, the raven was {{the first}} animal to be {{released}} from Noah's Ark. [...] "So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded {{from the face of the}} ground." [...] The raven is mentioned a dozen times in the Bible. In the New Testament Jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (...) [...] The raven is also mentioned in Quran at the story of Cain and Abel. Adam's firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel but he doesn't know what to do with the corpse: [...] "Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> able to be as this raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse? And he became repentant." ...|$|E
500|$|Marti Webb {{covered the}} song on her album Won't Change Places (1981) and also {{included}} it in 1995 on the album, Music and Songs from Evita. AllMusic's Joe Francis complimented the recording. Singer Sinéad O'Connor recorded [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] on her album <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Your Girl (1992). Her version received mixed response, with Joy Press from Spin who described the rendition as [...] "a melodramatic, sweeping 'Je ne regrette rien'—style apologia. O’Connor had a calling. Obsessed with purity and truth, she pitched herself somewhere between Christ and the Virgin Mary, as an asexual visionary whose suffering was Inextricably Intertwined {{with the pain}} of Ireland and of the world." [...] Released as a CD maxi single, the song reached number 31 in Belgium Flanders and number 44 in Netherlands. A punk rock version was recorded by alternative band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes in 1999 for their second studio album, Are a Drag. Angus Cargill, author of Hang the DJ: An alternative book of music lists {{was shocked by the}} complete revamp of the song as punk rock, saying that [...] "there's a dark appeal in here, like the thought of taking a cattle prod to your grandma's".|$|E
500|$|A fourth 1928 novel, Ladies Almanack by the American writer Djuna Barnes, {{not only}} {{contains}} a character based on Radclyffe Hall but includes passages {{that may be}} a response to The Well. Ladies Almanack is a roman à clef of a lesbian literary and artistic circle in Paris, written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style and starring Natalie Barney as Dame Evangeline Musset. Much as Sir Phillip paces his study worrying about Stephen, Dame Musset's father [...] "pac his library in the most normal of Night-Shirts". When, unlike Sir Phillip, he confronts his daughter, she replies confidently: [...] "Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing... <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> doing after your very Desire, and is it not the more commendable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?" [...] Ladies Almanack is far more overtly sexual than The Well; its cryptic style, full of in-jokes and ornate language, may have been intended to disguise its content from censors. It could not in any case be prosecuted by the Home Office, since it was published only in France, in a small, privately printed edition. It did not become widely available until 1972.|$|E

Peninnah, at every chance, teases and criticises Hannah about her barrenness {{to the point of}} Hannah's deep despair.

2500|$|The [...] "Tiger and Leopard Cavalry" [...] (虎豹騎) {{unit that}} Cao Chun led was an elite mounted unit in Cao Cao's forces.

Even Cao Cao himself {{found it difficult to}} lead such a unit, which was why he chose Cao Chun, who was able to gain the trust and respect of those elite soldiers.

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all {{editions of the}} 'Principia', that Hooke (but not {{exclusively}} Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. [...] Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1. Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, {{but that did not}} mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: [...] "yet <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things & for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{background}} {{described above}} shows there was basis for Newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from Hooke.

Obeying her, Juan Diego found an abundance of flowers unseasonably in bloom on the rocky outcrop where only cactus and scrub normally grew. Using his open mantle as a sack (with the ends still tied around his neck) he returned to the Virgin; she re-arranged the flowers and told him to take them to the bishop. On gaining admission to the bishop in Mexico City later that day, Juan Diego opened his mantle, the flowers poured to the floor, and the bishop saw they had left on the mantle an imprint of the Virgin's image which he immediately venerated.|$|E
