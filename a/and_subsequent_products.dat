50|$|Stem cell {{genomics}} {{analyzes the}} genomes of stem cells. Currently, this field is rapidly expanding {{due to the}} dramatic decrease {{in the cost of}} sequencing genomes. The study of stem cell genomics has wide reaching implications in the study of stem cell biology and possible therapeutic usages of stem cells. Application of research in this field could lead to drug discovery and information on diseases by the molecular characterization of the pluripotent stem cell through DNA and transcriptome sequencing and looking at the epigenetic changes of stem cells <b>and</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>products.</b> One step in that process is single cell phenotypic analysis, and the connection between the phenotype and genotype of specific stem cells. While current genomic screens are done with entire populations of cells, focusing in on a single stem cell will help determine specific signaling activity associated with varying degrees of stem cell differentiation and limit background due to heterogeneous populations. Single cell analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), or stem cells able to differentiate into many different cell types, is a suggested method for treating such diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This includes for understanding the differences between sporadic AD and familial AD. By first taking a skin sample from the patient and are transformed by transducing cells using retroviruses to encode such stem cell genes as Oct4, Sox2, KLF4 and cMYC. This allows for skin cells to be reprogrammed into patient-specific stem cell lines. Taking genomic sequences of these individual cells would allow for patient-specific treatments and furthering understanding of AD disease models. This technique would be used for similar diseases, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). These stem cells developed from a singular patient would also be able to be used to produce cells affected in the above mentioned diseases. As mentioned, it will also lead to patient specific phenotypes of each disease. Further chemical analyses to develop safer drugs can be done through sequence information and cell-culture tests on iPSCs. After development on a specific drug, it can be transferred to other patient diseased cells while also being safety tested.|$|E

40|$|The {{commercial}} opportunities for sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria L.

This article discusses recent analysis of the value chain of sengon in Indonesia to determine (i) who the stakeholders were and how each added value, and (ii) how the benefits were distributed among stakeholders. Information was collected from a mix of farmers (as tree growers) and other actors involved in the value chain. The research revealed two broad types of value chains for sengon–‘direct’ and ‘traditional’, with the potential increased income for farmers being as high as 35 % when they use the direct approach, compared to the traditional approach. As expected, the further ‘downstream’ {{the position of the}} stakeholder in the value chain, the greater the monetary value added to the sengon timber <b>and</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>products.</b> If farmers were to acquire a greater understanding of the market dynamics for sengon, they could better target the sale of their forest products to specific market segments and make forestry a more profitable enterprise.

40|$|Hypertension is {{a chronic}} illness {{that is often}} undiagnosed and {{untreated}} leading to high mortality rates in South Africa. The use of diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and beta blockers such as propranolol has been advocated as first line therapy {{for the treatment of}} hypertension. The study and use of controlled release dosage forms for the treatment of various disease states has gained wide interest over the past two decades. The use of controlled release systems offers improved therapeutic efficiency over conventional immediate release dosage forms, the use of which at times have often led to poor patient adherence and decreased therapeutic efficiencies. The current research objective was to develop a sustained release multi-source product for propranolol such that once daily dosing would be achieved. In addition, the sustained release product was developed using Inderal® LA 80 mg capsules as a reference product. In addition the development of a suitable immediate release hydrochlorothiazide tablet was undertaken to produce a combination dosage form. The use of two different technologies, namely direct compression and wet granulation were employed to develop the sustained release dosage form. The release of propranolol from these dosage forms was assessed using USP apparatus 1 with quantitation of the relevant dissolution samples using a validated high performance liquid chromatographic method. The release profiles from the prototype <b>and</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>products</b> were subjected to model independent and model dependent analyses in order to compare them to the innovator product and to elucidate the mechanisms of drug release respectively. Dissolution test results reveal that dosage forms prepared from wet granulation showed better rate retardation and more appropriate release profiles than those prepared by direct compression techniques.

Over recent years, the bio-geochemical and bio-optical community has begun {{to benefit from the}} increase in observational capacities by developing profiling floats that allow the measurement of key biooptical variables <b>and</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>products</b> of biogeochemical and ecosystem relevance like Chlorophyll a (Chla), optical backscattering or attenuation coefficients which are proxies of Particulate Organic Carbon (POC), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM). Thanks to recent algorithmic improvements, new bio-optical variables such as backscattering coefficient or absorption by CDOM, at present can also be extracted from space observations of ocean color. In the future, an intensification of in situ measurements by bio-optical profiling floats would permit the elaboration of unique 3 D / 4 D bio-optical climatologies, linking surface (remotely detected) properties to their vertical distribution (measured by autonomous platforms), with which key questions {{in the role of the}} ocean in climate could be addressed. In this context, the objective of the IOCCG (International Ocean Color Coordinating Group) BIO-Argo working group is to elaborate recommendations in view of a future use of bio-optical profiling floats as part of a network that would include a global array that could be ¿Argo-relevant¿, and specific arrays that would have more focused objectives or regional targets. The overall network, realizing true multi-scale sustained observations of global marine biogeochemistry and biooptics, should satisfy the requirements for validation of ocean color remote sensing as well as the needs of a wider community investigating the impact of global change on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems. Regarding the global profiling float array, the recommendation is that Chla as well as POC should be the key variables to be systematically measured. A first target would be to implement 20 % of the Argo floats with these measurements within a five-year term.

One of the problems encountered in estimating development and design cost {{is the lack of}} availability of hard information during the initial design phases.

Methods: An in-tube methylation assay is described that integrates amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA and melting analysis by using a thermal cycler coupled to a fluorometer (LightCycler). DNA melting curves were acquired by measuring the fluorescence of a double-stranded DNA-binding dye (SYBR Green I) during a linear temperature transition. Results: Analysis of a region comprising 11 CpG sites at the SNRPN promoter CpG island showed that the melting temperature (T m) differed by � 3 °C between unmethylated and fully methylated alleles.

Melting curve analysis also allowed resolution of methylation “mosaicism ” at the p 15 Ink 4 b promoter in bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
