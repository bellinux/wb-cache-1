25|$|In less {{developed}} countries, some traditional fishing villages persist {{in ways that}} have changed little from earlier times. In more developed countries, traditional fishing villages are changing due to socioeconomic factors like industrial fishing and urbanization. Over time, some fishing villages outgrow their original function as <b>artisanal</b> <b>fishing</b> villages. Seven hundred years ago, Shanghai, beside the Yangtze River delta, was a small fishing village. In recent times, fishing villages have been increasingly targeted for tourist and leisure enterprises. Recreational fishing and leisure boat pursuits can be big business these days, and traditional fishing villages are often well positioned {{to take advantage of}} this. For example, Destin on the coast of Florida, has evolved from an <b>artisanal</b> <b>fishing</b> village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats. The tourist appeal of fishing villages has become so big that the Korean government is purpose-building 48 fishing villages for their tourist drawing power.

40|$|Fish is an {{important}} source of protein which is highly needed for human beings to experience necessary growth and development. This is the reason for the phenomenal rise in the consumption of fish in order to meet up with the body nutritional requirements. Therefore, marketing of this source of protein is inevitable as its distribution depends largely on the structure of the marketing system. This study examined the structural performance of <b>artisanal</b> <b>fish</b> marketing in Ondo State, Nigeria. Data collected from 250 <b>artisanal</b> <b>fish</b> sellers selected using multistage sampling technique were analysed using descriptive statistics, marketing and gross margin, Gini coefficient and Lorenze curve analyses. The results showed that <b>artisanal</b> <b>fish</b> marketing was profitable with a mean net return of N 137. 10 /kg (0. 85 /kg).

It was realized that all the respondents in the study area, mentioned poor transport network, high transport cost, inadequate fund and inadequate storage facilities as major problems confronting <b>artisanal</b> <b>fish</b> market in the study area. Therefore, programmes that will improve fish marketing should be organized for fish marketers by the relevant government parastatals, extension workers, Non Governmental Organizations and the <b>artisanal</b> <b>fish</b> marketers should be sensitized on the formation of better organized fish marketing cooperative societies where they can solve some of their problems themselves...|$|R

The trade is essentially informal in nature. The communication pattern in this occupation is quite unique. Various modes and symbols, both tangible and intangible, serve as communication sources and media of information {{in the conduct of}} daily business. This study describes and records the nonverbal modes and symbols of communication in <b>artisanal</b> marine <b>fishing</b> in Ghana. It examines whether there are differences in the observed nonverbal communicative patterns among the sampled communities, and also assesses how time and modernity have affected the kind of communication pattern employed. It is qualitative, and employs a multiple case design that purposively samples three communities in the Central Region of Ghana. It is grounded on Morris’s semiotics on signs, behaviour and interaction, and Wilson’s taxonomy of non-verbal perspective of indigenous communication. Findings show that the stars, winds, waves, cultural events, among others communicate relevant messages to the fisherman. Differences in the nonverbal communicative pattern among the sampled communities are rather minimal, and attributed to variations in local culture.

Consequently, vital nutritional components diminish in value and quantity which renders fish consumer nutritionally insecure.

For each preservation method a portion was processed into respective products at Food Bioscience and Agri-Business Laboratories aside from the control (fresh) sample. Both preserved and control samples were analysed for nutrient loss at Department of Chemistry, Makerere University using AOAC methods. The composition of fatty acids was determined by methanolysis gas chromatography and Mass spectrophotometry of the resultant methyl esters.

40|$|AbstractFish are a {{significant}} food source for Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), but current projections indicate future supply shortfalls and distribution gaps in some PICTs. Regional and national food security strategies are accordingly seeking practical activities to improve food security benefits from fisheries. Expanding the use of <b>artisanal</b> <b>Fish</b> Aggregating Devices (FADs) is a popular method of meeting these objectives. However, FAD-associated food security benefits are not being fully realized in some PICTs because of key policy and management barriers. We identify and then discuss some of these barriers {{in the context of}} Kiribati, a small island developing State in the Pacific that is heavily dependent on fish for food and livelihood benefits. We find that in the rush to deliver visible short-term results, project resources are often unevenly allocated to deployment activities rather than across the breadth of policy and management activities required to realistically achieve food security objectives. We propose that more precautionary, cooperative, context-specific, and integrated regional and domestic policy responses to artisanal FAD use are needed if Kiribati’s food fish security goals are to be better realized in practice...|$|R

This study aims at {{identifying}} {{the current state}} of fish farming in the area of Gontougo. It was carried out from May to September 2013 using a questionnaire and individual interview with fish farmers. The results showed that all producers practiced <b>artisanal</b> <b>fish</b> farming and this activity played an important socio-economic role. Fish farming is exclusively carried out by local people belonging mainly to the Abron ethnic group (77. 8 %). This activity is mainly practiced by people aged 45 years and over (77. 8 %). It was observed that 41. 7 % of the ponds are in derivation while 58. 3 % are barrage ponds. Oreochromis niloticus Linné, 1758 and Heterobranchus longifilis Valenciennes, 1840 are the most reared fish species. The total fish production in 2012 was estimated to 3, 552. 5 kg in 68 ponds. The produced quantities vary from a fish farmer to another, with an average production of 592. 1 ± 635. 9 kg/fish farmer/year. All fish farmers (100 %) feed the fish with agricultural by-products.
