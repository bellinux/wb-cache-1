25|$|Chemists {{frequently}} {{refer to}} chemical compounds using chemical formulae or molecular {{structure of the}} compound. There has been a phenomenal {{growth in the number}} of chemical compounds being synthesized (or isolated), and then reported in the scientific literature by professional chemists around the world. An enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination of the known chemical elements. As of May 2011, about sixty million chemical compounds are known. The names of many of these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately. Also it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature. Several international organizations like IUPAC and CAS have initiated steps to make such tasks easier. CAS provides the abstracting services of the chemical literature, and provides <b>a</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier,</b> known as CAS registry number to each chemical substance that has been reported in the chemical literature (such as chemistry journals and patents). This information is compiled as a database and is popularly known as the Chemical substances index. Other computer-friendly systems that have been developed for substance information, are: SMILES and the International Chemical Identifier or InChI.|$|E
50|$|Stellar {{associations}} {{were first}} {{discovered by the}} Armenian astronomer Viktor Ambartsumian in 1947. The conventional name for an association uses the names or abbreviations of the constellation (or constellations) {{in which they are}} located; the association type, and, sometimes, <b>a</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier.</b>|$|E
50|$|These six {{mechanisms}} for representing colors with pixelvalues all require some additional parameters to work. These parameters are collected into a visual type, which contains a visual class and other {{parameters of the}} representation of colors.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, ECMA has {{published}} numerous ECMA Standards for magnetic tapes, magnetic tape cassettes and cartridges, {{as well as}} for optical disk cartridges. Those media developed recently have a very high physical recording density. In order to make optimal use of the resulting data capacity, lossless compression algorithms have been designed that allow a reduction of the number of bits required for the representation of user data. These compression algorithms are registered by ECMA, the International Registration Authority established by ISO/IEC. The registration consists in allocating to each registered algorithm <b>a</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier</b> that will be recorded on the medium and, thus, indicate which compression algorithm(s) has been used. This ECMA Standard is the fourth ECMA Standard for compression algorithms. The three previous standards are: ECMA- 15...|$|E
50|$|A CAS Registry Number, also {{referred}} to as CASRN or CAS Number, is <b>a</b> unique <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier</b> assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature (currently including those described from at least 1957 through the present), including organic and inorganic compounds, minerals, isotopes, alloys and nonstructurable materials (UVCBs, of unknown, variable composition, or biological origin).|$|R

Each academic institution that was sent a survey was provided with <b>a</b> unique <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier</b> after responses were obtained. All answers to the survey were de-identified and confidential prior to statistical analysis. This survey study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and was granted a waiver of signed consent at the authors’ home institution.|$|R
30|$|The {{key part}} of the system is the {{function}} Prove 1 and the procedure Prove 2, which are defined below. They are a straightforward realization of the reasoning method described in Sect.  3. A crucial element of this realization is the selection mechanism, which corresponds to the statement selectElemfromSet. It is used for choosing both a column from the matrix and a literal from the column. The mechanism has a form of the statement SelectNth Lst Space.choose Length Lst Elem Lst 1. The procedure SelectNth selects the n-th element Elem from the list Lst, where n is a number specified by the second argument. The argument Lst 1 is a list obtained by removing the element Elem from Lst. The function call Length Lst returns a number of elements of the list Lst. The statement Space.choose N is executed in a computation space and it informs a search engine about a nondeterministic choice with N alternatives. The engine in the response clones the space N times and sends to each copy <b>a</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier</b> ranging from 1 to N. The identifier becomes a value of the expression Space.choose N. In consequence, each element of the list Lst is to be processed further in a separate space.|$|E
50|$|A {{chemical}} compound (or just compound if {{used in the}} context of chemistry) is an entity consisting of two or more atoms, commonly two from different chemical elements, which associate via chemical bonds. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: molecules held together by covalent bonds, ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, and certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Many {{chemical compound}}s have <b>a</b> unique <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier</b> assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} 'outturn' of each cask {{is given}} <b>a</b> unique, two-part <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier,</b> representing first the originating distillery and second the individual cask {{from which the}} bottle was taken. For example, 2.35 represents the 35th cask acquired from distillery number two. Society bottlings are always referred to using this numerical code, {{rather than by the}} distillery name, as individual casks are unique and, therefore, may not be representative of the whisky produced by that distillery for ordinary retail.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{conventional}} relational databases use [...] "row-oriented" [...] storage, {{meaning that}} all data {{associated with a}} given row is stored together. By contrast, column-oriented DBMS store all data from a given column together in order to more quickly serve data warehouse-style queries. Correlation databases are similar to row-based databases, but apply a layer of indirection to map multiple instances of the same value to the same <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier.</b>|$|R
50|$|The list can use numerical, alphabetic, or {{alpha-numeric}} identifiers. However, in many computerized environments {{like the}} SIE format, only <b>numerical</b> <b>identifiers</b> are allowed. The structure and headings of accounts should assist in consistent posting of transactions. Each nominal ledger account is unique, which allows its ledger to be located. The list is typically arranged {{in the order}} of the customary appearance of accounts in the financial statements: balance sheet accounts followed by profit and loss accounts.|$|R
50|$|The message {{sequence}} of command (or request) and its response {{is known as}} a transaction, which is identified by the <b>numerical</b> Transaction <b>Identifier</b> exchanged in each transaction. The protocol specification defines nine standard commands that are distinguished by a four-letter command verb: AUEP, AUCX, CRCX, DLCX, EPCF, MDCX, NTFY, RQNT, and RSIP.

In editions of Mycenaean texts, the signs whose values have not been confirmed by CIPEM are always transcribed as numbers preceded by an asterisk (e.g., *64). CIPEM also allocates the <b>numerical</b> <b>identifiers,</b> and until such allocation, new signs (or obscured or mutilated signs) are transcribed as a bullet-point enclosed in square brackets: [...]|$|R
50|$|For example, the Hebrew letter aleph ("א") {{is often}} used by mathematicians to denote certain kinds of infinity, {{but it is also}} used in {{ordinary}} Hebrew text. In Unicode, these two uses are considered different characters, and have two different Unicode <b>numerical</b> <b>identifiers</b> ("code points"), though they may be rendered identically. Conversely, the Chinese logogram for water ("水") may have a slightly different appearance in Japanese texts than it does in Chinese texts, and local typefaces may reflect this. But nonetheless in Unicode they are considered the same character, and share the same code point.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Numerical</b> <b>identifiers</b> {{that are}} nominal numbers {{narrowly}} defined, viz, convey no information other than identity, are quite rare. These must be defined either arbitrarily or randomly, and most commonly arise in computer applications, such as dynamic IP addresses assigned by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. A more everyday example are sports squad numbers, {{which do not}} in general have any public meaning beyond identity, {{though they may be}} allocated based on some internal club or organization policy. In some settings, these are based on position, but in others they are associated with an individual, being a proper nominal number. The naming function is demonstrated by [...] "retired numbers", where a club no longer issues a number that has become associated with a particularly famous player, but reallocate others to new players when they become available ...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{phenomena}} of the globalization of commerce has been the internationalisation of goods and brands. A set of diverse practices and processes, including the transformation of transport infrastructure and logistics and the virtualisation of money, have enabled both producers (e. g., goods manufacturers) and sellers (e. g., wholesalers, supermarkets) to massively extend supply chains, to globally expand their markets, and to increase their turnover and profits. A key technology in improving the efficiency and productivity of logistical organisation and operation has been development of sophisticated identification systems that overcome the anonymity of manufactured products by assigning unique <b>numerical</b> <b>identifiers</b> – digital thumbprints - to material products. These identification systems allow products to be effectively and unambiguously processed, shipped and traced through complex logistical networks, to monitor sales, aid account management, refine supply chains and inform marketing strategies. Conceptually they have two distinct components, first an agreed allocation of unique id code numbers and, second, an agreed media to physical store the code. The most obvious manifestation of this technology for product identification and tracking are the parallel black and white printed stripes of barcodes...|$|R

30|$|The NCBI {{database}} ([URL] provides several {{resources for}} the ‘curated classification and nomenclature of all of organisms in the public sequence databases. This currently represents about 10  % of the described species {{of life on the}} planet.’ There were ~ 111  k transcripts. ~ 5  k did not align to the walnut genome, and were removed (Chakraborty et al. 2015). Of these, ~ 4  k transcripts had significant homology to E. coli genomes. The remaining ~ 1  k transcripts were the subject of analysis in the current manuscript, under the assumption that they were derived from extraneous organisms, pathogens or commensal, inhabiting the twenty different tissues. The species names were derived from the best BLAST match to the ‘nt’ database. A bitscore (BLASTSCORE) cutoff of 150 was used (~E-value =  1 E −  33). The <b>numerical</b> <b>identifier</b> was obtained from the species name using the site [URL] identifier.cgi. For example, Arthrobacter has the tax ID 1663. These numerical IDs were then used to obtain the complete lineage. The first classification of all organisms was into Eukaryota or Bacteria. We used the second classification field to cluster the organisms discussed here. The expression counts are not normalized since we do not make any inferences on the absolute or relative abundance of the transcripts.|$|R
40|$|The {{character}} of the sub-regional eco-climatic zones has possibly changed as suggested in the dwindling fortune of agricultural productivity, documented changes in vegetation and freshwater resources and rising poverty levels especially in the hitherto productive Northern Nigeria. To determine and map the changes, if any, in these eco-climatic characteristics is therefore important for general planning. This study is using rainfall and temperature data (1950 - 2006) to determine factors of rainfall effectiveness; onset dates, cessation dates, hydrologic growing season (HGS), monsoon quality index (MQI) and aridity index (AI); summarizing and ranking them using <b>numerical</b> <b>identifiers</b> for {{the interpretation of the}} various moisture situations, to assess the eco-climatic characteristics in the northern Nigeria. A multi-temporal database has been developed for the factors and classes have been defined using quantitative definitions for the time series. The point data have been transformed to spatial data and subjected to geospatial analysis. The results so far reveal variability in the effects of each factor on eco-climatic zonation and it is anticipated that integrating these derived climatic parameters and remotely sensed (vegetation dynamics) data using GIS techniques, is crucial for water management and attainment of food security. Key words: Eco-climatic, moisture effectiveness, surface, principal component analysis, environmental quality...|$|R
5000|$|Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) was {{the first}} {{publicly}} used version of the Internet Protocol. IPv4 was developed as a research project by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a United States Department of Defense agency, before becoming {{the foundation for the}} Internet and the World Wide Web. It is currently described by IETF publication [...] (September 1981), which replaced an earlier definition ( [...] , January 1980). IPv4 included an addressing system that used <b>numerical</b> <b>identifiers</b> consisting of 32 bits. These addresses are typically displayed in quad-dotted notation as decimal values of four octets, each in the range 0 to 255, or 8 bits per number. Thus, IPv4 provides an addressing capability of 232 or approximately 4.3 billion addresses. Address exhaustion was not initially a concern in IPv4 as this version was originally presumed to be a test of DARPA's networking concepts. During the first decade of operation of the Internet, it became apparent that methods had to be developed to conserve address space. In the early 1990s, even after the redesign of the addressing system using a classless network model, it became clear that this would not suffice to prevent IPv4 address exhaustion, and that further changes to the Internet infrastructure were needed.|$|R
