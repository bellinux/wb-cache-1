25|$|It {{was first}} {{released}} {{under the name}} Seagate Analysis as a free application written in Java released in 1999. After disappointing application performance, {{a decision was made}} to rewrite using ATL COM in C++. The initial rewrite only supported Microsoft <b>Analysis</b> <b>Services,</b> but support for other vendors soon followed, with Holos cubes in version 8.5, Essbase, IBM DB2 and SAP BW following in later releases. The web client was rewritten using an XSLT abstraction layer for the version 9.0 release, with better standards compliance to support Mozilla based browsers—this work also set the building blocks for support for Safari.|$|E
25|$|The {{main feature}} change was support for Microsoft's 64-bit {{operating}} system, however support for Banyan VINES was also dropped from {{this version of}} MDAC. There were several known issues: MDAC 2.7 continued causing connectivity problems on clustered servers running Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or SQL Server 7.0, with no workaround provided by Microsoft. When creating or configuring ODBC data source names (DSNs) using the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver the network library protocol might unexpectedly switch to TCP/IP, even if the DSN was configured to use named pipes. This issue was found by InfoWorld reporter Randall C. Kennedy, who identified that the change was actually made in MDAC 2.6 but was never documented. It was discovered when testing client/server database workloads on a Windows XP computer; InfoWorld claims that although overall server CPU utilization rose by only 8 percent using TCP/IP, context switches per second dropped by more than 150 percent (which is of course impossible because you would then have a negative context switch rate - the drop is either 33% or 60% depending on which planet the author was on {{at the time of}} writing) for a 10-user workload. They were unimpressed that a fundamental functional change to the default behaviour of Net-Lib occurred without more than a passing mention in an unrelated document. Windows XP users also sometimes experienced problems connecting to SQL Server because SQL Server attempts to use certificates it finds on the local computer, however if {{there is more than one}} certificate available it did not know which one to use. When attempting to use Microsoft <b>Analysis</b> <b>Services</b> 2000 RTM, an error would sometimes appear when trying to browse cubes. Microsoft also discovered a problem in Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me's setup program which prevented the MDAC installation program from rolling back when it encountered an installation error.|$|E

This study {{examines}} {{a method of}} generating comprehensive profiling information for a researcher <b>analysis</b> <b>service.</b> In addition to basic and performance-based information about researchers necessary to generate profiling information, we introduce researcher performance index models for researcher <b>analysis</b> <b>service.</b> The models can that measure qualitative and quantitative performance, researcher influence, and growth potential, which are necessary to analyze the skills of a researcher from multiple perspectives. We measure the qualitative performance index of researchers by using the citation index of the papers they have published. The quantitative performance index can be measured based on a researcher’s published papers. The Influence index measures the social influence of researchers according to their academic work. The growth potential index measures {{the speed at which}} a researcher improves research performance. We expect to develop a researcher <b>analysis</b> <b>service</b> that can evaluate a researcher’s performance and enhance his or her research abilities...|$|R
