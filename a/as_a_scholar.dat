5|$|Hugh was {{not well}} known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scholar.</b> He did, however, serve as a patron to Roger of Hoveden, the medieval chronicler who started writing about 1169.

5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scholar,</b> and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also {{makes it clear that}} the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated from the time of Aldfrith's death.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the early life of Plegmund except that he was of Mercian descent.

Some time before 887, Alfred summoned Plegmund to his court.

5|$|Two {{candidates}} {{stood with}} rather less support. William Ralls Morrison of Illinois {{had served in}} Congress since 1873 and was best known for advocating tariff reductions despite hailing from a protectionist district. He commanded little support outside his home state, and was seen as only a favorite son. Justice Stephen Johnson Field of the United States Supreme Court was better known, but still an unlikely victor. The only candidate from the Far West, Field was respected <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>scholar</b> of the law, but had greatly diminished his chances with {{his home state of}} California by striking down anti-Chinese legislation in that state in 1879. Even so, some observers, including Edwards Pierrepont, considered Field a likely choice for the nomination.|$|E
