50|$|Discrimination against <b>atheists,</b> both {{at present}} and historically, {{includes}} {{the persecution of}} those identifying themselves or labeled by others as <b>atheists,</b> {{as well as the}} discrimination against them. Discrimination against <b>atheists</b> may also refer to and comprise the negative attitudes towards, prejudice, hostility, hatred, fear, and/or intolerance towards <b>atheists</b> and/or atheism. Because atheism can be defined in various ways, those discriminated against or persecuted on the grounds of being <b>atheists</b> might not have been considered <b>atheists</b> in a different time or place. As of 2015, 19 countries punish their citizens for apostasy, and in 13 of those countries it is punishable by death.|$|R

2500|$|A 2006 {{study at}} the University of Minnesota showed <b>atheists</b> {{to be the most}} distrusted {{minority}} among Americans. In the study, sociologists Penny Edgell, Joseph Gerties and Douglas Hartmann conducted a survey of American public opinion on attitudes towards different groups. 40% of respondents characterized <b>atheists</b> as a group that [...] "does not at all agree with my vision of American society", putting <b>atheists</b> well ahead of every other group, with the next highest being Muslims (26%) and homosexuals (23%). When participants were asked whether they agreed with the statement, [...] "I would disapprove if my child wanted to marry a member of this group," [...] <b>atheists</b> again led minorities, with 48% disapproval, followed by Muslims (34%) and African-Americans (27%). Joe Foley, co-chairman for Campus <b>Atheists</b> and Secular Humanists, commented on the results, [...] "I know <b>atheists</b> aren't studied that much as a sociological group, but I guess <b>atheists</b> are one of the last groups remaining that it's still socially acceptable to hate." [...] A University of British Columbia study conducted in the United States found that believers distrust <b>atheists</b> as much as they distrust rapists. The study also showed that <b>atheists</b> have lower employment prospects.|$|R

5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize {{the use of the term}} agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the <b>atheist</b> label.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{theories}} of constitutional democracy assume that citizens are intellectually and spiritually autonomous and that governments should leave matters {{of religious belief}} to individuals and not coerce religious beliefs using sanctions or benefits. The constitutions, human rights conventions and the religious liberty jurisprudence of most constitutional democracies provide legal protection of <b>atheists</b> and agnostics. In addition, freedom of expression provisions and legislation separating church from state also serve {{to protect the rights}} of <b>atheists.</b> As a result, open legal discrimination against <b>atheists</b> is not common in most Western countries. However, prejudice against <b>atheists</b> does exist in Western countries. A University of British Columbia study conducted in the United States found that believers distrusted <b>atheists</b> as much they did rapists. The study also showed that <b>atheists</b> had lower employment prospects.|$|R
40|$|The Cognitive Science of Religion {{commonly}} advances {{the view}} that religious beliefs emerge naturally via specific cognitive biases without cultural influence. From this perspective comes the claim that self-proclaimed <b>atheists</b> harbour traces of supernatural thinking. By exploring the potential influence of the cultural learning mechanism Credibility Enhancing Displays (CREDs), which affirms beliefs, current disparities between studies involved in priming the implicit theism of <b>atheists,</b> might be reconciled. Eighty-eight university students {{were randomly assigned to}} either a religious or control prime condition. A dictator game was completed to obtain an indication of pro-social behaviour (PSB). Lifetime theists reported significantly higher religious CREDs exposure levels than lifetime <b>atheists,</b> though not convert <b>atheists.</b> Conversely, lifetime <b>atheists</b> reported significantly lower CREDs exposure scores than convert <b>atheists.</b> Convert <b>atheists</b> in the prime condition were significantly more pro-social than lifetime <b>atheists.</b> Additionally, higher scores on the CREDs exposure measure equated to higher PSB in the religious condition than the control condition. The results are consistent with {{the view that}} supernatural belief formation is an interactive process between both context and content biases, and that in order to accurately test for implicit theism, past personal differences in exposure to religious CREDs should be considered. 24 page(s...|$|R

As ideological positioning, <b>atheists</b> declare themselves, equally, both right-wing and left-wing, most of them (56%) placing {{at the center of}} the ideological line. Only eight percent say they prefer leftist economic policies, while right-wing economic policies attract 47% of <b>atheists.</b>|$|R

25|$|According to {{sociologist}} Phil Zuckerman, broad {{estimates of}} those who have an absence of belief in a God range from 500 to 750 million people worldwide. Other estimates state that there are 200 million to 240 million self-identified <b>atheists</b> worldwide, with China and Russia being major contributors to those figures. According to sociologists Ariela Keysar and Juhem Navarro-Rivera's review of numerous global studies on atheism, there are 450 to 500 million positive <b>atheists</b> and agnostics worldwide (7% of the world's population), with China having the most <b>atheists</b> in the world (200 million convinced <b>atheists).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Discrimination against <b>atheists</b> in the United States {{occurs in}} legal, personal, social, and {{professional}} contexts. Many American <b>atheists</b> compare their situation to the discrimination faced by ethnic minorities, LGBT communities, and women. [...] "Americans still feel it's acceptable {{to discriminate against}} <b>atheists</b> in ways considered beyond the pale for other groups," [...] asserted Fred Edwords of the American Humanist Association. The degree of discrimination, persecution, and social stigma <b>atheists</b> face in the United States, compared to other persecuted groups in the United States {{has been the subject}} of study and a matter of debate.|$|R
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of <b>atheist</b> was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} <b>atheist</b> and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|The website {{sometimes}} {{adopts a}} strongly critical stance against figures that it perceives as political or ideological opponents.

5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an <b>atheist</b> {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E

5000|$|Religion for <b>Atheists</b> has {{a general}} format in which de Botton {{describes}} {{a problem in}} society, discusses how religions (particularly Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism) have attempted to solve this problem, and proposes secular alternatives. Religion for <b>Atheists</b> draws {{on the work of}} the 19th century philosophers Auguste Comte, Matthew Arnold and John Stuart Mill. Religion for <b>Atheists</b> particularly pays attention to the way religions draw people's minds to ideas through annual ceremonies and rituals such as Christmas or the Day of Atonement. Religion for <b>Atheists</b> asserts that religions know that people are fundamentally children, in need of comforting and repeated guidance on how to live. The book is divided into ten chapters: Wisdom without Doctrine, Community, Kindness, Education, Tenderness, Pessimism, Perspective, Art, Architecture and Institutions. In an interview with New Scientist, de Botton stated his aim for <b>atheists</b> reading the book: [...] "I want to make sure <b>atheists</b> are deriving some of the benefits of religion." ...|$|R
