5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from <b>American</b> <b>friends</b> John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{critics were}} less favorable, such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film two stars out of five.

Club remarked, [...] "Ripley's Game fatally lacks the squirmy, desperate humanity that made Wenders' take on the same material so hauntingly tragic. Like Malkovich's suavely generic international criminal, it's all craft and no soul, with complexity and depth functioning as collateral damage for its slick thriller mechanics." [...] Neil Young's Film Lounge, giving Ripley's Game a score of 6 out of 10, called the film a [...] "largely uninspired" [...] adaptation by a [...] "pedestrian" [...] director, calling The <b>American</b> <b>Friend</b> [...] "brilliant" [...] by comparison, feeling that [...] "any viewer who {{is a fan of}} Highsmith and/or The <b>American</b> <b>Friend</b> will have major problems with this version." ...|$|R
