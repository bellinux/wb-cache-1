40|$|Abstract. Gear honing {{processing}} {{is a kind}} {{of processing}} method which belongs to the point-contact generating gear finishing. Its movement form is equivalent to a pair of gears transmission which the surface of the gear-honing-tool is adhered a layer of grinding grain. When it works in rolling processing, the contact-point between the workpiece and gear-honing-tool is moving. Then the moving point becomes a line in the space, and with the gear-honing-tool being in <b>axial</b> <b>play,</b> a standard flank of tooth is finished. Using the gear meshing principle, kinematics model of relative sliding velocity in the contact- point between the workpiece and tools is established, based on which the contact-line equation. and acceleration equation. at the contact-point are derived. The contact-line is solved in a given parameters of the workpiece and tool in MATLAB. The theoretical derivation and experimental results show that the speed in diverse along the direction of the tooth depth is the main reason for the roughness value and surface texture of workpiece. The acceleration of contact-line at the tooth flank is different, and it is leading reason that the processed workpiece gears appear profile distortion. Finally, the testing system is established for researching honing gear process. It is showed in the results that the acceleration difference can lead to the CBN abrasive falling away from gear honing tool, and even the "anti-cutting " phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Today roller-screw {{mechanisms}} (RSM) are {{the most}} prospective motion converters from rotary to linear type. RSM manufacturers have suggested their design in the way, similar to the rolling bearings, in static and dynamic load ratings. The latter means that during long operations the main criterion of the RSM working capacity is fatigue spalling. However, this approach does not permit to consider temporal changes {{of the most critical}} performance parameters of the RSM (such as the <b>axial</b> <b>play,</b> the efficiency factor, the axial stiffness, the accuracy, the starting torque force for zero lash RSMs, etc.) through calculations. The abovementioned method was not perfect, because the choice of the main criterion of RSM working capacity was wrong. The article proves that wear-resistance is the main criterion of RSM working capacity. The proof is the RSM efficiency factor equal to 80 - 88 % on the average. The power loss occurs because of overcoming a sliding friction between multiple (from 300 to 1000) interfacing turns of thread on the screw and the rollers {{as well as on the}} rollers and the nut. That is why the RSMs are the screwtype rolling mechanisms with an essential portion of sliding friction. High-accuracy measurements taken using the device called a form-tracer for threaded pieces permitted to determine the essential changes on the profiles of turns of threads on the rollers (a straight-line portion appeared on the radial profile); these changes could emerge only from wear. Besides, the length of this portion increased with the increasing RSM operation time. The JSC “Moskvich” has examined the RSMs, which have been put out of operation after completing their service life as parts of robot welding machines. There were no traces of fatigue spalling found on the threaded surfaces of the RSM parts, while the sizes of the straight-line portions on the turns of the roller threads were much bigger than they were during the measurements after the initial period of operation. Therefore, it is relevant to conduct a research for developing the RSM wear-resistance calculation methods. The aim and objectives of such a research have been established, and the initial object – a non-nut type roller-screw mechanism of simple design and kinematics – has been chosen. By now a whole range of theoretical studies have been conducted entirely, or partially, a test rig has been designed and manufactured, and the metrological examination methods have been developed for threaded surfaces of the RSM parts...|$|E

40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS <b>axial</b> <b>play</b> and its performance capabilities significantly.

The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter.

This excess heat supply enhances the MSR performance compared with the infinitely-thin walled reformer.

In the analysis, the radial displacement of the shell is approximated by a finite degree of freedom system. To assure that the created model is proper, its static buckling behavior was studied. It was found that the model gives the proper imperfection sensitivity behavior. The dynamic analysis includes not only the effect of the radial inertia, but also that due to the axial inertia in an approximate manner. The critical loads are determined by numerical integration of the equation of motion. In addition a study is carried out to consider the effects of wave number of the radial mode shape, mass on the loaded edge of the shell and damping of the axial motion. Compared with the static case, there is a significant reduction of the dynamic buckling load for the high wave numbers of the radial modes. Also, there is a critical clamping value, above which the dynamic buckling load is close to the static buckling load. The dynamic buckling load approaches half of the static buckling load with increasing mass on the loading edge.

Despite considerable success of this theory in explaining climate change over the Pleistocene epoch (2. 6 to 0. 01 Myr ago), it is inconclusive with regard to which combination of orbital elements paced the 100 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles over the late Pleistocene. Here we explore {{the role of the}} orbital elements in pacing the Pleistocene deglaciations by modeling ice-volume variations in a Bayesian approach. When comparing models, this approach takes into account the uncertainties in the data as well as the different degrees of model complexity. We find that the Earth's obliquity (<b>axial</b> tilt) <b>plays</b> a dominant role in pacing the glacial cycles over the whole Pleistocene, while precession only becomes important in pacing major deglaciations after the transition of the dominant period from 41 kyr to 100 kyr (the mid-Pleistocene transition). We also find that geomagnetic field and orbital inclination variations are unlikely to have paced the Pleistocene deglaciations. We estimate that the mid-Pleistocene transition took place over a 220 kyr interval centered on a time 715 kyr ago, although the data permit a range of 600 [...] 1000 kyr. This transition, occurring within just two 100 kyr cycles, indicates a relatively rapid change in the climate response to insolation.

In prior research, there were only two parameters, i. e. hydroforming pressure and <b>axial</b> feeding, to <b>play</b> with to obtain a part without any problems like bursting and wrinkling. However, for parts with complex geometries it is sometimes impossible to produce them by changing only these two variables. In this paper a new concept to design THF dies is presented and verified by numerical and experimental studies. By application of this concept, dies will have three parts instead of two, and consequently the tube will be preformed by the die closing {{before the start of the}} hydroforming step. The numerical verifications confirmed that without this modification, the production of most of the workpieces with complex geometries is difficult, if not impossible. The numerical results showed good agreement with the performed experiments. 9 2013. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{modelling}} is {{an essential}} and convenient tool to understand the systemic mechanism of human bodies and to assist the diagnosis and/or the treatment of various diseases. The main objective of this thesis is to develop soft tissue mechanics models and use these to address a number of particular clinical topics, namely, the human iris, the artery and the mitral valve. Important modelling aspects such as fluid-structure interaction, fibre reinforcement, material anisotropy and organ-organ interaction are included. To avoid the acute closed-angle glaucoma and the buckling of floppy iris syndrome in Descemet’s stripping endothelial keratoplasty, three-dimensional linear human iris is studied and the intraocular pressure {{is found to be}} a critical factor in determining the involving complications. Human arteries usually consist of two or more families of collagen fibres {{in each of the three}} distinct layers (the intima, the media and the adventitia). One challenge is to explain the recent experimental observation that only one family of (circumferential) fibres exists in the media of the iliac artery. Using an invariant-based fibre-reinforced nonlinear constitutive model, we are able to provide a plausible explanation from the mechanics viewpoint, and show that such fibre architecture achieves the optimal energy or stress distributions. We also find that the <b>axial</b> pre-stretch <b>plays</b> a vital role in different fibre structures. We finally develop a patient-specific human mitral valve model using the immersed boundary finite element method. A major advantage of this approach is that we can incorporate experimentally based constitutive laws for material properties in a coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction framework. This mitral valve model is ex- tended by coupling with a contractile left ventricular model and a comparative analysis is further conducted...|$|R
