5|$|Alongside {{the second}} series of Life Begins, Bullen {{continued}} developing George the Third. The title {{was changed to}} It Happens until eventually settling on <b>All</b> <b>About</b> George in time for filming in 2005. <b>All</b> <b>About</b> George starred Rik Mayall as George Kinsey, a builder whose life is changed when six generations of his family move into his home. Initially excited about the series when he attended the cast read-throughs, Bullen's optimism waned {{by the time it}} was broadcast as he felt there were too many characters and the series' premise unclear. In a 2008 interview, he describes it as one of his worst TV series. Life Begins returned for a third and final series in 2006. The same year, filming commenced on Tripping Over, a series about intercontinental backpackers in 1976 and 2006. SeaChange writers Andrew Knight and Andrea Denholm conceived the idea in 2003 and asked Bullen, a friend of Knight's, to develop it with them. A co-production between Australia's Channel Ten and Britain's Five, Tripping Over was broadcast in both countries at the end of 2006.|$|E

5|$|Extra Texture (Read <b>All</b> <b>About</b> It) is {{the sixth}} studio album by English {{musician}} George Harrison, released in September 1975. It was Harrison's final album under {{his contract with}} Apple Records and EMI, and the last studio album issued by Apple. The release came nine months after his troubled 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar and the poorly received Dark Horse album. The melancholic mood of the recording reflects Harrison's depressed state at the criticism generated by these projects.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} authorship of the work, its actual date, and its purpose, {{have long been}} matters for {{controversy}} amongst historians and scholars, ever since Hermann Dessau in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include {{the nature of the}} sources it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in <b>all</b> <b>about</b> 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's <b>all</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E

5|$|In <b>all,</b> <b>about</b> 15,000 damage {{claims were}} filed across Réunion, {{with a total}} of 3,251 homes damaged and about 850 {{condemned}} or destroyed. Property damage from the storm amounted to €95 million (US$83.4 million). Collectively, losses on the island were estimated at €200 million (US$190 million). Although there were no fatalities directly related to the storm, six people died in various events indirectly caused by Dina.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced {{was the fact that}} voters did not know about him and his candidacy. An April 2–5 poll {{conducted}} by Gallup found that 38% of the public had never heard of Joe Biden and 17% had no opinion at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> him. In contrast, 0% of the public had never heard of Hillary Clinton and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E

5|$|Planescape: Torment is {{primarily}} story-driven and combat is not prominently featured. The protagonist, known as The Nameless One, is an immortal {{who has lived}} many lives but has forgotten <b>all</b> <b>about</b> them, even forgetting his own name. The game focuses on his journey through the city of Sigil and other planes to reclaim his memories of these previous lives. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey, {{and most of these}} characters have encountered him in the past or have been influenced by his actions in some way.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at <b>all</b> <b>about</b> Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
