40|$|In this paper, an {{extension}} of Pure Type Systems (PTS's) to include definitions is presented and the meta-theory of these PTS's with definitions is treated in detail. We prove that all the properties of a PTS are preserved by the extension. 1 Introduction A PTS does not provide the possibility to introduce a definition, i. e. an <b>abbreviation</b> (<b>name)</b> for a larger term {{which can be used}} several times in a program or proof. A definition mechanism is essential for practical use, and indeed implementantions of PTS's such as Coq [ea 91], Lego [LP 92] or Constructor [Hel 91] do provide such facility, even though the formal definition of the systems they implement do not. In this chapter, we introduce {{an extension}} of the PTS with (non-recursive) definitions. The extension of a PTS with definitions looks very harmless and this may not seem a topic worthy of investigation. Howewer the local definitions complicate matters and it is an open problem whether extending an arbitrary PTS with defintions p [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a social}} community, {{multiple}} persons may {{share the same}} name, phone number or some other identifying attributes. This, along with other phenomena, such as name <b>abbreviation,</b> <b>name</b> misspelling, and human error lead to erroneous aggregation of records of multiple persons under a single reference. Such mistakes affect the performance of document retrieval, web search, database integration, and more importantly, improper attribution of credit (or blame). The task of entity disambiguation partitions the records belonging to multiple persons with the objective that each partition is composed of records of a unique person. Existing solutions to this task use either biographical attributes, or auxiliary features that are collected from external sources, such as Wikipedia. However, for many scenarios, such auxiliary features are not available, or they are costly to obtain. Besides, the attempt of collecting biographical or external data sustains the risk of privacy violation. In this work, we propose a method for solving entity disambiguation task from timestamped link information obtained from a collaboration network. Our method is non-intrusive of privacy as it uses only the graph topology of an anonymized network. Experimental results on two real-life academic collaboration networks show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{matching}} strings allowing errors has recently gained importance, considering the increasing volume of online textual data. In geotechnologies, approximate string matching algorithms find many applications, such as gazetteers, address matching, and geographic information retrieval. This paper presents a novel method for approximate string matching, {{developed for the}} recognition of geographic and personal names. The method deals with <b>abbreviations,</b> <b>name</b> inversions, stopwords, and omission of parts. Three similarity measures and a method to match individual words considering accent marks and other multilingual aspects were developed. Test results show high precision-recall rates and good overall matching efficiency. 1...|$|R

These unknown words could be <b>abbreviations,</b> <b>names,</b> acronyms and newly introduced terms. We have proposed an algorithm for the resolution of the unidentified words. This algorithm takes discourse unit (primitive discourse) as a unit of analysis and provides real time updates to the lexicon. We have manually applied the algorithm to news paper fragments.

This can produce name ambiguity which can affect the performance of document retrieval, web search, and database integration, and may cause improper attribution of credit. Proposed here is an unsupervised learning approach using K-way spectral clustering that disambiguates authors in citations. The approach utilizes three types of citation attributes: co-author names, paper titles, and publication venue titles 2. The approach is illustrated with 16 name datasets with citations collected from the DBLP database bibliography and author home pages and shows that name disambiguation can be achieved using these citation attributes...|$|R
