50|$|A haploscope is {{an optical}} device for {{presenting}} one image to {{one eye and}} another image to the other eye. The word derives from two Greek roots: haploieides, single and skopeo, to view. The word is often used interchangeably with stereoscope, {{but it is more}} general than that. A stereoscope is a type of haploscope, but not vice versa. The word has more currency in the medical field than elsewhere, where it refers to instruments designed to test binocular vision. These instruments include Worth's <b>amblyoscope</b> and the synoptophore.|$|E
50|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the vision therapy {{approach}} that is widespread in the U.S. and which has led to recover stereopsis in a number of persons, most notably Susan R. Barry, is diametrically opposed to the use of prisms in the manner that is advocated in the MKH method. In particular, Frederick W. Brock spoke against the use of an <b>amblyoscope</b> during training, because in his view the patient needed to take the correct binocular posture (aiming the two eyes such that they simultaneously look at the same target in space) when fusing, otherwise the training would not be likely to succeed.|$|E
5000|$|Brock trained his {{patients}} with rich stereo images which closely resembled the natural environment, and favored these {{over the use}} of (simplified) stereographs. In a first session with a client, Brock would invest great time into finding a point at which the client already performed binocular fusion, and Brock would refer to this point as his [...] "point of attack" [...] from which he would try to expand the range of positions in which fusion was achieved. He made use of the peripheral vision of {{his patients}} to lock binocular fusion, using his so-called [...] "stereomotivator" [...] to project large red/green anaglyphic stereo images onto a wall such as to stimulate very large receptive fields in the patients.

Horizontal and vertical deviations with the head kept straight were measured by alternate prism and cover test to the fixation light target at the distance of 5 Â m.

40|$|SUMMARY Random-dot stereograms {{were found}} to be capable of {{producing}} fusional vergence amplitudes in the absence of monocular contours. These vergence amplitudes are not an artefact of monocular contours provided by the target borders or test instrument and are comparable in range to vergence amplitudes measured clinically with second degree fusion targets in an <b>amblyoscope.</b> We conclude that diplopia of monocularly recognisable contours is not necessary for producing fusional vergence amplitudes. Fusional vergence amplitudes reflect the ability of the oculomotor system to maintain sensory fusion in spite of varying vergence requirements. Traditionally this has been regarded as a diplopia avoidance mechanism. However, Hyson et al. ' have recorded vergence responses to divergent misalignment of random-dot stereogram targets which do not feature monocularly recognisable contours which could give rise to diplopia.

40|$|MEASUREMENT of {{the angle}} of {{deviation}} in squint is usually made either objectively or subjectively {{by means of the}} major <b>amblyoscope.</b> This instru-ment has the disadvantage that, although the fixation object is optically at infinity, the known proximity of the apparatus may stimulate convergence (see, for instance, Schapero and Levy, 1953). The readings vary from operator to operator, especially by the objective method, and may differ widely from the visual estimate made by a practised surgeon from observa-tion of the corneal reflex. An attempt has been made to avoid some of these difficulties by assessing {{the angle of}} squint by photographic means. This also provides a permanent record which may be compared with similar records obtained later. The method to be described, though more time-consuming than that using the synoptophore, requires a minimum of co-operation from the patients, in that they are simply required to fix a small light. It places on a quantitative basis the method employed in visual estimation of the angle by the position of th...|$|E
40|$|THE {{purpose of}} {{treatment}} of all patients with strabismus {{is to reduce}} the angle of deviation to the smallest possible value and to develop the co-opera-tion between the eyes to the highest possible degree. Normal binocular use of the eyes may be achieved in patients with fully accommodative squints of late onset and relatively short duration, but this is not always the case even in patients who show strong fusion and stereopsis on the major <b>amblyoscope.</b> A certain number of such patients have a definite slight deviation on cover test at all distances; others have a manifest deviation for one distance only, arousing the suspicion that binocular vision may not be perfect even at those distances at which the cover test reveals no deviation; the subsequent history may demonstrate a tendency for the strabismus to recur; and in others the depth perception may be surprisingly poor (Naylor, Shannon, and Stanworth, 1956). One possible obstacle to perfect binocular vision in such patients is abnor-mal retinal correspondence with a very small angle of anomaly; this may b...|$|E
