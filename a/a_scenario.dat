30|$|We {{observe that}} the {{distribution}} functions for the <b>A</b> 5 <b>scenario</b> approach large probabilities faster {{than those for}} the <b>A</b> 6 <b>scenario.</b> This means that in the <b>A</b> 5 <b>scenario,</b> <b>a</b> larger fraction of CAMs is received from the near vicinity than in the <b>A</b> 6 <b>scenario.</b> While 90 % of the CAMs are received from other vehicles within a distance of up to 600 m in the <b>A</b> 5 <b>scenario,</b> this 90 % quantile is about 650 m in the <b>A</b> 6 <b>scenario.</b> The reason for the difference {{is the fact that}} the eight lanes in the <b>A</b> 5 <b>scenarios</b> cause <b>a</b> larger channel load than the four lanes in the <b>A</b> 6 <b>scenario.</b> <b>As</b> a result, CAMs from faraway senders in the <b>A</b> 5 <b>scenario</b> have <b>a</b> clearly lower reception probability than in the <b>A</b> 6 <b>scenario.</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such <b>a</b> <b>scenario.</b>|$|E

Character statistics, such as experience points, abilities, and disciplines, can also be modified. Finally, the Storyteller can assume the role of any character at any given time. These functions allow the Storyteller to dynamically manipulate the play environment while the other players traverse it.|$|E
5|$|Ricordi {{sent his}} agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to {{negotiate}} with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>scenario</b> {{consistent}} with the phylogenetic, ice sheet size, and sea-level depth data is that during the Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon corridor that ran along the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is {{consistent with}} the findings of earlier studies.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, <b>a</b> <b>scenario</b> known as heat death.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such <b>a</b> <b>scenario</b> occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E

When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, {{for the first time in}} the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready.
