40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} tracking n targets in the plane using 2 n cameras, where tracking each target requires two distinct cameras. A single camera (modeled as a point) sees a target point in a certain direction, ideally with unlimited precision, and thus two cameras (not collinear with the target) unambiguously determine {{the position of the}} target. In reality, due to the imprecision of the cameras, instead of a single viewing direction a target defines only a viewing cone, and so two cameras localize a target only within the intersection of two such cones. In general, the true localization error is a complicated function of the angle subtended by the two cameras at the target (the <b>tracking</b> <b>angle),</b> but a commonly accepted tenet is that an angle of 90 ◦ is close to the ideal. In this paper, we consider several algorithmic problems related to this so-called “focus of attention ” problem. In particular, we show that the problem of deciding whether each of n given targets can be tracked with 90 ◦ is NP-complete. For the special case where the cameras are placed along a single line while the targets are located anywhere in the plane, we show a 2 -approximation both for the sum of <b>tracking</b> <b>angles</b> and the bottleneck <b>tracking</b> <b>angle</b> (i. e., the smallest <b>tracking</b> <b>angle)</b> maximization problems (which is a natural goal whenever targets and cameras are far from each other). Lastly, for the uniform placement of cameras along the line, we further improve the result to a PTAS. ...|$|R

All beetles initiating flight along the pheromone plume {{make contact with the}} pheromone source. Analysis of digitized flight tracks indicates that C. maculatus males respond similarly to moths tested at several wind speeds. Beetles’ mean net upwind speeds and speeds along their track are similar (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) across wind speeds, whereas airspeeds increase (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with increasing wind speed. Beetles adjust their course angles to fly more directly upwind in higher wind speeds, whereas <b>track</b> <b>angles</b> are almost identical at each wind speed. The zigzag flight paths are generally narrow compared with most moth flight tracks and interturn distances are similar (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) at the wind speeds employed. The frequency of these counterturns across the wind line is almost constant regardless of wind speed, and there is little variation between individuals. The upwind flight tracks are more directly upwind than those typically seen for male moths flying upwind toward sex pheromone sources. Male moths typically produce a bimodal distribution of <b>track</b> <b>angles</b> to the left and right of the windline, whereas C. maculatus males’ <b>track</b> <b>angles</b> are centred about 0 °.

40|$|Improving the {{mobility}} of tracked vehicles in deep snow requires {{an increase in the}} knowledge and understanding of the design parameters which influence the tractive performance. This relates particularly to the new vehicle requirements of increased payload to vehicle weight ratio, improved fuel economy and reduced life cycle costs. It has been the aim of the research presented in this thesis to improve the understanding of how different vehicle design parameters affect the tractive performance of tracked vehicles in deep snow. A new tracked vehicle was developed to enable experimental studies of different vehicle design parameters in deep snow. The vehicle was skid steered with a hydrostatic transmission and driven by a five-cylinder diesel engine. The vehicle design made it possible to vary several vehicle design parameters in the field, one at a time, without affecting the others. To be able to compare vehicle tests from different snow conditions and also to be able to simulate vehicle performance in snow, the strength properties of the snow are required. A bevameter was developed to characterise the pressure-sinkage relationship, the response to unloading- reloading and the shear stress-shear displacement of the snow. The idea of using the bevameter technique was to measure the terrain data under loading conditions similar to those encountered by an off-road vehicle. The bevameter developed consisted of a hydraulic cylinder with a piston of one metre stroke through the cylinder. A hydraulic motor with a planetary gear was attached to {{the upper end of the}} rod piston, which exerted the turning torque in the shear test. The cylinder exerted the normal force in both the pressure-sinkage and the shear test. The most important finding was that the drawbar pull strongly increased when the initial rear <b>track</b> <b>angle</b> was reduced. This was due to both an increased thrust between the tracks and the snow and to a reduced track motion resistance. The increased performance originated from a reduced load transfer from the last roadwheel to the others when the initial rear <b>track</b> <b>angle</b> was reduced. The tractive performance increased continuously with decreasing initial rear <b>track</b> <b>angle.</b> The tractive performance not only increased when the idler made contact with the snow, thus increasing the track contact length, but increased continuously with a decrease in the initial rear <b>track</b> <b>angle</b> prior to the idler contacting the snow. Another important finding was that the drawbar pull increased when the centre of gravity was moved forward, especially when the idler was in the elevated position. An increased belly ground clearance and a reduced initial angle of the vehicle belly both provided improved mobility performance of the vehicle. This was due to both increased thrust and reduced belly resistance, which in both cases, originated from a vertical load transfer from the rear of the belly to the tracks. The experimental tests of the influence of the initial rear <b>track</b> <b>angle</b> on the tractive performance were compared with corresponding simulations using the Nepean Tracked Vehicle Performance Model for Microsoft Windows, (NTVPMwin). The simulation also showed an increased drawbar pull when the initial rear <b>track</b> <b>angle</b> was reduced. However, there was difference in the absolute level of the drawbar pull with the simulation results showing a 6 - 10 % higher drawbar pull. Godkänd; 2002; 20061113 (haneit...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} synthesis of servo driver for controlling {{the speed of the}} object with the speed tuned at the modular optimum. An automatic electric motor drive is considered as the controlled element. This assumes the use of the speed sensor on the output shaft of the drive gear. This approach can be used for geared motors, which are more commonly used in a variety of compact drives. The technique is based on the method of synthesis by using logarithmic frequency response (LFR). The result is a synthesis of the two <b>tracking</b> <b>angle</b> controllers: proportional-integral and proportional-derivative (PIPD regulator).
