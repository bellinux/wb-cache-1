25|$|After a thyroid nodule {{is found}} during a {{physical}} examination, <b>a</b> <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> an endocrinologist or a thyroidologist may occur. Most commonly an ultrasound is performed {{to confirm the}} presence of a nodule and assess the status of the whole gland. Measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis present, a known cause of a benign nodular goiter. Measurement of calcitonin is necessary to exclude the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Finally, to achieve a definitive diagnosis before deciding on treatment, a fine needle aspiration cytology test is usually performed and reported according to the Bethesda system.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{levels of}} the technology, the thought of abandoning control to a machine, and {{psychological}} comfort of passengers in such situations were the major discussion topics initially.

Intel also learnt that voice control regulator is vital, and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition, and brings some sense of control back. It is important to mention that Intel included only 10 people in this study, which makes the study less credible. In a video posted on YouTube, Intel accepted this fact and called for further testing.|$|E

Sean McPhilemy's The Committee: Political Assassination in Northern Ireland claims the Provisional IRA had initially been blamed for his killing. Hanna was allegedly shot after he had refused to participate in the UVF's planned Miami Showband attack which Jackson had personally organised and would help to carry out on 31 July. His refusal stemmed from his purported remorse at the part he had played in the killing of [...] "all those children in Dublin", which was <b>a</b> <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> his having instructed David Alexander Mulholland to drive and park the first car bomb which had detonated in Parnell Street, killing two infant girls and eight other people.

30|$|With a {{urologist}} led one-stop testicular clinic we {{have shown}} not only convenience for patients and referring doctors, but also <b>a</b> fast <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> clinic time and <b>a</b> fast <b>referral</b> <b>to</b> treatment time in those with suspected testicular cancer. This benefits patients and leads to less anxiety as diagnoses are made rapidly. In addition the reassurance of a normal or benign ultrasound scan would {{reduce the number of}} re-attenders. We have also shown that an appropriately trained urologist can perform testicular ultrasound scans with high accuracy and specificity comparable to previously published data. This saves time and also departmental funds. We believe that these collective enhancements are positive and benefit patients and the department as a whole. A urologist led one-stop testicular clinic should be regarded as the gold standard.|$|R
