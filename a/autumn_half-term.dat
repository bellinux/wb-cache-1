The original sleeve of the single credits [...] "Miss Snob and Class 3C" [...] with [...] "Additional noises". The basic track {{for the single}} was recorded in August 1973, so to create a wintry feeling engineer Steve Brown decorated the studio with Christmas decorations and turned the air conditioning down to its coldest setting. Wood wore a woollen hat found in lost property. The schoolchildren were brought down from the Midlands to London by bus during the <b>autumn</b> <b>half-term</b> to add their contributions.|$|E
