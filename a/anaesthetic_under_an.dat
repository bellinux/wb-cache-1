40|$|Most of the {{knowledge}} of cardiovascular physi-ology and pharmacology is based on experiments which have been conducted on animals in the anaesthetized state, often with an open chest, and the tacit assumption that general anaesthesia does not modify the conclusions derived from these experiments to a major extent. However, research in chronically instrumented experimental animals {{has shown that the}} methodological requirement for basal anaesthesia—that is, the impact of anaesthetic drugs {{in the absence of the}} particular <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>under</b> study—may cause <b>a</b> consider-able disruption of the autonomic control of the cardiovascular system [1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 15, 16], a pro-found shift in baseline haemodynamics [1, 2, 4, 7, 10 - 16], and myocardial function and coronary haemodynamics [1, 3, 10 - 14, 16], variables which are of fundamental importance in studying the impact of various anaesthetics on the cardio-vascular system. It is, therefore, important to conduct sequential haemodynamic measurements enabling comparisons of the conscious v. the anaesthetized states. The goal of the present article is to present some of the chronic instru-mentation techniques for study of the effects of anaesthetic agents on overall haemodynamics, coronary blood flow and regional myocardial function in comparison with the conscious state.

30|$|Our {{postoperative}} results {{cannot be}} compared to the literature since this is the first study to our knowledge to investigate the change in knee laxity after a medial CWHTO. Moreover, due to the difference in radiological measurement settings (i.e. <b>under</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> preoperative and non-anaesthetized conditions postoperative) we have possibly inflicted a non-comparable situation especially as regards the varus laxity measurements. Tsukeoka and Tsuneizumi proved that anaesthesia significantly influenced knee joint laxity on both the medial and lateral side after TKA. They reported a positive correlation between the laxity under anaesthesia and the amount of change in laxity on the lateral side (r =[*] 0.57; p =[*] 0.0022). They found an increase in laxity for varus stress with mean of 1 ° <b>under</b> <b>anaesthetics</b> in <b>a</b> 15 degree flexion angle of the knee. Moreover, in 23 % of their patients they reported an increase of >[*] 3 ° in laxity measured under anaesthesia as compared to non-anesthetized patients (Tsukeoka and Tsuneizumi 2016). The decrease of varus laxity comparing the postoperative non-anesthetized results to the preoperative anesthetized results may be contributed solely to the effect of anaesthesia and may in fact display the same unchanged lateral collateral laxity. Therefore, the different measurement setting is a plausible explanation for the unexpected decrease in varus laxity in this patient population.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In the {{treatment}} of hepatic injuries, there is not always adequate and secure hemostasis. A hepatic biopsy is indispensable {{in the evolution of}} focal or diffuse liver cell disease, being necessary for candidates for liver transplant and post-transplant treatment. Many patients suffer blood clotting that increases the risk of bleeding. For this reason, it is necessary to seek for substances capable of bringing about hemostasis quickly and effectively. PURPOSE: The aim {{of this study was to}} recognize the validity of the use of microporous polysaccharide hemispheres (MPH) as a hemostatic agent for hepatic injuries. METHODS: Thirty Wistar rats were used, split into three groups. <b>Under</b> <b>anaesthetic,</b> <b>a</b> laparoptomy was done and resulted in a standard liver injury that was treated in Group A with MPH, in Group B with n-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate and in Group C with fibrin adhesive. Immediate hemostasis, delayed bleeding and histological evolution were timed. RESULTS: The MPH took on average six minutes to promote hemostasis and also resulted in re-bleeding, which required reapplication; the n-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate took twenty seconds and the fibrin adhesive took one minute. The cyanoacrylate resulted in more intense adherence. The three adhesives mainly showed a chronic inflammatory reaction. The injuries treated with cyanoacrylate showed a larger area of injury (p= 0, 0164). The density of the collagen was similar in all groups. CONCLUSION: The MPH, despite achieving hemostasis, proved to be no more favorable than n-butyl-cyanoacrylate and the fibrin adhesive, the latter resulting in the lowest tissue reaction...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} various techniques for determining the sexual state of sows, four multiparous Landrace sows were housed in stalls 2 - 5 weeks after weaning. Catheters were inserted <b>under</b> <b>anaesthetic</b> into <b>a</b> prominent ear vein on each sow. Four days later blood and urine sampling commenced, along with other measurements to assess the oestrous state of the animals. Oestrus was detected in all four sows and so were corresponding oestradiol· 17 β peaks (22 - 49 pg/ml) in serum of the three sows from which blood was successfully sampled during the complete 25 ·day collection period. Serum progesterone concentrations were highest between days — 5 and — 12 (day 0 = 1 st day of standing heat) (peak values of 33 · 1 - 58 · 2 ng/ml), with values of 3 · 55 ng/ml or less on day 0. Urinary oestrogen was less well correlated with oestrous state than were serum hormone concentrations, but progesterone derivatives in urine corresponded well to serum progesterone with peaks between days — 5 and — 9. Vulval redness, vulval size, social interest and the occurrence of flehmen were markedly greater during the oestrous period than at other times in the cycle. Body temperature, vaginal pH, the presence of vaginal mucus and behavioural manifestations of oestrus (with the exception of back pressure test) were less well correlated with sexual state. A combination of vulval colour and size, back pressure test, a more detailed study of behaviour and possibly with urinary progesterone derivatives, should give the best indication of the incidence of oestrus in sow...|$|R

Methods: In a prospective, randomized fashion, 81 patients were selected for thyroid surgery under CEA. They were {{assigned to one of}} three groups: Group L, B and R to receive 10 mL of 1 % lignocaine, 0. 25 % bupivacaine and 0. 5 % ropivacaine, respectively. We compared their efficacy in terms of pulmonary and haemodynamic parameters, blockade quality and complications. Results: Of the total, 74 patients completed the study successfully. Sensory block attained the median dermatomal range of C 2 -T 4 /T 5 in all the groups. Motor block was more pronounced in the ropivacaine group. Cardiorespiratory parameters decreased significantly in all the groups; however, none of the patients had any major complications except for bradycardia in two patients. Among the measured variables, the decrease in heart rate and peak expiratory force was more in the lignocaine group while forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume at 1 sec declined to a greater extent in the ropivacaine group. The lignocaine group required significantly more epidural top-ups compared with the other two groups. Conclusion: We conclude that cervical epidural route can be safely used for surgery on thyroid gland in patients with normal cardiorespiratory reserve, using either of local anaesthetics chosen for our study. Under the selected dose and concentrations, the decrease in cardiorespiratory parameters was lesser with bupivacaine...|$|R
