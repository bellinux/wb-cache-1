40|$|This {{research}} in this paper considers the evidence {{on the success of}} alarm reduction strategies reported in the open literature. Despite strong beliefs to the contrary, the empirical evidence suggests that alarm reduction strategies have not been as successful as initially expected. This seems to be {{due to the fact that}} alarm reduction strategies actually deprive process control operators of information. In order to determine the ability of people to sift through alarm information, a study of alarm detection with three ratios of target to non-target alarms was devised (i. e. 2 %, 6 %, and 10 %) and the information was presented at three rates (i. e. 1 second, 4 seconds and 8 seconds). The results show that the ratio of target alarms has no effect on detection performance, but the temporal rate does. Given that process operators are rarely required to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>alarm</b> information in realtime, it is suggested that more emphasis should be placed on initial definition of alarms and better presentation methods, rather than attempts to block the flow of alarms that have already been triggered...|$|R
40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{possibility}} and implements an integration between OP 5 Monitor and Nilex Plus, and was performed during a five week period at Data Ductus in Uppsala. The {{reason for the}} project was {{to find out if}} there is any possibility to create a connection between OP 5 Monitor and Nilex Plus, to create tickets in Nilex from alarms in OP 5 Monitor and to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>alarms</b> in OP 5 Monitor directly from Nilex Plus. OP 5 Monitor is an evolvement of Nagios Core created by OP 5 AB, a Swedish based company that also was the only provider of the commercial support for Nagios during a period of time. Nilex Plus is an ITIL compatible software for ticketmanagement, incident and problemreporting created by Nilex AB. The report contains details of our learning period with OP 5 Monitor and NilexPlus and the results of this project is an almost complete integration in the test environment and also a documentation on how to perform the new integration between OP 5 Monitor and NilexPlus.

50|$|The {{driver was}} driving the train normally, keeping it under or close to posted speed limits. Travelling at 111 km/h with a limit of 150 km/h, at 11:55:11 pm the train passed over a {{midsection}} train protection magnet to warn of a lower speed limit ahead. The driver immediately <b>acknowledged</b> the <b>alarm,</b> and kept the train at speed with the throttle at 60 per cent power. At 11:55:24 pm, close to the 60 km/h speed limit sign, the driver moved the train's throttle to zero power, then to emergency braking less than one second after.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} part of most SCADA implementations is alarm handling. The system monitors whether certain alarm conditions are satisfied, to determine when an alarm event has occurred. Once an alarm event has been detected, one or more actions are taken (such as the activation {{of one or more}} alarm indicators, and perhaps the generation of email or text messages so that management or remote SCADA operators are informed). In many cases, a SCADA operator may have to <b>acknowledge</b> the <b>alarm</b> event; this may deactivate some alarm indicators, whereas other indicators remain active until the alarm conditions are cleared.|$|R

I hardly know what results may {{not be expected to}} follow the communication of your approaching change in life to Mrs. Lecount. My niece may be involved in those results. She is nervous; she is sensitive in the highest degree; she is the innocent object of this woman's unreasoning hatred and distrust. You alarm me, sir!

5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to <b>acknowledge</b> the <b>alarming</b> implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|R
40|$|Complex environments with {{automated}} systems, such as aircraft cockpits {{and nuclear}} control rooms, require critical decisions {{to be made}} about human intervention. Human monitors operating in these roles must interact with copious amounts of information. Decision support tools within integrated displays, especially alarms, aid people in monitoring these systems by capturing their attention to focus on possibly dangerous conditions. Once signaled, monitors choose whether they wish to <b>acknowledge</b> the <b>alarm</b> and search for more process status, or ignore it. This study investigates the impact of likelihood alarm technology versus traditional binary alarms on decision making accuracy and response bias in this acknowledgement phase using a two-stage Signal Detection Model. Participants performed two low-fidelity, twenty-min flight missions consisting of dual primary tasks, compensatory tracking and fuel management, and a secondary engine-monitoring task.

40|$|Clarke et al. (1986) have {{developed}} a model-based verification method and have applied it to validation of VLSI circuits. We have used the method to test automatically the safety and operability of discrete chemical process control systems. The technique involves: (1) a system model describing the process and its software; (2) assertions in temporal logic expressing user-supplied questions about the system behavior with respect to safety and operability; and (3) a model checker that determines if the system model satisfies each of the assertions and provides a counterexample to locate the error if one exists. Temporal logic is used for reasoning about occurrence of events over time. To reveal discrete event errors, we have applied the verification method to a simple combustion system and an <b>alarm</b> <b>acknowledge</b> system...|$|R
5000|$|All CityRail trains {{now have}} an {{additional}} safety feature, which has been fitted since the accident. In addition to the deadman handle and foot pedal, the trains are fitted with [...] "task linked vigilance" [...] - which resets a timer every time the driver activates certain controls. If there is no change in control, a flashing lamp and then buzzer sound and the driver is required to acknowledge a vigilance button. If the train's driver does not use the controls and does not <b>acknowledge</b> the vigilance <b>alarm,</b> the vigilance system is activated and makes an emergency brake application. All trains have also been fitted with data loggers to record the driver's and guard's actions as they work the train, {{as well as the}} train's speed. Such a system had been fitted to G7, but was in the early stage of fleet roll-out, and hence had not been commissioned and switched on {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} identify, characterize, and contrast alcohol use subgroups, by gender, {{in a college}} sample. Subgroups were formed by (1) alcohol consumption patterns and (2) cluster analytic methods. The resulting subgroups were externally validated with instruments selected from various domains;In general, univariate and multivariate analyses evidenced the existence of empirically and conceptually distinct subgroups {{for the majority of}} cluster derived subgroups. The quantity-frequency of alcohol use subgroups exhibited overall Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and Personality Research Form (PRF) empirical differences but were conceptually homogeneous. Relative differences were exhibited in individual scale elevations and, in some instances, did not reflect behavioral or cognitive uniqueness. However, many PRF derived clusters did manifest conceptually distinct MMPI profiles;The vast majority of all subgroups were characterized by MMPI Ma and Sc scale elevations. Female PRF derived clusters exhibited additional MMPI F and PD scale elevations with some male quantity-frequency of alcohol use subgroups evidencing F scale elevations;Overall, PRF subgroup commonalities were found for the Infrequency and Understanding scales. Further analysis revealed a wide scatter of PRF commonalities and uniqueness reflecting statistical and conceptual subgroup distinctions for the PRF derived clusters. The majority of quantity-frequency of alcohol use subgroup distinctions were subtle and of little utility in distinguishing subgroups;Compared with previous studies, male alcohol consumption patterns increased slightly, from an already elevated level, while college females demonstrated a dramatic upswing in their drinking habits. There was an overall increase in college student moderately heavy and heavy drinking. Furthermore, college students <b>acknowledge</b> an <b>alarming</b> number of alcohol related behavioral problems...|$|R
40|$|The Automatic Dialing system {{purchased}} by D 0 {{is intended to}} help make the D 0 cryogenic system operate unattended by cryogenic operating personnel. The auto dialer is completely programmable and is voice synthesized. The auto dialer was purchased with 32 bistable inputs, but is expandable to 64 bistable inputs with the purchase of more electronic cards at an approximate cost of $ 260 per card (8 bistable inputs). The auto dialer also has the capability for analog inputs, analog outputs, and bistable outputs none of which D 0 uses or intends to use. The auto dialer can be called on its operating phone line to describe current alarms with the proper password. The Auto Dialer can dial lab extensions, lab pagers, and any number outside the lab. It cannot dial a long distance pager. The auto dialer monitors alarms and alarm conditions via the T 1565 PLC, upon an alarm condition it initiates a phone calling sequence of preprogrammed lists with assigned priorities. When someone is reached, the auto dialer describes the individual alarm it is calling for, by a preprogrammed set of words for that individual alarm, spoken by a female voice. The called person then has a chance to <b>acknowledge</b> the <b>alarm</b> over the telephone, if the <b>alarm</b> is not <b>acknowledged</b> the auto dialer will disconnect and call the next person on the list. The auto dialer will continue to cycle through the list until it is acknowledged, reset, or the alarm condition no longer exists...|$|R
6000|$|The whole {{course of}} events, since the {{previous}} night, had tended one way, and had exerted the same delusive influence over her mind. It {{was impossible for}} her any longer to resist the conviction that she had distrusted appearances without the slightest reason, {{and that she had}} permitted purely visionary suspicions to fill her with purely causeless alarm. In the firm belief that she was in danger, she had watched through the night--and nothing had happened. In the confident anticipation that Geoffrey had promised what he was resolved not to perform, she had waited to see what excuse he would find for keeping her at the cottage. And, when the time came for the visit, she found him ready to fulfill the engagement which he had made. At Holchester House, not the slightest interference had been attempted with her perfect liberty of action and speech. Resolved to inform Sir Patrick that she had changed her room, she had described the alarm of fire and the events which had succeeded it, in the fullest detail--and had not been once checked by Geoffrey from beginning to end. She had spoken in confidence to Blanche, and had never been interrupted. Walking round the conservatory, she had dropped behind the others with perfect impunity, to say a grateful word to Sir Patrick, and to ask if the interpretation that he placed on Geoffrey's conduct was really the interpretation which had been hinted at by Blanche. They had talked together for ten minutes or more. Sir Patrick had assured her that Blanche had correctly represented his opinion. He had declared his conviction that the rash way was, in her case, the right way; and that she would do well (with his assistance) to take the initiative, in the matter of the separation, on herself. [...] "As long as he can keep you under the same roof with him"--Sir Patrick had said--"so long he will speculate on our anxiety to release you from the oppression of living with him; and so long he will hold out with his brother (in the character of a penitent husband) for higher terms. Put the signal in the window, and try the experiment to-night. Once find your way to the garden door, and I answer for keeping you safely out of his reach until he has submitted to the separation, and has signed the deed." [...] In those words he had urged Anne to prompt action. He had received, in return, her promise to be guided by his advice. She had gone back to the drawing-room; and Geoffrey had made no remark on her absence. She had returned to Fulham, alone with him in his brother's carriage; and he had asked no questions. What was it natural, with her means of judging, to infer from all this? Could she see into Sir Patrick's mind and detect that he was deliberately concealing his own conviction, in the fear that he might paralyze her energies if he <b>acknowledged</b> the <b>alarm</b> for her that he really felt? No. She could only accept the false appearances that surrounded her in the disguise of truth. She could only adopt, in good faith, Sir Patrick's assumed point of view, and believe, on the evidence of her own observation, that Sir Patrick was right.|$|R
