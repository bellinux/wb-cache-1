This inhibitory structure is called a pseudosubstrate and specific regulators are required to remove it from the active site to allow substrates <b>access.</b> <b>Removal</b> of the pseudosubstrate sequence {{from members of the}} myosin light-chain kinase subfamily, including twitchin kinase, activates them but it is not known whether the pseudosubstrate sequence binds to the active site. Native twitchin is a 753 K protein (6, 839 residues) located in muscle A-bands of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and because of its size has not been easy to study. We have determined the crystal structure, refined to 2. 8 Å resolution, of a recombinant fragment (residues 5, 890 to 6, 262) of twitchin kinase that contains the catalytic core and a 60 residue carboxy-terminal tail. The C-terminal tail extends through the active site, wedged between the small and large lobes of the structure and making extensive contacts with the catalytic core which accounts for autoinhibition and provides direct support for the intrasteric mechanism of protein kinase regulation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} tariffs, domestic taxes, and regulatory requirements pose on access to essential drugs, vaccines and devices for the diseases that afflict the developing world. While aid has increased {{in recent years and}} the price of many drugs has fallen, access to medicines, vaccines and devices has not increased greatly. There are numerous reasons for this, notably the paucity of medical professionals in the poorest countries. The major one discussed in this paper is the barrier imposed by recipient countries themselves. For example the combined domestic tax and import tariff barrier in India until recently was over 60 % and in Morocco it currently stands at 38 %. Only just over a third of Indians have access to essential drugs and it is likely that a reduction of these financial impediments would increase <b>access.</b> <b>Removal</b> of these barriers would therefore likely save thousands of lives across the developing world. Southern African countries generally have fewer tariff barriers. But if South Africa removed its 14 % sales tax, HIV patients could afford more food, and many are currently malnourished. Furthermore, many Southern African countries, such as Namibia, impose regulatory constraints (expensive and time consuming registration of products already approved in US/EU), which reduce access to essential medicines.

40|$|Background. Because of its ease of dosing, {{vancomycin}} {{is commonly}} used to treat methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. Clinical outcomes re-sulting from such a therapeutic strategy have not been well defined. Methods. We prospectively identified patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis who received a diagnosis of MSSA bacteremia. Clinical outcomes were grouped according to the predominant antibiotic received during their therapy (vancomycin or a first-generation cephalosporin [cefazolin]). Treatment failure (defined as death or recurrent infection) was determined at 12 weeks after the initial positive blood culture results. A multivariable {{analysis was used to}} adjust for confounders. Results. During an 84 -month period, 123 hemodialysis-dependent patients with MSSA bacteremia were iden-tified. Patients receiving vancomycin () tended to be younger (51 vs. 57 years;) and had a lowernp 77 Pp. 06 rates of metastatic complications at presentation (11. 7 % vs. 36. 7 %;) than did those receiving cefazolinPp. 001 ().

40|$|Software {{transactional}} memory (STM) is {{a promising}} programming paradigm for shared memory multithreaded programs. In order for STMs {{to be adopted}} widely for performance critical software, understanding and improving the cache performance of applications running on STM becomes increasingly crucial, as the performance gap between processor and memory continues to grow. In this paper, we present the most detailed experimental evaluation to date, of the cache behavior of STM applications and quantify {{the impact of the}} different STM factors on the cache misses experienced by the applications. We find that STMs are not cache friendly, with the data cache stall cycles contributing to more than 50 % of the execution cycles in a majority of the benchmarks. We find that on an average, misses occurring inside the STM account for 62 % of total data cache miss latency cycles experienced by the applications and the cache performance is impacted adversely due to certain inherent characteristics of the STM itself. The above observations motivate us to propose a set of specific compiler transformations targeted at making the STMs cache friendly. We find that STM's fine grained and application unaware locking is a major contributor to its poor cache behavior. Hence we propose selective Lock Data co-location (LDC) and Redundant Lock <b>Access</b> <b>Removal</b> (RLAR) to address the lock access misses. We find that even transactions that are completely disjoint access parallel, suffer from costly coherence misses caused by the centralized global time stamp updates and hence we propose the Selective Per-Partition Time Stamp (SPTS) transformation to address this. We show that our transformations are effective in improving the cache behavior of STM applications by reducing the data cache miss latency by 20. 15 % to 37. 14 % and improving execution time by 18. 32 % to 33. 12 % in five of the 8 STAMP applications...|$|E

We observe that while the older top-down scheduler provides a better starting point in terms of clock cycles than new bottom-up scheduler implementation, the difference narrows when bypassing is enabled, and overall, in terms of register file <b>accesses,</b> connectivity <b>removal,</b> and instruction width, the novel algorithm performs better.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Presented in {{this paper}} is an {{approach}} to realtime spatial reasoning for manipulative robotic tasks. When a service robot is requested to manipulate an object, it should determine the directions along which it can access and remove the object. The potential accessible directions for the object are retrieved from the object database. Then, spatial reasoning with the surrounding environment and the gripper geometry is invoked to verify the directions. The verification process mainly utilizes the visibility test of the commodity graphics hardware. Then, the directions along which both of the object and gripper are translated without colliding with the surrounding obstacles are computed using Minkowski sum and cube map of the graphics hardware. The <b>access</b> and <b>removal</b> directions are passed to the potential field path planning algorithm to determine the robot arm’s full path for accessing, removing and delivering the object. The experimental results show the feasibility of using graphics hardware for manipulative robotic tasks and further its performance gain in real-time manipulation.
