5|$|The M19 was {{developed}} from the T65 {{which was based on}} the M5 light tank chassis. The original design was improved upon and designated the T65E1. It was accepted into service in May 1944 as the M19 MGMC, equipping several U.S. Army anti-aircraft units during World War II. The M19A1 was an improved variant with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> and spare barrels for the 40mm Bofors guns.|$|E
5|$|The T65E1 was {{accepted}} into service as the M19 Gun Motor Carriage in May 1944 with {{an order for}} 904 production models, which was sent to Cadillac. Production did not start until August of that year, and only 285 were produced {{by the end of}} the war. The M19A1 had an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> and generator to operate the 40mm guns when the main engine was shut down, and fixtures for carrying two spare gun barrels.|$|E
50|$|In the Fell locomotive, {{however, the}} four main drive engines {{received}} their charge from Roots blowers driven by two further <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> which were governed such {{that when the}} traction power demand was more than minimal, they operated at essentially a constant speed. Since a Roots blower is a positive-displacement device, {{this meant that the}} mass flow rate at which charge was delivered to the main engines depended not on the speed of the main engines but on that of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines,</b> so the power output of the main engines was essentially defined by the speed of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

25|$|Result was {{operated}} by the Ashburner company until 1909, when she was sold for £1,100 to Capt. Henry Clarke of Braunton, North Devon. In March 1914 a 45bhp single-cylinder Kromhout <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> was fitted.|$|E
25|$|The fishing schooner, Elizabeth W. Hunan, was {{the last}} of a series of five vessels built for the Nunan family, which ran a fishing {{enterprise}} out of Cape Porpoise, Maine. The 96-foot auxiliary powered vessel was launched in 1908 and reportedly was in service for 30 years. It had an 80-horsepower Globe <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> which could propel her at 9 miles per hour.|$|E

25|$|A further {{innovation}} in diesel electric propulsion {{which might be}} considered for the Collins-class replacement is Air Independent Propulsion, which is not operated in the existing Collins-class, but is operated {{in a number of}} more recent submarine designs including the German Type 214, Japanese Sōryū-class, and French Scorpène-class. Air independent propulsion performs the role of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine,</b> providing submarines with increased stealth by allowing them to operate submerged for longer. The German Type 214 submarine employs advanced polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells that assist in delivering it comparable range and endurance to the Collins-class.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the changes were internal. While the module-based design of the engine room, pioneered by the SA-15 class ships, reduced the amount of working hours while building the ship, the piping was completely redesigned to reduce its overall length and make basic maintenance easier. The fifth <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> was also left out as it was rarely used in actual operation. Winterization was improved by installing heating elements in the double bottom tanks, improving the heating in other ballast water tanks and increasing ice strengthening {{in some parts of}} the hull.|$|E
25|$|New Mill is a four-storey smock mill on a two-storey brick {{base with}} an {{attached}} miller's cottage. It has four patent sails {{carried on a}} cast-iron windshaft. It drives four pairs of millstones by wind, with a fifth pair powered by an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine.</b> This was a steam engine until 1911, then an oil engine and latterly an electric motor. The Brake Wheel is of composite construction, with an iron centre and wooden rim. This drives a cast-iron Wallower on the Upright Shaft, which carries a cast-iron Great Spur Wheel, which drives the millstones overdrift.|$|E
25|$|Holes in {{the deck}} plating, {{crystallized}} valves and decrepit <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> augured an expensive refit {{as well as}} conversion.|$|R
50|$|Petrol-paraffin engines were {{traditionally}} {{found in}} motor boats, fishing vessels, small tractors, light railway locomotives, and stationary <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines,</b> {{but not in}} cars or motorcycles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{as-built}} engine specifications {{were two}} BuEng-built, MAN-designed direct-drive 10-cylinder 4-cycle main diesel engines, [...] each, with two BuEng MAN 4-cycle 6-cylinder <b>auxiliary</b> diesel <b>engines,</b> [...] each, driving [...] electrical generators. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> were for charging batteries or for increased surface speed via a diesel-electric system providing {{power to the}} main electric motors.|$|R
25|$|After the war, she was {{disarmed}} {{and returned}} to Halls of Arklow. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> remained. By now large steamers were more profitable than sailing ships for ocean voyages. However, within Ireland transport was becoming more difficult. The neglect of the networks during World War I was compounded by destruction during the war of independence and the subsequent civil war. It was more cost-effective to transport goods by sea around the coast rather than using internal road or rail. Cymric had a new career: transporting malt from ports such as Ballinacurra, New Ross and Wexford to Dublin.|$|E
25|$|Holton Mill {{was built}} in 1749 by John Swann. It was owned by William Fiske until he died in 1761, and was then {{purchased}} by Brame Oxford. When he was declared bankrupt in 1781 the mill was acquired by James Tillot. It then passed to John Tillot, who died in 1835. The mill was then put up for auction, and was {{for the first time}} described as having a roundhouse. It was bought by Samuel Wilkinson, a miller from Blythburgh. Wilkinson sold the mill to John Youngs of Wenhaston in 1851. Youngs died in 1861 and the mill was sold to Andrew Johnstone of Holton Hall. He in turn sold it to Thomas Buxton in 1863. The mill was again for sale in 1886. An engine shed indicated that an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> was employed at that time. The mill was last worked in 1910. The mill was then largely stripped of machinery and used as a summer house. A fantail was added about this time.|$|E
25|$|If {{designed}} {{strictly to}} deliver the performance required by the original specification, the interceptor would {{have been forced to}} glide back to ground from heights of up to 100,000ft (30,500m), perform an unpowered landing many miles away, after which it would then have to be recovered and taken back to the airfield by ground vehicle. Revised specifications from the Ministry were issued to Avro and Saunders-Roe, under which the auxiliary turbojet engine had become an official and explicitly-stated requirement. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> was required to provide sufficient power to allow the interceptor to fly back to its base {{in the aftermath of a}} combat mission. On 12 December 1952, further refinement of the rocket interceptor concept had led to the release of the defined Specification OR 337. The changes contained within the defined specification mainly revolved around armament changes, such as the adoption of the Blue Jay (as it was codenamed at the time) infrared-guided air-to-air missile under development, which replaced the originally-envisaged retractable battery of 2-inch rockets.|$|E
5000|$|The engine {{specifications}} {{were two}} BuEng-built, MAN-designed direct-drive 6-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engines, [...] each, with two BuEng MAN 4-cycle 6-cylinder <b>auxiliary</b> diesel <b>engines,</b> [...] each, driving [...] electrical generators. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> were for charging batteries or for increased surface speed via a diesel-electric system providing {{power to the}} main electric motors. Unusually for the V-boats, Dolphins engines were never replaced.|$|R
50|$|José Mercader, the manufacturer, {{had begun}} {{building}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> to install on bicycles. With this experience, he created Construcciones Ferrusola SA in 1953, {{to undertake the}} manufacture of motorcycles in Madrid.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2016, Wärtsilä’s {{market share}} in marine medium-speed main engines was 51% and in <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> 18%. Wärtsilä’s market share for gas and liquid fuel power plants was 13%.|$|R
500|$|The {{ground floor}} of the mill is the meal floor. It is where the freshly ground flour is {{delivered}} for bagging up. The wooden great spur wheel, located {{at the bottom of}} the extended upright shaft and stone nuts are located on this floor. The great spur wheel has been converted from compass arm construction to clasp arm construction. A third pair of [...] diameter French Burr millstones is located on a hurst frame, driven by the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> via a fast and loose pulley.|$|E
500|$|They {{measured}} [...] in length, with {{a beam of}} [...] and {{a normal}} draught of [...] Their standard displacement was , {{and they had a}} crew of five. They used two Thornycroft petrol engines driving two propeller shafts. The engines were rated at , and were designed to reach a top speed of , although a speed of [...] was achieved during sea trials in 1927. They carried [...] of fuel. They were equipped with two [...] torpedo tubes, two Lewis machine guns and up to four depth charges. An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> of unknown rating was installed for cruising.|$|E
500|$|Other work {{undertaken}} by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A [...] Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base {{with the aid of}} a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary.|$|E

500|$|Gunnel was {{deployed}} {{as part of}} the November 1942 {{invasion of}} French North Africa. Operating conditions for the five submarines sent there were not favorable, due to overcrowded waters, poor weather, and mixed-up signals, and the deployment had no accomplishments. Like many other U.S. submarines, Gunnel was attacked in error by friendly aircraft. The Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (H.O.R.) diesels (known as [...] "whores") which powered Gunnel were troublesome; at one point while returning home, drive gears of all four of the main engines were out of commission, and McCain's crew had to rely on their tiny <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> for the last [...] Gunnel went into the navy yard for an extensive refit and was replaced on patrol station off North Africa by [...] "Pilly" [...] Lent's [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} rigged as a three-masted schooner, {{with a total}} sail area of [...] Its <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> of 220horse-power was capable of speeds up to [...] However, speed and sailing qualities were {{secondary}} to the requirement of providing a safe and warm stronghold for Nansen and his crew during a drift that might extend for several years, so particular {{attention was paid to}} the insulation of the living quarters. At around 400gross register tonnage, the ship was considerably larger than Nansen had first anticipated, with an overall length of [...] and a breadth of , a ratio of just over three to one, giving her an unusually stubby appearance. This odd shape was explained by Archer: [...] "A ship that is built with exclusive regard to its suitability for [...] object must differ essentially from any known vessel." [...] On 6 October 1892, at Archer's yard at Larvik, the ship was launched by Nansen's wife Eva after a brief ceremony. The ship was named Fram, meaning [...] "Forward".|$|E
500|$|In March 1921, Shackleton renamed his {{expedition}} vessel Quest. She {{was a small}} ship, 125tons {{according to}} Huntford, with sail and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engine</b> power purportedly capable of making eight knots, but in fact rarely making more than five-and-a-half. Huntford describes her as [...] "straight-stemmed", with an awkward square rig, and a tendency to wallow in heavy seas. Fisher reports that she was built in 1917, weighed 204tons, and had a large and spacious deck. Although she had some modern facilities, such as electric lights in the cabins, she was unsuited to long oceanic voyages; Shackleton, {{on the first day}} out, observed that [...] "in no way are we shipshape or fitted to ignore even the mildest storm". Leif Mills, in his biography of Frank Wild, says that had the ship been taken to the Beaufort Sea in accordance with Shackleton's original plans, she would probably have been crushed in the Arctic pack ice. On her voyage south she suffered frequent damage and breakdowns, requiring repairs at every port of call.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the chain}} steamers without their own <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> had {{different}} gearing for moving upstream and downstream. When travelling upstream, it was designed for higher traction; when travelling downstream it was engineered for faster speed.|$|R
25|$|The ship is {{fitted with}} two MTU 20V8000M71L plants in an anti-gas {{operational}} mode, two MTU 12V4000 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> for driving {{the two main}} electrical generators and another Diesel engine by MAN which powers the emergency generator.|$|R
50|$|Prince David was {{suffering}} from neglect, with a badly fouled hull, rotten deck planks and bulkheads rusted thin. Holes in the deck plating, crystallized valves and decrepit <b>auxiliary</b> <b>engines</b> augured an expensive refit as well as conversion.|$|R
