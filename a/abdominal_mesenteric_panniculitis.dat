40|$|Abstract Background <b>Mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis</b> {{is a rare}} chronic fibrosing {{inflammatory}} disease that typically affects the adipose tissue and mesentery of the small intestine but may also affect the mesosigmoid and the mesocolon. The pathology of this disease remains unclear despite association with some malignancies or inflammatory disorders. We report a case of mesocolic panniculitis and a literature review of its clinical presentation, imaging findings, associated conditions and treatment options. Case presentation A 64 [*]year-old Caucasian man {{was admitted to the}} gastroenterology department for severe weakness, left lower quadrant abdominal pain, weight loss and diarrhoea. Physical examination revealed a palpable firm mass occupying the entire left part of the abdomen. Abdominal CT-scan showed fatty infiltration of the mesosigmoid and left mesocolic fat which was strongly suggestive of panniculitis. Laparoscopic surgery revealed an inflamed and edematous mesocolon and mesosigmoid; the sigmoid mucosa appeared petechial which was suggestive of venous ischemia. Histological examination of surgical biopsies revealed mesocolic panniculitis. Despite exhaustive investigation, no associated conditions were found and the cause was classified as idiopathic. Surprisingly, the patient clinically improved without therapeutic intervention other than supportive care. Conclusion Although <b>mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis</b> is most often a radiographic diagnosis without clinical symptomatology, it can also present with significant general status alteration. We report a case of mesocolic panniculitis complicated by development of an inflammatory mass associated with ischemic colitis. <b>Mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis</b> is a difficult diagnosis to make which typically requires histologic confirmation.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis</b> of the {{sigmoid colon}} {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} in surgical practice. The aim {{of this article is}} to present a case of <b>mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis</b> of the sigmoid colon and a short review of the literature. Case presentation We reviewed the hospital record of a 63 -year-old man who presented with a palpable mass in the left abdomen and clinical signs of a partial bowel obstruction. The pre-operative impression was a possible cancer of the sigmoid colon. A laparotomy was performed through a midline incision. The mesentery was found to be markedly thickened, constricted and puckered. The normal architecture of the adipose tissue had been lost and replaced with an irregular nodular mass. The microscopic pathologic sections demonstrated a chronic reactive inflammatory process with an exuberant proliferation of fibroblasts and fibrocytes. The adipose tissue contained scattered areas of steatonecrosis with foci of lipid-laden macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The sigmoid colon and its mesocolon were resected. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged in good condition, and followed up for the next two years. Conclusion <b>Mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis</b> of sigmoid is an extremely rare entity of unknown origin in which the normal architecture of the mesentery is replaced by fibrosis, necrosis and calcification. On gross examination the alterations may be mistaken for a neoplastic process. A frozen section may be necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis.

40|$|First {{observed}} during an autopsy by Simpson in 1867 {{as a cause}} of hydronephrosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis became a medical topic after the detailed report of two cases by Ormond in 1948. Initially considered to be chiefly an urological disease, it appeared progressively that it could possibly be a systemic disease because of its occasional association with inflammatory fibrosing processes in other sites of the body or with clinical and biological manifestations of hypersensitivity or autoimmunity. <b>Mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis</b> and <b>mesenteric</b> fibrosis may occur independently or, occasionally, in association with retroperitoneal fibrosis. One third of the cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis can be attributed to specific causes. That the other cases (idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis) could be manifestations of an immunological (systemic) process with vasculitis is generally accepted. The authors present a survey of the various possible morphological aspects of the disease and a review of its aetiopathogenesis. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is usually characterized by an overproduction of fibro-inflammatory tissue; however in few cases as well as in <b>mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis,</b> extensive development of fatty tissue may also occur.

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of fat-containing lesions that can arise in the {{intraperitoneal}} cavity and retroperitoneal space. Some of these fat-containing lesions, such as liposarcoma and retroperitoneal teratoma, have to be resected, although resection can be deferred for others, such as adrenal adenoma, myelolipoma, angiomyolipoma, ovarian teratoma, and lipoma, until the lesions become large or symptomatic. The third group tumors (i. e., <b>mesenteric</b> <b>panniculitis</b> and pseudolipoma of Glisson's capsule) require medical treatment or no treatment at all. Identifying factors such as whether the fat is macroscopic or microscopic within the lesion, the origin of the lesions, and the presence of combined calcification is important for narrowing the differential diagnosis. The development and wide-spread use of modern imaging modalities make identification of these factors easier so narrowing the differential diagnosis is possible. At the same time, lesions that do not require immediate treatment are being incidentally found at an increasing rate with these same imaging techniques. Thus, the questions about the treatment methods have become increasingly important. Classifying lesions in terms of the necessity of performing surgical treatment can provide important information to clinicians, and this is the one of a radiologist's key responsibilities...|$|R

The aims of this study were to determine whether any correlation could be found between the radiological findings and the clinical disease course. Methods: Patients observed due to idiopathic inflammation of the mesentery were identified. If SM could be verified histologically or MP radiologically, the patients were included in this descriptive retro perspective study. Results: Typical radiological changes were observed in 27 patients. A majority (23 / 27) of these patients had mild to moderate symptoms. This group with typical radiology was labelled MP. Four patients were included due to histologically verified disease but had uncharacteristic radiology involving multiple compartments of the abdomen. All four had marked systemic inflammation, fever and fluctuating radiologic findings.
