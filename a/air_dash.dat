5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an <b>air</b> <b>dash,</b> allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.|$|E

5000|$|Like the Mega Man series, Azure Striker Gunvolt is a side-scrolling action {{platform}} game. The player {{controls the}} eponymous Gunvolt, {{who is able}} to jump, dash, and utilize a gun with special bullets that [...] "tag" [...] their targets, which grants a homing effect to Gunvolt's electric fields. The player's actions are limited by an energy bar, which depletes when using the electrical field, using additional movement abilities such as double-jumping or <b>air</b> <b>dashing,</b> or being hit by enemies.|$|R

Four out of the 23 {{passengers}} on board died; the four crew members survived.

50|$|The game {{is entirely}} local {{multiplayer}} and each player controls their own anthropomorphic bird samurai character. The world is purely made {{of black and}} white parts, allowing characters to hide in plain sight due to their solid black and white colors. Players can also throw a single throwing star (which colors the enemy and makes them visible), and also <b>air</b> <b>dash.</b> One hit by the player's kendo stick results in the enemy character's death, similar to Bushido Blade. By pressing L2, the character's eyes can be squinted or closed to prevent screen-watching.|$|E

50|$|Players {{can also}} choose between {{original}} and remix {{options for the}} gameplay. Remix mode makes many changes to the game's control and mechanics, but does not impact level design or content. Some of these changes, like the new attacking and dodging controls, <b>air</b> <b>dashing,</b> and <b>air</b> recoveries, were modeled after Treasure's own Bleach: The Blade of Fate, a fighting game that likewise features elements of Guardian Heroes. The script for Story Mode has been rewritten and contains updated dialogue as well as changes in name to the Earth and Sky Spirits, who are {{now known as the}} Earthblood and the Skyborn, respectively.|$|R

50|$|Dash rescues Assaf and Verti {{from the}} sophomore level library, and Verti figures {{out that they}} can swim through the {{seawater}} by breathing trapped pockets of <b>air.</b> <b>Dash</b> nearly drowns, but is rescued by Lunch Lady Lorraine. At the junior level floor, the teachers are trying to bring surviving kids in line. It takes Lorraine to calm down a riot; she further shows her survival skills by saving Verti {{from a group of}} drug dealing students. The trio plus Lorraine and Mary decide {{to make it to the}} roof, but no one else wants to follow them. At the senior level floor, they find Brent Daniels organizing a hostile cult around him. They then find Grimm, who admits to the forgery. Grimm points out that they can scale to the roof using the back of the auditorium bleachers, and then sacrifices his life to open the bleachers up. The five friends reach the roof just as rescue helicopters arrive. Lorraine rescues a handful of other students while some others escape using a makeshift raft. Dash and Assaf vow to write a book about the disaster.|$|E
5000|$|In Sigma 2, besides her unlockable single-player {{chapter in}} the story mode, Momiji is also {{available}} for co-op multiplayer gameplay on 30 special missions, as well as additional Tag Mission and Ninja Race mode in Sigma 2 Plus. She is an acrobatic character with a unique double jump ability, and can attack enemies from the air. According to GameSpot, Momiji in Sigma 2 [...] "plays similarly to Ryu and is just as fast and formidable with a blade. She's able to leap through the <b>air,</b> <b>dash,</b> slice, dice, and more, with similar physics to Ryu" [...] and a similar control system. Between her, Ryu and Ayane, Momiji the slowest but strongest with her naginata, which has the best height and reach. According to 1UP.com, [...] "Momiji's reach is her biggest advantage, and the Naginata deals insane damage to her enemies," [...] allowing to [...] "kill them quickly and efficiently" [...] from a safe distance. A drawback to this is [...] "her raw strength and long range are balanced by her slow mobility." [...] GamesRadar called her [...] "actually the middle-ground character. Wielding a naginata halberd, Momiji’s combos require more skill, but {{she does have a}} number of one-hit kill techniques." [...] Despite Momiji's use of bow and arrows, PC Magazine opined that a particular problem with Momiji in the game is that she has [...] "no effective quick projectile," [...] and so the players have [...] "to rely on her jumping abilities and Ultimate Techniques to create some breathing room." [...] Momiji's breasts in the game can be manipulated with the motion sensor of the Sixaxis controller.|$|E

50|$|The game uses a four-button {{fighting}} system: {{a button}} each for light, medium, heavy, and magic attacks, and will include staple fighting game maneuvers such as launchers, pushblocks, and cross-ups. There will be six playable characters - Arizona the cow, Velvet the reindeer, Paprika the alpaca, Oleander the unicorn, Pom the sheep and Tianhuo the longma - each with different fighting move sets and unique movement options such as flight, short hops, double jumps, or <b>air</b> <b>dashes,</b> and a seventh boss character. A seventh playable character, a yet-to-be-named goat, {{will also be}} available following the game's launch, due to the crowd funding campaign reaching its stretch goals. The game will support both local and online multiplayer via a near-isometric pixel art lobby system.|$|R

60|$|IT was {{an awful}} sight to behold! When the Remora heard {{the name of the}} Firedrake, his hated enemy, he slipped with {{wonderful}} speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley. On and on and on he poured over rock and tree, as if a frozen river could slide downhill; on and on, till there were miles of him stretching along the valley--miles of the smooth-ribbed, icy creature, crawling and slipping forwards. The green trees dropped their leaves as he advanced; the birds fell down dead from the sky, slain by his frosty breath! But, fast as the Remora stole forward, the Firedrake came quicker yet, flying and clashing his fiery wings. At last they were within striking distance; and the Firedrake, stooping from the <b>air,</b> <b>dashed</b> with his burning horns and flaming feet slap into the body of the Remora.|$|R
