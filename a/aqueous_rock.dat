40|$|Clay mineral-bearing {{deposits}} previously {{discovered on}} Mars with near infrared (λ = 0. 3 - 5 μm) remote sensing data are of major significance {{for understanding the}} aqueous history, geological evolution, and past habitability of Mars. In this study, we analyzed the thermal infrared (λ = 6 - 35 μm) surface properties of the most extensive phyllosilicate deposit on Mars: the Mawrth Vallis area. Clay mineral-bearing units, which in visible images appear to be relatively light-toned, layered bedrock, have thermal inertia values ranging from 150 to 460 J m- 2 K- 1 s- 1 / 2. This suggests the deposits are composed of a mixture of rock with sand and dust at 100 -meter scales. Dark-toned materials that mantle the clay-bearing surfaces have thermal inertia values ranging from 150 to 800, indicating variable degrees of rockiness or induration of this younger sedimentary or pyroclastic unit. Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) spectra of the light-toned rocks were analyzed {{with a number of}} techniques, but none of the results shows a large phyllosilicate component as has been detected in the same surfaces with near-infrared data. Instead, TES spectra of light-toned surfaces are best modeled by a combination of plagioclase feldspar, high-silica materials (similar to impure opaline silica or felsic glass), and zeolites. We propose three hypotheses for why the clay minerals are not apparent in thermal infrared data, including effects due to surface roughness, sub-pixel mixing of multiple surface temperatures, and low absolute mineral abundances combined with differences in spatial sampling between instruments. Zeolites modeled in TES spectra could be a previously unrecognized component of the alteration assemblage in the phyllosilicate-bearing rocks of the Mawrth Vallis area. TES spectral index mapping suggests that (Fe/Mg) -clays detected with near infrared data correspond to trioctahedral (Fe 2 +) clay minerals rather than nontronite-like clays.

Sapphirine appeared during a {{second stage of}} prograde mineral growth which produced nodular structures and intergrowths involving spinel, corundum, and sillimanite, pseudomorphing an earlier generation of coarse, amphibolite facies minerals. A third generation of coarse, cross-cutting, mainly hydrous minerals (gedrite, kornerupine, phlogopite) is sporadically developed. The wide variety of cofacial mineral assemblages allows the delineation of the stable mineral associations of sapphirine in the system K 2 O-MgO-FeO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -H 2 O under P-T conditions independently estimated at about 5 kb, 750 - 800 °C. The natural assemblages provide constraints which, taken together with existing thermodynamic and experimental data, allow the estimation of P-T slopes of sapphirine equilibria. The mineral textures thus indicate sapphirine growth under increasing T, decreasing a(H 2 O), and constant or slightly increasing P.

These local breccias are similar in non-volatile-element composition to breccias investigated elsewhere on the rim. Rocks within the red zone are like those on either side in texture, but have higher Al, Si and Ge, and lower S, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn as compared to rocks on either side. The valley-head rocks have higher S than most Endeavour rim breccias, while red zone rocks are like those latter breccias in S.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} field {{measurements}} and hydraulic, oxygen transport and geochemical speciation modeling undertaken {{to evaluate the}} performance of a sand-bentonite test cover overlying a 20 % sloping waste rock platform. A pit run (gravelly sand) layer protected the sand-bentonite layer. The study site was the Whistle Mine near Capreol, Ontario, Canada. The {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate a number of test covers and select a final cover for the decommissioning of 7 million tonnes of acid-generating waste rock at the site. The sand-bentonite test plot and a control plot consisting of waste rock without cover were monitored over 3 years for water content, suction, soil temperature, gaseous oxygen concentrations, and water percola-tion. Air temperature, rainfall, snow pack and poten-tial evaporation were also monitored. Finite element modeling showed very good agreement between modeled and measured cumulative precipitation, daily potential evaporation and cumulative evaporation, and to a lesser extent, the cumulative water percolation through the test cover. Due to construction difficulties in the field, the back of the waste rock platform was not covered with the test cover. This resulted in oxygen ingress from the back side of the waste rock. Oxygen transport modeling showed that if the entire waste rock pile had been covered, the daily oxygen flux would have been reduced by 90 % to only 0. 003 g/m 2 /day. Such low oxygen flux would mini-mize sulphide oxidation and hence acid generation in the waste <b>rock.</b> <b>Aqueous</b> equilibrium speciation modeling suggested that the concentrations of sul-phate SO 24, iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) in per-colate water in contact with waste rock were controlled by secondary minerals such as gypsum, alunite, and ferrihydrite...|$|R

40|$|Generic hydrochemical {{modelling}} of a grantoid-groundwater system, {{using the}} Russian software "HydroGeo", {{has been carried}} out with an emphasis on simulating the accumulation of uranium in the aqueous phase. The baseline model run simulates shallow granitoid aquifers (U content 5  ppm) under conditions broadly representative of southern Norway and southwestern Siberia: i. e. temperature 10  °C, equilibrated with a soil gas partial CO 2 pressure (PCO 2, open system) of 10 (- 2. 5) atm. and a mildly oxidising redox environment (Eh = + 50  mV). Modelling indicates that aqueous uranium accumulates in parallel with total dissolved solids (or groundwater mineralisation M - regarded as an indicator of degree of hydrochemical evolution), accumulating most rapidly when M =  550 - 1000  mg L(- 1). Accumulation slows at the onset of saturation and precipitation of secondary uranium minerals at M = c. 1000  mg L(- 1) (which, under baseline modelling conditions, also corresponds approximately to calcite saturation and transition to Na-HCO 3 hydrofacies). The secondary minerals are typically "black" uranium oxides of mixed oxidation state (e. g. U 3 O 7 and U 4 O 9). For rock U content of 5 - 50  ppm, it is possible to generate a wide variety of aqueous uranium concentrations, up to a maximum of just over 1  mg L(- 1), but with typical concentrations of up to 10  μg L(- 1) for modest degrees of hydrochemical maturity (as indicated by M). These observations correspond extremely well with real groundwater analyses from the Altai-Sayan region of Russia and Norwegian crystalline bedrock aquifers. The timing (with respect to M) and degree of aqueous uranium accumulation are also sensitive to Eh (greater mobilisation at higher Eh), uranium content of <b>rocks</b> (<b>aqueous</b> concentration increases as rock content increases) and PCO 2 (low PCO 2 favours higher pH, rapid accumulation of aqueous U and earlier saturation with respect to uranium minerals) ...|$|R

40|$|Investigation of the geochemical and mineralogical {{composition}} of the Martian surface provides insight into the geologic history of the predominantly basaltic crust. The Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument onboard the Curiosity rover has returned the first X-Ray diffraction data from the Martian surface. However, large proportions (27 +/- 14 with some estimates as high as 50 weight percentage) of an amorphous component have been reported. As a remedy to this problem, mass balance equations using geochemistry, volatile chemistry, and mineralogy have been employed to constrain the geochemistry of the amorphous component. However, "the nature and number of amorphous phases that constitute the amorphous component is not unequivocally known". Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain {{the origin of this}} amorphous component: Allophane (Al 2 O); Basaltic glass (Volcanic and impact); Palagonite (Altered basaltic glass); Hisingerite (Fe (sup 3 plus) -bearing phyllosilicate); S/Cl-rich component (sulfates and/or akaganeite); Nanophase ferric oxide component (npOx). Establishing a multi-phase amorphous component from a basaltic precursor that has undergone physical and chemical weathering within geochemical constraints is of paramount importance to better understand the composition of {{a large portion of the}} Martian surface (up to 50 weight percentage). Shocked basalts from Lonar Crater in India are valuable analogs for the Martian surface because it is a well-preserved impact crater in a basaltic target. Having undergone pre- and post-shock <b>aqueous</b> alteration, these <b>rocks</b> provide crucial data regarding the effect of shock on the amorphous component in altered basalt. By conducting mass balance equations similar to what has been performed for Gale crater materials, we attempt to calculate the geochemistry of the amorphous component in altered basalts ranging from unshocked to Class 5 (Table 1). This has the potential to reveal the nature and origin (i. e. primary igneous, shock metamorphic, and/or aqueous alteration occurring before or after the impact event) of the amorphous component in shocked basalt with the goal of unravelling the history of the Martian surface...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBasins {{formed at}} magma-poor hyperextended margins that are partly floored by {{transitional}} crust exhibit a characteristic lithological assemblage including exhumed subcontinental mantle, basement slivers, syn-rift deep- marine basin sediments, coarse-grained sediments derived from pre-rift supracrustal rocks or basement, and minor mafic intrusives/volcanics. Such a lithological assemblage is preserved below the large crystalline nappes in South Norway, including the Jotun, Upper Bergsdalen, and Lindås nappe complexes and comprises metapelites, metasandstones, metaconglomerates, solitary serpentinite bodies, detrital serpentinite-soapstone conglomerates, minor late Scandian intrusives, and thin discontinuous sheets of Proterozoic and Ordovician gneisses. This rock association, non-genetically {{referred to as}} “mélange”, can be traced almost seamlessly from Bergen to Otta and is interpreted to represent the vestiges of the pre-Caledonian magma-poor hyperextended margin of Baltica. This study focusses on the metamorphism and metasomatism of the metapelites and the serpentinites. The metamorphic mineral assemblage of the metapelites includes white mica, chlorite, biotite, plagioclase, and quartz {{as well as local}} garnet and amphibole. The ultramafics are to various degrees serpentinised, talcified, and carbonated. The metamorphic mineral assemblage of the serpentinites includes serpentine, olivine, talc, carbonates (magnesite, dolomite), magnetite, diopside. The majority of the olivine grains are markedly rich in Mg (Fo 0. 9 - 0. 98) and the diopside grains are rich in Ca and poor in Al, which suggests that both olivine and diopside are secondary (Enger 2016, Master’s thesis, UiO). Locally, olivine, diopside, and carbonate are replaced by serpentine. Talc-carbonate, actinolite-chlorite, and talc-chlorite schists were locally developed during blackwall alteration of the ultramafics and the country rocks. Peak metamorphic temperatures for the metapelites were estimated at approximately 500 ± 50 °C by the means of Raman spectroscopy of carbon-rich material (RSCM) and are remarkably consistent along strike of the mélange zone. Comparisons of the metamorphic mineral assemblage and the RSCM results with thermodynamic calculations that are based on realistic whole rock compositions of the metapelites indicate pressures of 5. 25 - 7. 25 kbar during Scandian thrusting. The lateral consistency of the metamorphism is furthermore indicated by the isotope composition of carbonates in the mélange. The δ 18 OCarb values of the partly carbonated serpentinites and the metasediments fall within a narrow range between + 11 and + 15. 5 ‰ (SMOW) whereas the δ 13 CCarb values fall into three groups: (1) + 1. 6 to + 0. 3 ‰ (PDB), (2) − 1. 8 to − 3. 9 ‰, and (3) − 6 to − 8. 6 ‰, irrespective of their textural setting, i. e. whether the carbonate is biogenic, vein material, or replacing serpentine minerals. The unit-wide homogenization of the δ 18 O values in a narrow range and the only locally occurring equilibration of the δ 13 C values suggest fluid-rock alteration with an externally derived, mostly aqueous fluid. During prograde metamorphism of metapelitic <b>rocks</b> <b>aqueous</b> metamorphic fluids are released by the formation of, e. g., biotite and garnet on the expense of chlorite and feldspar. Aqueous fluids are also released during the dehydration of serpentinite, e. g. by the breakdown of talc and serpentine minerals to form forsterite and orthopyroxene. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the metapelites may have released up to 4 wt% and the metaperidotites up to 9 wt% of aqueous fluids during prograde metamorphism. Minor amounts of carbonic fluids may have been produced by the decarbonation of the metapelites and the partially carbonated serpentinites. We suggest that the ultramafics were already mostly or fully serpentinised prior to Scandian thrusting and underwent prograde metamorphism and dehydration together with the metapelites. Fluid-rock interactions with metamorphic aqueous fluids homogenized unit-wide the δ 18 OCarb values and locally the δ 13 CCarb values. The shared Scandian metamorphic history demonstrates that the rocks of the mélange represent an almost seamless tectonic unit in the Caledonides of South Norway and were juxtaposed prior to the onset of Scandian thrusting most likely in the pre-Caledonian magma-poor hyperextended margin of Baltica...|$|R
