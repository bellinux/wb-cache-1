5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout.</b> Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout</b> usually {{resolves}} in {{five to seven}} days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout {{are at increased risk}} of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|Eyre {{returned}} to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 10 December 1826, and was almost immediately offered command of a squadron fitting out for Lisbon. The changes in climate had brought on an <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout,</b> and on being informed that as Sir Thomas Hardy's squadron {{was already on}} the spot, he was at liberty to refuse the offer. Eyre did so, and retired ashore. He appears to have had no further commands, and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1830. He had married Georgiana Cooke, the daughter of Sir George Cooke, 7th Baronet, at Doncaster on 1 November 1800, with whom he had a family of eight children, including two sons named George-Hardolf and William. Sir George Eyre died on 15 February 1839 at the rectory, Carlton, Derbyshire.|$|E

50|$|Colchicine is an {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale). It inhibits mitosis by inhibiting microtubule polymerization. While colchicine is not used to treat cancer in humans, {{it is commonly used}} to treat acute <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout.</b>|$|R
40|$|Oxametacin, a new non steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} compound, with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties {{comparable to}} those of indomethacin, has been claimed to be effective in treatment <b>of</b> acute <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout.</b> The present study comprises an investigation in 8 healthy volunteers of the effect on the endogenous uric acid clearance rate, of oxametacin administered alone or in combination with the conventional hypouricaemic agents benzbromarone or allopurinol. Whether given alone or in combination with these drugs, oxametacin failed to alter the clearance rate of endogenous uric acid. In view of its good tolerance and its possible efficacy in treatment <b>of</b> acute <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout,</b> the present data help to validate use of oxametacin in acute gout.

500|$|While {{historically}} it is {{not recommended}} to start allopurinol during an acute <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout,</b> this practice appears okay. Allopurinol blocks uric acid production, and is {{the most commonly used}} agent. Long term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones, although hypersensitivity occurs in a small number of individuals.|$|E

40|$|Since {{clotting}} factor abnormalities {{could contribute to}} the raised cardiovascular risk profile <b>of</b> patients with <b>gout,</b> this project was to assess possible changes in Factor VII and VIII. Levels of fibrinogen and of clotting Factor VII and VIII were measured in patients with clinical gout, both acute and chronic (intercritical) and were compared with those in healthy controls, closely matched for age and sex. Median levels of fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients with acute gout than in patients with intercritical gout (p = 0. 02) or controls (p = 0. 005). In view of the already raised thrombotic risk profile in gout patients as a group, it is reassuring that hyperfibrinogenaemia only seems to be present during acute <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout,</b> presumably as an acute phase response. It is unlikely, therefore, that the hyperfibrinogenaemia noted during acute <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout</b> contributes significantly to the chronically raised cardiovascular risk profile <b>of</b> long-term <b>gout</b> patients...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the effects of}} azapropazone and indomethacin plus allopurinol in the management <b>of</b> acute <b>gout</b> and hyperuricaemia. A group of 93 patients predominantly based in general practice were randomly allocated to the two treatment regimens (azapropazone (days 1 - 225) or indomethacin (1 - 28) followed by allopurinol (29 - 225)) on a double-blind double dummy basis. Azapropazone produced a substantial reduction in serum uric acid levels by day 4 compared with day 1 (P< 0. 002) and was superior to indomethacin with regard to recorded levels of serum uric acid at day 4 (P< 0. 01) and day 28 (P< 0. 05). From day 28 onwards allopurinol produced and azapropazone maintained similar reductions in serum uric acid. Both treatments rapidly controlled the initial acute <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout</b> and both produced side effects similar in frequency and nature. Fewer breakthrough <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout</b> occurred in the azapropazone group (12) than the indomethacin/allopurinol group (21) ...|$|R

[...] By the war's end, he had achieved the rank of captain. Between 1769 and 1771, he embraced the cause against the rebels during the Regulator Movement, commanding a local militia which participated in the Battle of Alamance (May 16, 1771).

500|$|Both Hańska and Balzac took ill {{after the}} wedding; she {{suffered}} from a severe <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout,</b> for which her doctor prescribed an unusual treatment: [...] "Every other day she has to thrust her feet {{into the body of}} a sucking-pig which has only just been slit open, because it is necessary that the entrails should be quivering." [...] She recovered, but he did not. They returned to Paris in late May, and his health improved slightly at the start of summer. By July, however, he was confined to his bed. Hańska nursed him constantly, as a stream of visitors– including the writers Victor Hugo and Henri Murger– came to pay their respects. When Balzac's vision started to give out, she began to act as his secretary, helping him with his writing.|$|E
500|$|Champollion was {{particularly}} {{captured by the}} array of important monuments and inscriptions at Thebes, and decided {{to spend as much}} time there as possible on the way back north. South of Thebes, the Isis sprang leak and nearly sank. Having lost many provisions and spent several days repairing the boat they continued south to Aswan where the boats had to be left, since they could not make it across the first Cataract. They traveled by small boats and camelback to Elephantine and Philae. At Philae, Champollion spent several days recovering from an <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>gout</b> brought on by the hard trip, and he also received letters from his wife and brother, both sent many months earlier. Champollion attributed their delay to Drovetti's ill will. They arrived at Abu Simbel on November 26, the site had been visited by Bankes and Belzoni in 1815 and 1817 respectively, but the sand that they had cleared from the entrance had now returned. On January 1, 1829, they reached Wadi Halfa and returned north. That day, Champollion composed a letter to M. Dacier stating that [...] "I am proud now, having followed the course of the Nile from its mouth to the second cataract, {{to have the right to}} announce to you that there is nothing to modify in our [...] "Letter on the Alphabet of the Hieroglyphs."
