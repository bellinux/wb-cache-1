25|$|After the {{internment}} camps were closed, Opler taught {{anthropology and}} sociology at various colleges, including Occidental, Stanford, Harvard, and Tulane from 1946 until 1952. In 1947, Marvin Opler submitted an <b>affidavit</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of {{the restoration of}} citizenship to three American citizens of Japanese ancestry who had renounced their citizenship at Tule Lake. In this affidavit, he stated that, rather than being acts of free will, it was coercion, duress, and mass compulsion that motivated many of the wartime renouncements of citizenship by Japanese Americans. At Tule Lake, he had observed many of the renouncement hearings.|$|E
500|$|Paramedics {{responding}} to the emergency call [...] "found the three residents’ calm behavior unusual; none was screaming or even helping direct the paramedics." [...] According to Ward's attorney, detectives who interrogated the three housemates {{on the night of}} the murder informed them that they were the main suspects in the case, and asked many sexually charged, accusatory questions. Three days after the murder, the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit of the D.C. police were called in, but unit head Sgt. Brett Parson declined to discuss the unit's involvement. Within two weeks of the murder, police publicly alleged that the crime scene had been tampered with. Investigators spent more than three weeks examining the townhouse in detail, [...] "removing flooring, pieces of walls, a chunk of staircase, the washing machine, even sink traps." [...] Allegations that the area around Wone's body had been cleaned were revealed in an <b>affidavit</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of a search warrant for homeowner Joseph Price's offices at the D.C. law firm of Arent Fox.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{armistice}} in November 1918, the war-related trials continued. The Socialist Party of America, like the IWW, had opposed the war, and {{had also been}} raided by federal authorities. Seven Socialist Party leaders, including Victor Berger, who was elected to Congress in November 1918, were indicted for alleged anti-war activities. The defendants were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it illegal [...] "to utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" [...] about the armed forces, the flag, the Constitution, or democracy. The defendants, who were mostly of German birth or descent, moved {{for a change of}} venue away from Landis's courtroom, alleging that Landis had stated on November 1, 1918, that [...] "f anybody has said anything about the Germans that is worse than I have said, I would like to hear it so I could use it myself." [...] Landis, however, examined the transcript of the trial in which the statement was supposedly made, failed to find it, declared the <b>affidavit</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of the motion [...] "perjurious", and denied the motion. While the jury was being selected, Berger was indicted on additional espionage charges for supposedly violating the law during an earlier, unsuccessful political campaign. At the conclusion of the case, Landis took an hour to dramatically charge the jury, emphasizing the secretive nature of conspiracies and pointing at the jury box as he noted, [...] "the country was then at war". At one point, Landis leapt out of his seat, twirled his chair around, then sat on its arm. Later in his charge, he lay prone upon the bench. The jury took less than a day to convict Congressman-elect Berger and his four remaining codefendants. Landis sentenced each defendant to twenty years in federal prison. Landis denied the defendants bail pending appeal; but they quickly obtained it from an appellate court judge. [...] The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declined to rule on the case itself, sending it on to the Supreme Court, which on January 31, 1921, overturned the convictions and sentences by a 6–3 vote, holding that Landis should have stepped aside once he was satisfied that the affidavit was legally sufficient, leaving it for another judge to decide whether it was actually true. Landis refused to comment on the Supreme Court's decision, which ordered a new trial. In 1922, charges against the defendants were dropped by the government.|$|E
25|$|The other {{theme of}} the book was that Kerry's four-month tour in Vietnam had been marked by cowardice under fire and fraudulently obtaining medals. In that regard, the book {{contained}} statements by some veterans of the Vietnam War who served with John Kerry on Swift Boats, several of whom executed <b>affidavits</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of their claims; these claims were repudiated by other veterans who served with Kerry and often were disproven by outside sources, including the Navy's official records.|$|R

Because of Iti's arrest and court case over the 'terror-raids' Ponifasio had to convince the New Zealand High Court to allow the detained Maori activist to travel on the 2008 tour. <b>Affidavits</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of MAU from international arts organisations had also been submitted as evidence to the High Court.

Hoover, the {{passenger}} who said Elwood had run down two passengers in the water, swore out an <b>affidavit</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of {{a warrant for}} the arrest of Captain Lee, claiming that Lee had threatened to kill him.

[...] He threatened to kill me, and kept his hand on his hip pocket. [...] He wanted me to go aboard his boat, where he said he had twenty-five men to testify that he had not run down any men in the water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walter Schuck, one of {{his junior}} officers, appealed to Reichskommissar Josef Terboven. On 12 January 1945 Terboven hand-delivered Schuck's <b>affidavit</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of Ehrler to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe. [...] Further {{investigations}} and testimonies indicated that the aircrews {{did not know that}} the Tirpitz had been moved to the new location at Håkøya a couple of weeks earlier, and Heinrich Ehrler was a convenient scapegoat for the failure to protect Tirpitz. The investigation concluded the reason for the failure was poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe. Ehrler was exonerated. [...] Shortly afterward, the Führer HQ announced Ehrler's release and return to front-line service, where he would have the chance to [...] "rehabilitate himself." [...] Ehrler's sentence was commuted and his loss of rank rescinded. He was reassigned to an Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter squadron in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Following that denial, Overland {{moved to}} [...] the search {{warrants}} {{that had been}} executed on Lazarus' home, vehicle and spaces she utilized at work, and suppress the evidence obtained from them. They were, he argued, based on stale information and did not sufficiently establish a nexus between the places searched {{and the likelihood of}} finding evidence there; Lazarus had not moved to her present residence, he observed, until 1994, eight years after the murder, and the <b>affidavit</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of the warrant did not provide any reason why evidence might be found there. At times the affidavit, Overland claimed, was even deceptive, with the submitting detective asserting that the murder weapon might be found there, when Nuttall and Barba had already theorized that Lazarus had reported it stolen two weeks after the murder and irretrievably disposed of it.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 {{attorneys}} for Dick, Williams and Tice petitioned for clemency from Virginia governor Mark Warner. Warner {{did not rule}} on the petition, and it was considered by his successor, Governor Tim Kaine. The claims of innocence were backed by several FBI agents as well as eleven of the jurors who initially convicted them. On August 6, 2009, Kaine granted a conditional pardon to Dick, Tice, and Williams, releasing them from prison while not erasing their convictions. Part of the conditional release states that the three men are required to register as sex offenders and felons. Eleven jurors in the original case submitted <b>affidavits</b> <b>in</b> <b>support</b> of the sailors' clemency request before the Virginia State Parole Board. The jurors stated that they believed the men were not guilty.|$|R
