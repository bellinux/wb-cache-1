5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|Though most {{same-sex}} couples seeking to marry {{are required to}} give three months notice (<b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for opposite-sex couples), {{same-sex couples}} already in a civil partnership are allowed {{to make use of}} a 5-day fast track provision in the legislation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E
50|$|Establishing {{the rule}} of God on earth {{does not mean that}} {{sovereignty}} is assigned to a particular group of people, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when <b>the</b> Church wielded power in Christian Europe, or that certain men become spokesmen for <b>the</b> gods, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> under theocratic rule.|$|R
2500|$|Not {{all sports}} use IBSA classifiers.

5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in most mimicry complexes.|$|E
5|$|All modern scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite. The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous, rather than solid <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the prehistoric order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{for most}} Brazilian {{football}} clubs, Atlético Mineiro's by-law defines the club as a not-for-profit public utility organization, formed by associates (sócios). The club's administrative powers are the General Assembly, the Deliberative Council, the Board, the Fiscal Council and the Ethics and Discipline Council. The General Assembly, composed of all associates, elects the Deliberative Council {{among its members}} every three years, which in turn elects and removes the club's Board, responsible for the executive management of the club. Season ticket-holders and participants of the Galo na Veia affiliation programme, called sócios-torcedores, are not full club associates and cannot vote or be elected.|$|E

25|$|Where land is {{registered}} under a Torrens {{title registration}} system or similar, special rules apply. It may <b>be</b> that <b>the</b> land cannot <b>be</b> affected by adverse possession (<b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in England and Wales from 1875 to 1926, and <b>as</b> <b>is</b> still <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in <b>the</b> state of Minnesota) or that special rules apply.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{for most}} Carcharhinus species, {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} finetooth shark's phylogenetic relationships have yielded variable results. In 1988, Leonard Compagno grouped this species with the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), blacktip shark (C. limbatus), graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and smooth tooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon), {{on the basis of}} morphological characters. Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found that the finetooth shark is the second-most basal member of the genus next to the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Mine Dosay-Akbulut's 2008 study, based on ribosomal DNA, suggested that the closest relative of the finetooth shark is the smalltail shark (C. porosus), and that the two species form a clade apart from other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with many}} castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – {{there is no record}} of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with many}} fortresses, Golubac's {{structure}} was modified over time. For years, {{there were only}} five towers. Later, four more were added. The towers were all built as squares, {{a sign of the}} fortress' age, showing that battles were still fought with cold steel. Once firearms came into use, the Turks fortified the western towers with cannon ports and polygonal or cylindrical reinforcements up to two metres thick. After the Hungarian raid in 1481, they added the final tower, complete with cannon embrasures and galleries.|$|E

5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{an admirer}} of the elegance and wit {{in the work of}} satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison of wax heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as an outlet for her desire to act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of protocol and ceremony whose cumulative effects ridicule the object of description, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. <b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E

5|$|E. coli {{can live}} {{on a wide variety}} of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide. Since many pathways in mixed-acid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, these pathways require the levels of hydrogen to be low, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when E. coli lives together with hydrogen-consuming organisms, such as methanogens or sulphate-reducing bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. <b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become {{the apex of the}} shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the writing}} {{continues}} onto the second {{side of a}} tablet {{at the point where}} it finishes off the first, so if the first side has an odd number of lines, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with tablets K, N, P, and Q, the second will start at the upper left-hand corner, and the direction of writing shifts to top to bottom.|$|E
50|$|For {{the sixth}} contest in Pittsburgh, the Yankees threw Whitey Ford against the Pirates' Bob Friend.

5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state Senate, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector {{and was a member}} of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E
5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E
