5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
25|$|In the {{language}} mode framework, language processing mechanisms and languages {{as a whole}} can be achieved to different extents. The relative activation state of language is called language mode, and it is influenced by many factors, such as the person spoken or listened to, users’ language proficiency, the nonlinguistic context and so on. Language users can be in a bilingual mode if they <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> other bilinguals or reading text with mixed languages. However, if they listen {{to someone who is}} monolingual or is just speaking one language, the activation state would switch to a more monolingual mode. Based on this model, the bilinguals' language mode depends on {{the language}} users' expectation and by language environment.|$|E
25|$|Searle's thought {{experiment}} {{begins with}} this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research {{has succeeded in}} constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all {{of the questions that}} the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> another Chinese-speaking human being.|$|E

500|$|Several {{witnesses}} were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution.

This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the Australian tour, both Leigh and Olivier were {{exhausted}} and ill, and he told a journalist, [...] "You may not know it, but you <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a couple of walking corpses." [...] Later he would comment that he [...] "lost Vivien" [...] in Australia, a reference to Leigh's affair with the Australian actor Peter Finch, whom the couple met during the tour. Shortly afterwards Finch moved to London, where Olivier auditioned him and put him under a long-term contract with Laurence Olivier Productions. Finch and Leigh's affair continued on and off for several years.|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} where the boys <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Chef, he leaves without {{answering}} the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, [...] "Dammit, children, why do I {{always have to be}} the one to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying to think of what is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says [...] "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, [...] "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 short film that was the precursor to South Park.|$|E

500|$|By 1948 Olivier was on {{the board}} of {{directors}} for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in Richard III and also performed with Leigh in The School for Scandal and The Skin of Our Teeth. The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to [...] "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had [...] "dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage". By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, [...] "You may not know it, but you <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a couple of walking corpses." [...] Later, he would observe that he [...] "lost Vivien" [...] in Australia.|$|E
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} levels {{was long and}} complicated. [...] It began {{with the creation of}} a general layout of the area to be built by designers. [...] They would pass this concept map to the artists, who added models to it, beginning with the largest objects and ending with small items such as individual pieces of furniture. After everything was put in place by the art team, designers took over again, inserting graphical enhancements, effects, and collision detection code. With a functional level, creatures, items, traps, and triggers were added last, then scripts were written for everything to control behavior. The team found it quite difficult to keep track of changes made to levels, and there were sometimes communication problems between different parts of the team, such as the artists and designers, resulting in inconsistencies between their work. Ray Muzyka, the co-executive producer, wrote, [...] "We learned to make sure all elements of the team <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> each other and working as a group, rather than as a bunch of individuals!" [...] They did feel they had done a good job automating the level creation process, as levels were rapidly designed. [...] "A designer," [...] wrote Muzyka, [...] "might submit a level description and receive it, art complete, a month later ready for scripting, but missing some key features (almost always a door). We would then have to determine whether the omission was important enough to have the art piece redone, or whether we could simply tweak the design of the level to fit the finished art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under {{circumstances}} where normal space requirements cannot be met, {{such as in}} public transit or elevators, personal space requirements are modified accordingly. According to the psychologist Robert Sommer, one method of dealing with violated personal space is dehumanization. He argues that on the subway, crowded people often imagine those intruding on their personal space as inanimate. Behavior is another method: [...] a person attempting {{to talk to someone}} can often cause situations where one person steps forward to enter what they perceive as a conversational distance, and the person they <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> can step back to restore their personal space.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2016 it was {{reported}} that to meet Package 1 of the Multi Role Vehicle-Protected (MRV-P) requirement, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) was in talks with the Pentagon on acquiring the JLTV via the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route. “We can confirm that we <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the US DOD regarding Package 1 , to inform our understanding of an FMS option for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle,” said an MoD spokesman. [...] It was stated in January 2017 by Maj. Gen. Robert Talbot Rice, the director of land equipment at the Defence Equipment and Support arm of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), that: [...] "We are working through the Foreign Military Sales process. A letter of request has been sent to our American colleagues, and we expect a response in the next few months." [...] Talbot Rice told an audience of industry executives and military personnel at the International Armoured Vehicles conference in London on 24 January that the Army had opted for the single-source purchase due to its ability to meet UK requirements and its value for money.|$|E
