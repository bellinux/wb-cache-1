An argument concerning the size of missing contributions to the numerical Fourier integrals is developed. It is shown that the degree of distortion is not necessarily large even for relatively small experimental bandwidths. The density of states calculated from transient photodecay measurements in amorphous <b>arsenic</b> <b>triselenide</b> is validated by comparing with modulated photocurrent data. It is pointed out that DOS distributions calculated from transient photoconductivity data at a high photoexcitation density are valid under certain conditions. This argument is used to probe the conduction band tail in undoped a-Si:H to energies shallower than 0. 1 eV below the mobility edge. It is concluded that there is a deviation in the DOS from exponential at about 0. 15 eV below the mobility edge...|$|E

40|$|Five chalcogenide {{glasses in}} the GeAsSe ternary glass system were melted, {{fabricated}} into flats, and molded between planar, uncoated, binderless WC molds using a laboratory-scale precision glass molding machine. The five glasses originate at the binary <b>arsenic</b> <b>triselenide</b> (As 40 Se 60) and are modified by replacing As with Se in 5 mol% increments, or by locking the As:Se ratio and adding Ge, also in 5 mol% increments. The glasses are separated into two groups, {{one for the}} Ge-free compositions {{and the other for}} the Ge-containing compositions. This effort analyzes the differences between the Ge-containing and the Ge-free glasses on the post-molded glass and mold surface behavior, as well as the mold lifetime. Fabrication features, such as scratch and/or dig marks were present on the glass and mold surfaces prior to the PGM process. White light interferometry analysis of the surfaces shows an overall reduction in the RMS roughness of the glass after molding, and an increase of the roughness of the molds, after 15 molding cycles. After molding, the quantity of observable defects, primarily deposits and dig marks are increased for both the glass and mold surfaces. Deposits found on the WC molds and glasses were analyzed using Electron Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and showed no evidence of being due to material transfer between the WC molds and the glass constituents. In general the main observable difference in the analysis of the two post molded sets, despite the changes in chemistry, is the quantity of molding induced defects {{near the edge of the}} GeAsSe samples...|$|E

We next developed a novel temporal-imaging system that can be easily synchronized to an external clock source for use in a time-lens based on four-wave mixing for optical processing applications. Spectrally broadening the output of a repetition-rate-agile picosecond time-lens source via self-phase modulation in Corning® Vascade LS+ fiber resulted in a system that has the bandwidth to support optical measurement and processing with sub-picosecond resolutions. As a proof of concept, we implemented our temporal-imaging system in two time-lens systems: a time-to-frequency converter and a temporal-magnification system. We also showed that the timing jitter limits the resolution of our temporal-imaging system to 270 fs. Lastly, we used this temporal-imaging system to create an ultra-high-bandwidth fullfield, amplitude and phase, arbitrary waveform characterization system based on a temporal-phase measurement using heterodyning.

40|$|In this work, the {{suitability}} of amorphous semiconductors as hard field optical sensors for application in optical process tomography (OPT) has been established. Two amorphous semiconductors were selected for the study, these being amorphous <b>arsenic</b> <b>triselenide</b> (a-As 2 Se 3) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The a-As 2 Se 3 device was a single layered structure of 60 |Um thickness fabricated upon a 2 mm thick cylindrical aluminium substrate. The a-Si:H device was a multi-layered structure of 27. 1 fim overall thickness fabricated upon a 4 mm thick cylindrical aluminium substrate. 20 mm 2 samples were cut from the cylinders, their surface being left free for a xerographic investigation. For a tomographic investigation, semitransparent gold (Au) contacts were sputtered {{onto the surface of}} the devices to produce single contacts or contact arrays. The study comprised of the two fields of xerography and tomography. The xerographic study comprised of the measurement of such parameters as charge acceptance, dark decay, residual potential, and photoinduced discharge. The research project has concurred with other workers in that the dark discharge mechanism in a-As 2 Se 3 proceeds via a xerographic depletion discharge process, and a Poole-Frenkel type emission in a-Si:H. The tomographic investigation involved the study of such parameters as detectivity, responsivity, steady state photocurrent, and photoinduced fatigue. Detectivity has found to be dependant upon the magnitude of applied electric field and level of incident irradiance. Irradiance in the order of 3. 45 mW/cm 2 to 9. 57 mW/cm 2 for a- fj f As 2 Se 3 and 5. 31 mW/cm to 28. 32 mW/cm for a-Si:H was required in order to produce a clean and repeatable photogenerated current pulse over the range of electric fields specified (0. 66 xl 05 V/cm to 1. 66 xl 05 V/cm). The production of steady state current has found to be dependant upon the magnitude of electric field, the level of irradiance, and the illumination period. Irradiance of 319 mW/cm 2 to 1. 46 W/cm 2 with an illumination period of 520 ns was required to produce steady state photocurrent in a-As 2 Se 3, and 693 mW/cm 2 to 2. 62 W/cm 2 with an illumination period of 880 ns for a-Si:H. A linear relationship between electric field and responsivity has been observed in both materials over a range of irradiance of 3. 45 mW/cm 2 to 9. 57 mW/cm 2. Responsivity in the order of 87. 86 |LiAAV to 145. 19 |iA/W for a-As 2 Se 3 and 14. 19 (iAAV to 103. 81) J,AAV for a-Si:H has been demonstrated. An investigation as to the effects of photoinduced fatigue in both a-As 2 Se 3 and a-Si:H has been carried out by the application of pulsed visible light of various flash repetition rate (FRR) under a constant high electric field over a 30 minute illumination period. It has been shown that the rate of fatigue is dependant upon the material, time, electric field, light intensity, and FRR. A maximum operating speed of 20 Hz has been determined for a-As 2 Se 3 and lOOHz for a-Si:H. The maximum operating speed of 20 Hz for a-As 2 Se 3 was deemed unsuitable for OPT application and the a-As 2 Se 3 material was eliminated from further tomographic investigation. Tomographic prototypes were employed to establish the a-Si:H devices ability to produce qualitative and quantitative data.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{theoretical}} method for sphere-to-sphere radiative heat exchange is implemented for silica, lithium fluoride, and <b>arsenic</b> <b>triselenide</b> nanospheres of equal and unequal radii. The method is extended to approximate a sphere-to-plane geometric configuration via an asymptotic method. The asymptotic method {{calls for an}} iterative {{process by which the}} radiative exchange is continuously calculated up to convergence as the radii of one microsphere is increased. These results are compared to previously published theoretical approximations and experimental data. A theoretical method for cylinder-to-cylinder radiative heat exchange is formulated. The method utilizes {{a modified version of the}} numerical method for near-field sphere-to-sphere radiative exchange. Modifications were made to the numerical procedure to make it applicable to cylindrical geometry of nanorods. Nanorods investigated had length to diameter ratios of 3 : I and 7 : 1. The heat exchange of nanorods is plotted vs. gap to assess the impact of near-field radiative transfer as gap decreases. Graphical results of energy vs. nanorod radii are also presented. A nanorod-to-plane configuration is estimated utilizing a nanorod asymptotic ii method. The nanorod-to-nanorod method approximates a nanorod-to-plane geometric configuration when one nanorod radii is held constant, and the second nanorod radii is iteratively increased until the corresponding radiative exchange converges. A theoretical method for cylinder-to-cylinder radiative heat exchange is formulated by utilizing a sphere approximation method. The sphere approximation method calls for dividing the cylinders into smaller connected spheres and applying a previously published numerical method for near-field sphere-to-sphere radiative exchange. The overall radiative power exchange is obtained by an additive ray tracing assumption. These results are compared to results produced by a rigorous cylinder-to-cylinder radiative heat exchange method. The heat exchange of nanorods is plotted vs. gap to assess the impact of near-field radiative transfer as gap decreases. The unit sphere method is applied to nanorod configurations having length to diameter ratios of 3 : 1, 5 : 1, 7 : 1. Graphical results of energy vs. nanorod radii are presented. A nanoradii/gap dimensionless relationship caused by geometric effects is found and related to power for nanorods of different aspect ratios and temperatures. A V -shaped configuration is considered with the results plotted for heat exchange vs. angle. An assessment of the number of spheres required to produce an accurate approximation of the V -shaped configuration of nanorods is presented. An error analysis of this method based on a ray blocking assumption from neighboring spheres is discussed. An analysis is presented of a new device that utilizes near-field radiative heat transfer incorporated with pyroelectric materials to convert spacecraft waste heat to electrical energy. A background of pyroelectric material devices is presented to show the background as applied to this application. Near-field plane-to-plane radiative heat exchange is implemented for calculation of the near-field radiative heat exchange within the device. The numerical method is iii based upon an asymptotic approximation shown in previous work for sphere-to-sphere. One sphere is iteratively increased with the radiative heat exchange continuously calculated until convergence, whereby, the geometric configuration approaches plane-to-sphere. By superimposing this method on multiple spheres, the plane-to-plane approximation is achieved. This procedure is applied for silica and lithium fluoride coated planes. Near-field radiative heat transfer results expected in the spacecraft device are presented...|$|E
