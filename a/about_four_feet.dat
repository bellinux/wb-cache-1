5|$|I {{found they}} begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious procession: {{a party of}} young people procure {{the head of a}} dead horse, which is affixed to a pole <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>feet</b> in length; a string is affixed to the lower jaw; a horse-cloth is also {{attached}} to the whole, under which one of the parts gets, and by frequently pulling the string, keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied {{by the rest of the}} party, grotesquely habited, with hand-bells; they thus proceed from house to house, ringing their bells, and singing carols and songs; they are commonly gratified with beer and cake, or perhaps with money. This is called, provincially, a Hodening.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>feet</b> in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to plant specimens, Drummond also sent seeds of D.nobilis to England. Plants were raised from Drummond's seeds, and in 1852 {{one of them}} flowered, making D.nobilis {{one of only two}} dryandras known to have flowered in Europe from Drummond's seed. The flowering specimen was about seven years old at the time, and <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>feet</b> high. It became the basis for a lithographed plate by Walter Hood Fitch, which was featured in Volume 78 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine. By this time, however, the enthusiasm for Proteaceae that prevailed among horticulturalists in the 1840s had waned, and D.nobilis would be the last dryandra to feature in Curtis's Botanical Magazine.|$|E

500|$|Surviving sources {{testify to}} the fact that while there was clear {{variation}} in the hoodening tradition as it was practiced by different individuals in different parts of East Kent, it was nevertheless [...] "on the whole remarkably uniform". The hooden horse, which was at the centre of the tradition, was usually made out of a wooden horse's head affixed to a pole <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>feet</b> long, with a hinged jaw that was moved by a string. This horse was then carried aloft by an individual who was concealed beneath a dark cloth. As part of the hoodening custom, a team of [...] "hoodeners", consisting of between four and eight men, would carry the horse through the streets. This team included the horse with a [...] "hoodener" [...] operating it, a [...] "Groom", [...] "Driver", or [...] "Waggoner" [...] who carried a whip and led the [...] horse by a bridle, a [...] "Jockey" [...] who would attempt to mount the horse, a [...] "Mollie" [...] who was a man dressed as a woman, and one or two musicians. All of the men were farm labourers, usually being those who worked with horses.|$|E
500|$|Like other bird's nest {{fungi in}} the Nidulariaceae, species of Cyathus have their spores {{dispersed}} when water {{falls into the}} fruit body. The fruit body is shaped so that the kinetic energy of a fallen raindrop is redirected upward and slightly outward by {{the angle of the}} cup wall, which is consistently 70–75° with the horizontal. The action ejects the peridioles out of the so-called [...] "splash cup", where it may break and spread the spores within, or be eaten and dispersed by animals after passing through the digestive tract. This method of spore dispersal in the Nidulariaceae was tested experimentally by George Willard Martin in 1924, and later elaborated by Arthur Henry Reginald Buller, who used Cyathus striatus as the model species to experimentally investigate the phenomenon. Buller's major conclusions about spore dispersal were later summarized by his graduate student Harold J. Brodie, with whom he conducted several of these splash cup experiments: Raindrops cause the peridioles of the Nidulariaceae to be thrown <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>feet</b> by splash action. In the genus Cyathus, as a peridiole is jerked out of its cup, the funiculus is torn and this makes possible the expansion of a mass of adhesive hyphae (the hapteron) which clings to any object in the line of flight. The momentum of the peridiole causes a long cord to be pulled out of a sheath attached to the peridiole. The peridiole is checked in flight and the jerk causes the funicular cord to become wound around stems or entangled among plant hairs. Thus the peridiole becomes attached to vegetation and may be eaten subsequently by herbivorous animals.|$|E

2500|$|Kiandra {{is often}} {{isolated}} by deep snow {{which made it}} inaccessible during winter. In 1861, Norwegian miners introduced recreational skiing to the snowbound mining settlement after manufacturing over forty pairs of both short skis known as skates and the longer snow shoes [...] during the months before the first winter snow. To avoid confusion with a conventional skate the skates were described as (two palings turned up at the front end and <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>foot</b> long).

2500|$|... 1791 - A {{visitor to}} the Chartreuse de Champmol, a Carthusian monastery in Dijon, now in France, but in the 15th century {{the capital of the}} Duchy of Burgundy, {{recorded}} seeing in the Prior's room paintings, originally in the ducal chapel of the monastery: [...] "... paintings on wood of the type of the earliest Flemish painters, which come from the chapels of the Dukes; they are <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>feet</b> high. The first, about a foot wide, is an Annunciation..." [...] The monastery was very largely destroyed in the French Revolution, but had been the burial place of the Dukes of Burgundy, and contained many important works. [...] The painting mentioned is thought likely to be the Washington painting, although the measurements (in the French pied, or foot, of the period) do not match very exactly.|$|E

Legs on two of the poles fit into brackets which were bolted to the camper's roof. Two additional poles dogleg into the top frame and have small chain-hooks to hold the doors open. The lower ends of these poles fit into holes in the jack supports. Rubber grommets help protect the paint on the doors and the jack points. The lower edge of the tent is secured to the ground with about a dozen metal stakes. Each stake is about six inches long and is formed from hardened 1/4" [...] rods with a loop at one end. Two storage bags made of (usually matching) canvas with leather straps are supplied for the tent and poles.|$|E
2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine tumbled out on deck. It stood <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>feet</b> high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy marine growth. Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, said last night that he believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since she swept the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the danger area was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight." [...] The mine will be retained by Mr. Cam among the many curiosities that have been brought back to Sydney by his trawlers.|$|E
2500|$|By noon, the Union {{works were}} ready. The line formed an {{approximate}} semicircle {{around the town}} from northwest to southeast. [...] The {{other half of the}} circle was the Harpeth River. Counterclockwise from the northwest were the divisions of Kimball (IV Corps), Ruger (XXIII Corps), and Reilly (XXIII Corps). There was a gap in the line where the Columbia Pike (present day U.S. Route 31) entered the outskirts of the town, left open to allow passage of the wagons. About [...] behind this gap, a 150-yard [...] "retrenchment" [...] line was constructed of dirt and rails, which was intended to be a barrier to traffic, not a full-fledged defensive earthwork. (The gap was also defended by the guns of Battery A, 1st Kentucky Artillery. The men of the 44th Missouri also extended the retrenchment line to the west along their front with hastily dug trenches.) The actual earthworks in the southern portion of the line were formidable. Attacking infantry would be confronted by a ditch <b>about</b> <b>four</b> <b>feet</b> wide and two–three feet deep, then a wall of earth and wooden fence rails four feet above normal ground level, and finally a trench three–four feet deep in which the defenders stood, aiming their weapons through narrow [...] "head gaps" [...] formed by logs. In the southeast portion of the line, Osage-orange shrubs formed an almost impenetrable abatis. Just behind the center of the line stood the Carter House, appropriated as Cox's headquarters. Just east of the pike was the Carter cotton gin building, around which a minor salient occurred in the Union earthworks. Schofield established his headquarters in the Alpheus Truett House, a half mile north of the Harpeth on the Nashville Pike, although he would spend most of his time during the battle in Fort Granger, built in 1863 as an artillery position northeast of the town.|$|E
50|$|In {{areas where}} such a tall fence is {{unsuitable}} (for example, on mountains subject to very high winds), deer may be excluded (or contained) by a fence of ordinary height (<b>about</b> 1.5 metres, <b>four</b> <b>feet),</b> {{with a smaller}} one of about one metre (three feet) high, about one metre away from it, {{on the same side}} as the deer.

But whether or no the tongue of ice reached to the foot of it we were unable to tell, since about two thirds of the way down it arched inwards, like the end of a bent bow, and the conformation of the overhanging rocks on either side was such that we could not see where it terminated. We climbed back again and sat down, and despair took hold of us, bitter, black despair.|$|R
