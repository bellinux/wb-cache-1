40|$|Abstract — Receiver <b>adaptation</b> <b>layered</b> {{multicast}} video {{has been}} pro-posed {{to address the}} issue of network bandwidth heterogeneity in multi-party video communication over networks. An important issue in this ap-proach is how to conduct <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> to achieve the ”optimal level ” of subscription to maximize the perceived video quality at receivers while uti-lize bandwidth efficiently. In the current work, optimal layers are typically determined by congestion signals fed back from networks. This approach implies that instantaneous congestion is a key parameter; however, in ran-dom traffic, such an implication somewhat under-estimates other parame-ters. In order to investigate the performance of “layer adaptation ” in random traffic for improving the network-based multi-party video communication system, in this paper we present an analytical studying of the issue of re-ceiver <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> for <b>layered</b> video transmission. In this work, we use the notion of congestion probability as a partial and indirect measure of the perceived layered video quality at a receiver. The system’s efficiency under a given receiver <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> scheme is also defined and used as a metric to study the performance of a receiver <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> scheme. Through the analysis, we determine the optimal receiver <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> scheme, which maximizes the system efficiency while providing best sus-tainable video quality to a receiver. We show that the greedy receiver <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> scheme is indeed optimal if the traffic generated by various lay-ers of a layered video as well as the cross traffic are constant. However, in a more realistic setting where layered video traffic or the cross traffic varies over the time, the greedy receiver <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> scheme is in general not optimal. To verify our theory, we conduct simulations using both stationary and non-stationary traffic. Our simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the optimal receiver <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> scheme. I...|$|R
30|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirement}} of ubiquitous media access for the future Internet services, we proposed in this article to use the OPTIMIX architecture for optimized media delivery and cross-layer signaling. We considered {{the different types of}} adaptations supported by the architecture for the optimization of scalable video transmission over wireless networks. We also presented the results obtained from a simulation study conducted using a complete OMNeT++ model of the OPTIMIX system architecture. In the study, we evaluated both the network resource efficiency and QoE performance of four adaptation cases: no <b>adaptation,</b> MAC <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation,</b> application <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and combined MAC and application <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Based on the obtained results, we propose to use the combined MAC and application <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> approach for implementing wireless bandwidth adaptation support for the future ubiquitous video services. The proposed scheme performs the best when jointly considering the two criteria.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{attention}} given to ATM <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Layers</b> (AAL) over the ten [...] year history of ATM standardization. Yet none of the existing standards include a retransmission protocol to ensure reliability of the transfers. In this paper we propose an AAL for doing selective retransmissions of individual segments that have been lost or corrupted in the transfer. Since the amount of retransmitted data equals the amount lost, there is little risk of aggravating congestion and the reliability is provided as economically as possible. The protocol relies on the orderly delivery of ATM virtual circuits so that data octets can be identified uniquely by their locations in the data stream. 1. Introduction The development of <b>adaptation</b> <b>layers</b> for ATM has been less than straight forward.

Like other ATM <b>adaptation</b> <b>layers,</b> AAL2 defines segmentation and reassembly of higher-layer packets into ATM cells, in this case packets of data containing voice and control information. AAL2 is further separated into two sub-layers that help with the mapping from upper layer services to ATM cells.

30|$|Figure 7 {{illustrates}} the dropped EL 2 packets at the BS MAC. Here, we observe significantly larger drop rates with the adaptation schemes employing the MAC <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation.</b> In fact, the sole MAC <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> results {{in about two}} times higher EL 2 drop rate at the BS MAC (1181.1 packets in average for Foreman and 1431.9 packets for Hall) than when no adaptation is enabled (585 packets Foreman, 744.2 packets Hall). This is because the BL and EL 1 packets are prioritized over EL 2 packets. The usage of application <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> on top of MAC adaptation helps {{reducing the amount of}} EL 2 packet drops in the BS, and thus improves the video transmission efficiency also in the wired network: The number of EL 2 drops with sole application <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> and MAC plus application <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> for the Foreman sequence are in average 188.6 and 480.7, respectively.The corresponding figures for the Hall sequence are 286.8 and 628.8 EL 2 packets.|$|R

5000|$|The AAL2 {{protocol}} improves {{on other}} ATM <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Layers,</b> by packing lots of small packets efficiently into one standard-sized ATM cell of 53 bytes. A one-byte packet thus {{no longer has}} an overhead ratio of 52 unused bytes out of 53 (i.e. 98%). Potentially, total of 11 one-byte CPS packets (plus 3/4 of a 12th CPS packet) could squeeze into a single cell. Of course, CPS packets can come in other sizes with other CIDs, too. When the transmission is ready, the CPS packets are all multiplexed together into a single cell and transported over standard ATM network infrastructure.|$|R
30|$|Clearly, {{the best}} video quality can be {{attained}} when the MAC <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> is enabled. Since very {{little or no}} BL packets are lost, the PSNR values stay near the original, that is, 39.9 dB in average for Foreman and 41.2 dB for Hall. The PSNR drops with the MAC <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> follow well the drop rate of ELs. With MAC plus application <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation,</b> {{the effect of the}} application <b>layer</b> <b>adaptation</b> can be seen, for example, between 5 - 8 s in Figure 9. During this time period, a significant part of all EL packets are not sent at all, which negatively affects the PSNR. However, because only few BL packets are lost, the PSNR recovers fast and the error resilience algorithms of the decoder are less used. The average PSNR achieved with the combined MAC and application level adaptation is 38.8 dB for Foreman, and 40.3 dB for Hall.|$|R
