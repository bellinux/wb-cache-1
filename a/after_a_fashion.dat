5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> model dies while {{undergoing}} {{an illegal}} abortion, the attending doctor moves her body {{back to her}} home, staging her death to remove any trace of his involvement. However, he is murdered by a stranger disguised in racing leathers and a motorcycle helmet. At the Albatross Modelling Agency, womanising photographer Carlo (Nino Castelnuovo) embarks on an affair with fellow photographer Magda (Edwige Fenech). Meanwhile, a newly hired model, Patrizia (Solvi Stubing), fends off the unwanted advances of Maurizio (Franco Diogene), whose wife owns the agency. One evening, Mario (Claudio Pellegrini), who also works at the agency, invites a woman in racing leathers into his home for a drink, and is stabbed to death. The police question the agency's owner Gisella (Lia Amanda) and another model, Lucia (Femi Benussi) about the killing, but learn very little. Gisella and Lucia are sleeping together; one night when Gisella leaves after a fight, Lucia is attacked and killed.|$|E
5|$|Initially Lugosi and Jane Wyatt {{were set}} to star in the film. Universal also {{announced}} that Boris Karloff and Colin Clive, who had starred together in Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, would appear, and that Cesar Romero would play Dr. Garth. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Universal had sought Herbert Marshall {{for the role of}} Sandor, before casting Pichel. None of them appeared except, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion,</b> Lugosi, {{in the form of a}} wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{constitution}} are entrenched, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion.</b> Section 268 of the Electoral Act declares that the law governing the maximum term of Parliament (itself part of the Constitution Act), along with certain provisions of the Electoral Act relating to the redistribution of electoral boundaries, the voting age, and the secret ballot, may only be altered either by three-quarters of the entire membership of the House of Representatives, or {{by a majority of}} valid votes in a popular referendum. Section 268 itself is not protected by this provision, so a government could legally repeal Section 268 and go on to alter the entrenched portions of law, both with a mere simple majority in Parliament. However, the entrenchment provision has enjoyed longstanding bipartisan support, and the electoral consequences of using a legal loophole to alter an entrenched provision would likely be severe.|$|E
500|$|The {{common side}} did erupt <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> in 1728 when Robert Castell, an {{architect}} and debtor in the Fleet prison, {{who had been}} living in lodgings outside the jail within the rules, was taken to a [...] "sponging house" [...] after refusing to pay a higher prison fee to the Fleet's notorious warden, Thomas Bambridge. Sponging houses were private lodgings where prisoners were incarcerated before being taken to jail; they acquired the name because they squeezed the prisoner's last money out of him. When Castell arrived at the sponging house on 14 November he was forced to share space with a man who was dying of smallpox, and as a result became infected and died less than a month later.|$|E
500|$|Kepler and Roeslin {{engaged in}} a series of {{published}} attacks and counter-attacks, while physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular). In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology {{on the one hand and}} overzealous rejection of it on the other, Kepler prepared Tertius Interveniens [...] Nominally this work—presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius—was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars, but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls. While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the [...] "evil-smelling dung" [...] in which [...] "an industrious hen" [...] scrapes, there was an [...] "occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget" [...] to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer. Conversely, Sir Oliver Lodge observed that Kepler was somewhat disdainful of astrology, as Kepler was [...] "continually attacking and throwing sarcasm at astrology, but it was the only thing for which people would pay him, and on it <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> he lived." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. [...] It opens with a scene of Stefani and Kanal holding each other. [...] During the chorus, she runs to a church while wearing a wedding dress designed <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> show by John Galliano, while her bandmates run after her. [...] During the next verse, Stefani and guitarist Tom Dumont sit on a couch, and Stefani gets up on the table while Dumont plays an acoustic guitar. [...] Stefani has a nightmare during the second chorus, in which she is in an endless hall full of wedding cakes, attempting to stop her bandmates from destroying them. [...] There is then a dream sequence in which Stefani is backlit {{in front of a}} circle of stars. [...] She sits with Young for the third verse, during which point in time a light {{in the shape of a}} birth control pills flashes, with one missing pill. This coincides with her line [...] "Sometime I wished/For a mistake," [...] referencing her desire to get pregnant. In the video, Young quickly stands up and leaves after her line [...] "You seem like you'd be a good dad" [...] to play with Dumont and Kanal. [...] The band walks through a cemetery, and Stefani finds a baby. [...] Her bandmates extend their arms to hold the baby, but Stefani hands the baby off to a woman and enters her trailer to remove her makeup.|$|E

She was defended by designer Alexander McQueen, who, during his walk-out <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> show, wore a T-shirt saying [...] "We love you Kate". Artist Stella Vine also supported Moss, and paintings by Vine, painted during the scandal, were exhibited and reproduced in the press.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Cleburne's old {{regiment}} finally recovered {{its original}} designation, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion.</b> In the massive reorganization of the Army of Tennessee on April 9, 1865, the 15th Arkansas was consolidated with nine other depleted Arkansas regiments, the 1st Arkansas, 2nd Arkansas, 5th Arkansas, 8th Arkansas, 13th Arkansas, 19th (Dawson's) Arkansas, 24th Arkansas and the 3rd Confederate Infantry Regiment. They were lumped together to form the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry. The survivors of the 15th Arkansas were consolidated into a single understrength company, [...] "Company H" [...] of the new 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry. The 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry surrendered with the Army of Tennessee at Greensboro, North Carolina, on April 26, 1865.|$|E

2500|$|Saulnier himself, {{following}} {{the failure of}} his early synchronization experiments, pursued a method trusting rather less to statistics and luck by developing armoured propeller blades that would resist damage. [...] By March 1915, when French pilot Roland Garros approached Saulnier to arrange for this device to be installed on his Morane-Saulnier Type L, these had taken the form of steel wedges which deflected the bullets which might otherwise have damaged the propeller, or ricocheted dangerously. Garros himself, and his personal mechanic Jules Hue, are sometimes credited with testing and perfecting the [...] "deflectors". This crude system worked <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion,</b> although the wedges diminished the propeller's efficiency, and the not inconsiderable force {{of the impact of}} bullets on the deflector blades must have put undesirable stress on the engine's crankshaft.|$|E
2500|$|The spur to such {{commercial}} designs can {{be found}} in the [...] "free Renaissance" [...] style that was espoused by Charles Eastlake. In 1868 he published Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details which was very influential in Britain and later in the United States, where the book was published in 1872. Although the archaeology of Mr. Eastlake's volume was always careful, most of the principles in it are beyond question, and can be generally stated in a few words. The Italianate style would have no carving or molding or other ornament glued on—such work must be done in the solid; no mitered joints, but joints made at the right angle, and secured by mortise, tenon and pin; woods in their native colour, and unvarnished, or else painted in flat colour, with a contrasting line and a stenciled ornament at the angles; unconcealed construction everywhere, and purposes plainly proclaimed; and with veneering, round corners and all curves weakening the grain of the wood being absolutely forbidden. The furniture that he thus proposed has straight, strong, squarely cut members equal to their intention. Its ornament is painted panels, porcelain plaques and tiles, metal trimmings, and conventionalized carvings in sunk relief, a part of the construction entering into the ornament, also in the shape of narrow striated strips of wood radiating in opposite lines, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion</b> not altogether unknown in the time of Henry III. It has the honesty and solidity, but not the attraction, of the Medieval; and if it is stiff and somewhat heavy, and fails entirely to please, it has yet a wholesome and healthy air.|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>fashion.</b> Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
