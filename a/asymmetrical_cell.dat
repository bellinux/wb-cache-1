For example, a mutation in one gene causes more stomata that are clustered together, hence is called Too Many Mouths (TMM). Whereas, disruption of the SPCH (SPeecCHless) gene prevents stomatal development all together. Activation of stomatal production can occur by the activation of EPF1, which activates TMM/ERL, which together activate YODA.

Most of the research probing aspects of {{cell division}} has experimented with stationary or immobilized <b>cells</b> or distinctly <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>cells.</b> Here we took an alternative approach by examining cell division events within motile groups of cells growing on solid medium by time-lapse microscopy. A total of 558 cell divisions were identified among approximately 12, 000 cells. We found an interconnection of division, motility, and polarity in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. For every division event, motile cells stop moving to divide. Progeny cells of binary fission subsequently move in opposing directions. This behavior involves M. xanthus Frz proteins that regulate M. xanthus motility reversals but is independent of type IV pilus “S motility. ” The inheritance of opposing polarity is correlated with {{the distribution of the}} G protein RomR within these dividing cells.

50|$|Somatic embryos {{are formed}} from plant {{cells that are}} not {{normally}} involved {{in the development of}} embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo. Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form the callus. The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant. <b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>cell</b> division also seems to be important in the development of somatic embryos, and while failure to form the suspensor cell is lethal to zygotic embryos, it is not lethal for somatic embryos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Memories are a {{main concern}} in {{low-power}} and high-speed designs.

This simple solution avoids noise problems, and in spite of the full swing on bitlines, the results show that power consumption performances are quite interesting: for a 8 Kbytes SRAM, at 0. 8 Volt, the access time is 74 ns while consuming 7 uA/MHz (at 2. 5 Volts, the access time is 3. 5 ns and the power consumption 22 uA/MHz). ...|$|R
50|$|Progenitor cells inhabit an area {{outside of}} the early neural tube called the {{ventricular}} zone. Progenitor cells divide during a phase called symmetrical division. These new cells can then move to an area termed the subventricular zone, where they continue to divide. After a period of approximately seven weeks or so for human development, the progenitor cells trigger {{a new form of}} division called <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>cell</b> division 2. Like the name suggests, this division results in not only a duplicate progenitor cell, but also a neuronal precursor cell 2. Radial glia, which play an integral role in the migration of neuronal precursor cells during cerebral cortex development, are the first brain cells to be produced through asymmetrical division 2. The cell bodies of radial glia stay in close proximity to the wall of the neural tube within the ventricular and subventricular zones, but they extend processes outward and connect to the pia mater, the innermost layer of the meninges (a group of protective tissues that surround the brain). As the cerebral cortex becomes thicker, the fibers of radial glia extend and preserve their connections with the pia mater 2. The job of these radial glia are to provide guidance for neurons migrating throughout the developing brain.|$|E
5000|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, the GSC niche {{resides in}} the anterior-most region of each ovariole, known as the germarium. The GSC niche {{consists}} of necessary somatic cells-terminal filament cells, cap cells, escort cells, and other stem cells which function to maintain the GSCs. The GSC niche holds on average 2-3 GSCs, which are directly attached to somatic cap cells and Escort stem cells, which send maintenance signals directly to the GSCs. [...] GSCs are easily identified through histological staining against vasa protein (to identify germ cells) and 1B1 protein (to outline cell structures and a germline specific fusome structure). Their physical attachment to the cap cells is necessary for their maintenance and activity. A GSC will divide asymmetrically to produce one daughter cystoblast, which then undergoes 4 rounds of incomplete mitosis as it progresses down the ovariole (through the process of oogenesis) eventually emerging as a mature egg chamber; the fusome found in the GSCs functions in cyst formation and may regulate <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>cell</b> divisions of the GSCs.

Here, their results are compared with studies on the variabilities of length and age at division. It is argued that the decreased growth rate in old pole cells falls within the expected variation and may therefore be sufficiently far from a catastrophe-like cell death through aging.

We found that RNT- 1 ∷GFP is expressed in the H 0 - 2, V 1 - 6, and T blast cells in the embryo, and predominantly in the seam cells during larval to adult stages. rnt- 1 mutants exhibit a loss of polarity in the <b>asymmetrical</b> T <b>cell</b> division in hermaphrodites and abnormal ray morphology in the male tail. Genetic and molecular analysis revealed that rnt- 1 is allelic to mab- 2.

Expression studies of GFP∷POP- 1 and TLP- 1 ∷GFP reporters in rnt- 1 /mab- 2 mutants indicated that this gene functions upstream of tlp- 1 and downstream, or in parallel to, pop- 1 in the genetic cascade that controls asymmetry of the T cell division.

Nematodes thus allow an evolutionary analysis of developmental processes. We have analyzed cell lineages and pattern formation in the vulva equivalence group of six rhabditid nematodes of the genera Oscheius, Rhabditella, Rhabditoides, Pelodera, and Protorhabditis. The comparison of these species with four previously analyzed species of this family reveals evolutionary modification at several levels. The number of vulva precursor cells (VPCs) differ among species.
