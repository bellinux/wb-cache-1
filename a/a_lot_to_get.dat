A native with mainly earth signs will be {{practical}} and cautious, sensible and capable {{and will be}} happier with concrete things than abstract ideas. They move slowly and carry out their work in a thorough and unhurried manner. Earth subjects are shrewd and careful and need emotional and material security, and will put up with quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it. They are generous to those they love, but are otherwise careful not to waste time or money, though {{there can be a}} tendency towards meanness. Earth subjects tend to be shy in social situations, and to be slow to commit in love relationships, but are serious when they do. A subject lacking earth signs will lack common sense and practicality and find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be scatty, unrealistic and clumsy, hopeless with money and unreliable. Planets in the 2nd, 6th and 10th houses and an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy." ...|$|E
