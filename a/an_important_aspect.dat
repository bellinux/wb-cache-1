5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in Shetland since the Mesolithic period. The {{earliest}} written references to the islands date back to Roman times. The early historic period was dominated by Scandinavian influences, especially from Norway, and the islands did not become part of Scotland until the 15th century. When Scotland {{became part of the}} Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, trade with northern Europe decreased. Fishing has continued to be <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of the economy up to the present day.

In addition, many of the innovations introduced by the Lingbao School have survived to the present, including its division of the Daozang into three sections corresponding to different teachings, with the Dongzhen corresponding to the Shangqing School, the Dongxuan to the Lingbao School, and the Dongshen to the Sanhuang teaching. The integration of Buddhism within Lingbao practices and beliefs ensured that Buddhist elements would remain <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of later Daoism, and also aided in integrating Buddhism into all levels of society in China.|$|E

In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of {{entertainment}} is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience {{may have a}} passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms {{of entertainment}} have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.|$|E
5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} hermeneutic writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used only by a minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians were equally dismissive until the late twentieth century, when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued {{that it should be}} taken seriously as <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E

5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown}} that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E
5|$|Multiple vassalage became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of Romanian {{diplomacy}} {{after the}} Christian Balkan states (Bulgaria, Serbia) {{one by one}} fell to the Ottoman Empire in the course {{the second half of}} the 14th century. For example, Mircea the Elder (1386–1418) accepted the suzerainty of Poland in 1387 and that of Hungary in 1395, and Wallachia was paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417. When accepting Hungarian suzerainty, the princes of Wallachia usually also received the district of Făgăraş in Transylvania from the Hungarian monarchs, for example in 1366 King Louis I of Hungary (1342–1382) granted the region to Prince Vladislav I of Wallachia (1364–1377), with the title of duke, and Prince Mircea the Elder received it from King Sigismund (1387–1437).|$|E
5|$|Roman {{religious}} beliefs {{date back to}} the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek {{religious beliefs}}. Private and personal worship was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.|$|E
