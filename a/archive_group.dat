40|$|In 2005 the Digital <b>Archiving</b> <b>Group,</b> {{a working}} group of Oxford University's Information and Communication Technologies Committee (ICTC), {{suggested}} that a pilot project for the digital archiving of scholarly papers be developed. To support this suggestion, and to investigate the wider issues relating to eprints and institutional repositories, a workshop was organised on 10 June 2005. The purpose of the workshop {{was to investigate the}} opportunities and challenges of developing an open access institutional repository for research. The workshop was organised {{under the aegis of the}} Digital <b>Archiving</b> <b>Group</b> and in association with the Oxford Internet Institute, the Research Technologies Service (OUCS), and the Systems and Electronic Resources Service (OULS). "Towards a Research Repository" is derived from an earlier briefing document entitled, "Towards a policy for open access to research at Oxford University : briefing document", which was produced for, and considered by, participants at the research repositories workshop. The purpose of the document is to provide a summary of progress thus far, including a series of recommendations put forward, and further refined, at the June workshop.

50|$|The Greenbrier Historical Society and North House Museum is {{dedicated}} to collecting, preserving, and interpreting the rich history of the Greenbrier Valley. The Greenbrier Historical Society has operated within the North House since 1976 and has owned the building since 1992. Built in 1820, the North House was the home of local lawyer John North and his wife Charlotte {{for more than a}} decade before becoming James Frazier’s Star Tavern and Inn. At the turn of the 20th century, the North House became the President’s home for Greenbrier Women’s College. Today, the museum’s permanent displays and temporary exhibits feature items from across the Greenbrier Valley, including, but not limit to; the training saddle of General Robert E. Lee’s horse Traveller, an 18th-century covered wagon, Civil War artifacts, furniture made by local craftsman David Surbaugh, as well as original items from the North family. The Greenbrier Historical Society archives and museum hold artifacts from before the revolutionary war through today. The Greenbrier Historical Society and North House Museum also offers educational program, a research <b>archive,</b> <b>group</b> tour rates, and membership opportunities.|$|E
5000|$|The 19th Century {{centralization}} of archives, {{precursor to the}} 20th Century's nationalism, has been opposed by some. Historian Craig Robertson posits that [...] "archives do not neutrally store documents; rather, objects captured through archival practices are transformed into knowledge." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that the [...] "historicization of state archives can make explicit how archives create national narratives and, more importantly, national characters, prioritizing and privileging specific stories and peoples." [...] The concept of the archivist as a custodian of records originated in the late 19th Century and was championed by no less than Hilary Jenkinson. His concept, that [...] "the Archivist is not and ought not be an Historian" [...] and that the archivist [...] "is the servant of his Archives first and afterwards of the student Public" [...] reflect the idea that archivists should primarily serve as objective custodians of records. This contrasted with the prior practice of archives serving to embellish the histories of politicians and other wealthy patrons. The retention of records in a national archive would then become a universal bureaucratic norm rather than the retention of a select few records for a predetermined purpose. Jenkinson also specified that rather than holding source documents piecemeal, that the integrity of an organic <b>archive</b> <b>group</b> must be maintained.|$|E

Multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the factor structure based on responses to 51 items by a new cross-validation group (n= 9, 134) was invariant with the factor structures based on responses to the same 51 items and to all 102 items by the original normative <b>archive</b> <b>group</b> (n = 9, 187). Reliabilities for the 11 SDQII-S factors were nearly the same and consistently high (. 80 to. 89) for both groups.

Also the findings of the study revealed that, shelterbelts in the study area were perceived as useful and valuable assets which provide a range of forest goods and environmental services such as: increasing crop production, reducing the damage of crops, leading to sustainabl...|$|E
40|$|Jodi is {{a senior}} {{research}} assistant at LaTrobe University, Archaeology department and has established the GIS databases for several historical GIS projects, {{all of which have}} a strong emphasis on the examination of geo-referenced historical maps to inform archaeological research. She also manages the GIS at a Melbourne heritage consultancy and is integrating IPAD technology into archaeologists work flow. She {{is a member of the}} newly formed DADA (Digital Archaeological Data <b>Archive)</b> <b>group</b> which seeks to establish an archaeological spatial data archive and explore the potential of GIS for archaeology and cultural heritage management in Victoria. This paper presents an overview of Geographical Information System (GIS) applications currently being utilized in an historical archaeology research project supported by La Trobe University. This work is the first stage of a broader study titled “Cultural Landscapes of Colonial Water Management in Victoria’s Central Highlands”, funded by the Australian Research Council (DP 110100437). The current area of focus is immediately south east of Creswick. The project incorporates a variety of GIS applications in order to understand the spatial and temporal relationships between water management features such as water races, dams and reservoirs utilized on the 19 th century Creswick goldfields. MapInfo software has been utilized to integrate various GIS applications and technologies, such as geo-referenced historical maps, 3 D visualization, temporal mapping and integration with Google Earth, Google Maps, and IPAD. This paper introduces the reader to Historical GIS and discusses some limitations encountered thus far concluding that GIS has been integral to understanding this complex historical landscape and the complex relationships between water users...|$|E

40|$|The essay {{that aims}} to {{contribute}} to the history of relations between writing and literacy in Abruzzo in the 10 th century, comes from a section (pp. CLXII-CLXX) of the “Historical, Palaeographical and Codicological Introduction” to the volume published by the author in 2003. The immediate geo-monastic context is that of S. Liberatore alla Maiella, the biggest of the “cellae” of Montecassino in Abruzzo, {{and one of the most}} remarkable among the about sixty dependencies called “prepositurae”, belonging to the cassinese monastery in the south-central Italy. The general objective is to make known the entire <b>archive</b> <b>group</b> of S. Liberatore, both that of medieval age in the cited volume, and that of modern age in the following, which appeared in 2006. This specific series of the cassinese archives, gravitating towards S. Liberatore but relating also to other minor monastic centres of the Abruzzo and today preserved in the capsules XCVIII-CIV, contains a total of 801 documents. Among these there are some particularly known to the researchers, especially after the contributions of Enrico Carusi (1929, 1932) and Herbert Bloch (1986), as the “Memoratorium” of abbot Bertharius († 883) and the “Commemoratorium” – testamentary inventory – of the prior of S. Liberatore, then abbot of Montecassino Theobald († 1035 / 1037). Some documents have preserved interesting discoveries, as the current caps. XCVIII, fasc. I, no. 4, a charter of July 936, which encloses the oldest autographical signature (“Ego qui supra Arechisi”) by Arechis, judge of Capua, the same person who underwrote the Placitum dated 960, the first official testimony of the Italian vernacular. Others constitute a homogeneous group of charters (Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13), whose complete edition offered finally the oldest complete collection of agrarian contracts of Montecassino (from 950 to 984), especially in the form of emphyteusis – “livelli” – (generally for a term of twenty-nine years), the most widely used for the management of land in the cassinese sphere, having the character of a lease with the compensation of a fee proportionate to the land. On this historical and documentary plot, is interwoven the palaeographical profile, whose subject is the significance of the older charters (10 th cent.) of S. Liberatore for the history of the relations between writing and literacy in Abruzzo, profile based upon the signatures of the witnesses, but also in certain cases of the authors of the document. The investigation concerning 33 documents edited – except no. 1 (forgery) –, dated between 935 and 1000, shows a total of 104 signatures in the original, and 7 in the copy. Remarkable is the number of lay subscribers (69) compared to ecclesiastic (18). The lay writers use in large part the basic minuscule: basic elementary (15), between the elementary and the usual (23), usual (25), and only in rare cases usual beneventan (6). Prevalent among the ecclesiastics (all belonging to the cassinese area or South Longobardia) the Beneventan script: usual (10) or book hand (2); the remaining ecclesiastics from Abruzzo, sign in minuscule: between the basic elementary and the usual (1), and usual (3). From the palaeographical analysis springs the following conclusions: there are two distinct cultural areas: one is a reflection of the South Longobardia, the other derives from local area in which the writers use a minuscule mirroring a basic graphic education if not rudimentary. So it is to record the existence of a range of subjects whose writing was ordinary but which also recognized the symbolic value, as in the case of the personalized “signum crucis”; on the other hand, the use of the Beneventan script, typical of the territory to which belonged Montecassino, appears to be reserved for a minority of ecclesiastical origin...|$|E
