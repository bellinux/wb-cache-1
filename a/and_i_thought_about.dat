But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

'Well!' said Clennam, {{abiding by}} {{the feeling that}} had fallen on him in the avenue {{on the night of}} the roses, the feeling that he was an older man, who had done with that tender part of life, 'I found out my mistake, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it a little--in short, a good deal--and got wiser. Being wiser, I counted up my years and {{considered}} what I am, and looked back, and looked forward, and found that I should soon be grey. I found that I had climbed the hill, and passed the level ground upon the top, and was descending quickly.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Marvin later recalled, [...] "I {{thought at}} the time that, as the Shadows weren't working regularly, {{it would be nice to}} do {{something}} new - singing rather than instrumental, though with instrumentals as well, of course. I was talking to Bruce about it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> forming a five-piece. He wasn't keen on a big group so we shelved the idea and started writing songs together. He suggested the two of us should record the songs together. I suggested adding one more person - I wanted the extra strength of a third voice and the scope it would offer".|$|E
5000|$|History:The {{idea of a}} mathematically {{abstract}} adventure came aboutduring {{the summer}} of 1983, when I was reading the book [...] "Godel,Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid".

I knew that because I’d been one and I always loved movies about people who misbehaved... So I sat down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> everything I loved in movies. That list ran to: naughty girls, seaside towns, writers and scandalous behaviour. I then watched every movie that fitted that for me - The Wonder Boys, The Squid and the Whale, Wish You Were Here, The Door in the Floor, Thirteen." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I could answer, I had {{proof of}} this last statement, for the great yellow hound, Pharaoh, that had found us in the desert, hearing our voices, emerged from some corner where it was hidden, and {{advanced}} toward us, wagging its tail. As it passed Shadrach, it stopped and growled, the hair rising on its back, whereon he hurled a stone at it and hit its leg. Next instant Pharaoh, a beast of enormous power, was {{on the top of}} him, <b>and</b> really, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>about</b> to tear out his throat.|$|R

5000|$|Roth {{wrote this}} short story {{to change the}} {{perception}} about Divergent story. Talking about why she chose chapter thirteen of the book, she said on her blog that [...] "It {{was hard for me}} to pick just the right one. I thought about the Ferris wheel scene, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the fear landscape scene, and both of those would have been good options. But I really wanted to choose something that would change our (I say [...] "our" [...] because it changed mine, too) perceptions about the story, and show how limited Tris's perspective really is, though she is a reliable and observant narrator. And the knife-throwing scene was perfect for that--once I started writing, I discovered all kinds of things about Four that I didn't know, and I knew this scene was The One." ...|$|E
5000|$|The album's sleeve was {{designed}} and illustrated by English artist Roger Dean, who would design many of Yes's future album covers, including their [...] "bubble" [...] logo. On reflection of the design, Dean said: [...] "'Fragile' was very literal, really. I think the band has named a number of their albums after their current psychological state, and 'Fragile' described the psyche of the band. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> that very literally, painting a fragile world that would eventually break up." [...] He commented further: [...] "'Fragile' was quite a complicated cover {{because there was a}} book inside. It was elaborate although it wasn't {{one of the most striking}} of all the Yes covers. I was kind of learning my trade at the time. The main feature on the cover was a little Bonsai world with a wooden space ship flying overhead! It was literally meant to be a fragile world".|$|E
5000|$|My {{first reading}} of Caitanya Caritamrita created some faith in Caitanya. On the second reading I {{understood}} that Caitanya was unequalled, but l doubted {{how such a}} good scholar with so high a level of prema could recommend the worship of Krishna, who had such a questionable character. I was amazed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> this in detail. Afterwards, I humbly prayed to God, [...] "O Lord, please give me the understanding to know the secret of this matter." [...] The mercy of God is without limit and so I soon understood. From then on I believed that Caitanya was God. I often spoke with many vairagis to understand Vaishnava dharma. From childhood the seeds of faith for Vaishnava dharma had been planted within my heart and now they had sprouted. I experienced anuraga (spiritual yearning) and day and night I read and thought about Krishna.|$|E

[...] I call it [...] "the adrenaline of excellence," [...] I call it that because, as you walk into a room, what you experience is your body and your muscles tighten, your heart and your mind concentrate, and your body and your heart and mind are telling you that you’re prepared to deliver peak performance, so I call the feeling of what you’re about to do [...] "the adrenaline of excellence." ...|$|E
