40|$|An “attribution ” is a {{judgment}} about audience perceptions of why an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrong-doing</b> occurred, rather than causal percep-tions {{of the act}} per se. The issue is not what forces generated a particular outcome, but rather what outsiders believe influenced rele-vant actors {{at the time of}} the occurrence. Such beliefs are shaped by a number of indi-vidual and social factors. Sociologists gener-ally have examined the context of the situation surrounding a given act because the actor, by giving information or explanations, may influence judgments made by an observ-er (Hamilton and Hagiwara 1992). This approach has generated a great deal of socio-logical research informed by the concepts of jurisprudence and inspired by the practice o...|$|E

60|$|This {{conversation}} is very characteristic of Lady Byron as showing her benevolent analysis of character, and the peculiar hopefulness {{she always had}} {{in regard to the}} future of every one brought in connection with her. Her moral hopefulness was something very singular; and in this respect she was so {{different from the rest of}} the world, that it would be difficult to make her understood. Her tolerance <b>of</b> <b>wrong-doing</b> would have seemed to many quite latitudinarian, and impressed them as if she had lost all just horror of what was morally wrong in transgression; but it seemed her fixed habit to see faults only as diseases and immaturities, and to expect them to fall away with time.|$|R

The old acrid smell of frying brought back many holidays of Italy to me, and I was again at times on the Riva at Venice, and in the Mercato Vecchio at Florence.

On 12 November 1997, he was cheered from the Conservative benches when he asked Blair about the Bernie Ecclestone affair, [...] "Does the Prime Minister agree that the perception <b>of</b> <b>wrong-doing</b> can be as damaging to public confidence as the wrong-doing itself?

5000|$|The {{report by}} Ron {{discussed}} {{why it would}} be difficult to clear the soldiers <b>of</b> <b>wrong-doing.</b> Among the reasons the report gives for why it would be is the [...] "gravity of the deviation" [...] and the [...] "results of the event". The report says that a [...] "serious deviation from obligatory norms of behaviour" [...] occurred. Ron's report stated that [...] "An 11-year-old boy who was innocently playing football was killed", adding that [...] "even if this is a 'slight' deviation, the consequences make it imperative that a military police investigation be conducted", though the letter sent by Ron to B'Tselem said that she did not believe that an investigation was warranted.

60|$|But Susan Henchard's fear {{of losing}} her dearly loved daughter's heart by a revelation {{had little to do}} with any sense <b>of</b> <b>wrong-doing</b> on her own part. Her simplicity--the {{original}} ground of Henchard's contempt for her--had allowed her to live on in the conviction that Newson had acquired a morally real and justifiable right to her by his purchase--though the exact bearings and legal limits of that right were vague. It may seem strange to sophisticated minds that a sane young matron could believe in the seriousness of such a transfer; and were there not numerous other instances of the same belief the thing might scarcely be credited. But she was by no means the first or last peasant woman who had religiously adhered to her purchaser, as too many rural records show.|$|R
50|$|In August 1881, {{while in}} Perm, Korolenko refused to swear {{allegiance}} to the new Russian Tsar Alexander III (the act that some political prisoners and exiles were demanded to perform, after the assassination of Alexander II) and was exiled again, this time much farther, to Yakutia. He spent {{the next three years}} in Amga, a small settlement 275 verstas from Yakutsk, where he did manual work, but also studied local customs and history. His impressions from his life in exile provided Korolenko with rich material for his writings, which he started to systematize upon arriving at Nizhny Novgorod, where in 1885 he was finally allowed to settle in. In Nizhny, Korolenko became the center of the local social activism, attracting radicals to fight all kinds <b>of</b> <b>wrong-doing</b> committed by the authorities, according to the biographer Semyon Vengerov.|$|R
40|$|Some {{actions are}} {{identity}} affecting, they affect who will {{exist in the}} future. Explaining how identity affecting actions can be wrong has been thought to pose a problem, the Non-Identity Problem. The problem is that an identity affecting action could be wrong even though {{no one would be}} harmed if it were performed. If no one would be harmed, how can we explain why it is wrong? The Non-Identity Problem assumes that someone is harmed by an action only if someone would be worse-off if it were performed than they would be if it were not. I defend this assumption, and I argue that harm does not figure in any way into a plausible explanation <b>of</b> <b>wrong-doing</b> in examples <b>of</b> the Non-Identity Problem. Furthermore, I argue that the Non-Identity Problem is not an anomaly. There are other examples of actions that are wrong even though harm does not figure into any plausible explanation of why they are wrong. I focus on one: the wrong of increasing inequality between people who are equally deserving. I conclude that harm does not play a role in explaining all wrong actions, nor is harm an especially important consideration that counts against an action. Consistent with these lessons, I suggest that we think about the wrong done in examples that raise the Non-Identity Problem in the following way: we should ask what the action tells us about the agent's character. I argue that the action reveals to us a defect in the agent's character and an action that is the mark of a defective character is wrong. I identify the defect of character revealed by some of the most troubling examples <b>of</b> <b>wrong-doing</b> as insensitivity to suffering. Insensitivity to suffering can be exhibited to the same degree by an agent who harms someone as by an agent who harms no one. by Valentina Maria Urbanek. Thesis (Ph. D.)
