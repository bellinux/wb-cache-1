However, the present simulation results of the <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> with the arc chain model are constant, which is {{not consistent with the}} test results. In reaction to the above phenomenon, the stochastic simulation model was first established to calculate the relationship between the conductivity of the air and the temperature. Furthermore, the conductivity along the radius direction of the primary arc was acquired, and then the stochastic initial length of the secondary arc with different primary current was also obtained. Results showed that with the increase of primary current, the average value and dispersion of the initial secondary arc length also increased.

40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{achieving}} a controlled <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> on high voltage (SF 6) circuit breakers during fault interruption is presented. Using {{least mean squares}} based regression, {{a model of a}} sampled (fault) current is generated.

Benefits of such controlled interruption include reduction in circuit breaker electrical wear, potential to increase circuit breaker switching ratings and facilitation of new high voltage interruption techniques.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{transient characteristics}} and breaking performance of direct-current (DC) forced-interruption vacuum interrupters in 270 V power-supply systems. Three stages are identified in forced interruption: the DC-arcing stage, current-commutation stage, and voltage-recovery stage. During the current-commutation stage, the reverse peak-current coefficient k, {{which is a}} key design factor, {{is used to calculate}} the rate of current at zero-crossing (di/dt). MATLAB/Simulink simulation models are established to obtain the transient characteristics influenced by the forced-commutation branch parameters and the coefficient k. To study the breaking performance of spiral-type contacts, experiments are conducted for different contact materials and <b>arcing</b> <b>times</b> for currents less than 3. 5 kA. During the DC-arcing stage, a locally intensive burning arc is observed in the CuW 80 contact; however, it is not observed in the CuCr 50 contact. On examining the re-ignition interruption results of the CuW 80 contact, the intensive burning arc is found to be positioned within a possible re-ignition region. When the <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> is longer than 1 ms, the intensive burning arc occurs and affects the breaking performance of the spiral-type contacts. If the DC-arcing stage is prolonged, the total arcing energy increases, which leads to a lower breaking capacity...|$|R

40|$|A digital current-zero {{measuring}} system {{was used to}} monitor about 200 zero crossings of short-line fault currents in three designs of commercial high-voltage circuit breakers. The breakers were subjected to standard IEC 60056 tests in a high-power laboratory.

It was found that only three `free' parameters, extracted from the arc voltage and current during the pre-zero period can describe {{the state of the}} breaker after each test. With this model, the margin of the interrupting capability could be directly obtained. A strong relation between this margin and the arc conductivity at current zero can be established.

40|$|Abstract: CO 2 {{arc welding}} in a {{confined}} space was simulated {{in a laboratory}} by manipulating a welding robot which worked in a small chamber to experimentally evaluate the welder’s exposure to welding fumes, ozone and carbon monoxide (CO). The effects of the welding arc on the air temperature rise and oxygen (O 2) concentration in the chamber were also investigated. The measuring points for these items were located in the presumed breathing zone of a welder in a confined space. The time averaged concentrations of welding fumes, ozone and CO during the <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> were 83. 55 mg/m 3, 0. 203 ppm and 0. 006 %, respectively, at a welding current of 120 A– 200 A. These results suggest serious exposure of a welder who operates in a confined space. Air temperature in the chamber rose remarkably due to the arc heat {{and the increase in}} the welding current. No clear decrease in the O 2 concentration in the chamber was recognized during this welding operation. A model of air duct ventilation was constructed in the small chamber to investigate the strategy of effective ventilation for hazardous welding contaminants in a confined space. With this model we examined ventilation efficiency with a flow rate of 1. 08 – 1. 80 m 3 /min (ventilation rate for 0. 40 – 0. 67 air exchanges per minute) in the chamber, and proved that the exposure level was not drastically reduced during <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> by this air duct ventilation, but the residual contaminants were rapidly exhausted after the welding operation...|$|R

40|$|Air-break {{disconnectors}} (DS) in a high-voltage network can interrupt small capacitive currents (e. g., occurring when disconnecting short unloaded transmission lines, current transformers, and so forth). The {{performance of}} a device with high-velocity opening auxiliary contacts attached to the DS enhancing the interrupting capability is presented. A series of laboratory experiments is carried out with the interrupted current range between 5 and 27 A. The experimental observations include voltage and current characteristics of the DS, and synchronous optical recording of the arc with a high-speed camera. Electrical and optical data are studied for fail and successful interruptions. The results show: 1) The short <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> by the fast opening contacts limits the energy input into the arc, enhancing the probability of arc extinction; 2) the contribution to the arc energy mainly comes from the oscillations upon restrike. The energy input to the arc increases with higher breakdown voltage, larger air gap, and higher interrupted current; 3) the arc brightness is synchronous with arc current. With higher interrupted current, the overall arc is brighter and its remnants decay slower.

5000|$|<b>Arcing</b> <b>time</b> can {{be reduced}} by {{temporarily}} setting upstream protective devices to lower setpoints during maintenance periods, or by employing zone-selective interlocking protection (ZSIP). With zone-selective interlocking, a downstream breaker that detects a fault communicates with an upstream breaker to delay its instantaneous tripping function. In this way [...] "selectivity" [...] will be preserved, in other words faults in the circuit are cleared by the breaker nearest to the fault, minimizing {{the effect on the}} entire system. A fault on a branch circuit will be detected by all breakers upstream of the fault (closer to the source of power). The circuit breaker closest to the downstream fault will send a restraining signal to prevent upstream breakers from tripping instantaneously. The presence of the fault will nevertheless activate the preset trip delay timer(s) of the upstream circuit breaker(s); this will allow an upstream circuit breaker to interrupt the fault, if still necessary after the preset time has elapsed. The ZSIP system allows faster instantaneous trip settings to be used, without loss of selectivity. The faster trip times reduce the total energy in an arc fault discharge.|$|R
