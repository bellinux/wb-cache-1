40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a design framework for variable gain integral controllers {{with the aim}} to improve transient performance of linear motion systems. In particular, {{we focus on the}} well-known tradeoff introduced by integral action, which removes steady-state errors caused by constant external disturbances, but may deteriorate transient performance in terms of increased overshoot. We propose a class of variable gain integral controllers (VGICs), which limits the amount of integral action if the error exceeds a certain threshold, in order to balance this tradeoff in a more desirable manner. The resulting nonlinear controller consists of a loop-shaped linear controller with a variable gain element. The utilization of linear controllers as a basis for the control design appeals to the intuition of motion control engineers therewith enhancing the applicability. For the <b>add-on</b> <b>part</b> of the nonlinear variable gain part of the controller, we propose an optimization strategy, which enables performance-optimal tuning of the variable gain based on measurement data.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis {{is to develop a}} FE-model for the evaluation of dimensional accuracy of aluminium <b>add-on</b> body <b>parts.</b> Besides, the influence of clamping process and welding distortion is taken into account. The focus of the examinations is the determination of the model’s application limits. Considering non-linear contact behaviour and friction, the positioning and clamping are modeled close-to-process. The simulation of welding distortion is based on a simplified mechanical model, in order to save computation time. Welding distortion is induced through a mechanical equivalent load, in linear elastic analysis. An experimental procedure is introduced to determine the mechanical equivalent load. It is based on the balance of experimentally und simulatively determined welding distortion of defined calibration samples. The constraints for the design of calibration samples are identified by analysing the main influential factors of welding distortion of <b>add-on</b> body <b>parts.</b> Proof of the functioning of the coupled simulation model is produced by means of a close to reality designed experimental <b>add-on</b> body <b>part.</b> The modelbased prognosis allows making first predictions regarding the dimensional accuracy of body parts due to the clamping process and welding distortion at an early stage of the product creation process...|$|R

In 2014, KTH Royal Institute of Technology launched the pedagogical developers initiative, appointing part [...] time pedagogical developers among teachers {{from all schools}} of KTH, to implement and strengthen good teaching and learning practices among faculty and students. They are teachers active in different educational programmes, with experience of, and interest in, pedagogical issues. In line with CDIO standard 10, {{the purpose of the}} pedagogical developers’ initiative is to facilitate cooperation and knowledge exchange between faculty members, and to establish communities of practice. The paper presents the activities, processes for developing these activities and preliminary results from the initiative’s second year, which focused much on supporting faculty development by putting into place a series of workshops, a format chosen for its combination of active community-building learning and time efficiency. The topics of the workshops emerged to meet faculty needs identified by the pedagogical developers during the first year. The workshops were created by smaller teams of pedagogical developers from different schools of KTH. This enabled a wide array of experiences and perspectives to be incorporated into the workshops. Main focuses of the workshops have been on creating internal discussions in dynamic communities of practice on specific subjects of interest, and on creating forums for exchange of ideas, open to the whole faculty. During Autumn 2015, the workshops have been offered as voluntary <b>add-on</b> <b>parts</b> of the basic course in teaching and learning offered to faculty at KTH. This first round of workshops generated a positive interest from teachers, and participant feedback indicates that they particularly appreciated the opportunity to work directly with their own courses and the opportunity to discuss pedagogical aspects with peers.   QC 20170306 </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{portable}} {{classroom is}} a necessity for school districts {{across the country in}} need of quick capacity increases. Unfortunately, the standard design too often ignores the basic needs of the students and teachers who will be occupying it. The current design lacks access to good daylight and adequate ventilation, both of which {{have been shown to be}} critical to student performance. In addition, portable classrooms place a strain on shared resources by adding student capacity without increasing the capacity of the supporting infrastructure. Finally, portables are seen as an eyesore, detached from the larger school community. A school should be an inspirational place both visually and mentally, and an uninspiring classroom can have a critical effect on a student's love for learning. The solution to the problem of portables begins with a "better box" - a series of improvements to the standard double-wide portable classroom. But this is not enough. It is neither economically feasible nor environmental responsible to replace the thousands existing portables around the country. A true solution must address the buildings already in existence, not just those yet to come. This proposal includes three retrofit solutions, <b>add-on</b> <b>parts</b> that can be applied to either the new or the old standard designs. The first is a rooftop system that provides controllable daylight and greatly improves ventilation and air quality within the classroom. The second intervention is a new ramp system that helps to shape outdoor space while providing a sense of fun and excitement that is sorely lacking from the current portable design. Finally, a proposed self-contained bathroom unit can provide relief to overtaxed infrastructure without the need for expensive hookups to city water and sewer lines. Through these modular solutions, this thesis aims to give school districts realistic, affordable options that allow them to improve their inevitable portable classrooms where they need it most...|$|R

In the case study of malaria, we report a microfluidic device as part of a continuous-flow cellular impedance spectroscopy system and a new data analysis method to differentiate Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes including the early ring stage. The next parts of this thesis focus on two-dimensional (2 D) materials which are believed to be a tool set for future electronics.

The prototype system shows that use of 2 D material as <b>add-on</b> <b>parts</b> of the conventional technology can lead to development of new types of electronic applications. In addition to combinational uses with Si CMOS technology, 2 D materials and their heterostructures have the potential to be used as stand-alone electronic systems.

40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the total}} energy consumption of new or further developed rail vehicles is still a comprehensive task in the industrial development process. The aerodynamic drag is a dominant part of the driving resistance of today’s rail vehicles. An estimation of the energy consumption therefore requires information of the aerodynamically induced drag. Computational studies of the current state-of-the art {{do not meet the}} high accuracy level required for a reliable {{prediction of}} the total energy consumption of a rail vehicle. Scale model geometries in wind tunnel experiments do not allow for simulating realistic near wall flow conditions as a fundamental aspect to predict friction drag. Besides, no test facilities are available for a full-scale train configuration. Nowadays, coasting tests on a test track are generally used by the industry to predict the aerodynamic drag of rail vehicles. A main disadvantage of coasting tests is the strong impact of the environmental conditions on the measurement results. Therefore, a large number of test runs - associated with high costs - is necessary to produce reliable experimental results. A key interest from industry partners of DLR is the reduction of development costs by increasing the performance of computational studies to predict the aerodynamic drag of a rail vehicle. Besides pressure and vortex drag induced by <b>add-on</b> <b>parts</b> such as the pantograph, the bogies, the inter-car gaps and other supply systems and the pressure drag between the vehicle front and rear end, the major part of aerodynamic drag of a rail vehicle is friction drag {{as a result of the}} developing boundary layer on the train shape defined by the wall shear stress. This article describes an experimental study performed on an electric double-deck train KISS on a test track to measure the wall shear stress under real operating conditions. The results are compared to theoretical values and results published in the literature. The measured wall shear stresses are further used to improve the predictability of computational studies. The idea is to modify the surface rough-ness of the wall boundary condition of the vehicle geometry to reach the same wall shear stress as measured in the experiment. The oil film interferometry as a non-intrusive method to measure the wall shear stress was therefore used in the experiments...|$|R

Besides the many advantages (e. g. high processing speed) laser welding provides, temperature induced distortions are an important task to deal with.

Effective surface based clamping conditions (derived of "the real" clamping device) and effects of previous forming processes are considered.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out details on the {{production}} of late medieval European plate-armour for the field-use. Therefore, the author first collected thousands of extant objects in a database. With this stock of data he then was able to cluster and to structure the armour parts by various typological and technological aspects. To ease the access to the topic, the author defined an understandable and standardized terminology and typology for the different variations of armour parts. The author tried to prime the reader on the topic of armour production by summarizing the history of plate armour under technological aspects. This was followed by a large scale observation, definition and comparison of various armour-features and their making. To complete the picture, the main crafts that supplied <b>add-on</b> <b>parts</b> for the armourer’s products were shortly described. The author then entered the problematic topic of the authenticity question. After a short abstract on the history of armour preservation, metallurgical and art-based approaches to the problem of authenticity were introduced and new aspects on armour making as well as suggestions for future approaches were presented. The examination of a huge number of extant plate armour pieces proofed to be a practical way to find new common structures in the late medieval armour production in central Europe. The development of a standardized data acquisition and its systematic organization enables large scale comparisons that bring new evidence for common features of extant armour pieces. Many drawings, made especially for this study on the basis of the collected data, combine the results of the detail observation in a concrete way. Numerous common or “standardized” features were revealed. Similar to schools of masonry, of painting or of goldsmithing also for the armourer’s art the existence of certain hand or workshop circles can clearly be presumed. For the first time, ridges, rivets and washers, applications, surface decorations, turned edges, marks, measurements, weights and different fastening techniques were classified and used to suggest reconstructions of the historical technology and its development. The explanation on how iron plate material might have been made in the Middle Ages by means of a water powered hammer is discussed for the first time. On the basis of written and depicting sources, but also by ongoing traditions, methods for the mass production of armour by the end of the considered period were described. This study also shows that a lot of questions remain not finally solved. A final decision on an item to be genuine or reproduced can for the most cases not be made. Further research has to be carried out to enhance our knowledge on this delicate issue. The findings of this study do certainly deliver a stable basis for any future approach by any discipline to the topic of late medieval plate armour...|$|R
