Merlot's low acidity {{serves as a}} balance for the higher acidity in many Italian wine grapes with the grape often being used in blends in the Veneto, <b>Alto</b> <b>Adige</b> and Umbria. Global warming is potentially having an influence on Italian Merlot as more cooler-climate regions in northern Italy are being able to ripen the grape successfully while other regions already planted are encountering issues with over-ripeness.|$|E

2500|$|... "If the Germans on {{both sides}} of the Brenner don't toe the line, then the fascists will teach them a thing or two about obedience. <b>Alto</b> <b>Adige</b> is Italian and bilingual, and no one would even dream of trying {{forcibly}} to Italianize these German immigrants. But neither may Germans imagine that they might push Italy back to Salorno and from there to the Lago di Garda. Perhaps the Germans believe that all Italians are like Credaro. If they do, they’re sorely mistaken. In Italy, there are hundreds of thousands of Fascists who would rather lay waste to <b>Alto</b> <b>Adige</b> than to permit the tricolore that flies above the Vetta d’Italia to be lowered. If the Germans have to be beaten and stomped to bring them to reason, then so be it, we’re ready. A lot of Italians have been trained in this business." ...|$|E
