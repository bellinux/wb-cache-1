5|$|From {{an early}} age, Shoup was molded by the {{progressive}} ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives {{fighting against the}} interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism <b>about</b> <b>American</b> foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{offered the}} United States {{access to its}} {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments. He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns <b>about</b> <b>American</b> security. Ironically, it was the British project {{that had already been}} penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear information, but did {{not initially}} combine their efforts.

40|$|Teaching (or learning) {{a foreign}} {{language}} is a complex, interdisciplinary undertaking. Teachers and {{students are required to}} tackle aspects of language that transcend its merely linguistic component. This article discusses the relationship between language, thought and culture, and explores some aspects of the integration of cultural content in the English classroom. To achieve these goals, a study is conducted that identifies the main stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>Americans</b> among Slovenian university students of English as {{a foreign language}}. The results of the research {{can be used as a}} means of questioning some frequent stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>Americans,</b> and thus contributing to the fulfilment of (sometimes seemingly abstract) curricular aims that emphasize the significance of intercultural communication, awareness of cultural variety, and intercultural sensitivity...|$|R

5|$|From 14 December 1942 to 28 January 1943, Devers went on an {{inspection}} {{tour of the}} battlefields in North Africa, taking with him Brigadier Generals Edward H. Brooks and Williston B. Palmer from the Armored Force, and Gladeon M. Barnes from the Ordnance Department. He spoke with key British generals including Harold Alexander, Bernard Montgomery and Richard McCreery, and American commanders including Eisenhower, Patton, Thomas B. Larkin and Orlando Ward. Eisenhower was defensive, suspicious that Marshall may have sent Devers to replace him, and nervous when Devers had critical comments about {{the handling of the}} 1st Armored Division. Devers and his party received a great deal of feedback, both positive and negative <b>about</b> <b>American</b> equipment. Devers noted that the M4 Sherman was superior to the M3 Lee that the 1st Armored Division was equipped with, but urged the development of the more powerful 76mm gun.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft, {{as part of the}} Tizard Mission, briefed American scientists on British developments.

5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing {{the letter to}} the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints <b>about</b> <b>American</b> imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{returned}} to the East Coast in late September 1931. Although he was writing Arctic Village, he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles <b>about</b> <b>American</b> forestry. In particular, he was concerned that few articles of this time {{addressed the issue of}} deforestation, and he {{wrote a letter to the}} president of the American Forestry Association, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation.|$|E
5|$|PBHistory {{documents}} {{were used for}} years afterward to discredit Árbenz (living in exile) and to counter Soviet propaganda <b>about</b> <b>American</b> imperialism in Guatemala. When Árbenz moved to Montevideo in 1957, the CIA used the PBHistory documents to produce a biography of Árbenz that described him as a Soviet agent, {{in an attempt to}} prevent Árbenz from moving to Mexico, where opposition to Castillo Armas' regime was coalescing. Nonetheless, Árbenz remained a symbol of principled resistance to the United States, helped in part by Soviet propaganda to that effect. When some of the PBHistory {{documents were}} published, they received little attention in Latin America. Though PBSUCCESS was viewed positively within the US soon after it occurred, the violence perpetrated by the Guatemalan governments supported by the US in the 1970s and 1980s changed the perception of the coup among the US public.|$|E
5|$|The film became {{embroiled in}} controversy. Upon its {{theatrical}} release, many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of taking liberties with historical facts, including the film's implication that President Lyndon B. Johnson {{was part of}} a coup d'état to kill Kennedy. After a slow start at the box office, the film gradually picked up momentum, earning over $205 million in worldwide gross. JFK was nominated for eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and won two for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing. It was the most successful of three films Stone made <b>about</b> <b>American</b> presidents, followed by Nixon with Anthony Hopkins in the title role and W. with Josh Brolin as George W. Bush.|$|E
