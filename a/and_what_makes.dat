500|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} in architectural criticism {{have investigated the}} relationship between architecture and the body, sexuality, sex, power, and place.

[...] Elizabeth Grosz, however, offers a counter argument to phallocentrism in urban design theories, saying [...] "not so much {{the dominance of the}} phallus as the pervasive unacknowledged use of the male or masculine to represent the human. The problem, then, is not so much to eliminate as to reveal the masculinity inherent in the notion of the universal, the generic human, or the unspecified subject." [...] Marc C.

500|$|P.exclamans {{lives in}} a {{hierarchical}} society with one queen that lays the eggs. However, all of the females have the same morphology {{and they all have}} the physiological capability of taking over the egg laying if necessary (queen death, queen migration). Since the queen has the same morphology {{as the rest of the}} workers in the colony, this raises the question as to how the queen role is assigned <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> her special. Studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose, fructose and trehalose than workers, leading to higher cryoprotectant levels. P.exclamans use these sugars as cryoprotectant, which work by increasing the solute concentration in cells. This results in a greater survivability in colder weather. It was found that queens have a 76% survival rate in [...] weather compared to 17% survival of the workers over a 15-day test period. The queens also have a 0.5mm layer of fat surrounding their bodies. This allows them to live longer into the winter and possibly extend their mating season. The queens seem to be the only ones capable of diapause.|$|E
