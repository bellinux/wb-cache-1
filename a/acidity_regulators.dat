40|$|Whenever {{benzoic acid}} is {{combined}} with ascorbic acid in acidic beverages such as soft drinks, benzene can be formed. To determine the current situation on the Belgian market, a headspace gas chromatographic mass spectrometric method was developed, which needs little to no sample preparation. This method was then used to analyze 134 soft drinks sampled on the Belgian market by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain. Thirty-three percent of the samples contained no detectable benzene, whereas {{the majority of the}} samples (47 %) contained trace amounts below the limit of quantification of the method (0. 3 mu g L- 1). Ten samples were above the European limit for benzene in drinking water of 1 mu g L- 1, and one sample had a concentration of 10. 98 mu g L- 1, thereby exceeding the action limit for benzene in soft drinks of 10 mu g L- 1 discussed at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health of the European Commission.

30|$|KH 2 PO 4 and K 2 HPO 4 {{were used}} in the media because they act as {{buffering}} agents and provide the phosphate necessary for the production of sugar phosphates, nucleic acids, ATP and membrane phospholipids (Deacon [2006]). Sodium citrate or Na 3 C 6 H 5 O 7.2 H 2 O can also act as buffering agents or <b>acidity</b> <b>regulators,</b> resisting changes in pH. KCl was added to maintain the osmotic equilibrium. The inorganic salt, MgSO 4.7 H 2 O, stimulates fungal growth and enhances sporulation. CaCl 2.2 H 2 O provides Ca 2 +, which induces a loose pelleted form of growth and {{plays an important role in}} signal transduction in fungi (Pera and Callieri [1999]; Miller et al. [1990]). Biotin is a cofactor for acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA and is required for the de novo biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids and polyketide biosynthesis (Hasslacher et al. [1993]; Wattanachaisaereekul et al. [2008]). Trace elements supply the Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Mn 2 +, and Fe 2 + required for the functional components of enzymes produced by fungi. Fe 2 + is particularly important in cytochrome P 450 oxidases, which are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Zn 2 + plays a crucial role in stabilizing protein structures (Hanson [2008]).|$|E

40|$|This work {{measures}} {{and tries to}} compare the Antioxidant Capacity (AC) of 50 commercial beverages of different kinds: 6 wines, 12 beers, 18 soft drinks and 14 flavoured waters. Because there is no reference procedure established for this purpose, three different optical methods were used to analyse these samples: Total Radical trapping Antioxidant Parameter (TRAP), Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) and Ferric ion Reducing Antioxidant Parameter (FRAP). These methods differ on the chemical background and nature of redox system. The TRAP method involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms while TEAC and FRAP involves electron transfer reactions. The AC was also assessed against three antioxidants of reference, Ascorbic acid (AA), Gallic acid (GA) and 6 -hydroxy- 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetramethyl- 2 -carboxylic acid (Trolox). The results obtained were analyzed statistically. Anova one-way tests were applied to all results and suggested that methods and standards exhibited significant statistical differences. The possible effect of sample features in the AC, such as gas, flavours, food colouring, sweeteners, <b>acidity</b> <b>regulators,</b> preservatives, stabilizers, vitamins, juice percentage, alcohol percentage, antioxidants and the colour was also investigated. The AC levels seemed to change with brand, kind of antioxidants added, and kind of flavour, depending on the sample. In general, higher ACs were obtained for FRAP as method, and beer for kind of sample, and the standard expressing the smaller AC values was GA...|$|E
