METHODS Mortality data and population estimates 1996 - 2010 {{were obtained from}} the Swiss Federal Statistical Office for Switzerland and the World Health Organization Mortality Database ([URL] for Austria, Germany, France and Italy. Age standardised mortality rates (ASMRs, European standard) per 100 000 person-years were calculated for the population < 75 years old by sex for the following groups of cancer deaths: (1) avoidable through primary prevention; (2) avoidable through early detection and treatment; (3) avoidable through improved treatment and medical care; and (4) remaining cancer deaths. To assess time trends in ASMRs, estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated. RESULTS In Switzerland and neighbouring countries cancer mortality in persons < 75 years old continuously decreased 1996 - 2010. <b>Avoidable</b> cancer <b>mortality</b> decreased in all groups of avoidable cancer deaths in both sexes, with one exception. ASMRs for causes avoidable through primary prevention increased in females in all countries (in Switzerland from 16. 2 to 20. 3 per 100 000 person years, EAPC 2. 0 [95 % CI 1. 4 to 2. 6]). Compared with its neighbouring countries, Switzerland showed the lowest rates for all groups of <b>avoidable</b> cancer <b>mortality</b> in males 2008 - 2010.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia {{has been}} the focus of {{considerable}} investment in pandemic influenza preparedness. Given the wide variation in socio-economic conditions, health system capacity across the region is likely to impact to varying degrees on pandemic mitigation operations. We aimed to estimate and compare the resource gaps, and potential mortalities associated with those gaps, for responding to pandemic influenza within and between six territories in Asia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected health system resource data from Cambodia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bali), Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. We applied a mathematical transmission model to simulate a "mild-to-moderate" pandemic influenza scenario to estimate resource needs, gaps, and attributable mortalities at province level within each territory. The results show that wide variations exist in resource capacities between and within the six territories, with substantial mortalities predicted as a result of resource gaps (referred to here as "avoidable" mortalities), particularly in poorer areas. Severe nationwide shortages of mechanical ventilators were estimated to be a major cause of <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortalities</b> in all territories except Taiwan. Other resources (oseltamivir, hospital beds and human resources) are inequitably distributed within countries. Estimates of resource gaps and <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortalities</b> were highly sensitive to model parameters defining the transmissibility and clinical severity of the pandemic scenario. However, geographic patterns observed within and across territories remained similar for the range of parameter values explored. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have important implications for where (both geographically and in terms of which resource types) investment is most needed, and the potential impact of resource mobilization for mitigating the disease burden of an influenza pandemic. Effective mobilization of resources across administrative boundaries could go some way towards minimizing avoidable deaths...|$|R

5000|$|Population {{health has}} been defined as"the health {{outcomes}} {{of a group of}} individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group". It is an approach to health that aims to improve the health of an entire human population. This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are [...] "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions". [...] A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the social determinants of health, SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations. The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream medicine. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of public health agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, reported in 2008, that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries.

Comparison with Paris, Inner London and Manhattan was performed, and we discussed the findings in terms of prevention programmes, ethnicity and lifestyles. Methods: Mortality and population data by age and gender were obtained from vital statistics sources. Two periods, 1999 - 2003 and 2004 - 06, were selected for analysis. Negative binomial regression and logistic regression were used to model, respectively, the number and proportion of <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality,</b> in relation to age and gender. Results: The standardized total mortality rates (per 1000 population) were 2. 51 in the period 1999 - 2003 and 2. 25 in the period 2004 - 06, whereas the standardized <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> rates (per 1000 population) were 0. 85 and 0. 77 for the two periods, respectively. Cerebrovascular disease (stroke) was the leading cause of <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality.</b> Women in the age range of 65 - 74 years had the highest <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> proportion.

40|$|Background: During the 1990 s, Italy {{underwent}} {{significant changes}} in its National Health System including decentralization of health policy responsibilities to regional administrations, introduction of internal markets and increasing, in some regions, {{of the private sector}} role in delivering healthcare. We compared the effectiveness of private- and public-sector healthcare expenditure on <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> (deaths that should not occur in the presence of effective medical care). Methods: We calculated the average rate of change in age-standardised <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> rates in 19 of Italy’s regions from 1993 to 2003. Multivariate regression models were used to analyse the relationship between rates of change in <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> and levels of public versus private healthcare expenditure, controlling for potential demographic and economic confounders. Results: Greater per capita spending on public delivery of health services corresponded to higher reductions in <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> rates. Per capita private health expenditure had no effect on <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> in most regions and was associated with less progress in reducing <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> in other ones. After correcting for differences in each region’s per capita income, we found that 10 % additional public spending on National Health Service delivery was associated with a 3. 1 % reduction in <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> rate (p< 0. 001). Private health expenditure, by contrast, had no statistically significant effect on <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> rates (p = 0. 489). A higher private health expenditure as percentage of the total health expenditure was associated with higher <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> (p< 0. 001). As a control exercise, we found that neither public nor private healthcare spending was significantly associated with non-avoidable mortality, plausibly because non-avoidable mortality is less sensitive to healthcare services. Conclusion: Public healthcare delivery was significantly associated with greater progress in reducing <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> rates, whereas private spending related to less progress in reducing <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> across time in Italy’s regions.

Against this backdrop, we assessed the value of healthcare spending growth in 14 western countries between 1996 and 2006. We estimated macro-level health production functions using <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> as outcome measure. <b>Avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> comprises deaths from certain conditions "that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective healthcare". We investigated the relationship between total <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> and healthcare spending using descriptive analyses and multiple regression models, focussing on within-country variation and growth rates. We aimed {{to take into account the}} role of potential confounders and dynamic effects such as time lags. Additionally, we explored a method to estimate macro-level cost-effectiveness. We found an average yearly <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> decline of 2. 6 - 5. 3 % across countries. Simultaneously, healthcare spending rose between 1. 9 and 5. 9 % per year. Most countries with above-average spending growth demonstrated above-average reductions in <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality.</b> The regression models showed a significant association between contemporaneous and lagged healthcare spending and <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality.</b> The time-trend, representing an exogenous shift of the health production function, reduced the impact of healthcare spending.

This {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the differences in risk factors for hospital mortality among MI patients with and without stroke history. Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective, cohort study; 20, 750 new patients with MI from April, 2012 to March, 2013 were followed up and their data were analyzed according to having or not having the stroke history. Stroke and MI were defined based on the World Health Organization’s definition. The data were analyzed by logistic regression in STATA software. Results: Of the 20, 750 studied patients, 4293 had stroke history. The prevalence of stroke in the studied population was derived 20. 96 % (confidence interval [CI] 95 %: 20. 13 - 21. 24). Of the patients, 2537 (59. 1 %) had ST-elevation MI (STEMI). Mortality ratio in patients with and without stroke was obtained 18. 8 % and 10. 3 %, respectively. The prevalence of risk factors in MI patients with and without a stroke is various. The adjusted odds ratio of mortality in patients with stroke history was derived 7. 02 (95 % CI: 5. 42 - 9) for chest pain resistant to treatment, 2. 39 (95 % CI: 1. 97 - 2. 9) for STEMI, 3. 02 (95 % CI: 2. 5 - 3. 64) for lack of thrombolytic therapy, 2. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 66 - 2. 91) for heart failure, and 2. 17 (95 % CI: 1. 6 - 2. 9) for ventricular tachycardia.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine socioeconomic differences between those patients who die of avoidable causes and those who do not die. METHODS: A matched case-control study was carried out regarding in-hospital <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> (Holland's medical care indicators) that occurred in a university hospital serving a Spanish-Mediterranean population during a 30 -month period. RESULTS: We studied 82 cases of death from avoidable causes and 300 controls matched on medical care indicators and age. The variables that showed a statistically significant association with in-hospital <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> were number of diagnoses (the greater the number, the higher the risk), length of stay (patients staying seven or more days presented a lower risk), and education. Those patients with low and middle educational levels showed a greater risk of <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> (adjusted odds ratio= 3. 57 and 2. 82, respectively) than those patients with higher levels of education. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the findings of studies based on aggregate data, our case-control analyses indicated that among several socioeconomic variables studied, educational level was significantly associated with the risk of in-hospital <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality,</b> regardless of age and medical care indicators.

40|$|This {{working paper}} from the National Centre for Epidemiology & Population Health investigates {{the extent to which}} health care has contributed to the decline in {{mortality}} rates in Australia over recent decades by examining trends in <b>avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> between 1968 and 2001. <b>Avoidable</b> <b>mortality</b> refers to deaths from certain conditions that are considered to be largely avoidable given timely and effective health care...|$|E
40|$|This book {{is closed}} access. This seminal {{work is the}} first fully to engage human {{security}} with power in the international system. It represents global governance not as impartial, but as asymmetrical and violent towards those it marginalises through its Liberal control technologies, representing a biopolitical mechanism that in turn engineers biopoverty. In bypassing the usual thinking about narrow and broad understandings of human security, the book responds to recent critiques of the human security concept as incoherent by identifying and prioritizing transnational human populations facing life-ending contingencies en masse. Having done this, it evolves a bottom-up approach to reduce <b>avoidable</b> infant <b>mortality</b> that redirects World Bank lending strategies towards the mobilization of indigenous private sector provision of water and sanitation. Roberts offers a powerful critique of global governance as an ideational norm, and in practical terms, proposes human security policies that transcend borders without violating sovereignty, focused on the most lethally-exposed people in the worl...|$|R
40|$|Access to {{medications}} for chronic disease management {{is limited in}} many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), resulting in suboptimal care and <b>avoidable</b> morbidity and <b>mortality.</b> We performed a survey of COPD and asthma medicines that appeared on the national essential medicines lists (NEMLs) of 32 LMICs. Nearly all countries (> 90 %) had assigned essential medicines for treatment of exacerbations and early stable disease stages, but not for steps 4 (22 %) and 5 (6 %) controlled asthma management. The number of treatment options was limited, with long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABA) and combination dosage forms being notably absent. Suboptimal availability of chronic respiratory disease medicines suggests that implementation of NEMLs is the main problem in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Bone cement {{implantation}} syndrome (BCIS) {{is poorly}} understood. It {{is an important}} cause of intraoperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cemented hip arthroplasty and may also {{be seen in the}} postoperative period in a milder form causing hypoxia and confusion. Hip arthroplasty is becoming more common in an ageing population. The older patient may have co-existing pathologies which can increase the likelihood of developing BCIS. This article reviews the definition, incidence, clinical features, risk factors, aetiology, pathophysiology, risk reduction, and management of BCIS. It is possible to identify high risk groups of patients in which <b>avoidable</b> morbidity and <b>mortality</b> may be minimized by surgical selection for uncemen-ted arthroplasty. Invasive anaesthetic monitoring should be considered during cemented arthroplasty in high risk patients...|$|R
