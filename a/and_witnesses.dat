The issue has also led to scrutiny on detainee treatment by other Canadian departments and the armed forces of other nations.|$|E

5|$|During the race, nine riders were {{excluded}} because of, among other actions, illegal use of cars or trains.

5|$|Following {{his capture}} Noriega was {{transferred}} to a cell in the Miami federal courthouse, where he was arraigned on the ten charges which the Miami grand jury had returned 2 years earlier.

Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives.
