25|$|Problems with Senge's vision {{include a}} failure to fully <b>appreciate</b> <b>and</b> {{incorporate}} the imperatives that animate modern organizations; the relative sophistication of the thinking he requires of managers (and whether many in practice are up to it); and questions regarding his treatment of organizational politics. It is certainly difficult to find real-life examples of learning organizations (Kerka 1995). There {{has also been a}} lack of critical analysis of the theoretical framework.|$|E

25|$|The {{festival of}} Deepavali {{has begun to}} find {{acceptance}} in the broader British national consciousness as more non-Hindus <b>appreciate</b> <b>and</b> celebrate Hinduism on this occasion. Hindus celebrate all over the UK which also brings an understanding to different cultures {{for the rest of}} the community. Over the past decade national and civic leaders such as Prince Charles have attended Diwali celebrations at some of the UK's prominent Hindu temples, such as the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, using the occasion to commend the Hindu community's contributions to British life. In 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife joined thousands of worshipers at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden to celebrate Diwali and the Annakut festival marking the Hindu New Year. Since 2009, Diwali has been celebrated every year at 10 Downing Street, the residence of the British Prime Minister. The yearly celebration, begun by Gordon Brown and continued by David Cameron, is one of the most anticipated events hosted by the British Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|The Norman Hauteville family, {{who were}} {{descendants}} of Vikings, came to <b>appreciate</b> <b>and</b> admire {{the rich and}} layered culture in which they now found themselves. And they began implementing their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily also adopted some of the attributes of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, {{and even in the}} presence of palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem. The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of Córdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued {{in the language of the}} community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, still with heavy Arab and Greek influence. The governance was by the rule of law, so there was justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together to form a society that historians have said created some of the most extraordinary buildings that the world has ever seen.|$|E
25|$|Mormonism {{teaches that}} the purpose of life on Earth is to gain {{knowledge}} and experience and to have joy. Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow. The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise, rather the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to <b>appreciate</b> <b>and</b> choose good and reject evil. Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world, so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.|$|E

25|$|The {{return to}} {{democracy}} allowed Peruvians {{to choose among}} strongly left, strongly conservative, or middle-of-the-road parties. They chose Belaúnde and his party as the middle road, but it led nowhere. The Belaúnde government tried to return the economy to a more open system by reducing barriers to imports, implementing financial reforms intended to foster private markets, and reversing the statist orientation of the Velasco system. But the new approach {{never had a chance}} to get very far because of a series of macroeconomic problems. On one side, the government was rightly concerned about continuing inflation but made the mistake of focusing the explanation on monetary growth arising from the export surplus it inherited at the start. That position made it seem undesirable to continue trying to promote exports and desirable to raise domestic spending and imports. On the other side, President Belaúnde's personal and political objectives included using public investment actively to develop the interior of the country and to answer evident needs for improved infrastructure. Seeing the export surplus as the key macroeconomic source of imbalance, the government decided to eliminate it by removing import restrictions, slowing nominal devaluation to allow the real exchange rate to <b>appreciate,</b> <b>and</b> increasing government investment spending.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} film's plot originated when veteran Indian writer Dayanand Rajan {{claimed that the}} plot of the film was plagiarised from his unpublished novel Summer Snow. It's shocking that the main plot, the love story, the hero being wheelchair-bound due to an accident and even the mercy killing are the same as in the movie. The other similarities include a serious accident, in both the scripts, which require the protagonist to begin using a wheelchair and introduce him to the woman taking care of him – it is the nurse who falls in love with Hrithik, while in the novel it is his wife who looks after him. Both scripts having key flashback scenes and the woman supporting mercy killing for the hero. Raajan has dashed off a legal notice to the producers, UTV and Bhansali asking them for an explanation on how their film has so many similarities with his novel but Bhansali's office refused to accept the notice. In late-October, a PIL was filed by Aditya Dewan, a lawyer, in Delhi High Court alleging that Guzaarish promotes euthanasia or mercy killing, which is illegal, and portrays the legal profession in bad light. He demanded a disclaimer from the producers saying mercy killing is not legal in India {{and that there is a}} debate on whether such deaths can be allowed. But the case was dismissed by the court saying the facts averred were inadequate for the court to <b>appreciate</b> <b>and</b> that it cannot be entertained in its present form..|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{submissions}} began almost immediately, as did {{short story}} submissions with lesbian themes. Book reviews of current paperbacks were regular features, including a heated exchange in print between contributors to The Ladder and author Marijane Meaker as Ann Aldrich from 1957 to 1963. Meaker {{had written the}} immensely successful Spring Fire in 1952 under the name Vin Packer and was known to the Daughters of Bilitis. Meaker's books We Walk Alone from 1955 and We, Too, Must Love from 1958 were her version of Donald Webster Cory's The Homosexual in America, a nonfiction account published in 1951 {{about what it was}} like to live as a gay man in the US. Meaker's books, published by Gold Medal Books, were distributed all over the US, and gave people in remote places an idea of what it was like to live as a lesbian. The books, however, were not particularly sympathetic to lesbians, and Del Martin and Barbara Grier took issue with Meaker's portrayals. They began to criticize the books in The Ladder and suggest that Meaker was expressing self-hatred in the books. Del Martin wrote to Meaker personally in 1958, giving her a free subscription to the magazine. Meaker's reach to women was much broader through the distribution of her books, and she received so much mail from women asking for resources and support that she was unable to respond to all of it, so she referred the letter writers to the Daughters of Bilitis. However, in print, Meaker responded to the open letters to her in The Ladder in her next book Carol in a Thousand Cities in 1960, by skewering the magazine's amateurish homemade appearance, fiction and poetry she did not <b>appreciate,</b> <b>and</b> the ideas presented in the magazine. Again, The Ladder responded, once more calling Meaker's loyalties into question. However negative Carol in a Thousand Cities was to The Ladder, it was major advertising for the DOB and letters poured in for them from all over the U.S.|$|E

In 1973, he traveled to India to meet a final time with Swami Muktananda in hopes of being recognized as a [...] "Mahasiddha", or fully enlightened sage. They disagreed on a series of questions Adi Da had prepared. This effectively ended their relationship, and they went on to later disparage each other's relative level of spiritual accomplishment. Adi Da nevertheless stated that he continued to <b>appreciate</b> <b>and</b> respect Muktananda as his onetime teacher.|$|E
500|$|Ashfield {{considered}} that Pick possessed [...] "a sterling character and steadfast loyalty", and [...] "an administrative ability which was outstanding", with [...] "a keen analytical mind which {{was able to}} seize upon essentials and then drive his way through to his goal, always strengthened by a sure knowledge {{of the problem and}} confidence in himself." [...] Charles Holden described Pick's management of meetings: [...] "Here his decisions were those of a benevolent dictator, and the members left the meeting with a clear sense of a task to be performed, difficult, perhaps, and sometimes impossible, as might subsequently prove to be, but usually well worth exploring if only in producing convincing proof of obstacles. Out of these exploratory methods there often emerged new and most interesting solutions, which Pick was quick to <b>appreciate,</b> <b>and</b> to adopt in substitution for his own proposals." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{occupier}} has a less onerous duty {{towards a}} person [...] "in {{the exercise of}} his calling", such as a professional or somebody exercising a trade. Section 2(3)(b) of the Act provides that such a person [...] "will <b>appreciate</b> <b>and</b> guard against any special risks ordinarily incidental to , {{so far as the}} occupier leaves him free to do so". In Roles v Nathan 2 All ER 908 a pair of chimney sweeps were called to clean the flues of a boiler. The engineer warned them about the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning if the chimney sweeps cleaned the flues with the fires still lit, but they disregarded his warning and continued until they were overwhelmed by carbon monoxide and died. The Court of Appeal held that the occupier was not liable, because the chimney sweeps had been warned and a householder who calls in a specialist to deal with defective property can reasonably expect the specialist to guard against any obvious dangers.|$|E

500|$|In early February, ECB {{president}} Mario Draghi {{agreed that}} {{expansionary monetary policy}} like QE have not been undertaken to deliberately cause devaluation. Draghi's statement did however hint that the ECB may take action if the Euro continues to <b>appreciate,</b> <b>and</b> this saw {{the value of the}} European currency fall considerably. A mid February statement from the G7 affirmed the advanced economies commitment to avoid currency war. It was initially read by the markets as an endorsement of Japan's actions, though later clarification suggested the US would like Japan to tone down some of its language, specifically by not linking policies like QE to an expressed desire to devalue the Yen. Most commentators have asserted that if a new round of competitive devaluation occurs it would be harmful for the global economy. [...] However some analysts have stated that Japan's planned actions could be in the long term interests {{of the rest of the}} world; just as he did for the 2010–11 incident, economist Barry Eichengreen has suggested that even if many other countries start intervening against their currencies it could boost growth worldwide, as the effects would be similar to semi-coordinated global monetary expansion. Other analysts have expressed skepticism about the risk of a war breaking out, with Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, advising that: [...] "A real currency war remains a remote possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Robin Oliver of The Sydney Morning Herald praised Davies {{for taking}} [...] "an adult {{approach}} {{to one of}} television's most famous characters" [...] that children would <b>appreciate,</b> <b>and</b> that he reinvented {{it in a way}} that would be [...] "competitive in a high-tech market". Oliver also wrote that older viewers would find Eccleston [...] "easily the best time lord since Tom Baker". Reviewing the first episode, The Stages Harry Venning hailed it as a [...] "fabulous, imaginative, funny and sometimes frightening reinvention" [...] and particularly praised Rose for being an improvement upon previous female companions who were [...] "fit only to scream or be captured". However, he found Eccleston to be [...] "the show’s biggest disappointment" [...] as he looked [...] "uncomfortable playing fantasy". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan found the final episode anticlimactic, but overall said that the series was [...] "excellent Saturday night telly of the kind that many of us thought the BBC had forgotten how to make". He praised Eccleston's performance and named [...] "The Empty Child" [...] and [...] "The Doctor Dances" [...] as the best episodes. Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the series a grade of A-, praising its variety. However, he was critical of Davies' [...] "annoying tendency to play to the lowest common denominator with toilet humor", but felt that from [...] "Dalek" [...] on the series was more dramatic and sophisticated.|$|E
500|$|While in Germany, Holst reappraised his {{professional}} life, and in 1903 {{he decided to}} abandon orchestral playing to concentrate on composition. His earnings as a composer were too little to live on, {{and two years later}} he accepted the offer of a teaching post at James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich, which he held until 1921. He also taught at the Passmore Edwards Settlement, where among other innovations he gave the British premieres of two Bach cantatas. The two teaching posts for which he is probably best known were director of music at St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith, from 1905 until his death, and director of music at Morley College from 1907 to 1924. Vaughan Williams wrote of the former establishment: [...] "Here he did away with the childish sentimentality which schoolgirls were supposed to <b>appreciate</b> <b>and</b> substituted Bach and Vittoria; a splendid background for immature minds." [...] Several of Holst's pupils at St Paul's went on to distinguished careers, including the soprano Joan Cross, and the oboist and cor anglais player Helen Gaskell. Of Holst's impact on Morley College, Vaughan Williams wrote: [...] " [...] bad tradition had to be broken down. The results were at first discouraging, but soon a new spirit appeared and the music of Morley College, together with its offshoot the 'Whitsuntide festival'... became {{a force to be reckoned}} with". Before Holst's appointment, Morley College had not treated music very seriously (Vaughan Williams's [...] "bad tradition"), and at first Holst's exacting demands drove many students away. He persevered, and gradually built up a class of dedicated music-lovers.|$|E
