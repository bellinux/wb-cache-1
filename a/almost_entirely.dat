50|$|Native Wetland Garden: This {{garden was}} created to invite wading birds and other {{wildlife}} into the area. The plants here are <b>almost</b> all <b>entirely</b> native.

50|$|Agriculture {{remained}} as the county's prime economic activity, but farming became a large-scale corporate enterprise, with small family farms rapidly disappearing. Coal mining decreased, and has <b>almost</b> disappeared <b>entirely.</b> Buildings and structures related to coal mining were torn down as they wasted away, {{so that there}} is now little to see of this once-major industry.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to some of}} the other cyst-forming tumors of the pancreas (such as the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and the mucinous cystic neoplasm), serous cystic neoplasms are <b>almost</b> always <b>entirely</b> benign. There are some exceptions; rare case reports have described isolated malignant serous cystadenocarcinomas. In addition, serous cystic neoplasms slowly grow, and if they grow large enough they can press on adjacent organs and cause symptoms.|$|R

5|$|For unknown reasons, Ruisdael <b>almost</b> <b>entirely</b> stopped dating {{his work}} from 1653.

Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely based on detective work and speculation.|$|E

50|$|Rock gongs {{are often}} large {{dolerite}} rocks; Fagg describes examples that weigh {{up to several}} tons. They are <b>almost</b> always <b>entirely</b> solid, as playing rocks in other such states {{would result in a}} hollow and less metallic tone. Fagg identifies that the tone produced by the vibrating rock is not necessarily influenced {{by the size of the}} rock, provided that the resonating stone is not dampened by the solid earth.|$|R
