40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of 5 E learning model on three seventh grade students’ <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning. The students’ <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> “remembering what s/he learned”, “the goal of learning” and “encountering the difficulty in learning” before and after the application of 5 E model is presented. Data was gathered through these students’ scores on the scale of “Deep <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> Learning” and “Surface <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> Learning”. Pre and post interviews were also conducted with the students. The results show that the change in students’ <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning varies from each other. Two of the three students used both “deep approaches” and “surface approaches” to learning before the application of 5 E model, then the students developed their <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning deeply. The third student maintained both “deep approach” and “surface approach” to learning. The reason why two of the three students changed their <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning deeply is that through 5 E learning model, these students become active participants in the process of learning. This study also indicates that creating the constructivist learning environment may not cause the same effects for each of these students. Longitudinal studies should be designed <b>to</b> change students’ <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning deeply...|$|R

40|$|Achievement goals predict {{learning}} {{in children and}} young adults, but {{it is unclear whether}} they apply to older adults and how they are related <b>to</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> studying. An online survey examined achievement goals, <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> studying and academic attainment in distance learners. The Achievement Goals Questionnaire-Revised and the <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> Learning and Studying Inventory were given to 2000 students, yielding 1211 responses. The findings confirmed the 2 [*]×[*] 2 model of mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals in adult distance learners. Mastery goals were positively associated with deep and strategic <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> studying but negatively associated with a surface approach. Performance goals showed only weak associations with <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> studying. Performance-approach goals were positively related to attainment, performance-avoidance goals were negatively related to attainment, but mastery goals were unrelated to attainment. The relationship between achievement goals and attainment was partly but not wholly mediated by <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> studying...|$|R

High learner self concept was positively associated with Deep <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning and with classrooms perceived as high in Personalisation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a conceptual, research-in-progress {{study of the}} nature and role of {{communication}} in IT implementation projects. The paper considers different <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> the implementation of change and to communication, and argues that scant attention is given to the design of communication approaches and strategies suitable for IT projects and other change initiatives. Arguments are developed to suggest that the most frequently used <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> both implementation and communication are the least likely to be perceived to be successful, and those <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> implementation and communication associated with greater acceptance of change {{are less likely to be}} used. We then map different <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> implementation against different <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> communication and argue that designing participative <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> both implementation and communication are likely to result in better outcomes. The resulting conceptual model of communication approaches is then discussed with reference to a planned action research study of an enterprise system (ES) implementation in a global manufacturing company...|$|R

40|$|Aims and Objectives: <b>Approaches</b> <b>to</b> {{learning}} {{refer to}} {{the manner in which}} students engage in learning tasks. Approaches encompass two signficant aspects of learning - motivation to learn and the choice of learning strategies that students make. Research has identfied two distinctly different approaches that can be broadly categorised as deep or surface <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning. A number of studies have established an association between deep <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning and qualitatively better learning outcomes, which are characterised by a high level of understanding. Although recent increases in graduate admissions have clouded the issues somewhat, medical students, on entry to undergraduate medicine programs are the highest achieving group among their peers. How do their <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning &# 64257;t the paradigm? Are they consistently deep learners? This article explores the literature on <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning.
