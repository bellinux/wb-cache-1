5000|$|In 1638 two brothers, Sigismund and Christoff Greiff, {{who lived}} in Kaltern and were on good terms with the friary at Bolzano, {{proposed}} {{the establishment of a}} Franciscan friary in Kaltern and secured the agreement of the local council for their idea. The Tyrolean regent Claudia de' Medici was a keen supporter of the Franciscan movement, and on 17 March 1638 she provided the ruined castle, [...] "Schloss Rottenburg", as a site for the new foundation. [...] Local support was evident on 29 May 1639 when Franciscans and more than a thousand Christians from Kaltern and the surrounding district processed to the site and planted a cross on it. A plan to restore the ruined castle for use as a friary was soon abandoned on cost grounds, and the ruins were instead torn down in 1640. A new foundation stone was set in place on 27 March 1640 and the <b>accommodation</b> <b>section</b> of the conventual buildings was built on the site the same year with a large amount of the necessary labour provided by the townsfolk. [...] The friary church was added during 1642 and 1643, and dedicated to Saint Claudia.

40|$|This report {{examines}} the nature, the limits and {{potential of the}} principle of integration as a two-way process of mutual accommodation between migrants and the receiving societies. It assesses the extent to which this key principle, which lays at the foundation of the EU framework on integration, is implemented in practice by investigating how it informs national programmes supported by the European integration fund. The report stems from research undertaken by CEPS for the project “Integration as a two-way process in the EU? Assessing the European Integration Fund and the Common Basic Principles on Integration”. The research aims at identifying ways to enhance the use and oversight of European funding for the development of integration policies and activities at the national, regional and local levels. The authors put forward recommendations for evidence-based policy-making within the EU framework on integration and for improving the use of European funding for integration measures at national level. The recommendations include concrete steps to ensure that European funding primarily serves to put into practice a European approach to integration that is understood as a two-way process in which not only migrants but also the receiving societies – including civil society, social partners and multi-level public authorities – participate and interact. This report is divided into six sections. Section 2 outlines the scope and methodology of our study. It first offers a synthesised summary of the main substantive and financial components of the EU framework on integration. The section underlines the need to consider the close connectivity between the CBPs and the EIF in determining the impact of the EU framework on integration before presenting the specifics of our assessment. Section 3 provides some observations regarding the national implementation of the EIF, along {{with some of the most}} notable difficulties that have been identified as amounting to barriers to accessing the EIF. It is based on the outcomes of the desk research and consultation with the integration actors, which took place through a qualitative survey. Section 4 assesses the ways in which the EIF has been used to support the integration strategies developed within the member states. Important trends in the activities funded are highlighted and the pitfalls of such usage are presented. Section 5 is devoted to the two-way process tenet and to its possible practical translations. After an overview of the emergence of this principle in EU policy, the relevance of the EIF in supporting activities sustaining the principle is examined prior to an analysis of what, according to prominent stakeholders, constitutes a two-way process of mutual <b>accommodation.</b> <b>Section</b> 6 concludes and puts forward a set of policy recommendations to facilitate the promotion and application of the understanding of integration as a two-way process in the EU through the EIF...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Presupposition {{accommodation}} is {{the process}} by which the context is adjusted quietly and without fuss to accept the utterance of a sentence that imposes certain requirements on the context in which it is processed. In this paper, I explore some questions about accommodation that are still often asked. There are complaints that the putative process involves mysterious magic and that it is posited only to save a superfluous or wrong theory of presupposition. I argue that these complaints are mistaken: accommodation is not magic and is needed. The paper has two parts: 1. Sections 1 – 4 explain the common ground theory of presupposition and defend the need for and the propriety of <b>accommodation.</b> 2. <b>Sections</b> 5 – 7 address some further questions about accommodation and are somewhat more speculative...|$|R

40|$|Summary This {{bachelor}} {{thesis on}} the topic Choice of accommodation for a student not living in Prague consists of two parts. The first part deals with a literature review whereas the second part is analytical. The literature review and analytical section are further divided into chapters and subchapters. The literature review was used to explain the basic terms and methods which {{are related to the}} multi-criteria decision. At the beginning of the literature review emphasis is placed on defining and explaining of key components of multi-criteria analysis, concerning particularly the clarification of terms criteria and variants. At the end of the literature review is included a thorough explanation of the AHP method, which is also used in the analytical part. The analytical section starts with the presentation of criteria and variants of accomodation choice, which were used {{with the assistance of the}} AHP method. This method is supposed to determine which option is best suited for a given model student of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. The following chapters introduce two model students and their demands for <b>accommodation.</b> Other <b>sections</b> contain detailed compromise variant calculations for both students followed by the final result comparison. The conclusion summarizes the results of applied methods and conclusions are drawn from the results...|$|R
5000|$|The Majors and Whittier Terrace courts {{established}} the foundational principles that a tenant can be [...] "otherwise qualified" [...] under Section 504 despite {{an inability to}} comply with a [...] "no pets" [...] policy, and that a waiver of a [...] "no pets" [...] policy can be a reasonable <b>accommodation</b> under <b>Section</b> 504. However, several courts have consistently held that a tenant requesting an emotional support animal as a reasonable accommodation must demonstrate a relationship between his or her ability to function and the companionship of the animal. This required nexus between the disability and the emotional support animal has been refined by several courts. For instance, in Janush v. Charities Housing Development Corp (N.D. Ca., 2000), the U.S. Northern District Court of California held the reasonable accommodation is a fact-based, and not species-based, issue. In Nason v. Stone Hill Realty Association (1996), a Massachusetts trial court recognized that there were more reasonable accommodations to lessen the effects of a person's disability, other than keeping an emotional support animal, and therefore denied the tenant's motion for preliminary injunction. Courts have held the emotional distress expected to occur if a person is forced to give up his or her emotional support animal will not support a reasonable accommodation claim.|$|R
