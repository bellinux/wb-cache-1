5|$|Above ground, American and Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had escaped death or capture tried {{to escape from the}} North Vietnamese. From the team house, a group of four <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was no visible sign of the North Vietnamese. Without much difficulty, the <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> the CIDG soldiers were able {{to make it through the}} barbed-wire barrier, but North Vietnamese soldiers on the eastern side of the camp had detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge in a dry creek bed that offered some cover and concealment. At around 03:30am, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his request was turned down. In an attempt to save the defenders at Lang Vei, Company C Headquarters in Da Nang tried to call for reinforcements from the Marines at Khe Sanh, but its request was also turned down. Finally, Company C Headquarters placed another Mobile Strike Force Company and a company-sized unit on standby alert in Da Nang, to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available.|$|E

40|$|Japanese {{corporations}} <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations take {{different approaches}} {{when it comes}} to business in China in general : (i) American corporations are concentrated in the music, motion picture, and software industries, so they have a particular interest in solving copyright infringement problems; (ii) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations have started to actively use China as a base for research and development; <b>and</b> (iii) many <b>American</b> corporations have clear China-specific technological strategies. The systems for managing intellectual property in China also differ among Japanese corporations <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations : (i) whether <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations have an IP department depends on the individual corporations overall management policies; (ii) locally hired employees managing intellectual property in <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations are usually the ones entrusted with important IP-related duties; (iii) there are many requirements for employment and the remuneration is high for locally hired employees managing intellectual property in <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations; and (iv) relatively few Japanese corporations attribute intellectual property rights to their subsidiaries in China. Various aspects also differentiate Japanese corporations <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations in terms of the measures they take to combat counterfeit products : (i) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations show a similar trend as Japanese corporations toward taking administrative enforcement measures or civil proceedings, but a trend toward using criminal proceedings is emerging among <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations; (ii) in <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations, internal employees often prepare warning letters, conduct research, and collect evidence; (iii) the budget of <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations for measures to combat counterfeit products is far greater than that of Japanese corporations; (iv) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations are active in exchanging information with and collecting information from governments; <b>and</b> (v) <b>American</b> corporations emphasize using estimated amounts of damages and quantifying the effectiveness of their measures to combat counterfeit products. Two key points stand out as being essential when considering measures to combat leakages of technology and infringements of trade secrets : (A) that good personnel management is effective as a measure for combating the leakage of technology and the infringement of trade secrets; and (B) that good information management is essential for preventing technology leakages and trade secret infringements. Many differences are evident between Japanese corporations <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations with respect to these measures : (i) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations are more active than Japanese corporations in willfully transferring technology to China; (ii) Japanese corporations are considerably less popular in China than <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations; (iii) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations are more progressive in terms of assigning managerial powers to Chinese management personnel; (iv) the level of compensation offered at Japanese corporations in China is considerably lower than that offered at <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations in China; (v) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations in China engage in corporate PR in many different ways, but Japanese corporations in China do not do enough; (vi) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations employ various initiatives to increase the motivation of Chinese personnel; and (vii) Regulations at <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations provide severe punishment for personnel who divulge secrets. Japanese corporations <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations take different approaches {{when it comes to}} strategies for intellectual property and preventing technology leakage in China. But it is important that Japan adopts the good aspects of the methods used by <b>American</b> <b>and</b> European corporations {{at the same time as}} it continues to collaborate and cooperate with international institutions, governments, and anti-counterfeiting organizations. ...|$|R
