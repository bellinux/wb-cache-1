5|$|Newnes {{stipulated that}} Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} must sail under the British flag, and be styled the British Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink readily agreed to this, even though {{only two of}} the entire expedition party were British. This increased the hostility <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> of Markham, who chastised RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|Judge Appleby also {{threatened}} Kunstler with dismissal <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> {{of court}} after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby Rutgers University that in part discussed the upcoming trial, but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur. Until obtaining a court order, Williams {{was forced to}} strip naked and undergo a body search before each visit with Shakur—during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles. Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office {{that resulted in the}} disappearance of trial documents, amounting to half of the legal papers related to her case. Her lawyers also claimed that their offices were bugged.|$|E

5|$|Though they aren't very {{enthusiastic}} {{at the idea}} of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.|$|E
5|$|During {{his search}} for backers, Borchgrevink met Sir George Newnes, a leading British {{magazine}} publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the Westminster Gazette, Tit-Bits, Country Life and the Strand Magazine. It was not unusual for publishers to support exploration—Newnes's great rival Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed Frederick Jackson's expedition to Franz Josef Land, and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition. Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expedition—around £40,000, (at least £3million in 2008 values). This generosity infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed {{ought to have been}} theirs. Markham maintained an attitude of hostility <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> towards Borchgrevink, and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} {{biography}} of Tubman {{to be published}} after Sarah Hopkins Bradford's 1869 and 1886 books was Earl Conrad's Harriet Tubman (retitled Harriet Tubman: Negro Soldier and Abolitionist in some later printings). Conrad had experienced great difficulty in finding a publisher – the search took four years – and endured disdain <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> for his efforts to construct a more objective, detailed account of Tubman's life for adults. Several highly dramatized versions of Tubman's life had been written for children, and many more came later, but Conrad wrote in an academic style to document the historical importance of her work for scholars and the nation's memory. The book was finally published by Carter G. Woodson's Associated Publishers in 1943. Despite her popularity and significance, another Tubman biography for adults did not appear for 60 years, until Jean Humez published a close reading of Tubman's life stories in 2003, and Larson and Clinton both published their biographies in 2004. Author Milton C. Sernett discusses all the major biographies of Tubman in his 2007 book Harriet Tubman: Myth, Memory, and History.|$|E

5000|$|Gheorghe Cristescu, {{the leader}} of the party was the main defendant. Constantin Cernat, the royal commissaire, accused him of [...] "taking an active part in preaching the {{abolition}} of the present form of government, preaching rebellion, insulting <b>and</b> <b>contempting</b> state institutions".

25|$|Native Americans {{view the}} whiteshaman {{with a mix}} of humor <b>and</b> <b>contempt.</b> It is not just the simple act of going outside their culture that is {{upsetting}} to Native Americans, but that they are misrepresenting the true Indian culture (their images are shadows of the true Indian style). Rose is opposed to the idea that through reading and hearing about Indian culture anyone can simply claim to be a spokesperson for the Native American experience.|$|E

However, {{in some of}} the Western United States, like California, judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of state supreme courts, such as the Maryland Court of Appeals wear distinct dress. In Italy and Portugal, both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.|$|E

He also enjoyed landscape painting and the theatre. He {{was a member of}} White's and the Marylebone Cricket Club, the Vice-President of the Royal Automobile Club, and President of the Friends of London Oratory from 1980 to 1995. He was also a director of Daily Telegraph plc.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{psychologist}} Gershen Kaufman's view {{of shame}} {{is derived from}} that of affect theory, namely that shame {{is one of a}} set of instinctual, short-duration physiological reactions to stimulation. In this view, guilt {{is considered to be a}} learned behavior consisting essentially of self-directed blame or contempt, with shame occurring consequent to such behaviors making up a part of the overall experience of guilt. Here, self-blame and self-contempt mean the application, towards (a part of) one's self, of exactly the same dynamic that blaming of, <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> for, others represents when it is applied interpersonally.|$|E

His left eye and arm were destroyed by Blake, and replaced with an eye patch and a prosthetic arm fitted with a concealed weapon. Travis is known for treating his troops well and leading them personally, but also for his ruthlessness <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> for human life. After his trial and conviction for killing civilians, Travis becomes increasingly obsessed with killing Blake.|$|E
25|$|To {{the public}} {{ordinances}} {{of the church}} he scrupulously conformed. But, unfortunately, there were many things both in the teaching {{and the practice of}} the ecclesiastics of that day, which were calculated to repel men of sober judgment and high principle. These evil tendencies in the popular presentation of Christianity undoubtedly begot in Shaftesbury's mind a certain amount of repugnance <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> to some of the doctrines of Christianity itself; and, cultivating, almost of set purpose, his sense of the ridiculous, he was too apt to assume towards such doctrines and their teachers a tone of raillery.|$|E
25|$|The {{violations}} {{committed by}} members of the Russian forces were usually tolerated by their superiors and were not punished even when investigated (the story of Vladimir Glebov serving as an example of such policy). However, television and newspaper accounts widely reported largely uncensored images of the carnage to the Russian public. As a result, the Russian media coverage partially precipitated a loss of public confidence in the government and a steep decline in president Yeltsin's popularity. Chechnya was one of the heaviest burdens on Yeltsin's 1996 presidential election campaign. In addition, the protracted War in Chechnya, especially many reports of extreme violence against civilians, ignited fear <b>and</b> <b>contempt</b> of Russia among other ethnic groups in the federation.|$|E
