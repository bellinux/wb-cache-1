5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. <b>Antisense</b> RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way <b>antisense</b> RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sharma et al. {{presented}} a comprehensive analysis of transcription at single-nucleotide resolution by differential RNA-seq that confirmed the known acid induction of major virulence loci, {{such as the}} urease (ure) operon or the cag pathogenicity island (see below). More importantly, this study identified a total of 1,907 transcriptional start sites, 337 primary operons, and 126 additional suboperons, and 66 monocistrons. Until 2010, only about 55 transcriptional start sites (TSSs) were known in this species. Notably, 27% of the primary TSSs are also <b>antisense</b> TSSs, indicating that—similar to E. coli—antisense transcription occurs across the entire H. pylori genome. At least one <b>antisense</b> TSS is associated with about 46% of all open reading frames, including many housekeeping genes. Most (about 50%) of the 5' UTRs are 20–40 nucleotides (nt) in length and support the AAGGag motif located about 6 nt (median distance) upstream of start codons as the consensus Shine–Dalgarno sequence in H. pylori.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotides find {{a variety}} of {{applications}} in molecular biology and medicine. They are most commonly used as <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, primers for DNA sequencing and amplification, probes for detecting complementary DNA or RNA via molecular hybridization, tools for the targeted introduction of mutations and restriction sites, and for the synthesis of artificial genes.|$|E
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and <b>antisense</b> strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor <b>antisense</b> RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{where one}} of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. Only the phosphorothioates having sulfur at a non-bridging position as shown in figure are widely used and are available commercially. The replacement of the non-bridging oxygen with sulfur creates a new center of chirality at phosphorus. In a simple case of a dinucleotide, this results in the formation of a diastereomeric pair of Sp- and Rp-dinucleoside monophosphorothioates whose structures are shown in Figure. In an n-mer oligonucleotide where all (n– 1) internucleosidic linkages are phosphorothioate linkages, the number of diastereomers m is calculated as m = 2(n– 1). Being non-natural analogs of nucleic acids, OPS are substantially more stable towards hydrolysis by nucleases, the class of enzymes that destroy nucleic acids by breaking the bridging P-O bond of the phosphodiester moiety. This property determines the use of OPS as <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotides in in vitro and in vivo applications where the extensive exposure to nucleases is inevitable. Similarly, to improve the stability of siRNA, at least one phosphorothioate linkage is often introduced at the 3'-terminus of both sense and <b>antisense</b> strands. In chirally pure OPS, all-Sp diastereomers are more stable to enzymatic degradation than their all-Rp analogs. However, the preparation of chirally pure OPS remains a synthetic challenge. In laboratory practice, mixtures of diastereomers of OPS are commonly used.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a biological}} {{process in which}} RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically, it was known by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi {{is now known as}} precise, efficient, stable and better than <b>antisense</b> technology for gene suppression.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the <b>antisense</b> cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by <b>antisense</b> RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
25|$|An <b>antisense</b> {{oligonucleotide}} drug, oblimersen (G3139), {{was developed}} by Genta Incorporated to target Bcl-2. An <b>antisense</b> DNA or RNA strand is non-coding and complementary to the coding strand (which is the template for producing respectively RNA or protein). An <b>antisense</b> drug is a short sequence of RNA that hybridises with and inactivates mRNA, preventing the protein from being formed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{independent}} {{approach is}} to use oligoadenylated anti-telomerase <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotides and ribozymes to target telomerase RNA, inducing dissociation and apoptosis (Figure 5). The fast induction of apoptosis through <b>antisense</b> binding {{may be a good}} alternative to the slower telomere shortening.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{gene therapy}} was {{introduced}} in 1992/93 (Trojan et al. 1993). The treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, the malignant brain tumor whose outcome is always fatal, was done using a vector expressing <b>antisense</b> IGF-I RNA (clinical trial approved by NIH protocolno.1602 November 24, 1993, and by the FDA in 1994). This therapy also represents the beginning of cancer immunogene therapy, a treatment which proves to be effective due to the anti-tumor mechanism of IGF-I <b>antisense,</b> which is related to strong immune and apoptotic phenomena.|$|E
25|$|The HIV reverse {{transcriptase}} also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during {{the synthesis of}} cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an <b>antisense</b> DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA).|$|E
25|$|Santaris Pharma are {{developing}} miravirsen, a locked nucleic acid-based <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotide that is {{delivered to the}} liver and effectively inhibits miR-122. This molecule reduced HCV viremia in a small-scale trial in chimpanzees and {{was found to be}} safe in a small trial in humans.|$|E
25|$|A huge {{difficulty}} in siRNA delivery {{is the problem}} of off-targeting. Since genes are read in both directions, there exists a possibility that even if the intended <b>antisense</b> siRNA strand is read and knocks out the target mRNA, the sense siRNA strand may target another protein involved in another function.|$|E
25|$|Assembly PCR or Polymerase Cycling Assembly (PCA): {{artificial}} {{synthesis of}} long DNA sequences by performing PCR on {{a pool of}} long oligonucleotides with short overlapping segments. The oligonucleotides alternate between sense and <b>antisense</b> directions, and the overlapping segments determine {{the order of the}} PCR fragments, thereby selectively producing the final long DNA product.|$|E
25|$|Cancer immunogene therapy using {{modified}} anti – gene, <b>antisense</b> / {{triple helix}} approach {{was introduced in}} South America in 2010/11 in La Sabana University, Bogota (Ethical Committee 14 December 2010, no P-004-10). Considering the ethical aspect of gene diagnostic and gene therapy targeting IGF-I, the IGF-I expressing tumors i.e. lung and epidermis cancers, were treated (Trojan et al. 2016).|$|E
25|$|An <b>antisense</b> GFAP {{retrovirus}} (PLBskG) {{to reduce}} GFAP mRNA expression, has been implemented in suppressing growth and arresting astrocytes in the G1 {{phase of the}} cell cycle. However, a main caveat to the clinical application of retroviral use is the non-discriminatory effects of PLBskG on normal as well as injured astrocytes. Further in vivo {{studies are needed to}} determine the systemic effects of PLBskG administration.|$|E
25|$|Other than {{creating}} single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases {{have also}} been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial <b>antisense</b> transcripts. It has been speculated that this template switching activity of reverse transcriptase, which can be demonstrated completely in vivo, may {{have been one of the}} causes for finding several thousand unannotated transcripts in the genomes of model organisms.|$|E
25|$|Like Xist, the Tsix gene encodes a large RNA {{which is}} not {{believed}} to encode a protein. The Tsix RNA is transcribed <b>antisense</b> to Xist, meaning that the Tsix gene overlaps the Xist gene and is transcribed on the opposite strand of DNA from the Xist gene. Tsix is a negative regulator of Xist; X chromosomes lacking Tsix expression (and thus having high levels of Xist transcription) are inactivated much more frequently than normal chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|When {{the human}} genome project mapped its first {{chromosome}} in 1999, it was predicted the genome would contain over 100,000 protein coding genes. However, only around 20,000 were eventually identified. Since then, the advent of bioinformatics approaches combined with genome tiling studies examining the transcriptome, systematic sequencing of full length cDNA libraries and experimental validation (including the creation of miRNA derived <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotides called antagomirs) have revealed that many transcripts are non protein-coding RNA, including several snoRNAs and miRNAs.|$|E
25|$|Alicaforsen {{is a first}} {{generation}} <b>antisense</b> oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM-1 messenger RNA through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-1. ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes (white blood cells) into inflamed tissue. Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of ulcerative colitis sufferers, where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity. This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target {{in the treatment of}} ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|The two {{different}} types of rRNA modification (methylation and pseudouridylation) are directed by {{two different}} families of snoRNAs. These families of snoRNAs are referred to as <b>antisense</b> C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs based on the presence of conserved sequence motifs in the snoRNA. There are exceptions, but as a general rule C/D box members guide methylation and H/ACA members guide pseudouridylation. The members of each family may vary in biogenesis, structure, and function, but each family is classified by the following generalised characteristics. For more detail, see review.|$|E
25|$|When {{a cancer}} bladder cell line, T24P, {{which does not}} express H19 was {{transfected}} with a DNA construct expressing the H19 gene {{under the control of}} the cytomegalovirus promoter, many changes were seen in the resulting cells when compared to both the original T24P cell line and a H19-antisense DNA construct transfected T24P cell line. While there was no difference in proliferation in 10% FCS (normal condition) between the 3 cell lines, when grown in 0.1% FCS (starved serum), the H19-transfected cells maintained their rate of growth while both the control and the <b>antisense</b> H19 transfected cells decreased their rate of proliferation by approximately 50%.|$|E
25|$|When two mature microRNAs {{originate}} from opposite {{arms of the}} same pre-miRNA and are found in roughly similar amounts, they are denoted with a -3p or -5p suffix. (In the past, this distinction was also made with 's' (sense) and 'as' (<b>antisense)).</b> However, the mature microRNA found from one arm of the hairpin is usually much more abundant than that found from the other arm, in which case, an asterisk following the name indicates the mature species found at low levels from the opposite arm of a hairpin. For example, miR-124 and miR-124* share a pre-miRNA hairpin, but much more miR-124 {{is found in the}} cell.|$|E
25|$|The first genetically {{modified}} food approved for release was the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994. Developed by Calgene, it was engineered to have a longer shelf life by inserting an <b>antisense</b> gene that delayed ripening. China was the first country to commercialize a transgenic crop in 1993 {{with the introduction of}} virus-resistant tobacco. In 1995, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Potato was approved for cultivation, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the USA. Other {{genetically modified}} crops receiving marketing approval in 1995 were: canola with modified oil composition, Bt maize, cotton resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, Bt cotton, glyphosate-tolerant soybeans, virus-resistant squash, and another delayed ripening tomato.|$|E
25|$|NELL2 is a tissue-specific {{protein in}} the nervous system. It {{contains}} EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like repeat domain and its gene expression is regulated by estrogen. NELL2 {{is also known}} to play a neuroprotective role rat hippocampus neurons. When NELL2 synthesis is blocked by intracerebroventricular injection of <b>antisense</b> (AS) NELL2 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) into neonatal male rat brains (postnatal day0-day5), the size of SDN-POA is decreased. Since volume of SDN {{is related to the}} level of testosterone, {{it is quite possible that}} the volume is finally due to the neuroprotective effect of estradiol which is produced from testosterone by aromatase. So the result that NELL2 blockage reduces the size of SDN-POA suggests that it probably has neuroprotective effect on SDN-POA.|$|E
25|$|In November {{researchers}} {{reported on the}} use of VRX496, a gene-based immunotherapy for the treatment of HIV that uses a lentiviral vector to deliver an <b>antisense</b> gene against the HIV envelope. In a phase I clinical trial, five subjects with chronic HIV infection who had failed to respond to at least two antiretroviral regimens were treated. A single intravenous infusion of autologous CD4 T cells genetically modified with VRX496 was well tolerated. All patients had stable or decreased viral load; four of the five patients had stable or increased CD4 T cell counts. All five patients had stable or increased immune response to HIV antigens and other pathogens. This was the first evaluation of a lentiviral vector administered in a US human clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|Each snoRNA {{molecule}} {{acts as a}} {{guide for}} only one (or two) individual modifications in a target RNA. In order to carry out modification, each snoRNA associates with at least four protein molecules in an RNA/protein complex referred to as a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP). The proteins associated with each RNA depend on the type of snoRNA molecule (see snoRNA guide families below). The snoRNA molecule contains an <b>antisense</b> element (a stretch of 10-20 nucleotides), which are base complementary to the sequence surrounding the base (nucleotide) targeted for modification in the pre-RNA molecule. This enables the snoRNP to recognise and bind to the target RNA. Once the snoRNP has bound to the target site, the associated proteins are in the correct physical location to catalyse the chemical modification of the target base.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one of the}} two DNA strands {{serve as}} a {{template}} for transcription. The <b>antisense</b> strand of DNA is read by RNA polymerase from the 3' end to the 5' end during transcription (3' → 5'). The complementary RNA is created in the opposite direction, in the 5' → 3' direction, matching the sequence of the sense strand with the exception of switching uracil for thymine. This directionality is because RNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing mRNA chain. This use of only the 3' → 5' DNA strand eliminates the need for the Okazaki fragments that are seen in DNA replication. This also removes the need for an RNA primer to initiate RNA synthesis, {{as is the case in}} DNA replication.|$|E
25|$|Since many tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes are}} silenced by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis, {{there have been}} attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must {{be incorporated into the}} genome of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have {{led to the development of}} <b>antisense</b> RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their mRNAs and preventing their translation. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.|$|E
25|$|The recent {{progress}} in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of toxic progerin formation in laminopathies leading to premature aging {{has opened up}} {{the potential for the}} development of targeted treatment. The farnesylation of prelamin A and its pathological form progerin is carried out by the enzyme farnesyl transferase. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) can be used effectively to reduce symptoms in two mouse model systems for progeria and to revert the abnormal nuclear morphology in progeroid cell cultures. Two oral FTIs, lonafarnib and tipifarnib, are already in use as anti-tumor medication in humans and may become avenues of treatment for children suffering from laminopathic progeria. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphate drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis reduce farnesyldiphosphate production and thus prelamin A farnesylation. Testing of these drugs may prove them to be useful in treating progeria as well. The use of <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotides to inhibit progerin synthesis in affected cells is another avenue of current research into the development of anti-progerin drugs.|$|E
25|$|In Xenopus oocytes, β-catenin is {{initially}} equally localized to all {{regions of the}} egg, but it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the β-catenin destruction complex. Fertilization of the egg causes a rotation of the outer cortical layers, moving clusters of the Frizzled and Dsh proteins closer to the equatorial region. β-catenin will be enriched locally {{under the influence of}} Wnt signaling pathway in the cells that inherit this portion of the cytoplasm. It will eventually translocate to the nucleus to bind TCF3 in order to activate several genes that induce dorsal cell characteristics. This signaling results in a region of cells known as the grey crescent, which is a classical organizer of embryonic development. If this region is surgically removed from the embryo, gastrulation does not occur at all. β-Catenin also plays {{a crucial role in the}} induction of the blastopore lip, which in turn initiates gastrulation. Inhibition of GSK-3 translation by injection of <b>antisense</b> mRNA may cause a second blastopore and a superfluous body axis to form. A similar effect can result from the overexpression of β-catenin.|$|E
25|$|Janssen Biotech, Inc., {{formerly}} known as Centocor Biotech, Inc., is a biotechnology company that was founded in Philadelphia in 1979. In 1982, Centocor transitioned into a publicly traded company. In 1999, Centocor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Since the acquisition, Janssen Biotech increased its annual sales from $500 million to more than $2 billion. During the same period, research and development investment increased from $75 million to more than $300 million. In 2008, Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. merged to form Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc. In June 2010, Centocor Ortho Biotech acquired RespiVert, a privately held drug discovery company focused on developing small-molecule, inhaled therapies {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary diseases. In June 2011, Centocor Ortho Biotech changed its name to Janssen Biotech, Inc. as part of a global effort to unite the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies around the world under a common identity. In December 2014, the company announced it would co-develop MacroGenics cancer drug candidate (MGD011) which targets both CD19 and CD3 proteins in treating B-cell malignant tumours. This could net MacroGenics up to $700 million. In January 2015, the company announced it will utilise Isis Pharmaceuticals' RNA-targeting technology to discover and develop <b>antisense</b> drugs targeting autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, with the partnership potentially generating up to $835 million for Isis.|$|E
500|$|A DNA {{sequence}} is called [...] "sense" [...] if its {{sequence is}} {{the same as that of}} a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein. The sequence on the opposite strand is called the [...] "antisense" [...] sequence. Both sense and <b>antisense</b> sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and <b>antisense</b> sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, <b>antisense</b> RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear. One proposal is that <b>antisense</b> RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.|$|E
