25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> at the desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.|$|E

60|$|When I waked Alan {{he glanced}} {{first at the}} soldiers, then at the mark and the {{position}} of the sun, and knitted his brows with <b>a</b> sudden, <b>quick</b> <b>look,</b> both ugly and anxious, which was all the reproach I had of him.|$|R

6000|$|The girl {{gave him}} <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> searching <b>look,</b> {{and then said}} carelessly, [...] "One can sympathize with you; it is {{annoying}} to be watched. But after all, Edinburgh's rather dull just now, and the cold winds are trying to strangers." ...|$|R

60|$|He was {{surprised}} to see that she had lifted her head suddenly, with <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> that however changed to an amused and half coquettish smile.|$|E

60|$|Broadwood and Lance {{made some}} {{remarks about the}} accident, and Hester watched them with a smile. There was a hint of strain in their voices, but their manner was very matter-of-fact.

60|$|Evelyn {{could see}} {{his face in the}} moonlight, and she gave him <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look.</b> Her father, it seemed, had {{feelings}} she had never suspected in him.|$|E

60|$|At {{that the}} murderer gave <b>a</b> little, <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> over his shoulder, {{and began to}} run. The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches; then he came out again on the upper side, where I could see him {{climbing}} like a jackanapes, for that part was again very steep; and then he dipped behind a shoulder, and I saw him no more.|$|R
60|$|It {{was the way}} {{she said}} it. He felt warm all over, and in his heart and head.
