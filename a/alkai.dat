The isomerization is fast with lithium and sodium, but slow with the higher alkali metals. The higher alkali metals also favor the sterically congested conformation. [...] Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Increase in the {{incidence}} of hyperuricemia associated with gout as well as hypertension, renal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been a public health concern. We examined the possibility of facilitated excretion of uric acid by change in urine pH by managing food materials. Methods Within the framework of the Japanese government's health promotion program, we made recipes which consist of protein-rich and less vegetable-fruit food materials for H + -load (acid diet) and others composed of less protein but vegetable-fruit rich food materials (alkali diet). Healthy female students were enrolled in this consecutive 5 -day study for each test. From whole-day collected urine, total volume, pH, organic acid, creatinine, uric acid and all cations (Na +,K +,Ca 2 +,Mg 2 +,NH 4 +) and anions (Cl -,SO 4 2 -,PO 4 -) necessary for the estimation of acid-base balance were measured. Results Urine pH reached a steady state 3 days after switching from ordinary daily diets to specified regimens. The amount of acid generated ([SO 4 2 -] +organic acid-gut <b>alkai)</b> were linearly related with those of the excretion of acid (titratable acidity+ [NH 4 +] - [HCO 3 -]), indicating that H + in urine is generated by the metabolic degradation of food materials. Uric acid and excreted urine pH retained a linear relationship, where uric acid excretion increased from 302 mg/day at pH 5. 9 to 413 mg/day at pH 6. 5, {{despite the fact that the}} alkali diet contained a smaller purine load than the acid diet. Conclusion We conclude that alkalization of urine by eating nutritionally well-designed food is effective for removing uric acid from the body. </p...|$|E
40|$|The South Qȏroq Centre {{is one of}} four high-level, major {{intrusive}} centres {{comprising the}} Igaliko Nepheline Syenite complex. Three elliptical stocks of foyaite were emplaced in fairly rapid succession by ring fracture and block subsidence, followed by a partial ring dyke of augite syenite. Petrographic and mineralogical data shows that the intrusions become successfully less differentiated with time. Inward-dipping microsyenite sheets appear {{to be associated with the}} ring dyke and four earlier, satellitic stocks occur around the periphery of SS 2. Fieldspar, nepheline, iron-titanium oxide, clinopyroxene and amphibole have been investigated in each of the principal rock units by electron-microprobe. Most minerals show a considerable range in composition often with chemical zoning, forming continuous series from the augite syenites through the foyaites. Variations within the three individual foyaites are usually slight, but the <b>alkai</b> feldspar compsitions. Alkali feldspars provide estimates of P(_H(_ 2) 0) and mafic minerals give an indication of f(0 (_ 2)) conditions. Major and trace element analyses of the rocks were made by X-Ray florescence. Variation diagram trends are interpreted mainly in terms of fractionation of feldspar and the mafic phases. Trace element distributions are highly characteristic of fractional crystallisation series, but may not be compatible with progressive partial melting. The analyses are compared with phase equilibria in the experimental systems Q – Ne – Ks and Na(_ 2) 0 – Fe(_ 2) 0 (_ 3) – Al(_ 2) 0 (_ 3) – Si 0 (_ 2). It is suggested that the centre evolved from an underlining, differentiated magma chamber, formed by crystal accumulation, possibly with associated liquid fractionation. Successively lower portions of the chamber were tapped, producing batches of fractionated magma. Post-emplacement differentiation was restricted mainly to slight outward diffusion of alkalis and volatiles under a thermal diffusion gradient. Physico-chemical conditions during recrystallisation near to the Igdlerfigssalik Centre are interpreted from textural, geochemical and mineralogical changes...|$|E
40|$|Base-metal late Hercynian vein and stratabound-type {{deposits}} {{occur in}} the Linares-La Carolina mining district (Sierra Morena, Spain). No other ore deposits than iron beds and a supergene iron-manganese karst-related deposit {{were found in the}} studied area. However, Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian rocks show Ni, Zn, Pb content above the average values of sandstones. Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian country rocks are grouped into two stratigraphical sequences that reflect sea-level rise-fall cycles in a basin developed in a passive margin. The duration of these cycles indicates that they were caused by a combination of eustatic processes and intraplate extensional tectonics. The Late Hercynian hydrothermal deposits hosted by metasediments and granitoids, comprise (Ba) -(Pb-Zn-Cu- [Ag]) vein and stratabound type deposits that were emplaced before the Ladinian, during an extensional stage starting in the Upper Permian. Three stages of ore deposition have been recognised, the first stage is characterised by the formation of pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, Ag sulphosalts and minor arsenopyrite and Bi sulphides. In the second stage, pyrite, Cu sulphides, barite and Ni-Co mineral s precipitated. Main deposition of galena and sphalerite took place {{at the end of the}} first stage and the beginning of the second stage. There is no evidence of selective Ag enrichment. Hydrothermal alteration of granitic host rocks is characterised by argillic-phyllic, argillic-propylitic assemblages overprinted by a late <b>alkai</b> metasomatism. There is a strong relation between composition of secondary minerals, mineralogy of the alteration zone and whole-rock composition. Mass transfers of alumina appear to be important. There is a significant introduction of Si, AI, K, Na, Rb and Pb, together with a depletion in Ca and Sr. Chlorite and illite geothermometers indicate temperatures of 276. 7 - 321. 5 ·C. Three events of fluid entrapment at hydrostatic pressures have been recognised, with fluids evolved from low to moderate, locally carbonaceous hot fluids to highmoderately polysaline cooler fluids. Ore-lead was derived from Palaeozoic U-'enriched' country rocks, although some participation from the Hercynian granitoids can not be ruled out. The distribution of sulphur isotopes is not homogeneous in the scale of the district. Differences exist between those deposits at the El Centenillo-Santa Elena sector (where the dominant process was the mixing of 'magmatic'-derived sulphur and sulphur derived from the metasediments) and those occurrences at the Linares-La Carolina sector (where the dominant sulphur was 'magmatic'-derived) ...|$|E
