5|$|<b>Anti-inflammatory</b> {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|Selective {{glucocorticoid}} receptor modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable <b>anti-inflammatory,</b> immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical glucocorticoid drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ <b>anti-inflammatory</b> effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|E

50|$|Depending on severity, therapies may {{range from}} topical or oral <b>anti-inflammatories</b> to {{irrigation}} and surgical repair.|$|R
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used as}} an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> {{agent for}} both acute and {{long-term}} inflammation, {{as well as for}} treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Chan et al. {{show in a}} {{randomized}} control trial that eradication of H. pylori even prevents bleeding from ulcers that is caused by aspirin and non-steroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs.|$|E
50|$|Most S. suis strains {{respond to}} {{treatment}} with ampicillin and amoxicillin. <b>Anti-inflammatories</b> {{should also be}} used.|$|R

50|$|Treatment is symptomatic. <b>Anti-inflammatories</b> reduce {{fever and}} provide pain relief. Antibiotics may be {{necessary}} if a secondary infection occurs.|$|R
5|$|On 9 July 2015, the FDA {{toughened}} {{warnings of}} increased {{heart attack and}} stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs (NSAID). Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} oil has displayed antimicrobial properties in vitro, and can {{function as a}} biopesticide, especially regarding Tropidion castaneum beetles and Camponotus maculatus carpenter ants. Several terpenoids isolated from P.atriplicifolia have been investigated for potential inhibitory effects on the hepatitis B virus. Its traditional use as an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> {{has been attributed to}} the ability of the lignan (+)-taxiresinol and five other compounds to act as leukotriene antagonists. The isorinic acid derivative perovskoate may also contribute to an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> effect as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Interaction with opioid and cannabinoid receptors has been proposed as the mechanism of traditionally reported analgesic effects.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its <b>anti-inflammatory</b> properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their <b>anti-inflammatory</b> properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E

25|$|People who {{are taking}} nonsteroidal <b>anti-inflammatories</b> (NSAIDs) may also be {{prescribed}} a prostaglandin analogue (misoprostol) {{in order to help}} prevent peptic ulcers.|$|R
25|$|Antiviral drugs, {{that target}} infections with RRV. Patients are usually managed with simple analgesics, <b>anti-inflammatories,</b> anti-pyretics and rest while the illness runs its course.|$|R
5|$|When {{taken with}} NSAIDS (non-steroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> medications), {{warfarin}} {{increases the risk}} for gastrointestinal bleeding. This increased risk {{is due to the}} anti-platelet effect of NSAIDS as well as the possible damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are <b>anti-inflammatory.</b> Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} thick outer peridium, Mycenastrum corium puffballs can {{withstand}} hard blows without breaking, and children have used them as replacements for balls. The puffballs {{have also been}} used medicinally in Mexico as a hemostatic, as a throat and lung tonic, and for their purported <b>anti-inflammatory</b> properties.|$|E
50|$|Fluticasone is a {{synthetic}} glucocorticoid. Both the furoate and propanoate esters, fluticasone furoate and fluticasone propionate, {{are used as}} topical <b>anti-inflammatories</b> and inhaled corticosteroids.|$|R

5|$|Drug-induced {{psoriasis}} {{may occur}} with beta blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, non-steroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering drugs, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} body are high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory tests to have <b>anti-inflammatory</b> activity comparable to the drug diclofenac. Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion of clay minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as diarrhoea. Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> balm.|$|E
25|$|Carprofen, {{and other}} <b>anti-inflammatories</b> in general, whilst very safe for most animals, can {{sometimes}} cause problems for some animals, and (in a few rare cases) sudden death through liver toxicity. This is most commonly discussed with carprofen {{but may be}} equally relevant with other <b>anti-inflammatories.</b> As a result, it is often recommended to perform monthly (or at least, twice-annually) blood tests {{to confirm that the}} animal is not reacting adversely to the medications. Such side effects are rare but worth being aware of, especially if long-term use is anticipated.|$|R
30|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this injury remains conservative: rest, analgesia, <b>anti-inflammatories</b> and rehabilitation; however, surgical treatment has been utilised depending {{on the degree of}} fracture displacement and the individual’s rehabilitation requirements [5, 6].|$|R
5000|$|There is {{currently}} no cure or treatments tailored directly toward MEDNIK syndrome. [...] However, symptoms {{can be treated}} on an individual basis. Treatments can include: diuretics, steroids, pain medications, antidepressants, hydrotherapy, <b>anti-inflammatories,</b> and antibiotics.|$|R
5|$|In vivo {{studies in}} {{mice and rats}} showed that a topically {{administered}} SEGRAM inhibited peroxidase activity and formation of oedema, both indicators of <b>anti-inflammatory</b> activity, comparably to prednisolone. Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and colitis. In vivo evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic glucocorticoid in cancer pathologies is currently lacking.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{and kidney}} disease {{can affect the}} {{biological}} activity of analgesics. When people with diminishing liver or kidney function are treated with oral opioids they must be monitored for the possible need to reduce dose, extend dosing intervals, or switch to other opioids or other modes of delivery. The benefit of non-steroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs should be weighed against their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{usage of}} non-steroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> drugs (NSAIDs) is {{associated}} with a reduced likelihood of developing AD. Evidence also supports the notion that NSAIDs can reduce inflammation related to amyloid plaques. No prevention trial has been completed. They {{do not appear to be}} useful as a treatment. Hormone replacement therapy, although previously used, may increase the risk of dementia.|$|E
