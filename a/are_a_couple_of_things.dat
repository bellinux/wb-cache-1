[...] "There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> TVD {{can do that}} will make me forget all of my worries about the show. When the show goes back to its horror roots, it’s easy to {{momentarily}} forget all the bad {{that has been going}} on. Also, put any of these characters in cabin, and I’m predisposed to not hate the episode. Luckily, “What Lies Beneath” does both these things and is a better episode for it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Stepfather has an 86% {{approval}} rating from Rotten Tomatoes {{and an average}} rating of 6.7/10 out of 29 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert, from the Chicago Sun Times, gave the movie 2.5 stars out of 4, and commented: [...] "Violence itself seems to sell at the box office, even when it's divorced from any context. Maybe that's what the filmmakers were thinking. What often happens, though, is that in an otherwise flawed film there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that are wonderful. The Stepfather has one wonderful element: Terry O'Quinn's performance." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Brian Michael Bendis and Axel Alonso, they officially ran out {{of ideas}} trying to find {{what could be done}} for the 50th anniversary of Spider-Man. Alonso {{described}} the story with: [...] "All I can say is that the Peter Parker of the Ultimate Universe casts a huge shadow over Miles' spiritual and emotional development. What will he do when he's confronted with the Peter Parker from another universe? Well, that's the story. And there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> going on.

[...] Alonso went on to reveal that [...] "there's a super-cool villain involved in all of this and it's mind-bending, twisted stuff that puts these two in each others' orbit.

5000|$|In 2013, he {{was first}} seen in the crime comedy Soodhu Kavvum that saw him {{playing the role of}} a forty-year-old kidnapper. The film opened to {{extremely}} positive reviews and has become a huge success at the box office. Malini Mannath from The New Indian Express in her review wrote: [...] "It’s laudable that the actor doesn’t hesitate to take a role that has him playing a 40-year-old man, greying and with a paunch". The Times of India reviewer N. Venkateswaran cited that [...] "His knack of choosing good roles and working with new directors brimming with ideas will stand him in good stead, as also the work he puts in to portray each character. He put on weight and grew a beard to play Das, and the look fits him to a 'T'". His next release was Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara, directed by Gokul. It was met with positive reviews by critics and Vijay Sethupathi's performance was highly praised. Haricharan Pudipeddi from The New Indian Express in his review wrote : [...] "Vijay Sethupathi has become a darling of the masses. Scene after scene, the audience hoots and cheers for him in unison." [...] Rediff reviewer S.Saraswathi cited that [...] "His greatest strength lies in being able to counter the stereotypical image of heroes in commercial cinema today. In every film, we see him in a completely different avatar, and his latest film is no different. Vijay Sethupathi seems to have the knack of choosing the right role and script and he effortlessly slips into his character as Kumar." [...] Behindwoods stated that Vijay Sethupathi as Sumar Moonji Kumar has done it yet again, raising his pennant higher, making himself more visible to his fervent fans. The depth in his innocence and the foolhardiness in his love <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that stand tall in the character he plays, and Vijay Sethupathi has pulled it off in grand style. The actor is a revelation in the climax sequence, showing the other dimension of his acting.|$|E

40|$|The most {{frequent}} used method for joining metal structures together is fusion welding. This method {{has largely been}} developed by experiments, i. e. trial and error. The problem of distortion, residual stresses and reduced strength of a structure in and around a welded joint are a major concern of the welding industry, especially in the aerospace industry where safety and economy are important issues. The objective of this thesis is to develop and evaluate a method for introducing a moving heat source into a FE-model. The heat source {{should be able to}} move along any general 3 D curve. The aim is to facilitate the simulation of welding for complex weld paths and geometries. The basic idea is that the user defines the weld path in a CAD-program with the geometry as basis, then information about the weld path is to be exported to a separate file. This file is processed later in the FE-program by user-defined routines in order to create nodal heat input corresponding to the weld for the finite element model. The aim of this work has in general been fulfilled. The method for welding simulation that can follow any general 3 -D curve as welding path fulfils the expectations perfectly. In the whole process of welding simulation there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that must be added or corrected. One of these things is that this model gives no feed-back or verification if the correct amount of energy is given into the model. This may wary due to mesh and geometry changes. To be able to do simulations with adequate results this must of course be attended to. This simplification of the process of modelling welding will contribute to make simulations more commonly used by the industry. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|I didn’t sleep much in Stockholm. The eight hour time {{difference}} and the jet lag completely messed me up, {{not to mention}} the 19 hours of daylight! But during the day when I was so tired, the content being presented at the conference and the people I met kept me buzzing and wide awake! It is always nice to find {{a group of people who}} are interested in the same things as you are, and to do so in a beautiful setting with great food and a friendly environment is all the better. In my opinion, the 5 th EBLIP conference was the best yet! I returned to Canada inspired and intellectually stimulated. The EBLIP conference is one of the few times that those of us who work on the EBLIP journal have a chance to get together and talk in person. Our journal editors are situated in the U. K., Canada, and the United States, so our work is done primarily via e‐mail and the occasional conference call. Three of us made it to Stockholm (Alison, Lorie and myself), so it was great to touch base in person and have a drink or two together! We also got to see several members of the Editorial Advisory board, as well as those who write evidence summaries for us, or are involved in some other way. Meeting some of these people in person for the first time after a lengthy e‐mail relationship is quite a treat! The Editors took the opportunity at the conference to hold a user group meeting, inviting anyone who was interested to attend and provide us with feedback about the journal. To start we provided an update, which included the fact that the journal has over 2000 registered readers. Did you know that in just one month (May 25 – June 24, 2009) we had 4649 site visits; 3, 678 of them unique? Most visits to the journal are from the United States, followed by Canada, Australia, and the U. K. But we have people accessing the journal from all over world, and now that we are tracking site traffic via Google Analytics, it is easy to see on a map where our readers reside. There was a good turnout for our user group, and a lively discussion. People told us what they valued about the journal, with much discussion focused on the evidence summaries. The evidence summaries are valued as a unique way to learn more about original research, and a few people noted that they will show evidence summaries to senior managers when the summary focuses on an aspect of practice that is being considered at their institution. One thing that came up time and time again was how to get more international content into the journal. As a result, we are going to try to incorporate reviews of non‐English language research. We also actively encourage people from anywhere in the world to submit articles or volunteer to serve on our Editorial Advisory Board or in some other capacity. The user group session was over before we knew it, but as always, I encourage all readers to provide us with feedback about how we can make EBLIP better. In this issue, there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> from the conference that I want to highlight. Andrew Booth proposes an International Association of EBLIP in a commentary; this was the result of an early morning open meeting held during the conference. As well, several conference attendees have provided reflections on their experiences, which you will find in the News section. For those who could not attend in person, this will give you a good sense of what happened at the conference from different perspectives. And finally, the first of what we hope are many papers resulting from presentations given at EBLIP 5, an article by Michael Raynor is available in this issue. In a future issue we will have a Feature focused on all the keynote presentations that were given in Stockholm. As the days grow short here in my part of the world, I look back fondly on the long days in Stockholm this past summer, and am inspired to keep contributing to this international EBLIP community that continues to question our own models of practice in an effort to serve our local communities in the best way we possibly can.
