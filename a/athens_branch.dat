50|$|In 1883, {{the newly}} formed company inaugurated service from Newburgh and Jersey City at the Pennsylvania Railroad Depot, where {{passengers}} transferred to ferries across the river. A new alignment was built along {{the east side of}} the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (formerly the New Jersey Midland) to North Bergen. By 1886, service operated to Weehawken Terminal through a tunnel under Bergen Hill that had been built in the three preceding years. The company leased the <b>Athens</b> <b>Branch</b> of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, the old Saratoga and Hudson River Railroad, and incorporated it into their main line between Coxsackie and Fullers. At Ravena, along the <b>Athens</b> <b>Branch,</b> the main line turned northwest towards Schenectady, while a new branch continued north to Kenwood Junction on the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad in Albany. This full line formed an immediate threat to the NYC monopoly.|$|E

50|$|Although the Civil War saw heavy {{damage to}} railroads {{such as the}} Georgia Railroad, {{management}} used their considerable resources to restore operation as quickly as possible. The Georgia Railroad even resorted to temporarily abandoning the <b>Athens</b> <b>branch</b> to secure enough rail to reopen its main line. Returning Confederate soldiers were given free rides home, {{to the extent that}} the company's limited rail network would allow.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in Athens, {{the son of the}} Gendarmerie Major Miltiadis Evert. The Evert family was of German aristocratic origin, and they were philhellenes (i.e. lovers of Greek culture) who {{permanently}} settled in Greece in the late 19th century and eventually took Greek citizenship. After Law studies in the University of Athens, Angelos Evert joined the Gendarmerie as an officer in September 1915. He was transferred to the Cities Police in 1929, and became Police Commissioner of the <b>Athens</b> <b>branch</b> in September 1941, {{a few months after the}} country was overrun by the Germans.|$|E

5000|$|In 1913, {{with about}} 330 women and nearly 500 men, the {{university}} hired its first dean for women. Arriving on her thirty-first birthday, Dean Irma Voight later wrote that aside {{from getting a}} desk in the hallway of Cutler Hall, she received little instruction, much less camaraderie, from President Alston Ellis. Within three weeks, she called a meeting of all women students and faculty to discuss establishing a Women's League, which would develop “spirit, loyalty, and standards.” During her thirty-six years of influence on the campus, Dean Voight was also active in the university branch of the YWCA, the Women's Recreation Association, Student Council, and the Panhellenic Council {{and was the first}} president of the <b>Athens</b> <b>branch</b> of the American Association of University Women (AAUW). In 1920, when the nineteenth amendment gave women the right to vote, Voight, a suffragist, arranged political forums for women, believing that some men were “sitting back and waiting for us to make a mess out of our enfranchisement.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first part}} of the line was built as the Saratoga and Hudson River Railroad, {{incorporated}} April 16, 1864 and opened in Spring 1866. After only about a year of independent operation, the line served as a branch of the New York Central Railroad (NYC), splitting at Athens Junction near Schenectady and running southeast and south along {{the west side of the}} Hudson River to Athens, New York. Early plans included acquiring the Saratoga and Schenectady Railroad as a northern extension. The Saratoga and Hudson River was bought and merged into the New York Central as their <b>Athens</b> <b>Branch</b> on September 9, 1867. The terminal at Athens was destroyed by fire in 1876. The line ran intermittently from then into the 1880s, with its tracks being torn up for good in 1888. It had been called the [...] "White Elephant" [...] Railroad for most of its existence because it quickly outlived whatever usefulness it may have had. Today a row of brick houses known as the Brick Row Historic District which was built in 1850 for the workers of the failed railroad stand in Athens as the only remaining structure related to the [...] "White Elephant" [...] Railroad project.|$|E
