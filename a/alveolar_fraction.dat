40|$|Abstract Background Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} airways but {{recent studies have shown}} that alveoli are also subject to pathophysiological changes. This study was undertaken to compare hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) concentrations {{in different parts of the}} lung using a new technique of fractioned breath condensate sampling. Methods In 52 children (9 - 17 years, 32 asthmatic patients, 20 controls) measurements of exhaled nitric oxide (FE NO), lung function, H 2 O 2 in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and the asthma control test (ACT) were performed. Exhaled breath condensate was collected in two different fractions, representing mainly either the airways or the alveoli. H 2 O 2 was analysed in the airway and alveolar fractions and compared to clinical parameters. Results The exhaled H 2 O 2 concentration was significantly higher in the airway fraction than in the <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction</b> comparing each single pair (p = 0. 003, 0. 032 and 0. 040 for the whole study group, the asthmatic group and the control group, respectively). Asthma control, measured by the asthma control test (ACT), correlated significantly with the H 2 O 2 concentrations in the <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction</b> (r = 0. 606, p = 0. 004) but not with those in the airway fraction in the group of children above 12 years. FE NO values and lung function parameters did not correlate to the H 2 O 2 concentrations of each fraction. Conclusion The new technique of fractionated H 2 O 2 measurement may differentiate H 2 O 2 concentrations in different parts of the lung in asthmatic and control children. H 2 O 2 concentrations of the <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction</b> may be related to the asthma control test in children. </p...|$|E

Patients and methods: In this clinical multicenter trial with prospective inclusion and three-month follow-up, <b>alveolar</b> deadspace <b>fraction</b> was compared by ROC analysis with other parameters derived from volumetric capnography. Results: Capnography was performed in 239 patients, of which 205 tests (86 %) were conclusive. The prevalence of PE was 33 %. The ROC curve analysis for <b>alveolar</b> deadspace <b>fraction</b> was 0. 73 +/- 0. 04. The diagnostic performances of parameters from volumetric capnography were not significantly better. 16 % (95 % CI 12 %- 21 %) of patients presented a (PaCO(2) -EtCO(2)) /PaCO(2) ratio under the cut-off value of 0. 15 with a low clinical probability.

This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} the vanilloid transient receptor potential channel, TRPV 4, is a critical participant in the permeability response to high vascular pressure. Isolated lungs from TRPV 4 +/+ or TRPV 4 −/− mice were studied at baseline or during high pressure challenge. Permeability was assessed via the filtration coefficient. Endothelial calcium transients were assessed using epifluorescence microscopy of the lung subpleural network. Light microscopy and point counting were used to determine the <b>alveolar</b> fluid volume <b>fraction,</b> a measure of alveolar flooding. Baseline permeability, calcium intensity, and alveolar flooding were no different in TRPV 4 +/+ versus TRPV 4 −/− lungs. In TRPV 4 +/+ lungs, the high pressure–induced permeability response was significantly attenuated by low calcium perfusate, the TRPV antagonist ruthenium red, the phospholipase A 2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, or the P 450 epoxygenase inhibitor propargyloxyphenyl hexanoic acid. Similarly, the high pressure–induced calcium transient in TRPV 4 +/+ lungs was attenuated with ruthenium red or the epoxygenase inhibitor. High vascular pressure increased the <b>alveolar</b> fluid volume <b>fraction</b> compared with control. In lungs from TRPV 4 −/− mice, permeability, calcium intensity, and <b>alveolar</b> fluid volume <b>fraction</b> were not increased.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} as a routine procedure in the differential diagnosis of respiratory diseases in adults. However, there is only limited information {{about the value of}} BAL in children and there is no standardisation of the procedures. METHODS: The difference in cellular profiles of sequential BAL fractions from children was analysed to assess the effect of evaluating bronchial and <b>alveolar</b> <b>fractions</b> separately. Twenty five children (mean age 13. 4 years) were examined by fibreoptic bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia, combined with local application of lignocaine. The investigation was part of the clinical evaluation of an infective pulmonary problem. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed from the right middle lobe using four 20 ml aliquots of normal saline and the four fractions of recovered fluid were evaluated separately. RESULTS: The total cell count was lowest in the first aspirate (1. 8 x 10 (6)) and increased gradually from fraction 1 to fraction 4. Similarly, the viability of the cells was lowest in fraction 1 and gradually improved from fraction 1 to fraction 4. In the differential count the number of neutrophils decreased from fraction 1 (8. 3 %) to fraction 4, with fractions 2 (5. 4 %), 3 (3. 4 %), and 4 (2. 4 %) being significantly different from fraction 1. There were no differences in the numbers of eosinophils, lymphocytes, or macrophages between individual fractions. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the cell profile of the first "bronchial" fraction is different from subsequent samples.

CC 16 possesses anti-inflammatory properties {{and is a}} potential biomarker for airway epithelial damage. We studied the effect of inhaled allergen on pulmonary and systemic CC 16 levels. Methods: Thirty-four subjects with allergic asthma underwent an inhaled allergen challenge. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and brushings was performed before and 24 h after the challenge. CC 16 was quantified in BAL and CC 16 positive cells and CC 16 mRNA in bronchial brushings. CC 16 was measured in plasma and urine before and repeatedly after the challenge. Thirty subjects performed a mannitol inhalation challenge prior to the allergen challenge. Results: Compared to baseline, CC 16 in plasma was significantly increased in all subjects 0 – 1 h after the allergen challenge, while CC 16 in BAL was only increased in subjects without a late allergic response. Levels of CC 16 in plasma and in the <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction</b> of BAL correlated significantly after the challenge. There was no increase in urinary levels of CC 16 post-challenge.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to quantitate cilia loss {{following}} airway epithelial cell injury. Two models of airway injury were used: (1) Ex vivo acute cigarette smoke exposure model: Bovine lungs, obtained directly after slaughter, were ventilated with air or cigarette smoke for 5 min followed immediately by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The bronchi were examined histologically and bronchial and <b>alveolar</b> <b>fractions</b> of BAL fluid were examined for cell counts, cell differentials, and cilia dynein concentrations using a specific 13 S dynein ELISA. Smoke exposure resulted in a marked loss of ciliated cells from the bronchial luminal surface (2, 364 +/- 351 versus 11, 090 +/- 542 ciliated cells/mm 2; p = 0. 0001), a comparable increase in ciliated cells in the bronchial BAL fraction (0. 90 x 10 (6) cells/mm 3 versus 0. 15 x 10 (6) cells/mm 3; p = 0. 0003) and a significant increase in bronchial fluid dynein concentrations (24. 5 +/- 6. 0 micrograms/ml versus 8. 9 +/- 2. 2 micrograms/ml; p = 0. 03) compared with that in air-exposed lungs. The dynein concentrations strongly correlated with the absolute number of ciliated cells recovered in the bronchial lavage (r = 0. 80; p < 0. 0001).

It focuses on the characterization of aerosols emitted by the combustion of dead shrub leaves and twigs with different thickness (range of 0. 75 - 20 mm). The experiments were carried out at bench scale with a cone calorimeter for the burning of Cistus monspeliensis leaves and twigs. Auto-igthtion of the samples was obtained by heating their surface with a radiant heat flux of 50 kW/m(2). The smoke and aerosols emitted before ignition during pre-heating were analysed separately from the smoke and aerosols emitted during the flaming phase. Heat release rate (HRR) was also measured and we observed two different behaviours depending on the diameter of the twigs. Fuel samples with diameter smaller than 4 mm exhibit a single peak HRR whereas two peaks were observed for the twigs with larger diameters. The smoke production rate (SPR) was also measured and it showed that smoke was mainly emitted during the pre-heating phase. We also obtained a strong correlation between HRR and SPR during the flaming phase but no smoke was emitted, during the glowing phase. Emission factors of aerosols were calculated depending on these combustion phases (pre-ignition and flaming) and for the range of thickness of the samples. The observations of the aerosols were performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The chemical composition of organic carbon (OC) aerosols, emitted during the pre-ignition phase, were analysed using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). Some carcinogenic compounds were identified. The sizes of OC and black carbon (BC) aerosols emitted were measured with an optical device.

We postulated that the inflammatory changes of the small airways are implicated in the lack of asthma control in mild asthma. OBJECTIVE: To test this hypothesis, we measured the <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction</b> of exhaled NO (CalvNO) in patients with mild asthma with different levels of control of symptoms. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with asthma (35 men, age, 37 +/- 15 years; FEV 1 percentage of predicted, 100 % +/- 9 %) were studied. Asthma control was assessed by using the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Measurements of exhaled NO at multiple constant flows were performed. RESULTS: Bronchial NO concentrations were 27. 1 +/- 20 ppb, and CalvNO levels were 5. 7 +/- 3. 4 ppb. The ACT score was 20 +/- 4. 2. The level of asthma control {{was not associated with}} bronchial NO concentrations (rs = 0. 16, P =. 15). However, a significant correlation was found between the ACT score and CalvNO (rs = 0. 25, P =. 03). Moreover, CalvNO was significantly higher in patients with uncontrolled asthma than in patients with controlled/partially controlled asthma (6. 7 +/- 2. 6 ppb vs 4. 9 +/- 2. 6 ppb, respectively, P =. 02). In the subgroup of patients with asthma who underwent extrafine inhaled corticosteroid treatment, the magnitude of the inhaled corticosteroid-induced improvement in asthma control positively correlated with baseline CalvNO at 1 month (rs = 0. 39, P =. 003) and at 3 months (rs = 0. 49, P <. 0001).

The iron oxide Fe₃O₄ (magnetite) may be a major anthropogenic component in ambient PM and is derived mainly from industrial sources. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of four different size fractions of magnetite on signaling pathways, free radical generation, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity in human alveolar epithelial-like type-II cells (A 549). The magnetite particles used in the exposure experiments were characterized by mineralogical and chemical techniques. Four size fractions were investigated: bulk magnetite (0. 2 – 10 μm), respirable fraction (2 – 3 μm), <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction</b> (0. 5 – 1. 0 μm), and nanoparticles (20 – 60 nm). After 24 h of exposure, the A 549 cells were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study particle uptake. TEM images showed an incorporation of magnetite particles in A 549 cells by endocytosis. Particles were found as agglomerates in cytoplasm-bound vesicles, and few particles were detected in the cytoplasm but none in the nucleus. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), {{as determined by the}} 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate assay (DCFH-DA), as well as genotoxic effects, as measured by the cytokinesis block-micronucleus test and the Comet assay, were observed for all of the studied fractions after 24 h of exposure. Moreover, activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) without increased nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) -binding activity but delayed IκB-degradation was observed. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with magnetite and subsequent stimulation with the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) led to a reduction of NF-κB DNA binding compared to that in stimulation with TNFα alone.

Right-to-left shunt fraction (Qs/Qt) leads to an <b>alveolar</b> dead space <b>fraction</b> (VdA(S) /VtA; where VtA is alveolar tidal volume). In acute respiratory distress syndrome, ancillary physiological disturbances may include low cardiac output, high metabolic rate, anaemia and acid-base instability. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to analyze the extent to which shunt contributes to alveolar dead space and perturbs carbon dioxide exchange in ancillary physiological disturbances. Methods A comprehensive model of pulmonary gas exchange was based upon known equations and iterative mathematics. Results The <b>alveolar</b> dead space <b>fraction</b> caused by shunt increased nonlinearly with Qs/Qt and, under 'basal conditions', reached 0. 21 at a Qs/Qt of 0. 6. At a Qs/Qt of 0. 4, reduction in cardiac output from 5 l/minute to 3 l/minute increased VdAS/VtA from 0. 11 to 0. 16. Metabolic acidosis further augmented the effects of shunt on VdA(S) /VtA, particularly with hyperventilation. A Qs/Qt of 0. 5 may increase arterial carbon dioxide tension by about 15 % to 30 % if ventilation is not increased. Conclusion In acute respiratory distress syndrome, perturbation of carbon dioxide exchange caused by shunt is enhanced by ancillary disturbances such as low cardiac output, anaemia, metabolic acidosis and hyperventilation.

The results showed that BLM treatment significantly increased fibrosis area and <b>alveolar</b> wall area <b>fraction</b> as compared to control. OIn the other hand, CMN treatment significantly reduced fibrosis area and <b>alveolar</b> wall area <b>fraction</b> in mice treated with BLM. In conclusion, our study showed that CMN treatment may inhibit lung fibrogenesis in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|In a {{prospective}} cohort study, we assessed whether changes in total cell counts and differentiation and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) {{are associated with}} a higher risk to develop obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). We investigated 60 lung transplant patients (follow-up of 2 to 8 yr) with either histologic evidence of OB within 1 yr after lung transplantation (n = 19) or no pathology, good outcome (CO) for at least 24 mo and well-preserved lung function, i. e., FEV {{greater than or equal to}} 80 % of baseline (n = 41). Median time between lung transplantation and the first BAL was 42 d for the GO group and 41 d for the OB group (p > 0. 05). in the bronchial fraction, median total cell counts (0. 06 x 10 (3) /ml versus 0. 04 x 10 (3) /ml), lymphocyte (9 x 10 (3) /ml versus 2 x 10 (3) /ml), and eosinophilic granulocyte counts (1 x 10 (3) /ml versus 0) were significantly higher in the OB group than in the CO group (p < 0. 05). In the <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction,</b> this was the case for the median value of neutrophilic granulocyte counts (19 x 10 (3) /ml versus 4 x 103 /ml), respectively. Median values of IL- 6 and IL- 8 concentrations in both bronchial (IL- 6 : 23 versus 6 pg/ml, IL- 8 : 744 versus 102 pg/ml) and alveolar fractions (IL- 6 : 13 versus 3 pg/ml, IL- 8 : 110 versus 30 pg/ml) of the BALF were significantly higher in the OB group than in the GO group. By means of logistic regression, we showed that higher total cell, neutrophilic granulocyte, and lymphocyte counts, the presence of eosinophilic: granulocytes, and higher concentrations of IL- 6 and IL- 8 were significantly associated with an increased risk to develop OB. We conclude that monitoring cell counts, neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes, IL- 6, and IL- 8 in BALF within 2 mo after lung transplantation in addition to the transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB) pathology will contribute to a better identification and management of the group of patients at risk for developing OB within a year...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the changes in somatic cell counts (SCC) in different fractions of milk, with special emphasis on the foremilk and cisternal milk fractions. Therefore, in Experiment 1, quarter milk samples were defined as strict foremilk (F), cisternal milk (C), first 400 g of alveolar milk (A 1), and the remaining alveolar milk (A 2). Experiment 2 included 6 foremilk fractions (F 1 to F 6), consisting of one hand-stripped milk jet each, and the remaining cisternal milk plus the entire alveolar milk (RM). In Experiment 1, changes during milking indicated {{the importance of the}} sampled milk fraction for measuring SCC because the decrease in the first 3 fractions (F, C, and A 1) was enormous in milk with high total quarter SCC. The decline in SCC from F to C was 50 % and was 80 % from C to A 1. Total quarter SCC presented a value of approximately 20 % of SCC in F or 35 % of SCC in C. Changes in milk with low or very low SCC were marginal during milking. Fractions F and C showed significant differences in SCC among different total SCC concentrations. These differences disappeared with the alveolar fractions A 1 and A 2. In Experiment 2, a more detailed investigation of foremilk fractions supported the findings of Experiment 1. A significant decline in the foremilk fractions even of F 1 to F 6 was observed in high-SCC milk at concentrations > 350 x 10 (3) cells/mL. Although one of these foremilk fractions presented only 0. 1 to 0. 2 % of the total milk, the SCC was 2 - to 3 -fold greater than the total quarter milk SCC. Because the trait of interest (SCC) was measured directly by using the DeLaval cell counter (DCC), the quality of measurement was tested. Statistically interesting factors (repeatability, recovery rate, and potential matrix effects of milk) proved that the DCC is a useful tool for identifying the SCC of milk samples, and thus of grading udder health status. Generally, the DCC provides reliable results, but one must consider that SCC even in strict foremilk can differ dramatically from SCC in the total cisternal fraction, and thus also from SCC in the <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Traffic is {{the main}} source of platinum-group element (PGE) {{contamination}} in populated urban areas. There is increasing concern about the hazardous effects of these new pollutants for people and for other living organisms in these areas. Airborne and road dusts, as well as tree bark and grass samples were collected at locations in the European cities of Göteborg (Sweden), Madrid (Spain), Rome (Italy), Munich (Germany), Sheffield and London (UK). Today, in spite of the large number of parameters that can influence the airborne PGE content, the results obtained so far indicate significantly higher PGE levels at traffic sites compared with the rural or non-polluted zones that have been investigated (background levels). The average Pt content in airborne particles found in downtown Madrid, Göteborg and Rome is in the range 7. 3  13. 1 pg m&# 8722; 3. The ring roads of these cities have values in the range 4. 1  17. 7 pg m&# 8722; 3. In Munich, a lower Pt content was found in airborne particles (4. 1 pg m&# 8722; 3). The same tendency has been noted for downtown Rh, with contents in the range 2. 2  2. 8 pg m&# 8722; 3, and in the range 0. 8  3. 0 and 0. 3 pg m&# 8722; 3 for motorway margins in Munich. The combined results obtained using a wide-range airborne classifier (WRAC) collector and a PM- 10 or virtual impactor show that Pt is associated with particles {{for a wide range of}} diameters. The smaller the particle size, the lower the Pt concentration. However, in particles <PM- 10, some of the highest values correspond to the fraction < 0. 39 um. Considering an average Pt content in all particles of approximately 15 pg m&# 8722; 3, which is representative for all countries and environmental conditions, the tracheobronchial fraction represents approximately 10 % and the <b>alveolar</b> <b>fraction</b> approximately 8 % of the total particles suspended in air. However, from the environmental risk point of view, an exposure to PGEs in traffic-related ambient air is at least three orders of magnitude below the levels for which adverse health effects might theoretically occur (of approx. 100 ng m&# 8722; 3). Therefore, today inhalation exposure to PGEs from automotive catalysts does not seem to pose a direct health risk to the general population. Even though the data available today indicate no obvious health effects, there are still a number of aspects related to PGEs and catalysts that justify further research. First, continual monitoring of changes in PGE levels in air and road dust is warranted, to make sure that there is no dramatic increase from today's levels. Secondly, more detailed information on the chemical composition of the PGE-containing substances or complexes leaving the catalyst surface and the size distribution of the PGE-containing particles released during driving will facilitate a more in-depth human risk assessment...|$|E

Clinical, gasometric and capnographic data allowed the decision to perform the thrombolysis with safety. The P(a-et) CO 2 gradient decreased from 46. 4 mmHg to 11. 8 mmHg (normal < 5 mmHg) and the end-tidal <b>alveolar</b> dead space <b>fraction</b> decreased from 0. 85 to 0. 37 (normal < 0. 15) from the pre-thrombolysis period to the 7 th day postthrombolysis.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} depth of {{anaesthesia}} have shown graded {{changes in the}} auditory evoked response (AER) in patients anaesthetized with increasing concentrations of volatile anaesthetic agents [1, 2]. In these studies the amplitudes of the early cortical waves, Pa and Nb, decreased progressively as the concentrations of halothane, enflurane and isoflurane were increased. However, when observed several minutes after induction of anaesthesia and before {{the administration of the}} volatile agent, the amplitudes of these early cortical waves appeared frequently to exceed their pre-anaesthetic values. In this period, anaesthesia was provided solely by nitrous oxide and the declining concentration of the induction agent, thiopentone. From these data {{it is not possible to}} differentiate between the effects of nitrous oxide alone, which could possibly have had an excitatory effect, and those effects produced by the potentially stressful sequence (induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation) that preceded it. Recent studies have shown that the depression of the early cortical AER by anaesthetic agents may be reversed partially by the stimulus of surgery [3]. We have conducted a cross-over study to examine the effects on these AER waves of the period immediately after induction and tracheal intubation in patients anaesthetized with equal MAC (minimal <b>alveolar</b> concentration) <b>fractions</b> of either nitrous oxide or isoflurane...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging of inhaled fluorinated inert gases ((19) F-MRI) such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF(6)) allows {{for analysis of}} ventilated air spaces. In this study, {{the possibility of using}} this technique to image lung function was assessed. For this, (19) F-MRI of inhaled SF(6) was compared with respiratory gas analysis, which is a global but reliable measure of <b>alveolar</b> gas <b>fraction.</b> Five anesthetized pigs underwent multiple-breath wash-in procedures with a gas mixture of 70 % SF(6) and 30 % oxygen. Two-dimensional (19) F-MRI and end-expiratory gas fraction analysis were performed after 4 to 24 inhaled breaths. Signal intensity of (19) F-MRI and end-expiratory SF(6) fraction were evaluated with respect to linear correlation and reproducibility. Time constants were estimated by both MRI and respiratory gas analysis data and compared for agreement. A good linear correlation between signal intensity and end-expiratory gas fraction was found (correlation coefficient 0. 99 +/- 0. 01). The data were reproducible (standard error of signal intensity 8 % vs. that of gas fraction 5 %) and the comparison of time constants yielded a sufficient agreement. According to the good linear correlation and the acceptable reproducibility, we suggest the (19) F-MRI to be a valuable tool for quantification of intrapulmonary SF(6) and hence lung function...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), we evaluated infiltration by T-lymphocytes and macrophages in lung tissue sections obtained from smokers with COPD undergoing lung volume reduction surgery (n= 8) as well as control smokers (n= 5) and nonsmokers (n= 4) undergoing lung resection for solitary lung cancer. Paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections were immunostained using antibodies against CD 4, CD 8, or CD 68 and the results showed that smokers with COPD had increased numbers of CD 4 ^+ T cells, CD 8 ^+ T cells, and CD 68 ^+ macrophages in the alveolar wall, compared with the control smokers and nonsmokers. Evaluation of the distribution of T cells by a morphometric analysis revealed that a greater number of CD 4 ^+ T cells than CD 8 ^+ T cells were located in the alveolar wall of emphysematous lesions characterized by a low <b>alveolar</b> wall <b>fraction</b> (Valv/Vv). By contrast, the number of CD 4 ^+ T cells was similar to that of CD 8 ^+ cells in normal areas as well as in fibrotic lesions characterized by a high Valv/Vv. These results suggest that CD 4 ^+ T cells {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of emphysema, an essential pathologic feature of COPD...|$|R

PE was diagnosed by pulmonary scintigraphy, helical tomography, and pulmonary angiography. The calculation of fDlate, AVDSf and P(a-et) CO 2 was based on volumetric capnography associated with arterial blood gas analysis. The pre-operative fDlate of the first patient was 0. 16 (cutoff 0. 12) and AVDSf was 0. 30 (cutoff 0. 15). However, the fDlate of the second patient was false-negative (0. 01) but, the AVDSf was positive (0. 28). Postoperative fDlate of the first patient was - 0. 04 and AVDSf was 0. 16; for the second patient, the values were 0. 07 and 0. 28, respectively.

30|$|The {{results of}} our study reflect {{pulmonary}} derecruitment with increased shunt fraction during ALI and mirror lung overinflation at the maximum PEEP of 30. After induction of ALI, alveolar collapse and increased pulmonary shunt lead to reduced oxygenation, reduced compliance and increased <b>alveolar</b> dead-space <b>fraction.</b> The increased arterio-end-tidal CO 2 difference is even more pronounced in the supine group. The shunt fraction of the prone group seems to stay lower within the whole trial. Whereas parameters of oxygenation (PaO 2 /FiO 2) and ventilation (PaCO 2, etCO 2) reflect global pulmonary shunt, they may not give information on pulmonary overdistension during the PEEP trial. During the phase of maximal airway pressure at PEEP 30, Cdyn is reduced and dead-space variables are increased in both groups. This reaction reflects overdistension of pulmonary parenchyma. However, lowest alveolar dead space (Vdalv/Vte) during the PEEP trial for each group is documented at decremental PEEP 20 d reflecting the reduction of shunt after recruitment of injured lung parenchyma. Richter et al. found in a surfactant-deficient model of lung injury in sheep that PP improved gas exchange by restoring aeration and decreasing shunt. Perfusion in dorsal lung regions was preserved, {{and the distribution of}} ventilation was more uniform [32]. Similar findings were also described by Maisch et al. in adults with healthy lungs undergoing general anaesthesia after a recruitment manoeuvre and PEEP titration. The highest compliance value together with the lowest alveolar dead space (at PEEP 20 d) indicated optimal alveolar recruitment whereas functional residual capacity and PaO 2 were insensitive to document alveolar overdistension [30].|$|R
40|$|For six {{successive}} milkings, six {{dairy cows}} were relocated immediately before milking to an unfamiliar operating theatre, a procedure previously shown to inhibit oxytocin release and milk ejection. Two control milkings were performed in familiar surroundings. After milk flow had ceased, two i. v. injections of 1 i. u. oxytocin {{were given to}} remove the remaining milk. Milk flow was recorded continuously and blood samples were taken every minute during milking and 10 min after milking. During the first milking in unfamiliar surroundings, no oxytocin was released. Thereby, only 13 % of the total milk yield, the cisternal milk, was available and the <b>alveolar</b> milk <b>fraction</b> could only be removed after injection of oxytocin. During subsequent relocations oxytocin release steadily increased toward the control level, although the timing of oxytocin release remained delayed as compared with controls. However, the milk fraction available before oxytocin injection increased with increasing number of removals, following an asymptotic approach to control levels. The concentrations of β-endorphin, cortisol (and perhaps also of prolactin) gradually declined {{with the number of}} times the animal was moved to unfamiliar surroundings, i. e. hormone concentrations gradually adjusted to control level. During milking, concentrations of prolactin and cortisol increased, while β-endorphin concentrations decreased (except for the first relocation). We conclude that milking-related oxytocin release and therefore milk ejection adapted gradually to repeated relocations to unfamiliar surroundings. This adaptation was inversely related to β-endorphin concentrations, so it is possible that oxytocin release was suppressed by high circulating β-endorphin concentration...|$|R
30|$|MWCNTs were {{obtained}} from Hodogaya Chemical Company (MWCNT- 7, lot no. 061220 - 31). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 – 300  g) were exposed to a MWCNT aerosol (5  mg/m 3) for 5  h. Rats were placed individually in sealed cages which were connected to the main exposure chamber (used as a mixing chamber for this study) through anti-static flexible tubing. Gilian gilair- 5 R basic air sampling pumps (Sensidyne, St. Petersburg, FL 33716 USA) were attached to the sealed cages to pull either aerosol of MWCNTs from the main exposure/mixing chamber or filtered air (control group) into the sealed cage at a flow rate of 1.25  l/min. Particle mass size distribution of MWCNT aerosol in the sealed cage was determined by a cascade impactor (MOUDI, Models 110 and 115, MSP Co., Shoreview, MN). The MWCNT mass concentration was determined by a physical gravimetric analysis with Teflon filters. The aerosol generation system, exposure chamber, and physical characterization of the MWCNT aerosol have been described elsewhere [10, 18, 19]. Using a deposition fraction of 1.5 or 2.7 % and an average minute ventilation of 186  ml/min [5], the total lung burden with our exposure scheme is calculated as 5  mg/m 3 (exposure concentration)[*]×[*]  186  ml/min (minute ventilation)[*]×[*]  10 −[*] 6  m 3 /ml (volume conversion)[*]×[*]  300  min (exposure duration)[*]×[*] 1.5 or 2.7 % (<b>alveolar</b> deposition <b>fraction),</b> which is approximately equal to 4.2 or 7.5  μg MWCNTs in rats.
