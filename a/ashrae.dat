25|$|Compared to {{estimating}} performance {{which is}} very cost effective (thus useful in design), testing, while costly, {{is still the most}} precise method. Further, testing centrifugal compressor performance is very complex. Professional societies such as ASME (i.e. PTC–10, Fluid Meters Handbook, PTC-19.x), <b>ASHRAE</b> (<b>ASHRAE</b> Handbook) and API (ANSI/API 617-2002, 672-2007) have established standards for detailed experimental methods and analysis of test results. Despite this complexity, a few basic concepts in performance can be presented by examining an example test performance map.|$|E

In 2000, <b>ASHRAE</b> issued guidelines to maintain water systems and {{to decrease the}} chances of Legionnaires' disease transmission.

25|$|The {{cooling system}} was based around a high-efficiency {{air-cooled}} condensing chiller. Each office was provided {{with its own}} thermal controls, from the mechanicals of the compartmentalized four-pipe and two-pipe fan-coil underfloor air distribution system, allowing ventilated air to be warmer and cleaner, to the operable windows and shades, so that occupants could work at their own comfort levels. Occupancy sensors shut off ventilation when no one is present. If these measures worked as planned, the total cooling load capacity would be only 29 watts per square metre (2.6 per square foot), and the building would see a 45% improvement over American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (<b>ASHRAE)</b> energy-use standards.|$|E

40|$|We have {{evaluated}} a 20 -in. photoelectric lens {{image intensifier}} tube (PLI) to be mounted on the spherical focal surface of the <b>Ashra</b> light collectors, where <b>Ashra</b> stands for All-sky Survey High Resolution Air-shower Detector, an unconventional optical collector complex that images air showers produced by very high energy cosmic-ray particles in a 42 ^∘-diameter field of view with a resolution of a few arcminutes. The PLI, the worlds largest image intensifier, has a very large effective photocathode area of 20 -in. diameter and reduces an image size to less than 1 -inch diameter using the electric lens effect.

500|$|Threatened with thirst, the Arab army left Baykand {{and headed}} for Bukhara, with Qatan in the vanguard. When the Turgesh and Soghdian forces attacked, the vanguard, some 6,000 men, was {{cut off from the}} main body under <b>Ashras,</b> and <b>Ashras</b> and Qatan gave each other up for lost until they met again two days later. The king of Samarkand, Ghurak, who had unto this moment {{remained}} ostensibly loyal to the Arabs—although, ever careful to hedge his bets, he had sent his son Mukhtar to the khagan—now switched sides. Exhausted by thirst, the Arab vanguard was almost cut down by their enemies, losing 700 men. At this point, according to the account preserved by al-Tabari, the Tamimi warrior al-Harith ibn Surayj, who was later to lead a widespread revolt in Khurasan, urged the Arabs forward, crying that [...] "being killed by the sword is nobler in (this) world and greater in reward with God than death by thirst". Encouraged by his example, the Tamimi and Qaysi cavalry under al-Harith and Qatan broke through the Turgesh lines and reached the water sources, narrowly staving off a second [...] "Day of Thirst" [...] and allowing <b>Ashras</b> to continue his advance towards Bukhara.|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} confront the Turgesh, <b>Ashras</b> {{assembled}} the forces of Khurasan, and led them to Amul on the Oxus River. A vanguard under Qatan, son of Qutayba ibn Muslim, was sent over the river and established a fortified camp, but {{with the arrival of}} the combined native Soghdian and Turgesh armies, the bulk of the Arab force was unable to cross for three months. During this period Qatan's force was beleaguered by the Turgesh, who at the same time crossed the Oxus in small raiding parties. <b>Ashras</b> gave command of his cavalry to Thabit Qutnah, who managed to rout the raiders and drive them to Amul. There the Arabs defeated the Turgesh, although a decisive victory eluded them as Turgesh reinforcements crossed the river and allowed the raiders to escape to safety back over the Oxus. At length <b>Ashras</b> got his forces across, linked up with Qatan ibn Qutayba, and began to advance on Bukhara. The Arabs beat off attacks to reach the trading town of , some five farsakhs—roughly —south of Bukhara itself and outside the oasis that surrounded the latter. After the Arab army encamped at Baykand, the Turgesh and Soghdians cut off the water supply from the oasis.|$|R
2500|$|The use of {{air filters}} can trap {{some of the}} air pollutants. [...] The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section wrote [...] " [...] Filtration should have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as {{determined}} by <b>ASHRAE</b> 52.2-1999." [...] Air filters are used {{to reduce the amount}} of dust that reaches the wet coils. [...] Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can reduce the efficiency of the coils.|$|E
2500|$|One way of quantitatively {{ensuring}} {{the health of}} indoor air is by the frequency of effective turnover of interior air by replacement with outside air. [...] In the UK, for example, classrooms are required to have 2.5 outdoor air changes per hour. [...] In halls, gym, dining, and physiotherapy spaces, the ventilation should be sufficient to limit carbon dioxide to 1,500 ppm. In the USA, and according to <b>ASHRAE</b> Standards, ventilation in classrooms {{is based on the}} amount of outdoor air per occupant plus the amount of outdoor air per unit of floor area, not air changes per hour. Since carbon dioxide indoors comes from occupants and outdoor air, the adequacy of ventilation per occupant is indicated by the concentration indoors minus the concentration outdoors. The value of 615 ppm above the outdoor concentration indicates approximately 15 cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per adult occupant doing sedentary office work where outdoor air contains 385 ppm, the current global average atmospheric CO2 concentration. In classrooms, the requirements in the <b>ASHRAE</b> standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, would typically result in about 3 air changes per hour, depending on the occupant density. Of course the occupants aren't the only source of pollutants, so outdoor air ventilation may need to be higher when unusual or strong sources of pollution exist indoors. When outdoor air is polluted, then bringing in more outdoor air can actually worsen the overall quality of the indoor air and exacerbate some occupant symptoms related to outdoor air pollution. Generally, outdoor country air is better than indoor city air. Exhaust gas leakages can occur from furnace metal exhaust pipes that lead to the chimney when there are leaks in the pipe and the pipe gas flow area diameter has been reduced.|$|E
50|$|<b>ASHRAE</b> {{continues}} to publish space-by-space ventilation rate recommendations, which are decided by a consensus committee of industry experts.
