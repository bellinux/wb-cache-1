25|$|Mares {{exist in}} a hierarchy, with the alpha female being the first to mate with the {{stallion}} and being the one to lead the group. When new mares {{are added to the}} group, they are met with hostility by the other mares. Thus, the stallion must shield the new mares until the aggression subsides. The most recently added females rank lowest. Females that become unfit or weak may drop in their rank, though. The female membership of a harem stays intact even if a new stallion takes over. Zebras strengthen their social bonds with grooming. Members of a harem nip <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> along the neck, withers, and back with their teeth and lips. Mothers and foals groom the most often, followed by siblings. Grooming shows social status and eases aggressive behaviour.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th-century {{historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Hua Tuo heals the general Guan Yu, who is {{hit by a}} poisoned arrow in the arm during the Battle of Fancheng in 219. Hua Tuo offers to anaesthetise Guan Yu, but he simply laughs and {{says that he is}} not afraid of pain. Hua Tuo uses a knife to cut the flesh from Guan Yu's arm <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> the poison from the bone, and the sounds strike fear into all those who heard them. During this excruciating treatment, Guan Yu continues to play a game of weiqi with Ma Liang without flinching from pain. When Ma Liang asks him later, Guan Yu says that he feigned being unhurt to keep the morale of his troops high. After Hua Tuo's successful operation, Guan Yu allegedly rewards him with a sumptuous banquet, and offers a gift of 100 ounces of gold, but Hua Tuo refuses, saying that a physician's duty is to heal patients and not to make profit. Although Hua Tuo historically died in 208, a decade before Guan Yu fought at the Battle of Fancheng, this story of him performing surgery on Guan Yu has become a popular artistic theme.|$|E

A common facial expression is the [...] "grimace face" [...] or flehmen response, which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and involves an open mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose closed eyes and relaxed ears. Lions also use chemical and visual marking; male lions will spray <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> both plots of ground and objects within their territory.|$|E
500|$|All {{sea turtles}} have similar basic nesting behaviors. Females return to lay eggs at {{intervals}} of 12–17 days during the nesting season, {{on or near}} the beach where they hatched. They exit the water, climb the beach, <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> away the surface sand to form a body pit. With their hind limbs, they excavate an egg chamber in which the eggs are deposited. [...] The females then cover the egg chamber and body pit with sand, and finally return to the sea. This process takes one to two hours, and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes, preferably near dune grasses that the females can use to camouflage the nest. The nesting area must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness, emergence ratio, and vulnerability to nest predators. Loggerheads have an average clutch size of 112.4 eggs.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} reasons why Ganteaume played no further Test cricket after his single match. Apart from {{the slow pace}} of his batting during that hundred—Goddard later suggested {{that it would have been}} better for Ganteaume's career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred— West Indies' batting was strong at the time and there was plenty of competition for places in the team. Even so, his teammate and later West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky to be left out of subsequent teams. It is also possible that Ganteaume was affected by his attitude to authority. The cricket journalist Martin Williamson suggests: [...] "Ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti-establishment attitude as for slow scoring. He was certainly not someone who was going to bow <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> to the white players who still dominated the region's cricket." [...] In later years, Ganteaume served as a Test selector and was West Indies manager in 1973–74. In 2007, his autobiography, My Story: The Other Side of the Coin was published, in which he criticised the West Indies [...] "establishment" [...] of his playing days. He died at the age of 95 on 17 February 2016. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer, and the second oldest in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Pampas deer do {{not defend}} {{territory}} or mates, but do have displays of dominance. [...] They show dominance by keeping their heads up {{and trying to}} keep their side forward, and use slow, deliberate movements.

[...] They may urinate into the scrape they've made, and sometimes defecate. [...] They rub the scent glands on their heads and faces into plants and objects.

2500|$|Guan Yu {{was once}} {{injured in the}} left arm by a stray arrow, which pierced through his arm. Although the wound had healed, he would {{experience}} pain in the bone whenever there was a heavy downpour. A physician told him, [...] "The arrowhead had poison on it and the poison had seeped into the bone. The {{way to get rid}} of this problem is to cut open your arm <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> away the poison in your bone." [...] Guan Yu then stretched out his arm and asked the physician to heal him. He then invited his subordinates to dine with him while the surgery was being performed. Blood flowed from his arm into a container below. Throughout the operation, Guan Yu feasted and drank wine and chatted with his men as though nothing had happened.|$|E

[...] The Skinny's Mark Shukla likewise gave a 4-star rating, explaining, [...] "The first four tracks set a blistering pace as churning riffs transition relentlessly into fret-burning breakdowns; all the while Chino Moreno deploying his wounded croon and lacerating howl with an intensity that remains impressively undiminished." [...] Sputnikmusic staff writer Nick Greer gave an unequivocally positive review. He awarded a [...] "classic" [...] 5-out-of-5 score and stated that the album is [...] "better than White Pony". He described the album's sound as [...] "intense and visceral, but introspective and sensitive in ways Deftones have never been before", before finally adding, [...] "I can honestly say it's Deftones' best album to date." [...] Scott Gordon of The A.V. Club stated that while there are moments on the album where Deftones [...] "sound a bit like a band on auto-pilot", many of the other tracks [...] "stomp such limp moments with pleasingly crude riffs that claw <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> through the verses, then release Chino Moreno's voice into glimmering, menacing choruses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of Klee's early {{preserved}} children's drawings, {{which his}} grandmother encouraged, were listed on his catalogue raisonné. A total of 19 etchings were produced during the Bern years; ten {{of these were}} made between 1903 and 1905 in the cycle [...] "Inventionen" [...] (Inventions), which were presented in June 1906 at the [...] "Internationale Kunstausstellung des Vereins bildender Künstler Münchens 'Secession'" [...] (International Art Exhibition of the Association for Graphic Arts, Munich, Secession), his first appearance as a painter in the public. Klee had removed the third Invention, Pessimistische Allegorie des Gebirges (Pessimistic Allegory of the Mountain), in February 1906 from his cycle. The satirical etchings, for example Jungfrau im Baum/Jungfrau (träumend) (Virgin on the tree/Virgin (dreaming)) from 1903 and Greiser Phoenix (Aged Phoenix) from 1905, were classified by Klee as [...] "surrealistic outposts". Jungfrau im Baum ties on the motive Le cattive madri (1894) by Giovanni Segantini. The picture was influenced by grotesque lyric poetries of Alfred Jarry, Max Jacob and Christian Morgenstern. It features an cultural pessimism, {{which can be found}} at the turn of the 20th century in works by Symbolists. The Invention Nr. 6, the 1903 etching Zwei Männer, einander in höherer Stellung vermutend (Two Men, Supposing to be in Major Position), depicts two naked men, presumably emperor Wilhelm II and Franz Joseph I of Austria, recognizable by their hairstyle and beards. As their clothes and insignia were bereft, [...] "both of them have no clue if their conventional salute [...] is in order or not. As they assume that their counterpart could have been higher rated", they bow <b>and</b> <b>scrape.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With {{any large}} number of people being in close {{quarters}} there was a constant threat of disease. [...] When one individual in a large group gets sick with a communicable disease, it spreads to others very quickly. [...] This premise remains true even today in the modern military. [...] The Romans recognized the difference between disease and wounds, each requiring separate treatment. [...] Drainage of excess water and waste were common practices in camps as well as the permanent medical structures, which come at a later date. [...] As the medical corps grew in size there was also specialization evolving. Physicians surfaced that specialized in disease, surgery, wound dressing and even veterinary medicine. Veterinary physicians were there to tend to livestock for agricultural purposes as well as combat purposes. [...] The Cavalry was known for their use of horses in combat and scouting purposes. [...] Because of the type of injuries that would have been commonly seen, surgery was a somewhat common occurrence. [...] Tools such as scissors, knives and arrow extractors have been found in remains. [...] In fact, Roman surgery was quite intuitive, in contrast to common thought of ancient surgery. [...] The Roman military surgeons used a cocktail of plants, which created a sedative similar to modern anesthesia. [...] Written documentation also showed surgeons would use oxidation from metal such as copper <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> it into wounds, which provided an antibacterial effect; however, this method was most likely more toxic than providing an actual benefit. [...] Doctors had the knowledge to clean their surgical instruments with hot water after each use. [...] Wounds were dressed, and dead tissue was removed when bandages were changed. [...] Honey and cobwebs were items used to cover wounds, and have even been shown today to increase healing. [...] Because of the wide array of cases, it was not uncommon for surgeons to begin their careers in the army to learn their trade. [...] Physicians such as Galen and Dioscorides served in the military. [...] Most major advancements in knowledge and technique came from the military rather than civil practice.|$|E
