5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the cycle {{have been used to}} explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher.

In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E

5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E

5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces {{in contact with the}} test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND A better {{understanding}} {{the mechanisms of}} cerebral ischemia is important both for diagnosis and treatment. OBJECTIVE The study aimed to quantify several characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to indicate the brain tissue changes <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS In the present study, a rat model of cerebral ischemia was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the left hemisphere. MRI and MRS were performed on 15 Sprague Dawley rats 4 H, 24 H, and 1  W after MCAO. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), relative ADC including FNR, PNR, PNF, and metabolite ratio NCC were proposed to reflect the changes of water diffusion and metabolism in brain tissue. RESULTS ADCs of focal zone and penumbra zone from 1  W group were significantly larger than those from 4 H group, respectively (both p <  0. 05). PNR and PNF of 24 H and 1  W groups were significantly less than 4 H group (all p <  0. 01). NCCs of focal zone and penumbra zone were significantly less than the normal zone within 4 H, 24 H, and 1  W groups, respectively (both p <  0. 01). While NCCs of penumbra zone from 24 H and 1  W groups were significantly larger than 4 H group (both p <  0. 01). CONCLUSION We conclude that combination of MRI and MRS characteristics can provide significant indicators for ischemic damage <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> cerebral ischemia in a rat model...|$|R
