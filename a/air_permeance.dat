The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{influence}} of beating and refining {{as well as the}} fibre furnish on the properties of silk paper, such as <b>air</b> <b>permeance,</b> softness, pore size, tensile index and burst index. The results showed that the beating characteristic of silk fibre was similar to that of plant fibre, they all had the characteristic of fibrillation. Silk paper had excellent softness and <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> when the beating degree of silk pulp was 20 °SR, 181. 3 µm/Pa·s and 2. 5 mN·m 2 /g respectively, which was superior to paper made from plant fibres of the same beating degree. The minimum average pore size of silk paper was 5. 11 µm at the beating degree of 20 °SR, and it decreased with the increase of beating degree, reached 0. 79 µm at the beating degree of 67 °SR. With the increase of beating degree, the tensile index of silk paper increased at first, and then decreased. The burst index of silk paper showed a upward trend, but the softness and <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> of it constantly decreased. The tensile strength of paper made from mixed-furnish pulp consisting of silk and softwood reached the maximum when the amount of silk fibre was 4 %, and its <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> increased with the increase of silk fibre...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of the neutral point voltage of three-phase synchronous reluctance motors {{is useful for}} obtaining information on the operating conditions of the motor and also on the Fourier coefficients of the <b>air</b> gap <b>permeance.</b> It is known that these parameters are crucial for the accurate evaluation of the motor’s main quantities. Modelling the motor so as {{to take into account}} of the harmonics of both magneto-motive force and <b>air</b> gap <b>permeance,</b> the homopolar component of the induced voltages is obtained. It is shown that amplitude and phase of each harmonic of the homopolar voltage can be expressed as a function of two Fourier coefficients of <b>air</b> gap <b>permeance,</b> which suggests using a procedure for on-line calculating these coefficients.

40|$|Weight {{limitations}} in electric/hybrid cars demand {{the highest possible}} power-to-weight ratio from the traction motor, as in double salient permanent magnet (PM) machines. Their high flux densities in the air gap result in nonlinear analytical models, which need to be time optimized. The incorporated reluctance networks {{are sensitive to the}} correctness of <b>air</b> gap <b>permeances.</b> Conventionally, in these networks, <b>air</b> gap <b>permeances</b> are calculated by approximating flux paths; however, it is time inefficient. For an improved simulation time, spatial discretization techniques are presented to calculate <b>air</b> gap <b>permeances</b> in double salient PM machines. The spatial techniques discussed here cover the tooth contour method and Schwarz–Christoffel (SC) mapping as semidiscrete methods, which are used to discretize only the air gap region. Their results are verified by the spatial discrete method and finite element method, which discretizes the whole machine geometry. For consistency in this paper, all methods are explained on a three-phase 12 / 10 flux-switching PM motor. Obtained <b>air</b> gap <b>permeances</b> show a very good agreement with only 0. 8 % difference. Further on, machine characteristics such as phase flux linkage and cogging torque are also compared to show the impact of the modeling techniques.

40|$|The {{influence}} of high temperature pressing on paper properties was investigated. Handsheets made of TMP, bleached and unbleached kraft pulp were pressed {{in a press}} simulator with the press surface heated to 300 °C. The density, tensile strength and <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> of the press dried sheets are compared with the values for conventionally pressed and dried reference sheets.

A further increase to 300 °C gave only a minor compressibility increase. The increase in density and tensile index for the press dried sheets is higher for the high yield, low refined sheets than for the bleached kraft sheets. The <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> of the press dried sheets was significantly lower than that of the conventionally pressed and dried sheets for TMP and for the low refined unbleached kraft.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project was {{to get more information}} about the influence of wind pressure on the heat transmission through timber frame con-structions and to establish a recommended limit for <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> of wind barriers. * The project was divided into three parts: wind pressure measurements on a rotatable test house, hot-box measurements on a wall, and calculations. The theoretical studies as well as the experimental investigations in the hot-box, have been restricted to one specific type of forced convection in the thermal insulation, the interchange of air be-tween the insulation and the air gap between the wind barrier and the outer cladding. The results of the project show the importance of protecting the insulation layer with a wind barrier to achieve full effect of the insulation in wind exposed constructions. The measurements indicate that heat loss caused by this type of forced convection can be three to ten times higher than calculated for ideal constructions. Based on the measurements carried out in this project, Norwegian Building Research Institute, NBI, is recommending an upper limit for the <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> of wind barriers, includ-ing joints, of 0. 05 m 3 /m 2 h Pa (1. 4 E- 5 m 3 /m 2 s Pa). 1...|$|E

The AIR steering committee developed goals for a two-phase testing program: Phase 1, quantify <b>air</b> <b>permeances</b> of single-ply and polymer-modified bitumen membrane materials; and Phase 2, quantify air leakage rates of seam-fastened mechanically attached single-ply and polymer-modified bitumen roof membrane assemblies. In Phase 1, four roof membrane materials were tested using ASTM E 2178 test protocol to measure the air permeability rates. The tested materials meet the air permeability criterion of ASHRAE 189. 1, ASHRAE 90. 1, and the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for effective air barrier materials. In Phase 2, a test method for measuring air leakage rates across membrane roof assemblies was developed. Test assemblies were constructed with seam-fastened mechanically attached Phase 1 roof membrane materials, rigid board roof insulation, and steel roof decks.

40|$|Greaseproof {{paper has}} a dense {{structure}} and therefore provides a natural barrier against materials like fat and oils. The barrier is obtained by extensive refining of the pulp. This refining is however a costly operation, {{not only in}} terms of direct costs for the refining but also in terms of indirect costs because the energy consumption for the drying of the paper is affected by the refining. A full-scale trial was performed to investigate the role of the pulp with respect to the energy demand and the barrier properties of the final papers. Paper made of 100 % sulphite pulp with a low degree of refining exhibited the lowest energy consumption at a given level of <b>air</b> <b>permeance.</b> In addition, the effect of refining on the <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> was compared with that of calendering. The calendering affected the <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> less than the refining. The papers produced in the full-scale trial were later used as substrates for coatings and for detailed studies of the paper structure. Coating with chitosan was examined on a bench-scale and on a pilot scale. The studies showed that greaseproof paper can be upgraded with an oxygen barrier, but also that suitable coating techniques are lacking for the application of the coating in a sufficient amount. The influence of the base paper on the barrier properties of chitosan-coated paper was investigated in another study, in which it was found that greaseproof paper possesses a unique coating hold-out which cannot be met by other types of paper with a more open structure. It was also found that the coated paper had a lower oxygen permeability than the chitosan coating itself, and this indicates that the dense surface layer of greaseproof paper contributed to the oxygen permeability of the coated paper. The pore volume fraction of the greaseproof paper was found to be approximately 40 % and it is therefore surprising that its <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> is so low. To bring understanding to this question, the structure of greaseproof paper was studied using several methods. It was found that the structure was dominated by very small pores with a median diameter of < 0. 3 µm. The fraction of closed pores was also substantial. A porosity gradient was also found, indicating that the papers used in the study had a closed surface. The hypothesis that the surface layer of the paper contributed to the oxygen barrier was tested in an experiment in which greaseproof paper was extrusion-coated with polyethylene. The oxygen permeability was measured at 0 %, 50 % and 90 % relative humidity, and the permeability was found to increase with increasing moisture content. Because only the cellulose layer in the paper and not the polyethylene layer in the coating is affected by moisture, this result supports the hypothesis that the surface layer of the paper contributed to the oxygen barrier properties of the coated paper...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} findings of a microporous molecular sieve zeolite composite membrane experimental study for dehumidification in building ventilation and air-conditioning systems. The dependence of membrane water and <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> from inlet airflow parameters (flow rate, humidity, temperature), and permeate total pressure was experimentally studied. Based on the obtained results, the membrane dehumidification system and the membrane air-conditioning system?s annual energy efficiency were estimated in an actual building located in a hot and humid climate. Membrane dehumidification process application was considered in three main areas: an energy recovery ventilation (ERV) system, an outdoor air dehumidification for dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), and an air-conditioning system that combines an evaporative cooling and the membrane dehumidification system. Application of the membrane separation process for building air-conditioning provides several advantages: improvement of an occupant?s health and comfort due to better ventilation rate, better energy efficiency, operation without fluorocarbon refrigerant, capability to collect pure water from the airstream during dehumidification process, no condensation during dehumidification provides mold resistant system, and separate control of sensible and latent load. The experimental data revealed, that with the existing technology studied zeolite membrane average effective <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> does not exceed (3 ? 0. 5) E- 9 kmol/(kPa-m?-s), and average effective water permeance is at least (5 ? 2) E- 6 kmol/kPa-m?-s that provides a membrane selectivity coefficient above 1500. The analytical model of the membrane ERV systems showed that at the design conditions, the ERV system can provide 0. 78 cross-flow enthalpy effectiveness with a membrane area of 0. 25 m?/cfm (0. 42 m?/ (m?/h)). The application of the membrane dehumidification system in a typical office building can provide an increase in dehumidification process energy efficiency from coefficient of performance of 4. 1 to 7. 4. This change in the coefficient of performance will provide energy savings between 6 % and 10 % for a conventional HVAC system. The membrane air-conditioning system analysis show that the system operating in actual weather conditions of College Station, Texas can provide annual energy efficiency of 0. 98 kW/TR with further possibility to reduce energy consumption to 0. 62 kW/TR (COP 5. 7) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of the new cellulase Cel 9 B from Paenibacillus barcinonensis for the modification of cellulose flax fibers was {{for the first time}} assessed in this work. Cel 9 B treatments were found to enhance the development of properties during the refining of fibers, the precise effects depending on the enzyme dose used. Scanning electron micrographs showed the treatments to alter flax fiber surface and cause defibrillation, peeling and fiber wall removal. Zero-span tensile strength was determined to elucidate the changes in intrinsic resistance of cellulose fibers and solubilization of carbohydrates evaluated by HPLC. Low Cel 9 B doses resulted in improved tensile strength in handsheets and can thus be used to save energy in the refining process. Also, on equal tear resistance, handsheets had a higher tensile index. High doses of Cel 9 B raised the collapsibility and bonding {{potential of}} cellulose flax fibers and produced heavier handsheets.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, winding {{function}} method (WFM), {{applied to}} a faulted synchronous generator, is modified and is used for online diagnosis of mixed eccentricity fault. For the first time, the static and mixed eccentricities are modeled in synchronous generators. A modified winding function (MWF) method introduced here is more precise compared with previous methods. This MWF enables to compute the <b>air</b> gap magnetic <b>permeance</b> accurately. Here, two or three terms of the infinity permeance series have not been used, but a closed form equation is employed for permeance evaluation. This leads to a very precise computation of the inductances of the faulted machine. Self inductances of the stator and rotor, mutual inductance of two stator phases and the mutual inductance of rotor and stator are obtained. Meanwhile, it is shown that static, dynamic and mixed eccentricities lead to the increase of the amplitude and occurrence of the distortion in the aforementioned inductances. Since calculation of inductances {{is the most important}} step for fault diagnosis of the machine, the proposed method improves the on-line diagnosis of the fault.

Characteristic case studies are depicted in selected 2 D and 3 D graphical plots for easy visualization and interpretation. The radon transport into buildings might be dominated by diffusion, pressure driven flow or a mixture of both depending on the actual values of the various parameters. The results of our work indicate that with realistic or typical values of the parameters, most of the transport of radon from the building ground to the indoor air is due to air leakage driven by pressure differences through the construction. By incorporation of various and realistic values in the radon model, valuable information about the miscellaneous parameters influencing the indoor radon level is gained. Hence, the presented radon model may be utilized as a simple yet versatile and powerful tool for examining which preventive or remedial measures should be carried out to achieve an indoor radon level below the reference level as set by the authorities...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{moisture}} related {{building envelope}} failures in wood frame walls with stucco cladding provided {{a reason for}} a question if adjacent components such as wood-based sheathing board or stucco layer could affect the field performance of water resistive barriers (WRB). This thesis either selected or developed a few experimental techniques for laboratory testing of WRB with the view to their use for evaluating the material performance. In particular, test methods such as <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> test, modified inverted cup test, and water absorption test were {{used to examine the}} effects from WRB surroundings on air and water transmission through the materials. Theoretically, WRB resistance to water transmission changes when chemicals e. g. surfactants or wood extracts are dissolved in the water. Yet, the measured moisture transmission did not indicate significant effects when wood extracts were dissolved in water or deposited on WRB surfaces. Neither four-month outdoor weathering nor laboratory mechanical stretching showed a significant effect in WRB performance when measured with typical test methods. This is because in most cases vapour transmission is a dominant phase of the transport. On the other hand, when employing more discrimination test methods, the interaction of bentonite particles with the wood extract deposits was evidently found to alter the water transport rate. Although this study did not address explicitly the durability of different WRB products, it showed the significance of an interactive weathering mechanism that could affect the long-term performance of some WRB products. By enhanced understanding of the interactions with the adjacent components of the wall, this study will assist in improved design of stucco cladding systems...|$|E
40|$|Airflow into, out of, {{and within}} {{buildings}} {{is fundamental to}} their design and operation as it can affect occupant health and comfort, building durability, and energy consumption. This thesis works to develop the understanding of airflow patterns and pressure regimes in high-rise multi-unit residential buildings which are both unique and complex due to the combination of their height, typical inclusion of operable windows, and compartmentalized layout. Specific attention is directed towards the performance of corridor pressurization based ventilation systems which are used pervasively within industry to ventilate and control contaminant transfer in these buildings. Airflow is caused by pressure differences which for buildings are created by the driving forces of wind, stack effect, and mechanical ventilation systems. These airflows are resisted by the <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> (i. e. airtightness) of building elements including the exterior enclosure and interior compartmentalizing elements. Using an experimental program at a case study building, this thesis assesses the interaction of these driving forces of airflow with the physical building to create the airflow patterns for a typical high-rise multi-unit residential building. Perflourocarbon tracer (PFT) testing was performed to measure in-service airflows {{into and out of}} the suites. This testing found that the air change rates of upper suites are significantly higher than that of lower suites and that most suites receive small fractions of modern ventilation rates or are over ventilated. Airflow measurements of the supply of ventilation air to each corridor indicate that these low flow rates are in part due to leakage of air from the supply duct. The PFT testing also found that significant airflow occurred from the parking garage below the building into the occupied building spaces indicating significant potential for transfer of harmful air contaminants. The <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> of the exterior enclosure and interior compartmentalizing elements were measured using neutralized fan pressurization and depressurization techniques and found to be within typical ranges. In particular this testing found that only 20 % of the flow paths out of the corridor were to the adjacent suites through the suite entrance doors and that flows to the elevator shaft and stairwells could create a significant inefficiency in the ventilation system. A long-term monitoring program was implemented at the case study building primarily to monitor exterior environmental conditions including wind and exterior temperature and to correlate these with measured pressure differences. A strong correlation was found between building pressure and exterior temperature. Nearly 70 % of the theoretical stack effect pressure was measured to act across the corridor to suite pressure boundary which creates a significant pressure differences to be overcome by the ventilation system, likely contributing to the uneven distribution of ventilation rates. Both wind and stack effect pressures were found to often be of similar or greater magnitude than mechanically induced pressure differences and thus can overwhelm the ventilation system. Overall, the corridor pressurization based ventilation system at the case study building does not effectively or efficiently ventilate the building and also does not provide sufficient control of air contaminants. As the case study building was found to be relatively representative of a typical multi-unit residential building, the findings from this building can be extended to many other buildings. Effective ventilation and airflow control in multi-unit residential buildings likely requires suite compartmentalization and direct supply of ventilation via ducted or in-suite systems...|$|E

Strong papers are desirable both in the traditional paper industry as well as in new fields of application, such as fibre-based packaging and light-weight building material. In this study, the effects of adding abaca (Musa textilis) as a reinforcement fibre for softwood pulp was investigated. Moreover, the LB Multilayer Handsheet Former for the production of stratified sheets was evaluated and used to study the effects of placing selected fibres in separate layers, rather than by making homogeneous sheets from a mixture of the pulps. Handsheets of a softwood sulphate pulp with the addition of abaca fibres were made in a conventional sheet former. It was seen that the addition of abaca fibres can increase the tearing resistance, fracture toughness, folding endurance and <b>air</b> <b>permeance.</b> Tensile strength, tensile stiffness and tensile energy absorption, however, decreased somewhat. It was shown that the LB Multilayer Handsheet Former is suitable for studying the effects of stratification of paper. The sheet former produces sheets with good formation and the variation of paper properties of the sheets is retained at a fairly constant level when the number of layers in the stratified sheets is increased. The uniformity of the sheets produced in the LB Multilayer Handsheet Former are generally at the same level as of those produced in conventional sheet formers. Homogeneous and stratified sheets were produced in the LB Multilayer Handsheet Former and it was found that by stratifying a sheet, so that pulp with a high tear index and pulp with a high tensile index are placed in separate layers, it was possible to increase the tear index by approximately 25 %, while the tensile index was decreased by 10 - 20 %...|$|E
40|$|Ink {{absorption}} {{performance in}} inkjet receptive coatings containing synthetic zeolite pigments was studied. Coating pigment pore and {{particle size distribution}} are the key parameters that influence in modifying media surface properties, thus affecting the rate of ink penetration and drying time (Schölkopf, et al. 2004). The primary objective of this study was: (1) to investigate the synthetic zeolite pigment effects on inkjet ink absorption, dynamic contact angle and printability, and (2) to evaluate these novel synthetic zeolite pigments in replacing the fumed silica pigments in conventional inkjet receptive coatings. In this research study, single pigment coating formulations (in equal P:B ratio) were prepared using microporous synthetic zeolite pigments (5 A, Organophilic and 13 X) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) binder. The laboratory-coated samples were characterized for absorption, <b>air</b> <b>permeance,</b> roughness, drying time, wettability and print fidelity. Based on the rheological data, {{it was found that}} the synthetic zeolite formulated coatings depicted a Newtonian flow behavior at low shear; while the industry accepted fumed silica based coatings displayed a characteristically high pseudoplastic flow behavior. Our coated samples generated using microporous synthetic zeolite pigments produced low absorption, reduced wettability and accelerated ink drying characteristics. These characteristics were caused due to the synthetic zeolite pigments, which resulted in relatively closed surface structure coated samples. The research suggested that no single selected synthetic zeolite coating performed better than the conventional fumed silica based coatings. Experimental data also showed that there was no apparent relationship between synthetic zeolite pigment pore sizes and inkjet ink absorption. For future research, above coated samples should be evaluated for pore size distribution using Mercury Porosimeter, which quantifies surface porosity of coated samples. This presented approach can be easily used for investigating other such microporous coating pigments in formulating inkjet receptive coating. The research findings will benefit the coating formulators, engineers and material science students, in understanding the absorption characteristics of selected synthetic zeolite pigments thereby encouraging them in identifying other such alternative pigments in conventional inkjet receptive coatings...|$|E

The MFC suspension used has a high water content and water is known to deteriorate {{the properties of the}} paper, so water treated paper substrates were prepared as references to give an indication of the effects that the processing has on the final properties of the coated papers. The structure of the MFC coating and associated surface properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by measuring the thickness and the roughness of the coated substrates. A tool to visualise the distribution of the MFC was developed and the tensile properties ofthe MFC coated substrates were characterised. Resistance to air, oxygen and water vapour permeationas well as water and grease absorption were used to describe the barrier properties of the coated papers. The MFC coated paper substrates exhibited a higher roughness than the reference paper substrate. This was due to the sensitivity of the substrate to water and not from the coating material it self since the water treated paper substrates showed an even higher roughness than the MFC coated substrates. The latter showed slightly increased tensile properties compared to the reference paper substrates, and most importantly, reduced <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> and grease absorption (- 100 % and - 84 % respectively); for the rod coated paper substrate with 3 g⁄m 2 coat weight. The water vapour transmission rate was also decreased with the applied MFC coatings. Advantages and drawbacks were identified for the coating techniques. The rod coating allowed a good control of the coat weight in a range of 1 to 3 g⁄m 2. However, the Mayer rod and the high viscosity of the MFC suspension caused poor MFC distribution and a coating which reproduced the rod pattern. With the size press, coat weights around 1 g⁄m 2 were reached. The MFC did not build a coating layer on the paper substrate surface but was impregnated into the paper substrate by the rollers...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the study, the {{selected}} wood and fiber properties were investigated in terms of their occurrence and variation in wood, as well as their relevance from the perspective of thermomechanical pulping process and related end-products. It was concluded that the most important factors were the fiber dimensions, juvenile wood content, and in some cases, the content of heartwood being associated with extremely dry wood with low permeability in spruce. With respect to the above properties, the following three pulpwood assortments of which pulping potential was assumed to vary were formed: wood from regeneration cuttings, first-thinnings wood, and sawmill chips. In the experimental part of the study the average wood and fiber characteristics and their variation were determined for each raw material group prior to pulping. Subsequently, each assortment - equaling about 1500 m 3 roundwood - was pulped separately for a 24 h period, at constant process conditions. The properties of obtained newsgrade thermomechanical pulps were then determined. Thermomechanical pulping (TMP) from sawmill chips had the highest proportion of long fibers, smallest proportion of fines, and had generally the coarsest and longest fibers. TMP from first-thinnings wood was just the opposite, whereas that from regeneration cuttings fell in between the above two extremes. High proportion of dry heartwood in wood originating from regeneration cuttings produced a slightly elevated shives content. However, no differences were found in pulp specific energy consumption. The obtained pulp tear index was clearly best in TMP made from sawmill chips and poorest in pulp from first-thinnings wood, which had generally inferior strength properties. No dramatical differences in any of the strength properties were found between pulp from sawmill residual wood and regeneration cuttings. Pulp optical properties were superior in TMP from first-thinnings. Unexpectedly, no noticeable differences, which could be explained with fiber morphology, were found in sheet density, bulk, <b>air</b> <b>permeance</b> or roughness between the three pulps. The most important wood quality factors in this study were the fiber length, fiber cross-sectional dimensions and percentage juvenile wood. Differences found in the quality of TMP manufactured from the above spruce assortments suggest that they could be segregated and pulped separately to obtain specific product characteristics, i. e., for instance tailor-made end-products, and to minimize unnecessary variation in the raw material quality, and hence, pulp quality...|$|E
40|$|Release liners {{are used}} in various {{self-adhesive}} applications such as hygiene products (feminine care and diapers), envelopes, labels, etc. The main function of the release liner {{is to protect the}} adhesive layer in the product. Release liner has to stick to the adhesive, but also be easily removed from it. Therefore, the optimal level of release force needed to peel off the release liner is important for the proper performance of the liner. Release liner consists usually of base paper, precoating, and silicone coating. Silicone offers easy release, but it is the most expensive part of the release liner. Precoating makes the paper surface smoother and allows the use of a thinner silicone layer. The properties of the base paper, such as roughness and porosity, as well as the properties of the precoating and silicone coating, such as coating coverage, affect the final performance of the release liner. In addition to the factors directly related to the release liner, the release performance is affected by other factors such as the adhesive, the face stock material and the peel speed and angle. For a release liner manufacturer, {{it is important to know}} well all the factors that affect the performance of the release liner in the final product. In this work, influence of base paper porosity, precoating and silicone amount of the release liner as well as impact of different adhesives on the release force were investigated. In the theoretical part of the work, the phenomenon of adhesion is introduced with the help of general adhesion theories, continued with the concept of practical adhesion, or the practical strength of the adhesive bond, with contributions of fundamental adhesion and energy dissipation in the peeling process. Then, the materials involved in the study are introduced starting from the base paper, precoating and silicone, and continuing with pressure-sensitive adhesives. For the experimental part of the work, release liner samples were prepared with a base paper of 3 different levels of porosity coated with a hand coater using 2 levels of precoating and 3 levels of silicone coating. <b>Air</b> <b>permeance</b> values (closely related to the porosity), coat weights, water contact angles, and surface roughness were determined for the release liner samples. Six commercial adhesives intended for release liner applications were then characterized by their rheological properties. Release tests were then performed for the 18 different release liner samples and 6 different adhesives. It was found that the porosity of the base paper at the porosity level used did not have strong influence, but paper with lower porosity would allow the use of lower level of precoating. The level of precoating and silicone coating expectedly had a significant influence on the release performance with a higher level of precoating allowing less silicone to be used. Unexpectedly, a clear correlation between the rheological properties of the adhesive and the release force was not found. Commercial adhesives intended for the same purpose (hygiene products) gave similar release forces...|$|E
40|$|For paper producers, an {{understanding}} of the development of strength properties in the paper is of uttermost importance. Strong papers are important operators both in the traditional paper industry as well as in new fields of application, such as fibre-based packaging, furniture and light-weight building material. In the work reported in this thesis, three approaches to increasing paper strength were addressed: mixing different pulps, multilayering and reinforcement with man-made fibres. In specific: The effects of mixing Swedish softwood kraft pulp with southern pine or with abaca (Musa Textilis) were investigated. Handsheets of a softwood kraft pulp with the addition of abaca fibres were made in a conventional sheet former. It was seen that the addition of abaca fibres increased the tearing resistance, fracture toughness, folding endurance and <b>air</b> <b>permeance.</b> Tensile strength, tensile stiffness and tensile energy absorption, however, decreased somewhat. Still it was possible to add up to about 60 % abaca without any great loss in tensile strength. As an example, with the addition of 30 % abaca, the tear index was increased by 36 %, while the tensile index was decreased by 8 %. To study the effect of stratification, a handsheet former for the production of stratified sheets, the LB Multilayer Handsheet Former was evaluated. The advantage of this sheet former is that it forms a stratified sheet at low consistency giving a good ply bond. It was shown to produce sheets with good formation and the uniformity, evaluated as the variation of paper properties, is retained at a fairly constant level when the number of layers in the stratified sheets is increased. The uniformity of the sheets produced in the LB Multilayer Handsheet Former is generally at the same level as of those produced in conventional sheet formers. The effects of placing southern pine and abaca in separate layers, rather than mixing them homogeneously with softwood pulp were studied. Homogeneous and stratified sheets composed of softwood and southern pine or softwood and abaca were produced in the LB Multilayer Handsheet Former. It was found that by stratifying a sheet, so that a pulp with a high tear index and a pulp with a high tensile index are placed in separate layers, it was possible to increase the tear index by approximately 25 %, while the tensile index was decreased by 10 - 20 %. Further, by mixing a pulp with less conformable fibres and no fines with a pulp with more flexible fibres and fines, a synergy in tensile strength (greater strength than that predicted by linear mass fraction additivity) was obtained. The effects of stratifying sheets composed of softwood and abaca were compared to the effects of refining the softwood pulp. Homogeneous and stratified sheets composed of softwood with three different dewatering resistances and abaca were also produced in the LB Multilayer Handsheet Former. It was found that by stratifying the sheets the tear index was retained while the tensile index was increased by the refining. The effects of reinforcing softwood pulp of different dewatering resistances with man-made fibres with low bonding ability were also investigated. Man-made fibres (i. e. regenerated cellulose, polyester and glass fibres) were added in the amounts 1, 3, or 5 wt% to softwood pulp of three different dewatering resistances. It was found that with refining of a softwood pulp and subsequent addition of long fibres with low bonding ability the tensile-tear relationship can be shifted towards higher strength values. The bonding ability of the man-made fibres was evaluated by pull-out tests and the results indicated that, in relation to the fibre strength, regenerated cellulose (lyocell) was most firmly attached to the softwood network while the glass fibres were most loosely attached...|$|E
40|$|Acacia mearnsii, Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus patula are {{the main}} {{commercial}} plantation species grown in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. They are a potential source of pulpwood for a proposed bleached kraft pulp and paper mill. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate and evaluate the technical factors to be considered when planning pulpwood plantations. An extensive literature survey of important pulpwood properties, with emphasis on measurable and potentially controllable properties, revealed that neither cellulose, lignin nor extractive content are universally reliable indicators of pulp yield. Wood density emerged as the most important pulpwood property affecting wood handling costs, pulp yield, pulp quality and digester productivity. Among the fibre properties, fibre length and fibre coarseness were found to have large influence on paper properties although this is more important where large differences occur such as those found between softwoods and hardwoods. To provide material for assessing the pulpwood quality, the hardwood species were sampled at single sites from 8 year old trees, while P. patula was sampled at two sites (Erin and Stapleford) from two age classes, 14 and 25 years (ie. 6 stands). For investigation of wood properties within trees, 25 mm thick discs were taken at six height levels (0, 10; 30, 50, 70 and 90 % up to 8 cm diameter over bark) from three sample trees from each of the six stands. The material was also used for pulping within tree of P. patula, by simulating utilisation of 7 year old thinnings, toplogs and slabwood. In order to determine the average pulpwood quality, six trees were sampled from each of the P. patula stands and twelve trees from each of the hardwood stands. A single log (15 cm long) was taken from the trees in rotation from the midpoint of the butt, middle and top third of the stem. Wood density was measured by an x-ray densitometric technique along the north and south radii of all sample trees. Fibre length and coarseness were measured by the Kajaani FS 200 fibre analyser. Investigation of fibre length was carried out on the north radii of a single tree from each of the four P. patula site-age classes, and two trees of each of the hardwoods. Fibre coarseness was only investigated on a single tree of each hardwood species. P. patula fibres caused blockages of the Kajaani capillary which frequently stopped the analysis and invalidated the measurement. A technique was developed for preparing whole fibres for determining length distributions and coarseness. Radial ships, while clamped between perforated metal plates, were partially delignified by kraft pulping and bundles of whole fibres were extracted from the pulped still), thereby avoiding the problem posed by cut and broken fibres. A special procedure was developed, using Millipore filters, to estimate oven-dry mass of the fibres in the suspension used in the Kajaani fibre analyser and through this the fibre coarseness. Wood properties were measured and recorded for each growth ring for P. patula and for every 5 mm section from the pith for the hardwoods. Within-tree data for P. patula were analysed on the basis of the age of tree when the growth ring was formed (year-number). Analyses of variance were used ito examine differences in density, fibre length and fibre coarseness between trees, between the north and south radii, between six height levels and between year- numbers or distances from pith. Regression analysis was used to estimate mathematical equations that best described the pattern of the wood property within the tree. Predicted values calculated from the equations were presented as grey scale maps to illustrate visually the within-tree variation pattern of the properties. P. patula showed an increase in wood density with tree age. The area-weighted mean densities of the 14 year old trees of P. patula were 0. 476 and 0. 492 g/cm 3 respectively for samples from Erin and Stapleford. The respective values for the 25 year old trees were 0. 557 and 0. 544 g/cm 3. A. mearnsii and E. grandis had area-weighted mean density values of 0. 811 and 0. 583 g/cm 3 respectively. For the three species, variation of density between trees, between heights and with year-number or distance from pith was statistically significant. For P. patula and A. mearnsii, density decreased with tree height, while density increased after an initial decrease from 0 to 10 % height level in E. grandis. In both P. patula and A. mearnsii, the overall decrease between 0 % and 90 % height levels was about 20 % for all trees. At all height levels, density increased from pith to bark. For P. patula the rate of increase from pith bark was similar at the different heights, resulting in a cylindrically symmetric within-tree pattern, similar to that reported for P. radiata (Cown & McConchie 1980). A similar pattern was found in A. mearnsii, but the central core of low density extended from about 30 % height level upwards. The pattern of wood density in E. grandis requires further work since the regression equation obtained had a low coefficient of determination and there were no obvious trends apparent. Equations from previous studies (e. g. Malan 1988) also failed to describe the density pattern. The corresponding points along the two radii of both P. patula and A. mearnsii were found not to differ significantly. Although a significant difference was observed in E. grandis, the difference was small in practical terms. Fibre length in P. patula increased with tree age. The ring area-weighted mean fibre length for the 14 year old trees were 3. 48 mm and 3. 07 mm respectively for the samples from Erin and Stapleford. Fibre lengths for the 25 year old trees were 3. 55 and 3. 84 mm respectively for Erin and Stapleford. The fibre length of 0. 89 mm for E. grandis was significantly (at the 5 % probability level) longer than the 0. 76 mm recorded for A. mearnsii. Fibre length varied significantly with tree height and with year-number or distance from pith. The general pattern in all three species was for fibre length to increase from a minimum at the butt, reaching a maximum at 10 or 30 % height level before decreasing towards the apex. Radial increase from pith to bark was more than 100 % at most height levels. In P. patula, most of this increase occurred in the first 10 growth rings from the pith. Unlike wood density, the within tree pattern for fibre length was nearly symmetric conically. These patterns closely resemble those reported for P. radiata (Cown & McConchie 1980). Both hardwood species exhibited a cylindrical distribution of fibre length within-tree. This difference arises from the linear radial increase found in the hardwoods as opposed to the curvilinear increase found in P. patula. E. grandis had coarser fibres, yielding an area-weighted fibre coarseness of 6. 19 mg/ 100 M compared to 4. 23 mg/ 100 m for A. mearnsit. The trend in the mean fibre coarseness is different in the two species. For A. mearnsu, fibre coarseness increased up the tree but in E. grandis there was a decrease with tree height. In E. grandis, fibre coarseness increased with distance from pith, while in A. mearnsu it remained relatively constant. The interesting point is that the radial trends are the reverse of those found for density. These results contradict the generally held view that density and fibre coarseness are correlated. More research is needed to clarify this because, while the relationship was statistically significant for E. grandis, that for A. mearnsii was not significant. Basic density of the pulpwood samples was 414 kg/m 3 for E. grandis, 610 kg/m 3 for A. mearnsii, and averaged 370 and 420 kg/m 3 for the 14 and 25 year-old P. patula. To achieve a Kappa number of between 20 and 30, P. patula, required 18 to 19 % active alkali to produce 44 to 45 % screened pulp yield. For Kappa number 20, A. mearnsii required 12. 5 % active alkali to yield 53. 0 % screened pulp and E. grandis 10. 5 % active alkali for 54. 2 % screened pulp yield. The study demonstrated that the two hardwood species can successfully pulped together resulting in a marginally lower screened yield. A. mearnsii had the highest pulp yield per cubic metre of wood (323 kg) followed by E. grandis (224 kg) and P. patula (174 kg). All pulps could be bleached to a brightness of 87 - 89 % ISO. Lightly beaten pulp from the 25 year old P. patula trees had the highest tear index (18 - 21 mN. m 2 /g), and highly beaten pulps from the 14 year old P. patula trees had the highest tensile index (112 - 115 N. m/g) and burst index (about 9 kPa. m 2 /g). Bleaching reduced tear index but increased tensile index. At 300 Csf, the tensile and tear indices for E. grandis pulp (127 N. m/g and 11. 0 mN. m 2 /g) and for A. mearnsii pulp (103 N. m/g and 9. 4 mN. m 2 /g) would be classified as very good and adequate for use in unbleached packaging papers. A. mearnsii pulp had higher opacity (70 vs 65 %) which is crucial for printing papers. Bleaching reduced tensile index by about 14 % in both species. The pulping and papermaking results of A. mearnsii demonstrates that the conventional prejudice against the use of this species as pulpwood in Zimbabwe may be wrong. Its high density means that on a volume basis, there is more wood material that can be transported and higher pulpwood productivity will enable pulp production from less volume of wood for a given digester capacity. These all have beneficial economic consequences to the pulp producer. The species has the added advantage that it can be successfully co-pulped with the other major hardwood species. A new sampling scheme was developed to provide wood formed when trees were 7 years old. This was useful in demonstrating that pulp yield and papermaking properties of the simulated 7 year old thinnings of P. patula were not influenced by tree age from which they were extracted. Bulk density decreased in the order of slabwood, toplog and 7 year old. Slabwood produced pulp with the highest tear index. This property was about the same for toplogs and 7 year old material. The test results for the P. patula components provided an opportunity for correlation analysis of wood density and fibre length with pulp properties (freeness, bulk, tear index, tensile index, stretch, burst index and <b>air</b> <b>permeance).</b> All handsheet properties examined (except freeness and stretch from high tearing strength pulp) could be predicted in terms of wood density and fibre length to the extent of accounting for at least 69 % of the variation. A model was developed for estimating plantation areas required for the production of the proposed pulp grades. It involves three parameters and the associated coefficients of variation, namely pulp yield (Y), basic density of wood (BD) and mean annual volume increment (MA 1). Using the growth rates of similar species in South Africa and test results from this study, it is estimated that the 60 000 t/y mill could be supplied from about 20 000 ha of dedicated pulpwood plantations. The results show that growing P. patula pulpwood on 25 year rotation as against 14 year rotation will provide high strength pulps for packaging papers.
