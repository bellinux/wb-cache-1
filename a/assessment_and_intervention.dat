25|$|Many {{intensive}} behavioral interventions {{rely heavily}} on discrete trial teaching (DTT) methods, which use stimulus-response-reward techniques to teach foundational skills such as attention, compliance, and imitation. However, children have problems using DTT-taught skills in natural environments. These students are also taught with naturalistic teaching procedures to help generalize these skills. In functional assessment, a common technique, a teacher formulates a clear description of a problem behavior, identifies antecedents, consequences, and other environmental factors that influence and maintain the behavior, develops hypotheses about what occasions and maintains the behavior, and collects observations to support the hypotheses. A few more-comprehensive ABA programs use multiple <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> methods individually and dynamically.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: This aim of {{this study}} was to obtain a {{consensus}} from clinicians regarding occupational therapy for people with depression, for the <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices they use that are not currently supported by research evidence directly related to functional performance. The study also aimed to discover how many of these <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices were currently supported by research evidence. METHODS: Following a previously reported systematic review of <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices used in occupational therapy for people with depression, a modified nominal group technique was used to discover which <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices occupational therapists currently utilize. Three online surveys gathered initial data on therapeutic options (survey 1), which were then ranked (survey 2) and re-ranked (survey 3) to gain the final consensus. Twelve therapists completed the first survey, whilst 10 clinicians completed both the second and third surveys. MAJOR FINDINGS: Only 30 % of the <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> practices identified by the clinicians were supported by research evidence. A consensus was obtained on a total of 35 other <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> <b>interventions.</b> These included both occupational-therapy-specific <b>and</b> generic <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> <b>interventions.</b> Principle conclusion. Very few of the <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> <b>interventions</b> identified were supported by research evidence directly related to functional performance.

Second, we identified the attributes and the attribute values in order to describe the entities in more detail. The data type and optionality of the attributes were then defined. Third, the entities, attributes and value sets in the DCMs were mapped to the International Classification for Nursing Practice Version 2 concepts. Finally, the DCMs were validated by domain experts and applied to case reports. Results: In total 481 DCMs, 429 DCMs for nursing <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> 52 DCMs for nursing <b>interventions,</b> were developed <b>and</b> validated. The DCMs developed in this study were found to be sufficiently comprehensive in representing the clinical concepts of nursing <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> <b>interventions.</b> Conclusions: The DCMs developed in this study can be used in electronic nursing records.

2500|$|As well as {{behavioral}} {{interventions and}} supports, {{school psychologists are}} often responsible for selecting and implementing academic interventions. In the 1990s, school psychology service delivery shifted towards a problem-solving focus, which is an approach aimed at developing interventions and ensuring outcomes. This was {{in contrast to the}} previous wait-to-fail model. This problem-solving approach is commonly referred to as the Response to Intervention (RTI) framework and is steadily becoming adopted by more and more schools. It is made up of a multi-tiered system of support that provides interventions and services to students with an increasing intensity based on severity of needs. [...] RTI necessitates that school psychologists be involved in the early identification of learning and behavioral difficulties and needs. School psychologists work collaboratively with teachers and other special education staff to determine what services and supports need to be implemented to best serve struggling students. RTI includes specific components to effectively ensure that all students are making adequate progress. Included is: 1) High quality instruction and behavioral support, 2) Well-researched, evidence-based interventions that are implemented with fidelity, 3) Continuous progress monitoring and data collection, 4) Continuous collaboration of an educational team, and 5) Parent involvement and participation. [...] These interventions can be conceptualized as a set of procedures and strategies designed to improve student performance with the intent of closing the gap between how a student is currently performing and the expectations of how they should be performing. [...] Short term and long term interventions used within a problem-solving model must be evidence-based. This means the intervention strategies must have been evaluated by experimental or quasi-experimental research that utilized rigorous data analysis and peer review procedures to determine the effectiveness. [...] Implementing evidence-based interventions for behavior and academic concerns requires significant training, skill development, and supervised practice. Linking <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> is critical for determining that the correct intervention has been chosen. [...] School psychologists have been specifically trained to ensure that interventions are implemented with integrity to maximize positive outcomes for children in a school setting.|$|E

40|$|Background: The current {{practice}} of occupational therapy services provided {{for children with}} autism spectrum disorders in Victoria, Australia was investigated - specifically, practice {{in terms of the}} theories, <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> strategies utilised. Identification of professional development needs was also explored. The purpose was to identify how occupational therapy practice may have changed over the last decade and to explore what additional developments are required in the field. Method: A self-administered survey was mailed to 322 registered members of Occupational Therapy Australia Limited, Victoria Branch. Results: A valid response rate of 20. 5 % was obtained. The majority of the participants worked in private practice, and had between one and five years of work experience. Theories, <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> <b>interventions</b> that are associated with or based on, sensory integration and/or processing approaches are highly utilised by the participants in their service delivery with children with autism spectrum disorders. Participants indicated that they felt they needed training and courses around sensory integration. Conclusions: We concluded that there were few changes in occupational therapy practice related to the selection of theoretical models, <b>assessments</b> <b>and</b> <b>interventions</b> by {{the participants in this study}} over the last decade. It is essential for occupational therapists not to neglect the goals of providing occupation-based interventions to children with autism spectrum disorders by focusing only on sensory-based approaches.

40|$|Because case {{management}} {{of children with}} elevated blood lead levels varies markedly among states, cities, and other jurisdictions, the Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention developed these nationally applicable recommendations. Based on recently published studies and augmented with opinions of experts, this report defines the elements of {{case management}} <b>and</b> offers <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> management guidelines for health departments, case managers, primary care physicians, and other professionals. Not all recommendations are appropriate for any individual child because of variations in age, blood lead level, housing status, and 2 ̆ 014 most important 2 ̆ 014 the ability of caregivers to respond to recommendations without being overwhelmed. The report contains five chapters {{in addition to the}} introduction: home environment investigation <b>and</b> <b>interventions,</b> medical evaluation <b>and</b> treatment, nutritional <b>assessment</b> <b>and</b> dietary modification, developmental surveillance <b>and</b> <b>interventions,</b> <b>and</b> education for caregivers. At the beginning of each chapter is a summary table of specific management recommendations. (The remainder of the tables, the figures, and the references are {{at the end of each}} chapter.) The text of the chapters provides the detailed information and references upon which most recommendations are based. Each chapter concludes with suggestions for further research. This report, in addition to addressing the case management of individual children, also discusses the importance of state laws, regulations, and financing related to lead abatement efforts and the provision of appropriate services for affected children. Finally, the authors of this report recognize that case management is involved with the secondary prevention of elevated blood lead levels and that primary prevention by the removal of ongoing lead exposure sources should be promoted as the ideal and most effective means of preventing elevated blood lead levels.
