40|$|Abstract: For {{the past}} several years, several {{techniques}} of physiology have been applied to overcome the water deficit and drought stress in field crops. However little information is gained on the response to PBZ and ABA treatments under drought stress and their ameliorative actions on Sesamum. So a study was carried out to understand the effect of PBZ and ABA on drought stress amelioration in Sesamum indicum L. The main aspects studied were the non-enzymatic antioxidant changes {{in different parts of}} treated, drought stressed as well as control plants. The non-enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid and tocopherol) were extracted and estimated. The non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules like ascorbate and-tocopherol showed significant increase under drought condition in Sesamum indicum. PBZ caused significant enhancement in these antioxidant enzymes under drought stress and also in well-watered conditions. It is not so with ABA treatment. ABA slightly reduced the non-enzymatic antioxidant contents. From the results, it can be concluded that, these growth regulators are better suited as stress <b>ameliorating</b> <b>agents</b> in gingelly.

Recent studies have identified high-glucose induced p 38 MAPK (p 38) over-activation in mesangial cells. Mesangial hypocontractility is the major underlying mechanism, however, no <b>ameliorating</b> <b>agents</b> are currently available. We investigated the protective effects of emodin on high-glucose induced mesangial cell hypocontractility. Mesangial cells were cultured under normal (5. 6 mM) and high glucose (30 mM) conditions. Emodin was administrated at doses of 50 mg/l and 100 mg/l. Angiotension II stimulated cell surface reductions were measured to evaluate cell contractility. p 38 activity was detected using Western blotting. To further explore the possible mechanism of emodin, expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was measured and its specific inhibitor, gw 9662, was administrated. Our results showed: (1) high-glucose resulted in a 280 % increase in p 38 activity associated with significant impairment of mesangial contractility; (2) emodin treatment dose-dependently inhibited high-glucose induced p 38 over-activation (a 40 % decrease for 50 mg/l emodin and a 73 % decrease for 100 mg/l emodin), and mesangial hypocontractility was ameriolated by emodin; (3) both the PPARγ mRNA and protein levels were elevated after emodin treatment; (4) inhibition of PPARγ using gw 9662 effectively blocked the ameliorating effects of emodin on high-glucose induced p 38 over-activation and mesangial hypocontractility.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the use of Senna multijuga associated with peat in the phytostabilization of copper contaminated soil. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse for 120 days, using an entirely randomized design in a factorial arrangement (2 x 6), with and without peat (200 mL L- 1 soil) and six doses of copper (0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 mg kg- 1), with six repetitions of each treatment. At 120 days after seedling, the plants were evaluated for height, stem diameter, root and aerial dry matter, contents and accumulated amount of copper in the root system and aerial part. Also, the Dickson quality indexes, as well as tolerance and translocation indexes were analyzed. The results showed that the use of 200 mL of peat L- 1 of soil was inefficient as an <b>ameliorating</b> <b>agent</b> for copper-contaminated soil, but it acted as a soil conditioner, increasing the morphological parameters of S. multijuga.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1965. Bibliography: leaves [125]- 132. xiii, 140 l mounted illus. (part col.) tables (part fold.) While calcium {{has long}} been known as an {{essential}} macro-nutrient for plants, it has had the distinction of having been used as a soil <b>ameliorating</b> <b>agent</b> {{from the very beginning of}} organized soil husbandry (Thompson, 1957). Calcium is ascribed several roles in plant nutrition, among which is its role in the formation of cell wall constituents, that of nitrogen metabolism and as activator of several enzyme systems. (Meyer et al., 1960). Even so, Fried and Peech (1946) discussing calcium as a nutrient, carne to the conclusion that supplying calcium as such was not important, on the probable assumption that most well-cultivated agricultural soils have a sufficient supply of calcium for nutritional purposes. Thus, it is no surprise that most of the work done with calcium has been on its role as a soil <b>ameliorating</b> <b>agent,</b> or as a liming material on acid soils, for promoting the growth of certain crops. Under the general term of lime, many materials, such as calcium carbonate, hydrated lime, dolomitic limestone, silicic slags of various descriptions, crushed serpentine rocks, cement kiln dusts, etc., have been included. Numerous reasons have been adduced by several workers for the ameliorating effect of these soil amendments in relation to the growth of specific plants on these acid soils. Among these, some of the more important are: a) Promotion of more favorable soil physical conditions (Coleman et ~, 1958). b) Improvement in the fixation of nitrogen by improved soil microbial activity (Black, 1957). c) Beneficial effect of phosphorus release from the breakdown of organic phosphates (Ghani & Aleem, 1942). d) Reduction of phosphorus fixation in soils (Mitscherlich, 1947). e) Reduction of toxic levels of manganese and aluminum in soils (Mulder & Gerretsen, 1952). f) Increasing the general effectiveness of other elements (Truog, 1953). The literature also gives ample evidence of injury to crops due to overliming (Richardson, 1951; Russel, 1961). In tropical soils, while a great deal of research has been concentrated on the amelioration and utilization of leached-out acid soils, nevertheless many gaps as in a "jigsaw puzzle" yet remain to be filled. 111 is situation is best illustrated in the words of Schmehl et al., (1950) "... the poor plant growth associated with acid soils is a complex function of many contributing factors, all of which may be modified by liming. Not until the relative importance of the different beneficial effects of liming acid soils is fully evaluated will it be possible to make the most intelligent use of lime... " As for the research findings reported in this thesis, it must be pointed out that much work has already been done on the amelioration with lime of these Akaka soils (Monteith, 1961; King, 1961; Rixon, 1962; Clements, 1962, 1963; Reddy, 1964; Rana, 1964). The present work is thus an extension of the work already done, in which Akaka subsoil (2 - 5 feet depth) has been investigated. The main areas where the work to be reported here would contribute to additional. knowledge are: a) The laboratory study of the progressive dehydration of these soils from the state of field moistness to complete dryness, with respect to certain chemical, physical, as well as mineralogical changes. b) Use of these soils at three different moisture levels (moist, 50 % moist, dry) 1 for studying their response to liming. This is the first time that an intermediate moisture level has been investigated in fertility studies in these soils. c) An investigation concerning the physical mixing of the moist and dry soils in varying proportions with respect to response to lime and plant growth. d) The use of crushed Olivine Sand as a soil amendment, since this material is found occurring in abundance in the Hawaiian islands. It would prove to be an economic soil amendment if found efficacious. In addition to crushed Olivine sand, crushed coral rock and calcium silicate (TVA) was also investigated...|$|E

Group A represented the unexposed control, whereas groups B and C were exposed orally to 0. 15 and 0. 3 ml of crude oil respectively every other day for 56 days. Both the low dose and high dose oral administration of crude oil caused {{a significant reduction in}} the serum testosterone level (STL) and cauda epididymal sperm reserve (CESR) of the exposed rats when compared to the control. Crude oil withdrawal and vitamin E supplementation significantly improved the cauda epididymal sperm reserve (CESR) in all the subgroups. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities of the control and low dose group were significantly lower than those of the high dose group. The high dose crude oil administration significantly decreased the mean serum total protein (STP) and sodium ions (Na+) concentration. The mean serum total cholesterol (STC) value of the low dose group was significantly higher than those of the control and high dose group. However, crude oil withdrawal and vitamin E supplementation did not significantly alter the mean serum total protein (STP) and mean serum total cholesterol (STC) values in all the subgroups.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the potential beneficial effect of bosentan in <b>ameliorating</b> fibrotic <b>agents</b> in diabetic mice. Methods: Male 6 -week old C 57 BL/ 6 mice {{were divided into}} 3 groups (N= 20) : Control group, diabetes mellitus (DM) group and DM-B group (diabetes with bosentan group). Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected as 200 mg/Kg for single dose, i. p. (intraperitoneal injection). Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured at 0 -, 1 -, 2 -week after STZ injection to confirm that diabetes was induced in the mice. Bosentan (100 mg/Kg) and placebo was given i. g. (intragastric administration) once a day immediately after STZ injection for 18 weeks. The mRNA expression of tissue growth factor beta (TGF-b), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and collagen- 1 were evaluated by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. Differences in the data between the groups were compared by Student t-test for independent samples. Results: After 18 weeks of diabetic situation, FBG of DM-B mice {{was significantly higher than}} that of control mice and was similar with that of DM mice (DM mice vs. control mice, p 0. 05).

Neurochemical studies suggest, alterations in catecholaminergic, mainly dopaminergic and noradrenergic, transmitter functions markedly contribute to the symptoms of this disorder. The symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are significantly <b>ameliorated</b> by the <b>agents</b> that specifically influence these neurotransmitters. Animal studies implicate {{areas of the brain}} in which these neurotransmitters are most dominant. Psychostimulant medications are generally the first choice in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

40|$|Bone {{remodeling}} is {{a balanced}} process between bone synthesis and degradation, maintaining homeostasis and a constant bone mass in adult life. Imbalance {{will lead to}} conditions such as osteoporosis or hyperostosis. Osteoblasts build bone, becoming embedded in bone matrix as mature osteocytes. Osteocytes {{have a role in}} sensing and translating mechanical loads into biochemical signals, regulating the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts residing at the bone surface through the secretion of Sclerostin (SOST), an inhibitor of WNT signaling. Excessive mechanical load can lead to activation of cellular stress responses altering cell behavior and differentiation. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a shared pathway utilized by cells to cope with stress stimuli. We showed that in a transgenic mouse model, activation of the UPR in early differentiating osteocytes delays maturation, maintaining active bone synthesis. In addition, expression of SOST is delayed or suppressed; resulting in active WNT signaling and enhanced periosteal bone formation, and the combined outcome is generalized hyperostosis. A clear relationship between the activation of the unfolded protein response was established and the onset of hyperostosis that can be suppressed with a chemical chaperone, sodium 4 -phenobutyrate (4 -PBA). As the phenotype is highly consistent with craniodiaphyseal dysplasia (CDD; OMIM 122860), we propose activation of the UPR could be part of the disease mechanism for CDD patients as these patients are heterozygous for SOST mutations that impair protein folding and secretion. Thus, therapeutic <b>agents</b> <b>ameliorating</b> protein folding or the UPR can be considered as a potential therapeutic treatment...|$|R
