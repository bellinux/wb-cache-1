5000|$|In October 1963 AMP (now TE Connectivity) {{introduced}} the MATE-N-LOK connector. The <b>AMP</b> <b>connector</b> {{was similar to}} the patented Molex connectors but not interchangeable. Both were widely used in the computer industry and the term [...] "Molex Connector" [...] is often improperly used to refer to all nylon plugs and receptacles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fighting}} game {{board has}} two revisions. While looking like one, the first revision {{is not true}} JAMMA, as the sound {{does not come from}} the JAMMA edge but from an <b>AMP</b> <b>connector</b> mounted {{on the front of the}} board, which is controlled by a potentiometer. There is a modification available to get mono sound off the JAMMA edge which involves removing a jumper and setting another. There is also an extra +5v connector that is supposed to be connected to the back of the board to [...] "prolong" [...] the life of the board per SNK. It is still unconfirmed if having the extra +5v connector connected actually does increase the board's life. Some say it is to divert the heat of the high amps going through the JAMMA edge.|$|E
50|$|Revision 1 has {{a volume}} port and <b>amp</b> <b>connectors</b> {{on the front}}, while the Revision 2 board has only <b>amp</b> <b>connectors</b> (around five) {{on the front of}} the board.|$|R
50|$|The first 5.25 inch {{floppy disk}} drive, the Shugart SA400, {{introduced}} in August 1976 used the <b>AMP</b> MATE-N-LOK <b>connector</b> part number 350211-1. This connector became {{the standard for}} 5.25 inch format peripherals such as hard drives and was used until introduction of SATA drives. In 1983, Molex introduced the 8981 connector that was fully compatible with the <b>AMP</b> MATE-N-LOK <b>connector.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lower power devices (e. g. 3.5 inch floppy drives) use {{the smaller}} <b>AMP</b> 171822-4 <b>connector</b> instead.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of similar design PC board power connectors, {{including}} Molex Mini-Fit SR, Molex Mini-fit jr., MOLEX MICROFIT and Molex SABRE <b>connectors,</b> and <b>AMP</b> DUAC <b>connectors</b> that look similar to each other.|$|R

40|$|The MIDFILM cell {{fabrication}} and encapsulation processes {{were demonstrated}} {{as a means}} of applying low-cost solar cell collector metallization. The average cell efficiency of 12. 0 percent (AM 1, 28 C) was achieved with fritted silver metallization with a demonstration run of 500 starting wafers. A 98 percent mechanical yield and 80 percent electrical yield were achieved through the MIDFILM process. High series resistance was responsible for over 90 percent of the electrical failures and was the major factor causing the low average cell efficiency. Environmental evaluations suggest that the MIDFILM cells do not degrade. A slight degradation in power was experienced in the MIDFILM minimodules when the <b>AMP</b> Solarlok <b>connector</b> delaminated during the environmental testing...|$|R
