Pillsbury {{executive vice president of}} restaurant operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival, McDonald's. One of his first acts was to initiate an <b>advertising</b> <b>plan</b> emphasizing claims that Burger King's flame-broiled burgers were better and larger than its rival's. The program, arguably the first attack ads on a food chain by a competitor, was controversial in that before it fast food ads only made allusions to the competition without ever mentioning them by name. McDonald's sued Burger King, their ad agency at the time J. Walter Thompson. The child actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was also implicated in the lawsuit because of her appearance in these television commercials. The suit was settled the following year on undisclosed terms. Despite the controversy, the ad plan, dubbed the Burger Wars, boosted same store sales. Brinker continued working for the company in this capacity until 1982 when he was promoted to president of Pillsbury's food service division, which included the company's other chains beyond Burger King. Brinker left the company in 1984 to take the helm at Dallas-based gourmet burger chain Chili's.|$|E

The study provides a conceptual grounding for understanding the shift from dyadic to multiple relationships in <b>advertising</b> <b>planning.</b> It focuses on the degree of collaboration and integrative relationships inherent. Using a theoretically derived, grounded theory approach, depth interviews were conducted with twenty two practitioners spread across four dominant parties: advertising account management and creatives, independent media planners and researchers. Four core constructs were abstracted from the data forming the conceptual basis for a model. These were shared (agency) purpose and philosophy, personal chemistry between involved parties, power relations between parties with their incumbent conflictual tensions and finally trust between parties. The study provides an important bridgehead, opening up and exploring the increasingly networked foundations for <b>advertising</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R

One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach (Defining Advertising Goals for Measured Advertising Results) developed in the 1960s. While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects.|$|E

40|$|Advertising {{is one of}} the key {{marketing}} tools {{managers have}} at their disposal to influence their customers into purchasing a new product. The overall objective of new product advertising is to inform and persuade customers. Drawing up an <b>advertising</b> <b>plan</b> for a new product that is under the influence of diffusion phenomenon is not an easy task. Hence, research in this area is very limited. In our research, we use an empirically proven diffusion demand function that explicitly incorporates the advertising component. Our results suggest that optimal advertising is determined by the advertising effectiveness, discount rate, and the ratio of advertisement to profits. Depending upon the interplay among these factors, the optimal advertising takes decrease-increase, increase-decrease, monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing shape. dynamic programming, optimal control, new products, advertising...|$|E

After formulating the new product introduction optimal control problem, we study and solve two special cases of it, namely the minimum time and the advertising cost problems. From the former we derive the existence of an optimal solution of the original problem, whereas we obtain its structure from the latter. Finally we present two alternative formulations of the original problem in the non-linear programming framework and suggest using them to solve the bounded time problem...|$|E
