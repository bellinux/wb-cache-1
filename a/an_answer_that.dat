5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians became {{interested}} in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry {{could be used to}} solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for decades or more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered an error in their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.|$|E
25|$|We can {{extrapolate}} {{from the}} above table that the step size needed to get <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> is correct to three decimal places is approximately 0.00001, meaning that we need 400,000 steps. This large number of steps entails a high computational cost. For this reason, people usually employ alternative, higher-order methods such as Runge–Kutta methods or linear multistep methods, especially if a high accuracy is desired.|$|E

25|$|Dozens {{of species}} of fish {{have been found in}} the middens. Some of the most common are pike, whitefish, cod and ling at Østenkaer, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and eel at Krabbesholm. The oldest site, Yderhede, {{featured}} remains of flatfish and sharks: porbeagle, topeshark, smoothhound and at Lystrup Enge spurdog. At Egsminde herring, cyprinids and European perch were found. The presence of deep-sea fish and sharks probably indicates the Ertebølle fishermen often ventured out on deep water.

500|$|According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context syadvada {{does not}} mean a {{doctrine}} of doubt or skepticism, rather it means [...] "multiplicity or multiple possibilities". Syat in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism.

500|$|In the United Kingdom, Time Out {{magazine}} wrote, [...] "Zodiac isn't {{a puzzle}} film in quite that way; instead its subject is the compulsion to solve puzzles, and its coup is the creeping recognition, quite {{contrary to the}} flow of crime cinema, of how fruitless that compulsion can be." [...] Peter Bradshaw in his review for The Guardian commended the film for its [...] "sheer cinematic virility," [...] and gave it four stars out of five. In his review for Empire magazine, Kim Newman gave the film {{four out of five}} stars and wrote, [...] "You'll need patience with the film's approach, which follows its main characters by poring over details, and be prepared to put up with a couple of rote family arguments and weary cop conversations, but this gripping character study becomes more agonisingly suspenseful as it gets closer to <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> can't be confirmed." [...] Graham Fuller in Sight & Sound magazine wrote, [...] "the tone is pleasingly flat and mundane, evoking the demoralising grind of police work in a pre-feminist, pre-technological era. As such, Zodiac is considerably more adult than both Seven, which salivates over the macabre cat-and-mouse game it plays with the audience, and the macho brinkmanship of Fight Club." [...] Not all British critics liked the film. David Thompson in The Guardian felt that in relation to the rest of Fincher's career, Zodiac was [...] "the worst yet, a terrible disappointment in which an ingenious and deserving all-American serial killer nearly gets lost in the meandering treatment of cops and journalists obsessed with the case." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the past, Singer has {{not held}} that {{objective}} moral values exist, {{on the basis}} that reason could favour both egoism and equal consideration of interests. Singer himself adopted utilitarianism {{on the basis that}} people's preferences can be universalised, leading to a situation where one takes the [...] "point of view of the universe" [...] and [...] "an impartial standpoint". But in the Second Edition of Practical Ethics, he concedes that the question of why we should act morally [...] "cannot be given <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> will provide everyone with overwhelming reasons for acting morally".|$|E
2500|$|In 1895, Motora kept {{a journal}} of a week-long stint {{practicing}} Zen meditation at Engaku-ji, a Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Zen meditation {{involves the use}} of a kōan, a prompt {{that can be used to}} assess a student's progress. Motora's kōan was [...] "What is the sound of clapping with only one hand?" [...] Motora required 16 attempts and a hint from the Zen master before he was able to provide <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> satisfied the Zen master. He later wrote that Zen should be understood through personal interpretation rather than through a Zen master, and this became an influential thought in early Japanese psychology.|$|E

2500|$|Fish {{argued in}} January 2008 on his New York Times-syndicated blog that the {{humanities}} are of no instrumental value, but have only intrinsic worth. Fish explains, [...] "To the question 'of what use are the humanities?', the only honest answer is none whatsoever. And it is <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> brings honor to its subject. Justification, after all, confers value on an activity from a perspective outside its performance. An activity that cannot be justified is {{an activity that}} refuses to regard itself as instrumental to some larger good. The humanities are their own good. There is nothing more to say, and anything that is said diminishes the object of its supposed praise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sigmund Freud: In the Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1916-1917) Freud wrote: [...] "There can be {{no doubt}} that the source [...] lie in the instincts; but it still has to be {{explained}} why the same fantasies with the same content are created on every occasion. I am prepared with <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> I know will seem daring to you. I believe that...primal fantasies, and no doubt a few others as well, are a phylogenetic endowment". His suggestion that primal fantasies are a residue of specific memories of prehistoric experiences have been construed as being aligned with the idea of archetypes. Laplanehe and Pontalis point out that all the so-called primal fantasies relate to the origins and that [...] "like collective myths they claim to provide a representation of and a 'solution' to whatever constitutes an enigma for the child".|$|E
2500|$|Family Feud {{returned}} in syndication on September 20, 1999, with comedian Louie Anderson as host. After Richard Karn {{took over the}} show, the format was changed to reintroduce returning champions, allowing them to appear {{for up to five}} days. However, even after Karn's takeover, Anderson-hosted episodes continued in reruns that aired on PAX Network. In John O'Hurley's later days, the show's Nielsen ratings were at 1.5 (putting it in danger of cancellation), but when comedian Steve Harvey took over, ratings increased by as much as 40%, and within two short years, the show was rated at 4.0, and had become the fifth most popular syndicated program. Fox News' Paulette Cohn argued that [...] Harvey's [...] "relatability," [...] or [...] "understanding of what the people at home want to know," [...] is what saved the show from cancellation; Harvey himself argued, [...] "If someone said <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> was so ridiculous, I knew that the people at home behind the camera had to be going, 'What did they just say?' … They gave this answer that doesn't have a shot in hell of being up there.

2500|$|In 1959 Dijkstra {{published}} in a 3-page article 'A note on two problems in connexion with graphs' the algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph between any two given nodes, now called Dijkstra's algorithm. Its impact over the next 40 years is summarised from the article of Mikkel Thorup, 'Undirected Single Source Shortest Paths with Positive Integer Weights in Linear Time' (1999): [...] "Since 1959, all theoretical developments in SSSP [...] for general directed and undirected graphs {{have been based on}} Dijkstra's algorithm." [...] Dijkstra's algorithm is used in SPF, Shortest Path First, which is used in the routing protocols OSPF and IS-IS. Various modifications to Dijkstra's algorithm have been proposed by many authors using heuristics to reduce the run time of shortest path search. One of the most used heuristic algorithms is the A* search algorithm (first described by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute in 1968), the main goal is to reduce the run time by reducing the search space. Dijkstra thought about the shortest path problem when working at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam in 1956 as a programmer to demonstrate capabilities of a new computer called ARMAC. His objective was to choose both a problem as well as <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> (<b>that</b> would be produced by computer) that non-computing people could understand. He designed the shortest path algorithm in about 20 minutes without aid of paper and pen and later implemented it for ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in the Netherlands (so that 6 bits would suffice to represent the city in the algorithm).|$|E
2500|$|Collusion was practiced {{among various}} Champagne houses {{in order to}} drive down the prices of grapes to as a low as they would go, with the ever-present threat that if the houses could not get their grapes for cheap enough they would {{continue}} to source grapes from outside the region. Champenois vineyard owners {{found themselves in a}} situation where they were being paid less for fewer grapes. Poverty was widespread. In January 1911, frustrations reached their boiling point as riots erupted in the towns of Damery and Hautvilliers. Champenois vine growers intercepted trucks with grapes from the Loire Valley and pushed them into the Marne river. They then descended upon the warehouses of producers known to produce faux Champagne, tossing more wine and barrels into the Marne. The French Government tried to answer the vine growers' concerns by passing legislation defining where Champagne wine was to come from. This early legislation dictated that the Marne department and a few villages from the Aisne department were the only areas approved to grow grapes for Champagne production. The glaring exclusion of the Aube region, where the historic capital of Champagne—Troyes—is located, promoted further discontent as the Aubois protested the decision. The Aube, located south of the Marne, was closer to the Burgundy region in terms of soil and location. The growers of the Marne viewed the region as [...] "foreign" [...] and not capable of producing true Champagne but the Aubois viewed themselves as Champenois and clung to their historical roots. The government eventually reversed themselves and included the Aube-much to the dismay of vine growers in the Marne who vigorously protested the decision. More riots erupted and the region was on the brink of civil war. As the government fumbled for <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> would appease both parties, World War I erupted and those issues had to be set aside as the entire country braced itself for war.|$|E
