40|$|Natural fibres {{reinforced}} cement-based {{materials have}} gain increasing application in residential housing components. One {{of the natural}} fibres considered is oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) fibres which offer advantages such as availability, renewability, low cost and the established technology to extract the fibres. This study investigates the properties of cement block incorporated with large amount of oil palm EFB fibres. The blocks were mixed with 10 to 30 % oil palm EFB fibres based on cement weight into the block. A total of 60 block samples of dimensions 100 mm x 200 mm x 400 mm were manufactured in this study using a high density operated <b>block</b> <b>making</b> <b>machine</b> with a cement-sand ratio of 1 : 6. Among the tests conducted was compressive strength, density, water absorption, drying shrinkage and prism tests. It was found that high EFB fibres content lead to lower strength, higher absorption and drying shrinkage. The results also indicate that high EFB fibres contents reduced the self-weight of the blocks and the resulting blocks can be classified as lightweight cement blocks suitable {{to be used as}} lightweight walling materials...|$|R
40|$|The ambient {{temperature}} of tropical countries like Nigeria {{is as high}} as 40 oC during the dry season. This ultimately gives rise to increase in demand for ice which is used to reduce the temperature of water, soft-drinks as well as other uses. This increase in demand for ice block makes the design and construction of a machine which can be used for the production of ice within {{a short period of time}} in order to save energy and time imperative and a worthwhile venture. This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of a model ice <b>block</b> <b>making</b> <b>machine</b> that can freeze water quickly. In order to achieve quick freezing, certain design consideration, such as the quantity of water to be frozen, the choice of cooling system and the methodology of attaining the desired result. The methodology adopted involves increasing the area of heat transfer and employing a vapour compression refrigerating system to generate the refrigerating effect. The design analysis of the evaporator, compressor and condenser are presented in details. This paper also reports on the material selection, fabrication methods and the experimental procedures and results. A temperature of- 140 C was achieved in the freezing chamber and a freezing duration of 70 minutes for 1 kg of ice block as test results...|$|R
40|$|In the Nuraicholai {{coal fired}} thermal power plant, 7500 MT of coal per day is burnt {{producing}} 750 MT and 75 MT of two main waste products fly ash and bottom ash respectively. Fly ash {{is used in}} cement manufacture, but bottom ash is presently regarded as a waste material. However, {{there is a possibility}} to convert bottom ash to a value added material. This thesis presents findings pertaining to the feasibility of using bottom ash as a replacement of sand in producing light weight cement blocks. Chemical analysis carried out using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy on Nuraicholai power plant bottom ash waste showed that the harmful elements present such as As, Pb, Cr, Cd, Cu, Ni and Se were within internationally specified toxicity limits for soil. It was found that bottom ash at oven dry condition had a loose bulk density of 600 kg/m 3, which is about 40 % that of river sand which has a nominal loose bulk density of about 1450 kg/m 3. Important physical and mechanical properties such as compressive strength, water absorption, density, accelerated erosion resistance and drying shrinkage & wetting expansion were tested for blocks produced by partly or fully replacing fine aggregate with bottom ash. Heat conductivity of blocks produced with bottom ash was found to be less than the good quality conventional cement blocks available in Sri Lanka. Comparatively, performance of the bottom ash blocks was very good and comparable with conventional cement blocks produced with river sand and quarry dust. Further, trials were carried out with river sand, crushed rock sand and coarse aggregate in order to find out optimum mix proportions and to investigate the feasibility of medium scale production of bottom ash blocks using a conventional type of <b>block</b> <b>making</b> <b>machine.</b> The optimum mixes which give strength, density and water absorption of desirable amount were found with Cement, Quarry dust, Bottom ash and 5 - 10 mm crushed rock aggregates...|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s, the {{signalling}} {{systems were}} rebuilt {{along the entire}} route. <b>Automatic</b> <b>block</b> signaling was established between Salzburg and Freilassing in 1963. In addition, push button relay interlockings were installed in Prien and Bad Endorf stations in 1963. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system was installed between the two stations on 28 June 1964 for 233,000 Deutsche Marks, making the signalbox at Rimstings station unnecessary. On 14 July 1969 and in the following days, the automated route setting interlocking in Traunstein, the <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Übersee and Traunstein and the <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Traunstein and Teisendorf opened. So for 2.092 million Deutsche Marks the personnel at Bergen (Oberbay) and Lauter (Oberbay) were able to be saved. On 11 December 1978, a centralised block was established between Teisendorf and Freilassing, which was controlled by an automated route setting interlocking of the SpDrS60 design. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system went into operation between Prien am Chiemsee and Übersee on 1 July 1980. Bergen (Oberbay) station was closed to passenger traffic at the same time. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system was taken into operation between Landl (Oberbay) {{and the start of}} the Rosenheim curve on 21 January 1982. The <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Landl and Bad Endorf was not opened until 26 November 1985. The entire upgrade between Rosenheim and Bad Endorf cost 4.7 million Deutsche Marks. An electronic interlocking was put into operation at Rosenheim between 19 and 23 November 2003. Electronic interlockings that are controlled from Munich have operated at Bad Endorf and Prien am Chiemsee stations since 2 March 2005.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{identify}} the characteristic {{features of the}} engineering control measures system of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> of numeric code, identifying their advantages and disadvantages, to analyze the possibility of their use in the problems of diagnosing status of the devices <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> and setting targets {{for the development of}} new diagnostic systems. Methodology. In order to achieve targets the objective theoretical and analytical method and the method of functional analysis have been used. Findings. The analysis of existing and future facilities of the remote control and diagnostics <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> devices had shown that the existing systems of diagnosis were not sufficiently informative, designed primarily to control the discrete parameters, which in turn did not allow them to construct a decision support subsystem. In developing of new systems of technical diagnostics it was proposed to use the principle of centralized distributed processing of diagnostic data, to include a subsystem support decision-making in to the diagnostics system, it will reduce the amount of work to maintain the devices blocking and reduce recovery time after the occurrence injury. Originality. As a result, the currently existing engineering controls facilities of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> can not provide a full assessment of the state distillation alarms and locks. Criteria for the development of new systems of technical diagnostics with increasing amounts of diagnostic information and its automatic analysis were proposed. Practical value.

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the banjo signal was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long pneumatic lines eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signals. However, these types did see long service in interlocking plants. Early semaphores also had limited range with manual wire operation and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signal operation was needed between manual block stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|R
