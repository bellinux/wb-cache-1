We are making a conjecture that avoidance of DLA in protocol, presented here, should increase its security, since an attempt to solve the initial system of MPF equations would appear to be no less complex than solving the system of MMQ equations. No algorithms are known to solve such a system of equations. Security parameters and their secure values are defined.

Other aspects are the backdoors discovered in deterministic random generators or recent advances in solving some instances of DLP. The use of alternative algebraic structures like non-commutative or non-associative partial groupoids, magmas, monoids, semigroups, quasigroups or groups, are valid choices for these new kinds of protocols. In this paper, we focus in an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>cipher</b> based on a generalized ElGamal non-arbitrated protocol using a non-commutative general linear group. The developed protocol forces a hard subgroup membership search problem into a non-commutative structure. The protocol involves at first a generalized Diffie-Hellman key interchange and further on {{the private and public}} parameters are recursively updated each time a new cipher session is launched. Security is based on a hard variation of the Generalized Symmetric Decomposition Problem (GSDP). Working with GF(251 ^ 8) a 64 -bits security is achieved, and if GF(251 ^ 16) is chosen, the security rises to 127 -bits. An appealing feature {{is that there is no}} need for big number libraries as all arithmetic if performed in Z_ 251 and therefore the new protocol is particularly useful for computational platforms with very limited capabilities like smartphones or smartcards.

Currently, {{the most widely used}} algorithms appear to be two-key triple DES and RC 4 for symmetric ciphers, RSA with a 1024 -bit key for an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>cipher</b> and a digital signature, and SHA- 1 for a hash function according to international standards and guidelines related to {{the financial}} transactions. However, according to academic papers and reports regarding the security evaluation for such algorithms, it is difficult to ensure enough security by using the algorithms for a long time period, such as 10 or 15 years, due to advances in cryptanalysis techniques, improvement of computing power, and so on. To enhance the transition to more secure ones, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States describes in various guidelines that NIST will no longer approve two-key triple DES, RSA with a 1024 -bit key, and SHA- 1 as the algorithms suitable for IT systems of the U.
