25|$|Critics {{pointed out}} that {{published}} terrestrial trophic cascades generally involved smaller subsets of the food web (often only a single plant species). This was quite different from aquatic trophic cascades, in which the biomass of producers as a whole were reduced when predators were removed. Additionally, most terrestrial trophic cascades did not demonstrate reduced plant biomass when predators were removed, but only increased plant damage from herbivores. It was unclear if such damage would actually result in reduced plant biomass or abundance. In 2002 a meta-analysis found trophic cascades to be generally weaker in terrestrial ecosystems, meaning that changes in predator biomass resulted in smaller changes in plant biomass. In contrast, {{a study published in}} 2009 demonstrated that multiple species of trees with highly varying <b>autecologies</b> are in fact heavily impacted by the loss of an apex predator. Another study, published in 2011, demonstrated that the loss of large terrestrial predators also significantly degrades the integrity of river and stream systems, impacting their morphology, hydrology, and associated biological communities.|$|R
40|$|The California vernal pool-endemic grasses Orcuttia tenuis and Tuctoria greenei, both {{listed under}} the U. S. Endangered Species Act, were {{recently}} found in Modoc County, California, {{a short distance}} south of the Oregon border. This prompted searches in suitable habitats in adjacent portions of the Klamath Basin in Oregon, in the Gerber Block Bureau of Land Management lands and adjacent portions of the Fremont- Winema National Forest. Neither species {{was found in the}} 2010 or 2011 surveys. The 2009 - 2010 winter through summer was very dry, possibly causing dormancy of these species in soil seed banks that year. The 2010 - 2011 winter through summer was much wetter, {{so much so that the}} pools desiccated very late, perhaps furthering dormancy. Alternately, the species may truly be lacking from the Gerber Block. Twenty-six species ranked for conservation by the Oregon Biodiversity Information Center were found in the 2010 surveys, and an additional 10 species were found that should be considered for listing as conservation priorities in Oregon. A number of vascular plants and lichens were found that may represent taxa new to science. In vernal pools, 149 taxa (all but 9 of them native) were recorded.

50|$|Population ecology or <b>autecology</b> is a {{sub-field}} {{of ecology}} {{that deals with}} the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the environment.

5000|$|The older term, <b>autecology</b> (from Greek: αὐτο, auto, [...] "self"; οίκος, oikos, [...] "household"; and λόγος, logos, [...] "knowledge"), {{refers to}} {{roughly the same}} field of study as {{population}} ecology. It derives from the division of ecology into autecology—the study of individual species {{in relation to the}} environment—and synecology—the study of groups of organisms in relation to the environment—or community ecology. Odum (1959, p. 8) considered that synecology should be divided into population ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology, defining <b>autecology</b> as essentially [...] "species ecology." [...] However, for some time biologists have recognized that the more significant level of organization of a species is a population, because at this level the species gene pool is most coherent. In fact, Odum regarded [...] "autecology" [...] as no longer a [...] "present tendency" [...] in ecology (i.e., an archaic term), although included [...] "species ecology"—studies emphasizing life history and behavior as adaptations to the environment of individual organisms or species—as one of four subdivisions of ecology.|$|E
40|$|The {{predominant}} hypothesis {{regarding the}} composition of microbial assemblages in indoor environments is that fungal assemblages are structured by outdoor air with a moderate contribution by surface growth, whereas indoor bacterial assemblages represent a mixture of bacteria entered from outdoor air, shed by building inhabitants, and grown on surfaces. To test the fungal aspect of this hypothesis, we sampled fungi from three surface types likely to support growth and therefore possible contributors of fungi to indoor air: drains in kitchens and bathrooms, sills beneath condensation-prone windows, and skin of human inhabitants. Sampling was done in replicated units of a university-housing complex without reported mold problems, and sequences were analyzed using both QIIME and the new UPARSE approach to OTU-binning, to the same result. Surfaces demonstrated a mycological profile {{similar to that of}} outdoor air from the same locality, and assemblages clustered by surface type. "Weedy" genera typical of indoor air, such as Cladosporium and Cryptococcus, were abundant on sills, as were a diverse set of fungi of likely outdoor origin. Drains supported more depauperate assemblages than the other surfaces and contained thermotolerant genera such as Exophiala, Candida, and Fusarium. Most surprising was the composition detected on residents' foreheads. In addition to harboring Malassezia, a known human commensal, skin also possessed a surprising richness of non-resident fungi, including plant pathogens such as ergot (Claviceps purperea). Overall, fungal richness across indoor surfaces was high, but based on known <b>autecologies,</b> most of these fungi were unlikely to be growing on surfaces. We conclude that while some endogenous fungal growth on typical household surfaces does occur, particularly on drains and skin, all residential surfaces appear - to varying degrees - to be passive collectors of airborne fungi of putative outdoor origin, a view of the origins of the indoor microbiome quite different from bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Urbanisation is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} largest threats to biodiversity although little is known about the effect of habitat fragmentation on native flora and fauna in urban areas in general, and in Sweden specifically. In this thesis, data have been collected using remote sensing analyses of 100 cities, bird surveys in 34 cities, and experiments have been used to answer specific questions regarding dispersal and reproduction in different urban habitats. The dual processes of infill development and expansion of cities threaten remaining unprotected urban woodlands. Results showed that between 1 and 40 % (average of 20 %) of the proportion of the city area were comprised of urban woodland. Urban and peri-urban (surrounding) woodlands covered an area larger than the total area of protected forests in Sweden and had higher amounts of dead wood than typical non-protected forests. In contrast to previous studies, this thesis showed that many bird species breeding in urban woodlands were strongly affected by the surrounding city or landscape composition. On a smaller spatial scale (200 m), adjacent habitats affected population density and nestling quality of great tits Parus major breeding within urban woodlands. Movement corridors were only used by butterfly habitat specialists, and grassland corridors of intermediate quality seemed to be most efficient to promote dispersal among habitat fragments. In this thesis, I show that Sweden have relatively high proportion urban woodlands; urbanisation does not necessarily lead to a homogenisation of the bird fauna; urban habitats need to be well described in detail to allow comparisons among studies; bird faunas of local urban woodlands differ among regions and are strongly affected by composition of habitats both at city and landscape levels; movement corridors may be an efficient conservation tool if specifically managed to fit the <b>autecologies</b> of the species of conservation concern.

40|$|Knowledge about species biology, distributions, and <b>autecologies</b> {{is based}} on {{accumulated}} information provided by identifying observers from diverse time periods and from sometimes somewhat isolated scientific cultures. Traditional taxonomic revisions bear witness of the inherent challenges of specimen identification and the efforts to obtain concordant species observations that actually refer to the same natural units. “Mislabelled” species {{is a growing concern}} in population management and food industries. There is also an emerging alertness in macro-ecology of bias in estimators of species occurrences and in biodiversity assessment and modelling due to misidentifications. Open access databases with DNA-barcodes are potentially powerful tools to discover conflicting identifications and may help in species recognition and in harmonizing the use of species taxonomies across research groups. Barcodes may also give taxonomists alerts about a need for integrative re-evaluation of taxa and their distributions. Such ideas are the background motivation for our DNA-barcoding of benthic animals from recent sampling on the West-African shelf conducted by the EAF-Nansen programme. We prepared 470 specimens of Decapoda and five Stomatopoda, in sum representing 133 identified species, for DNA-sequencing using the BOLD v 3 system. Sequences were obtained from 351 samples, including 107 (80 %) of the identified species. The BOLD-system assigned the sequences to 113 BINS (RATNASTINHAM & HEBERT, 2013) of which 64 BINS were taxonomically concordant and 33 were singletons. Amongst 16 taxonomically discordant BINs, one was due to a previous record with a junior synonym, four due to identical sequences of subspecies taxa or identification to genus only. Interestingly, some of the discordant BINs, such as our sequences of the crab Menippe nodifrons (Menippidae) contained conspecific matches with West-Atlantic sequences in BOLD whereas another matching sequence from GenBank had been identified as a Pilumnidae. The most striking conflicting identifications in BOLD were observed with respect to the genus Macropodia, showing a need for taxonomic resolution and revision.

40|$|During the recessional flow {{period of}} 2004, benthic diatoms were sampled from four {{catchments}} {{in the tropics}} of the Northern Territory of Australia. Each of the catchments showed evidence of acid mine drainage. Diatoms were {{used in conjunction with}} physical and chemical water parameters to provide a biomonitoring approach with the ultimate goal to assess the water quality of the mine impacted catchments. A total of 267 species of diatoms from 45 genera were recorded from 50 sites in the Northern Territory. One of the primary aims {{of this study was to}} assess diatom classification techniques, morphological and genetic, for the accurate identification of the morphologically variable taxon, Nitzschia palea. A second primary aim was to determine the degree to which diatom taxa and community structures can be effectively used as biological indicators and monitors of heavy metal pollution in tropical aquatic environments. To address the lack of diatom floristic studies from the Northern Territory, an iconograph of the most abundant taxa was created. Forty eight Nitzschia palea-like cells were cultured and then grouped by hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward’s method). The reliability of the groups was tested with discriminant analysis. The morphological groups were compared to the phylogenetic grouping of 20 of the cultures which were each genetically sequenced using the nuclear-encoded small subunit rDNA. For monitoring studies, multivariate statistical techniques were used to produce models to infer environmental variables from diatom distributions. The three datasets used varied in terms of the level of taxonomic identification and the inclusion of bioavailable or total metal concentrations. The program AquaRisk was employed to determine the bioavailable concentrations of the heavy metals. Each dataset was related to water quality parameters using canonical correspondence analysis. The Simpson’s index and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index were statistically related, together with species richness, to the variables pH and copper through bivariate regression analysis. To determine the usefulness of individual diatom taxa as indicators, species were selected based on their occurrence, weighted average optima and tolerance values, and species response curves. Additionally, teratogenic frustules were statistically correlated with environmental variables by bivariate and linear regression. Although the Nitzschia palea-like cultures displayed morphological variation, which could be used separate the cultures into five distinct groups, the cultures were not found to be genetically variable. However, one new species, Nitzschia sp. 39, was defined genetically and described morphologically. As with other analyses of mine impacts, canonical correspondence analysis identified pH and aluminium as the principal environmental factors structuring the diatom communities. The calibration set models generated to infer pH and heavy metals had high predicative capabilities. Overall, the species dataset, rather than the datasets utilising genus level identification or bioavailable metal fractions, provided the statistically strongest results. Monitoring using diversity indices was less successful for indicating pollution. Contrary to findings from other studies, species richness tended to be higher in polluted waters than control sites. Unlike other studies of acidic environments, the species Chamaepinnularia mediocris, Naviculadicta subtilissima, Nitzschia vasta and Pinnularia schoenfelderi were found to be the best indicators. Nitzschia vasta was the only teratogenic diatom within the dataset. However, as with other analyses, the relationship between teratogenic valves and mine impact was not significant. This study demonstrates the continued need for research in the tropics in order to better understand biological responses and enable study comparisons. Although at least one new xii species was identified, the genetic research indicated that taxonomic texts produced for northern hemisphere regions can be applied to tropical diatom taxa as long as the risk of taxonomic force fitting is avoided. Additionally, the benefit of diatoms as biological monitors varies depending on the method utilised. In these highly impacted systems, transfer functions produced the strongest results. In contrast, it is evident that the abundance and distribution of teratological forms of diatoms are poor indicators of impact. Further work culturing diatoms and combining this technique with ecotoxicological work will help verify <b>autecologies</b> of taxa and their responses to co-varying pollutants. This will strengthen use of diatom taxa as indicator species. Continued monitoring of these sites can add much to our ecological understanding of these highly impacted systems which, in turn, will lead to better management of the systems for both sustainable resource development and conservation.

Literature was reviewed to study the <b>autecology</b> and life cycle of A. fuscipes in order to reveal the ecological requirements of this species. By taking Agapetus fuscipes as an example, it is shown that the <b>autecology</b> and life cycle of an indicator species can give important clues for its presence in unimpacted and absence in impacted streams. A. fuscipes is very susceptible to organic pollution {{and to a lesser}} degree to discharge dynamics (dropping water level and discharge peaks). The species copes with dynamic discharge events by maintaining a high population density and recolonisation of disturbed habitats from refuges. However, the vulnerability of the species strongly depends on the life stage of the animals (e. g., the ability to migrate, the oxygen demand and the habitat requirements differ between instars). Although several adaptations to dynamic conditions, a high frequency of discharge peaks or a long period of drought can cause the population to decline. Once a population has totally disappeared from a stream it will take the species a long time to recolonise the stream because of its low dispersion capacity. To protect this species stream restoration should focus on water quality (avoid organic pollution and agricultural run off) and on stabilising the discharge by taking care of natural infiltration in the catchment area instead of fast removal of rain water by drainage systems...|$|E
