5|$|Medieval England was <b>a</b> <b>patriarchal</b> {{society and}} the lives of women were heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority. However, the position of women varied considerably according to various factors, including their social class; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived. Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men.|$|E
5|$|Culturally the Betsimisaraka can {{be divided}} into {{northern}} and southern sub-groups. Many elements of culture are common across both groups, including respect for ancestors, spirit possession, the ritual sacrifice of zebu, and <b>a</b> <b>patriarchal</b> social structure. The groups are distinguished by linguistic sub-dialects and various fady (taboos), as well as certain funeral practices and other customs. The Betsimisaraka practice famadihana (reburial) and sambatra (circumcision) and believe in sorcery and a wide range of supernatural forces. Many taboos and folktales revolve around lemurs and crocodiles, both of which are common throughout Betsimisaraka territory.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with <b>a</b> <b>patriarchal</b> system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in <b>a</b> <b>patriarchal</b> family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E

5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of <b>a</b> <b>patriarchal</b> {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous {{than those in the}} general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|The coin was {{probably}} struck at Canterbury {{in the late}} 6th century, most likely between 578 and 589. Although {{it could have been}} used as a coin, it was more likely made as a medallion to proclaim the wearer's conversion to Christianity. The coin is the oldest surviving example of Anglo-Saxon coinage. The design of the figured side has some affinities with Merovingian and Visigothic coins, but the side with the cross has few known predecessors in coinage, and is the first northern European depiction of <b>a</b> <b>patriarchal</b> cross in any medium.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in <b>a</b> <b>patriarchal</b> family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E

5|$|Women {{in early}} modern Scotland, between the Renaissance {{of the early}} sixteenth century and the {{beginnings}} of industrialisation in the mid-eighteenth century, were part of <b>a</b> <b>patriarchal</b> society, though the enforcement of this social order was not absolute in all aspects. Women retained their family surnames at marriage and did not join their husband's kin groups. In higher social ranks, marriages were often political in nature {{and the subject of}} complex negotiations in which women as matchmakers or mothers could play a major part. Women were {{a major part of the}} workforce, with many unmarried women acting as farm servants and married women playing a part in all the major agricultural tasks, particularly during harvest. Widows could be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading, but many at the bottom of society lived a marginal existence.|$|E
