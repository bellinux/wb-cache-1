A popular haptic device is the PHANTOM Omni, a six degree of freedom (6 DOF) positioning manipulator with 3 DOF force feedback. To increase the usability of the class of under <b>actuated</b> <b>devices</b> that include the common PHANTOM Omni, an impedance requiring full 6 DOF force feedback control law for under <b>actuated</b> <b>devices</b> based on a virtual mechanism (VM) was developed.

The control theory includes using a VM as a constraint for the RM. Weighted matrices and the pseudo inverse Jacobian control law place the VM as to minimize the error between the current RM position and somewhere on the path of the VM.
