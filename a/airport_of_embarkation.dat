25|$|Hampton Roads Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> (HRPOE or HRPE) was {{the third}} largest United States Army Transportation Corps port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> in terms <b>of</b> {{passengers}} and second in terms of cargo tonnage on the East Coast of the United States during World War II. Until June 1942 Hampton Roads was a sub-port of the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> {{continued}} operations {{under the}} Chief of Transportation with the Hampton Roads Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> becoming a sub-port effective 31 March 1954. On 28 September 1955 the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> was redesignated effective 1 October as the Atlantic Transportation Terminal Command, Brooklyn, headquartered in the Brooklyn Army Base {{with responsibility for}} operation of all Army terminal and related activities of the Atlantic coast from those in Canada south to Miami, Florida. By the same order the other Ports <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> and sub-ports were redesignated. The Brooklyn Army Base, a class III sub-installation of the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> was separated and designated the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Effective 1 April 1965 the remaining Army facility of the NYPOE, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, along with other such remnant facilities of the old ports <b>of</b> <b>embarkation,</b> were transferred from the Army Material Command to the Military Traffic Management and Terminal Service.|$|R
50|$|In World War II the NYPOE, {{now under}} the new Transportation Corps, was the largest of eight Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> commands, the second largest being the San Francisco Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> and the second largest on the East Coast being Hampton Roads Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b> Originally it had the army {{facilities}} in Charleston, South Carolina as a sub-port until it was elevated to the Charleston Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> as a separate command. The cargo sub-port at Philadelphia remained {{under the command of}} NYPOE throughout the war. By {{the end of the war}} 3,172,778 passengers, counting 475 embarked at the Philadelphia cargo port, and 37,799,955 measurement tons of cargo had passed through the New York port itself with 5,893,199 tons of cargo having passed through its cargo sub-port at Philadelphia—about 44% of all troops and 34% of all cargo passing through army ports <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> (NYPOE) was a United States Army command {{responsible}} for the movement of troops and supplies from the United States to overseas commands. The command had facilities in New York, New Jersey, roughly covering the extent of today's Port of New York and New Jersey, as well as ports in other cities as sub-ports under its direct command. During World War I, when it was originally known as the Hoboken Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> with headquarters in seized Hamburg America Line facilities in Hoboken, New Jersey, the Quartermaster Corps had responsibility. The sub-ports were at Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and the Canadian ports of Halifax, Montreal and St. Johns. The World War I port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> was disestablished, seized and requisitioned facilities returned or sold and operations consolidated at the new army terminal in Brooklyn. Between the wars reduced operations continued the core concepts of a port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and as the home port of Atlantic army ships. With war in Europe the army revived the formal New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> command with the New York port, the only Atlantic port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation,</b> taking a lead in developing concepts for operations.|$|R
