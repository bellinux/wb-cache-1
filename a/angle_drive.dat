2500|$|In 1956, {{a second}} {{prototype}} was constructed, {{this time with}} a Metro-Cammell body and, again equipped with a O.350 engine fitted across the frame. It had a centrifugal clutch, Pneumocyclic gearbox and <b>angle</b> <b>drive.</b> This vehicle was [...] in height, with a [...] wheelbase and overall length of [...] and had a seating capacity of 78. Leyland christened this prototype the Lowloader.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} the GM Diesel 6-71 (426 cubic inches, 220 {{horsepower}} @ 2000 r.p.m.). Mounted transversely {{at the rear}} with three rubber mounts, it connected via <b>angle</b> <b>drive</b> to the rear axle through a 4-speed transmission. During the testing time, Greyhound added a two-speed clutch which {{became part of the}} original PD-4501 in 1954. The diesel also drove the hydraulic fluid pump, the alternator and a cooling fan. The hydraulic system operated the steering gear, but unlike the 4501 to come, it also worked the brakes and the six [...] windshield wipers. The seven gallons of fluid were pumped at a rate of 11 gallons per minute and generated a maximum pressure of 1500 PSI, with 900 PSI the norm. The muffler was mounted behind the rear bumper and the radiator was on the left rear side.|$|E
50|$|The all {{cast-iron}} Hydramatic was {{the heaviest}} automatic transmission ever produced for automobiles. The heaviest {{of them all}} was the Truck Hydra-Matic version offered by GM Truck and Coach Division in its line of light- and medium-duty trucks and conventional buses, {{as well as with}} its transverse mounted gas L6 engined transit buses produced until 1963. That particular version weighed in at an incredible 655 pounds, when equipped with the <b>angle</b> <b>drive</b> for the transit bus application, while the ¾ ton and up pickup truck model (HM270) still tipped the scale at a solid 435 pounds. When coupled to GMC's heavy V6 powerplant of 1960-1962, the powertrain weight was not too much lighter than the weight of the entire body of a ¾ ton P-2500 model pickup truck. Even its successor, the Controlled Coupling Hydramatic was reviled by shop mechanics having to remove or reinstall such a unit, as they, too, were quite heavy when compared to other contemporary units. In the end, the true Hydramatic was rendered obsolete because of its cost, both in raw materials used as well as the machining needed. The successor, Turbo Hydramatic, was a much simpler, lighter and cheaper, if less efficient, transmission.|$|E

25|$|Turbine {{drilling}} is best {{used for}} drilling hard rocks at high bit RPM's with diamond impregnated bits, {{and can be}} used with an <b>angled</b> <b>drive</b> shaft for directional drilling and horizontal drilling. It competes though with moyno motors and increasingly with rotary steerable systems and is again out of favour.|$|R
5000|$|Impact {{wrenches}} {{are available}} in all sizes and in several styles, depending on the application. ¼" [...] drive wrenches are commonly available in both inline (the user holds the tool like a screwdriver, with the output on the end) and pistol grip (the user holds a handle which is {{at right angles to}} the output) forms, and less commonly in an <b>angle</b> <b>drive,</b> which is similar to an inline tool but with a set of bevel gears to rotate the output 90°. ⅜" [...] impacts are most commonly available in pistol grip form and a special inline form known as a [...] "butterfly" [...] wrench, which has a large, flat throttle paddle {{on the side of the}} tool which may be tilted to one side or the other to control the direction of rotation, rather than using a separate reversing control, and shaped to allow access into tight areas. Regular inline and angle ⅜" [...] drive impact wrenches are uncommon, but available. ½" [...] drive units are virtually only available in pistol grip form, with any inline type being virtually impossible to obtain, due to the increased torque transmitted back to the user and the greater weight of the tool requiring the larger handle. ¾" [...] drive impact wrenches are again essentially only available in pistol grip form. 1" [...] drive tools {{are available in}} both pistol grip and [...] "D handle" [...] inline, where the back of the tool has an enclosed handle for the user to hold. Both forms often also incorporate a side handle, allowing both hands to hold the tool at once. 1¼" [...] and larger wrenches are usually available in [...] "T handle" [...] form, with two large handles on either side of the tool body, allowing for maximum torque to be applied to the user, and giving the best control of the tool. Very large impact wrenches (up to several hundred thousand foot-pounds of torque) usually incorporate eyelets in their design, allowing them to be suspended from a crane, lift, or other device, since their weight is often more than a person can move. A recent design combines an impact wrench and an air ratchet, often called a [...] "reactionless air ratchet" [...] by the manufacturers, incorporating an impact assembly before the ratchet assembly. Such a design allows very high output torques with minimal effort on the operator, and prevents the common injury of slamming one's knuckles into some part of the equipment when the fastener tightens down and the torque suddenly increases. Specialty designs are available for certain applications, such as removing crankshaft pulleys without removing the radiator in a vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{generating}} {{principle of}} generating line of {{spiral bevel gears}} with spherical involute, a new method for building the model of spiral bevel gears with spherical involute is presented by utilizing the modules of part design, assembly design and kinematic simulation in CATIA. In the part design module of CATIA, the models of base cone, tangent surface, and generating line are built respectively. And the built models are assembled in the assembly environment; the simulation of pure rolling is accomplished in the environment of kinematics; and {{the model of the}} gear surface is built using the function of tracks. Then the solid model of the spiral bevel gear is built through the functions of transferring the model’s file format, multi-section sweep and solid fill. Finally, the analysis to the performance of the bevel gear transmission is conducted. In the environment of the assembly design, the solid model of the gearwheel and the pinion are inserted respectively, and then the assembly is accomplished by applying the constraints. And in the environment of kinematics, the meshing simulation of the bevel gear pair is accomplished by applying <b>angle</b> <b>drive.</b> The research indicates that this method can build the model of spiral bevel gears accurately and rapidly, and the model can illustrate the gearing correctly...|$|E

5000|$|United then {{travelled}} to face Benfica at the Estádio da Luz on 26 September. Despite being outplayed {{during the}} first half, while Nuno Gomes just off target, United - who were wearing their white change kit - took the lead through Louis Saha, who struck with a rising <b>angled</b> <b>drive</b> on the hour mark, giving United their first away win in the UEFA Champions League for almost three years. United took control after the goal, and forced Benfica keeper Quim into several fine saves in the dying stages.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, a 2-2 draw at the San Siro and a 2-0 win at the Allianz Arena {{confirmed}} Milan's {{status as}} United's semi-final opponents. Manchester United's semi-final first leg, played on 24 April, {{was at home}} to Milan, and the game ended 3-2 to United. Cristiano Ronaldo gave United the lead with a fifth-minute header, but Kaká drew Milan level with an <b>angled</b> <b>drive</b> after 21 minutes, and gave Milan the lead from close range before the break. Wayne Rooney then turned in Paul Schole's cool pass on the hour to equalise, and won the game for United in the last minute, when he lashed a glorious 20-yard finish past Dida.|$|R

50|$|Spurs {{returned}} to Premier League action away to Bolton Wanderers, without Aaron Lennon & Rafael van der Vaart through injury. Spurs started slowly, and fell behind after Kevin Davies lashed home the opener for Bolton. Spurs didn't improve {{in the second}} half, and were then 2-0 down after Grétar Steinsson screwed in an <b>angled</b> <b>drive</b> ten minutes after half-time. Spurs then failed to respond and conceded a penalty after Benoît Assou-Ekotto bundled over Lee Chung-yong in the box - Kevin Davies expertly dispatched the spot-kick from 12 yards for Bolton's third.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim of this project {{was to investigate the}} mechanics of the sprint start through the use of computer simulation. Experimental data was collected on one male athlete in accordance with a procedure agreed by Loughborough University Ethical Advisory Committee. The data provided subject specific data {{for the creation of a}} four and fourteen segment, <b>angle</b> and torque <b>driven</b> models of the sprint start. The models simulated the start from the moment of onset of force production until takeoff from the starting block. The four segment model comprised a head and trunk, thigh, shank and foot whilst the fourteen segment model also included a lower spine and pelvis, upper arms, forearms and hands, as well as the other leg including two segment feet. Subject specific torque data was combined with EMG data to provide input to the torque models Results from the four segment <b>angle</b> <b>driven</b> model demonstrated that the participant will benefit from using smaller joint angles than usual in the set position as this resulted in increased velocity on takeoff with minimal increase in movement time. The model also showed large joint torques during such starts and so suggested that this is likely to limit start performance. The four segment torque driven model also revealed that optimal joint angles exist for the hip and knee but such a result was not clear for the ankle. For this model the optimum angle at the hip was 73 (the smallest tested) and 108 at the knee which was the athlete’s usual angle. Increasing the athlete’s strength parameters resulted in a small increase in horizontal velocity on takeoff for some simulations and all simulations had enhanced acceleration. Increasing initial muscle activations didn’t increase horizontal takeoff velocity but did also increase horizontal acceleration. The fourteen segment <b>angle</b> <b>driven</b> model was used to optimise spring parameters for input into a torque driven model. The fourteen segment torque driven model simulated movements and forces realistically but an adequate match was not found to the sprint start performance of the participant due to long simulation times and lack of computing power...|$|R

40|$|A spiking neurons network encodes {{information}} in the timing of individual spike times. A novel supervised learning rule for SpikeProp is derived to overcome the discontinuities introduced by the spiking thresholding.

50|$|For {{the opening}} game, on 15 September, Milan {{played host to}} Auxerre at the San Siro. Despite {{struggling}} in the first half, with the visitors also hitting the crossbar once, the Rossoneri {{managed to get a}} 2-0 win, thanks to two goals by Zlatan Ibrahimović in the 66th and 69th minutes. Two weeks later, Milan traveled to the Amsterdam Arena to face Ajax. The Dutch went ahead in the 23rd minute; Luis Suárez flicked the ball through Alessandro Nesta's legs and passed it to Mounir El Hamdaoui, who stopped the ball inside the goal area, turned around and shot into the net. Shortly after, Robinho missed a good chance for Milan, as he fired wide one-on-one against goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. The Rossoneri, however, managed to equalise eight minutes before half time through Ibrahimović, who chested a one-time pass by Clarence Seedorf and scored.

50|$|The {{tail rotor}} drive system {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an <b>angled</b> <b>drive</b> for the tail rotor and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the tail rotor, measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the {{tail rotor drive}} shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The tail rotor pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the tail rotor in forward flight. The tail rotor pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the tail rotor or the tail rotor flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to the tail rotor.|$|R
