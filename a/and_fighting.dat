5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training <b>and</b> <b>fighting</b> capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E

Specifically we investigate normal, pre, post <b>and</b> actual <b>fighting</b> sequences <b>and</b> classify them. A hierarchical AdaBoost classifier is described and results using this approach are presented. We show {{it is possible to}} classify pre-fighting situations using such an approach and demonstrate how it can be used in the general case of continuous sequences. ...|$|R

Amstrad Action rated this version at 54% calling it challenging, but lacking in action. They described environmental detail <b>and</b> <b>fighting</b> as the high points, but criticized sound as poor and graphics as slow.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Zappas {{joined the}} Greek War of Independence (1821–1832), {{achieving}} {{the rank of}} Major <b>and</b> <b>fighting</b> in several significant battles.

5|$|In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed}} by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, <b>and</b> <b>fighting</b> {{between the two sides}} was paused. After a series of {{unsuccessful}} ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions and the JNA retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. Serbia continued to support the RSK after the JNA pullout.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young <b>and</b> <b>fighting</b> males. Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{generally}} have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates. This {{may result in}} extra wear and breakage to the anterior (front) teeth due to heavy use in grooming, feeding, <b>and</b> <b>fighting.</b> Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.|$|E

5|$|Madre de Deus {{attracted}} {{all manner}} of traders, dealers, cutpurses and thieves from miles around, from as far as London and beyond. At seeing this huge vessel, pandemonium broke out amongst the townspeople; they visited the floating castle and sought out drunken sailors in taverns and pubs, buying, stealing, pinching <b>and</b> <b>fighting</b> for the takings. Local fishermen as well ventured aboard, further depleting the cargo.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a raiding party {{attacked}} Williams Station, a Pony Express station {{located on}} the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war.

Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.|$|E
5|$|On 24 December 1962, UN {{troops and}} Katangese gendarmes clashed near Élisabethville <b>and</b> <b>fighting</b> broke out. After {{attempts}} {{to reach a}} ceasefire failed, UN troops launched Operation Grandslam and occupied Élisabethville, prompting Tshombe to leave the country. A ceasefire was agreed soon thereafter. Indian UN troops, exceeding their orders, then occupied Jadotville, preventing Katangese loyalists from regrouping. Gradually, the UN overran {{the rest of the}} Katanga and, on 21 January 1963, Tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of Kolwezi, effectively ending the Katangese secession.|$|E

[...] Moore's reference to [...] "reds" [...] and [...] "yellows" [...] was criticized as racially insensitive. Moore's campaign responded by stating that Moore's statement was a paraphrase of the children's Sunday School song [...] "Jesus Loves the Little Children" [...] and was an appeal for racial healing.|$|R
