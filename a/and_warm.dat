5|$|The windfield of an extratropical cyclone constricts with {{distance}} {{in relation to}} surface level pressure, with the lowest pressure being found near the center, and the highest winds typically just on the cold/poleward side of warm fronts, occlusions, and cold fronts, where the pressure gradient force is highest. The area poleward and west of the cold <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> fronts connected to extratropical cyclones {{is known as the}} cold sector, while the area equatorward and east of its associated cold <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> fronts is known as the warm sector.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} ultrastructural {{appearance}} of oocytes after vitrification <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> with two different devices. Design: Oocytes were examined by ultrastructural analysis after vitrification <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> {{with use of}} closed (CryoTip; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) or open (Cryotop; Kitazato BioPharma Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan) devices. Setting: Pordenone Hospital IVF Unit and Medical Morphological Research Department, University of Udine. Patient(s) : Surplus oocytes from 10 patients (aged 31 - 39 years) undergoing assisted reproductive technologies at the Pathophysiology Unit of Human Reproduction and Sperm Bank between 2006 and 2008. Intervention(s) : Oocytes with normal invertoscopic appearance underwent vitrification <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> with closed (CryoTip) or open (Cryotop) devices and were processed for transmission electron microscopy. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Cryodamage extent and cell alterations in oocytes after open or closed vitrification <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> procedures <b>and</b> their rehydration rate. Result(s) : A higher rate of complete oocyte rehydration and less-severe ultrastructural alterations were observed after vitrification <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> with the open Cryotop device. Conclusion(s) : These preliminary data suggest that oocyte ultrastructure is better preserved with an open rather than closed vitrification <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> protocol...|$|R
40|$|During {{cryopreservation}} {{of human}} embryos, ice crystal {{formation in the}} embryos or in surrounding media may cause cryodamage to them and can be lethal. A strategy to avoid this is the vitrification procedure when the embryo and the surrounding medium undergo the transition to glassy state rather than a crystalline one during cooling. Similarly, recrystallization in the embryo or the medium must be avoided during the warming process. The necessary conditions for this are rapid cooling <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> rates. We assess the cooling <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> rates in the Rapid-i™ device for vitrification and cryostorage of human embryos from Vitrolife Sweden AB with help of numerical simulations. We demonstrate that the fast cooling <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> rates necessary for safe vitrification <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> are achieved in the device. We also determine safe margins for the warming procedure...|$|R
40|$|Urban canyon, urban park, and {{suburban}} surface air temperature data for hot-wet, hot-dry, cool-dry, and warm-wet periods in Nairobi city were analyzed to detect {{differences in the}} cooling <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> rates. Measurement of temperature for thirty continuous days was done {{at each of the}} three sites for each of the above periods. The cooling <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> rates were computed on an hourly basis beginning at 6. 00 P. M., the approximate time of sunset. The results of the study showed that the largest cooling <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> rates were generally experienced during the hot-dry period while the lowest during the cool-dry period. Cooling <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> rates were also found to be the highest at the suburban site and the lowest at the urban canyon site. The differences in the conditions of the built environment at the three sites could explain the cause of the differential cooling <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> rates. The study recommends proper planning of the built environment to ameliorate the problem of excessive nocturnal heat loads within the built environment...|$|R

When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure.

Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.|$|E
5|$|The system {{formed on}} a cold front that tracked across the Midwest and {{stretched}} from the northern Great Lakes to Tennessee. The front was enhanced by a strong jet stream <b>and</b> <b>warm,</b> humid air ahead of it, allowing thunderstorms to develop. A severe thunderstorm watch was issued for the region just west of Evansville as the main threat appeared to be straight-line winds.|$|E
5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July.

Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> fronts.|$|E

5|$|In the 1964 renumbering, the {{legislative}} designation {{was changed to}} Route 680. SR 17 was officially moved to former Route 5 between San Jose <b>and</b> <b>Warm</b> Springs, which {{had not had a}} signed designation since the Nimitz Freeway (then I-680) was constructed, but this was instead marked as part of SR 238 (which replaced SR 9 north of Mission San Jose), and SR 17 remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway. This was very short-lived, as the Bureau of Public Roads approved a shift in the south end of I-680 in October 1964. The legislature changed the routes in 1965, swapping Routes 17 and 680 south of Warm Springs, and creating a new SR 262 on the short roadway at Warm Springs where they had overlapped to switch sides. However, until I-680 was completed in the early-to-mid 1970s, it remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway, and the old road between San Jose <b>and</b> <b>Warm</b> Springs continued to be marked as SR 238. One more change was made to the routing of I-680: in July 1973, the remainder of SR 21, from Benicia to Fairfield, was added to the Interstate Highway System. This became the new alignment of I-680, and the old route to Vallejo became I-780. The corresponding changes were made by the state legislature in 1976.|$|E
40|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{elevated}} CO 2 (eCO 2) and the corresponding shifts in temperature and precipitation will interact to impact ecosystems over time. During a 7 -year experiment in a semi-arid grassland, the response of plant biomass to eCO 2 <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> was largely regulated by interannual precipitation, while the response of plant community composition was more sensitive to experiment duration. The combined effects of eCO 2 <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> on aboveground plant biomass were less positive in ‘wet’ growing seasons, but total plant biomass was consistently stimulated by ~ 25 % due to unique, supra-additive responses of roots. Independent of precipitation, the combined effects of eCO 2 <b>and</b> <b>warming</b> on C 3 graminoids became increasingly positive and supraadditive over time, reversing an initial shift toward C 4 grasses. Soil resources also responded dynamically and non-additively to eCO 2 <b>and</b> <b>warming,</b> shaping the plant responses. Our results suggest grasslands are poised for drastic changes in function and highlight the need for long-term, factorial experiments...|$|R
