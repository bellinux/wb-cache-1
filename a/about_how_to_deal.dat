5|$|Discussions {{took place}} in the Tower of London <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the revolt. The King had only a few troops at hand, {{in the form of the}} castle's garrison, his {{immediate}} bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Microencapsulated Phase change {{material}} can absorb and release {{large amounts of}} latent heat over a defined temperature range as its physical state changes. The microencapsulated PCM has high energy density and isothermal behavior during charging and discharging and can avoid the contradiction of the energy supply and demand unbalance in time and space. Meanwhile, the shell can separate the phase change material from the outside environment {{in order to protect}} the core material. But the super-cooling problem is a main barrier for microencapsulated PCM application. So this paper talks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> with super-cooling based on related literatures and gives an overview about the methodology in this area...|$|R

500|$|President Washington {{was confronted}} with what {{appeared}} to be an armed insurrection in western Pennsylvania, and he proceeded cautiously while determined to maintain governmental authority. He did not want to alienate public opinion, so he asked his cabinet for written opinions <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State Edmund Randolph who urged reconciliation. Washington did both: he sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. Washington privately doubted that the commissioners could accomplish anything, and believed that a military expedition would be needed to suppress further violence. For this reason, historians have sometimes charged that the peace commission was sent only for the sake of appearances, and that the use of force was never in doubt. Historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick argued that the military expedition was [...] "itself a part of the reconciliation process", since a show of overwhelming force would make further violence less likely.|$|E

These sculptors all want to incorporate their own ideas in the design and ask anywhere from $400.00 to $1,000.00 for their work, telling you what trouble it is to get the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and many other things which do not exist." [...] Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. [...] He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer—the letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said [...] "Loans and Mortgages" [...] under his name. He also warned Rovelstad, [...] "It would not be good for either of us if the word got out you had disposed of the entire issue to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Megan {{finds out}} that the shooter was in fact outside the room. They find Sean Wilcox's (Tobias Segal) skin on the bullet, a {{recently}} released criminal. Sean denies killing Elena, but states {{that he was one}} of Elena's patients, and that she had rented the motel room for him, to give him a place to stay. After falling asleep in the room, he awoke after hearing a shot. After seeing Elena dead on the floor, and himself injured, he ran after thinking no one would believe his account of what happened. After Bud and Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) meet with Sean's [...] "friend" [...] Vincent Stone (Zach McGowan), he admits that he was warned off by Elena after phoning Sean six times in one day, so Samantha and Bud start to develop a theory about how Vincent killed Elena. After persuasion by Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop), Sean helps the police, which allows them to get an arrest warrant for Vincent, however Megan finds rice flour on the bullet, which concludes that Vincent did not kill Elena. The rice flour leads them back to Holly, as she has a baby, and rice flour is commonly used for babies. They arrest Holly, who reveals that Elena visited her and discovers Holly was back on drugs, and was going to take Holly’s baby. Holly followed Elena, and shot her to prevent this from happening. After the confession, social services arrive, and take Holly's baby away. Back at the office, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) plays pranks towards Megan and Peter tells Megan that Bud is experiencing marriage problems, so Megan tells him <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the marriage problems, as Megan is a divorcée.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the difficulties inherent in providing {{mental health treatment}} for men who commit acts of violence against their intimate partners. The effectiveness of available treatment programs for men who batter, both in the international literature and in Spain, is analyzed. In all studies the dropout rates {{in the treatment of}} men involved in intimate partner violence are very high. Different studies have pointed to multiple psychological and social causes to explain the poor adherence to treatment in men who batter. The main predictors of poor adherence to therapy are described. Therefore, motivational enhancement strategies are being developed to strengthen subjects' commitment to change by helping them to identify their goals for recovery and to determine ways to reach these goals. Finally, some suggestions are discussed <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>deal</b> with these issues. It is necessary to implement strategies to improve motivation for treatment. Implications of this study for clinical practice, policy decisions, and future research in this field are commented upon...|$|R

40|$|A Cochrane review from 1998 {{concluded}} that single-session intervention {{does not prevent}} the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder. This led to a debate about what is the best, if any, psychological treatment after traumas. In consequence, some clinicians have become doubtful <b>about</b> as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with traumatized patients. We present three examples in order to illustrate situations in which psychological intervention is useful. The conclusions in the Cochrane review are well documented. However, insufficient correspondence between the traumas and the intervention offered gave us cause to question the clinical importance of existing studies. Future studies of psychological intervention after traumas should use an individualized design in which the intervention is {{in proportion to the}} trauma. Based on knowledge not given by randomized controlled studies, we recommend clinicians to offer psychological help to those exposed to traumatic incidents. Most people need adequate information after traumas. For those who develop health problems, intervention until recovery is recommended.
