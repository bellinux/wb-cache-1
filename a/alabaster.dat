5|$|The serekh for Peribsen {{was found}} pressed in earthen jar seals made of clay and mud and in {{inscriptions}} on <b>alabaster,</b> sandstone, porphyry and black schist vessels. These seals and vessels were excavated from Peribsen's tomb and at an excavation site in Elephantine. One clay seal with Peribsen's name was found inside the mastaba tomb K1 at Beit Khallaf.|$|E
5|$|In {{the valley}} temple of Menkaure, Nyuserre {{extended}} the eastern annex, where he added {{two sets of}} <b>alabaster</b> columns, rebuilt the main entrance and refurbished the limestone causeway leading from the valley temple to the high temple. There, Mark Lehner suggested that Nyuserre expanded the inner part of the high temple, notably adding to it a square antechamber with a single central pillar.|$|E

At the very end, as she and her brother escape Block's factory, she kills herself.|$|R
5|$|One {{of these}} two queens might have been Reptynub, the only known consort of Nyuserre. Her {{existence}} and relation to Nyuserre are attested by a fragmentary <b>alabaster</b> statuette of her discovered in the valley temple of Nyuserre's pyramid complex. Pieces of relief from the tomb of vizier Ptahshepses give the titles of a queen and while her name is lost, these titles {{are the same as}} those that Reptynub bore, leading Egyptologists to propose that these refer to her.|$|E
5|$|The church {{features}} architecture by Edward Doran Webb {{and stained}} glass by Charles Eamer Kempe. The Forster Chapel, a lady chapel {{added to the}} south face in the 13th century, contains the <b>alabaster</b> effigial monument of Sir George Forster and his wife Elizabeth which was built in 1530. Evidence suggests that the chapel may originally have been a chantry dedicated to St Nicholas. The roundel windows in the north wall date from the 13th century and are the oldest glass in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High Victorian style. There is much elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. The marble apse has <b>alabaster</b> carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall panelling features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. The ornate choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. The stained glass and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and the painting and stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E

5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent <b>alabaster</b> is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|In 1574, Queen Elizabeth I {{promoted}} {{the restoration of}} the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608–1616, paid £1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm. He is buried in an <b>alabaster</b> tomb in the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, <b>alabaster,</b> and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E

5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English <b>alabaster</b> effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interior}} of the pyramid a descending passage led, behind three granite portcullises, to an antechamber, three magazine rooms and the burial chamber. In it, pieces of <b>alabaster</b> and a faience bead on a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large sarcophagus of dark grey basalt. The sarcophagus was sunk into the floor of the burial chamber together with a niche for the canopic chest of the king to its north-east. An almost complete mummy was discovered in the remnants of the sarcophagus. An examination by Ahmed Batrawi of these skeletal remains, excavated in the mid-1940s under the direction of Abdel Salam Hussein, suggests that Djedkare {{died at the age of}} 50 to 60 years old.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{eccentric}} member of staff is Alan Statham (Mark Heap), an overbearing, stuttering and pedantic consultant radiologist, whose everyday actions regularly border on insanity. He is desperately and hopelessly {{in love with}} Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood), the 48-year-old head of human resources with an increasingly sardonic attitude. Their relationship is an open secret, with student doctor Boyce (Oliver Chris), often {{using it as a}} weapon against them, bullying Alan constantly. Joanna's human resources staff also use it against her, in particular Kim <b>Alabaster</b> (Sally Bretton), who has a bad attitude towards most of the people she meets, and Naughty Rachel (Katie Lyons), who earned her nickname due to her love of sex. The other HR staff include Harriet Schulenburg (Olivia Colman), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage, and Karen Ball (Lucinda Raikes), who divides her time between doing much of the office's work, trying to attract Martin's affections, and being bullied by Kim and Rachel.|$|E

50|$|In 1860, Frilli {{established}} {{his first and}} exclusive Atelier in via dei Fossi, Florence, where he worked with a few assistants on medium-size refined painted <b>alabasters</b> and big white Carrara marble statues for private villas and monumental cemeteries. His works decorate famous cemeteries such as Porte Sante and Allori in Florence. A marble portrait of Frilli was carved in his Atelier after his death, and it was placed on his family tomb in Cimitero degli Allori.|$|R
5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for shame!) and {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that is, they do not preserve the order, which they have received in the bosom of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should spit out their doctrine like filth. A cleric ought to be the keeper of his own soul, just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he ought to subject his own soul to service, by filling the <b>alabaster</b> box with precious oil, that is, he ought to be inwardly subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679, {{probably}} by local man Thomas Sabin, {{has been compared}} favourably {{with the work of}} Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons, and the metal screen also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of CharlesII high on the west wall of the nave. The <b>alabaster</b> pulpit and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base. The pulpit is similarly supported to match the font. A second, smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, <b>alabaster,</b> and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked {{deposits of}} emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.|$|E
50|$|Before {{completion}} of the mosque, the <b>alabastered</b> panels from the upper walls were taken away and used for the palaces of Abbas I. The stripped walls were clad with wood painted to look like marble. In 1899 the mosque showed signs of cracking and some inadequate repairs were undertaken. But {{the condition of the}} mosque became so dangerous that a complete scheme of restoration was ordered by King Fuad in 1931 and was finally completed under King Farouk in 1939.|$|R
50|$|This manor {{was held}} in demesne by William Portitor, the king's door-keeper, {{at the time of}} the taking the Domesday Survey. It was held as the king's gaol for the county of Devon.The manor of Bicton was granted by King Henry I to John Janitor. In 1229, Ralph Balistarius, or Le Balister (the cross-bow-bearer), {{occupied}} the manor. His descendants, the <b>Alabasters,</b> a corruption of Le Balister, held the manor for five generations. It then was passed to the Sacheville, or Sackville, and Copleston families through female heirs.|$|R
50|$|The Yuko Nii Foundation <b>alabasters</b> of Adam and Eve {{recently}} came to light; these 12th-century {{versions of}} the Autun Cathedral Adam and Eve lintels {{may be the only}} surviving replica of this Giselbertus Adam masterpiece, which makes it significant. No other drawings or other copies of the Giselbertus Adamhave been seen in our time in any library or museum. “Eve has a seductive quality that no other 12th-century artist has equaled. If the other block (Adam) had survived, we would most certainly have had in it the completion of a great masterpiece”.|$|R
5|$|The Hastings Chapel {{contains}} {{a number of}} family monuments, including a large <b>alabaster</b> tomb for Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, who died in 1561, and his countess, Catherine. The monument was carved by Joseph Pickford to a design by William Kent. A memorial to Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, who died in 1746, is on the east wall and is by Michael Rysbrack. His widow, Selina, founded a training college for evangelical ministers, and a sculpture of her in mourning, also by Rysbrack, is placed by her husband's memorial. The countess herself is remembered through a large brass plaque in the chancel floor. The larger of two vaults containing the coffins of the Hastings family lies beneath the chancel, and the smaller and older one is under their chapel.|$|E
5|$|The only secure {{depiction}} of the king dating to the Old Kingdom that has survived to this day is a rough, possibly unfinished, <b>alabaster</b> statuette showing Menkauhor enthroned and wearing the tight-fitting ceremonial robe of the Heb-sed. The statue was discovered in a cachette built during the late New Kingdom beneath {{the floor of a}} room {{to the west of the}} sacred lake at the temple of Ptah in Memphis. The Egyptologist Jocelyn Berlandini proposed that another statuette, usually attributed to Teti, belongs instead to Menkauhor Kaiu. Berlandini bases her hypothesis on stylistic grounds, noting the resemblance with Menkauhor's seated statue, as well as the location of the second statue, which was uncovered east of Teti's pyramid, in close proximity to Menkauhor's pyramid.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the {{entrance}} lies the dining room, which was formerly the Jacobean great hall. The room least damaged by the fire, it was restored by Barry to its 17th century appearance, with facsimiles of the original ceiling and carved wooden screen. It contains an overmantel featuring a relief of Plenty, considered to be original, and a large stone chimneypiece, which {{is believed to be the}} only surviving work by Blore on the interior. The oak parlour, in the south west, contains a large wooden Jacobean overmantel, featuring Green Men carving. The Jacobean carving here and in the dining room is noticeably cruder than the Victorian work. The carved parlour is another reproduction by Barry of the original. Panelled in oak, it has a plaster frieze of the Elements, Graces and Virtues. The <b>alabaster</b> chimneypiece depicts the winged figure of Time rewarding Industry and punishing Sloth, symbolised by two boys, which is surmounted by a carved portrait of Sir Randolph Crewe.|$|E
5000|$|Barque of {{phosphor}} On the palmy beach, Move outward into heaven, Into the <b>alabasters</b> And night blues. Foam and cloud are one. Sultry moon-monsters Are dissolving.

In a letter written in 1939, Stevens {{says that he has}} always likedthis poem, not because of its sense, [...] "because it does not have a greatdeal of sense", but because of [...] "the feeling of the words and thereaction and images that the words create".|$|R
5000|$|There were earlier images, {{common in}} the great French Gothic cathedrals of the 13th century, {{illustrating}} Abraham himself with small souls represented as children in his cloak, or held in a napkin {{in the same way}} as in the <b>alabasters.</b> [...] By [...] "about the early fourteenth century" [...] such images ceased to be [...] "theologically acceptable", though it seems this news had not reached Cornwall by the early 16th century, when a stained glass Abraham with a napkin of souls was installed in the parish church at St Neot, Cornwall (picture below).|$|R
50|$|The {{subjects}} of the sculptors were the usual content of altarpieces, most often scenes from the Life of Christ or Life of the Virgin. There is a subject apparently unique to English <b>alabasters,</b> the Bosom of Abraham Trinity, {{a variant of the}} Throne of Mercy which is more often found, and with the Madonna and Child, is often a larger free-standing statue - such as the Westminster example. Other subjects include saint's lives, including Thomas Becket and, exceptionally, the V&A has a fine detached head of John the Baptist, the subject of a popular devotional cult from {{the second half of the}} 15th century right up to the Reformation, which involved fasting on Wednesdays to obtain specific graces.|$|R
