She used the opportunity to discuss the plight of women in Afghanistan leading up to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, saying, [...] "The brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists." [...] Her husband was originally to give the address but he felt that she should do it; she later recalled, [...] "At that moment, it was not that I found my voice. Instead, it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> voice found me." [...] Her words summarized one of the goals and moral rationales of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and it became one of the more famous speeches of his administration. In May 2002, she made a speech to the people of Afghanistan through Radio Liberty. [...] In March 2005, she made the first of three trips to that country as First Lady.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} paint myself into what absorbed me... Natural figures would {{have broken the}} spell of it, so I made my figures half unreal. Some critics have said that I turned my figures into puppets, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> aim were to hint at the hard {{economic}} necessities that drove them. To say the truth, I was not thinking very much about the people. I did not care {{for them in the}} way a social reformer does. They are part of a private beauty that haunted me. I loved them and the houses in the same way: as part of a vision.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{should call}} myself an Afrikaner, {{were it not}} for the {{tendency}} to confine that term to those whose ancestors landed here before the British occupation, and to such newer arrivals as are animated by the 'South African spirit'. I have neither Voortrekker nor Huguenot blood in my veins, and 'the South African spirit', as understood by those who extol it, implies a view on the native question which I cannot share. But I am proud to be a South African, and I claim to stand on the same national footing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> forebears had landed with Van Riebeeck or followed Piet Retief over the Drakensberg." ...|$|E
60|$|Memory was {{the word}} she used, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>my</b> youth were fled. I suppose I really am quite elderly.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Barkis {{turned his}} eyes upon me, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> for <b>my</b> assent to this {{result of his}} {{reflections}} in bed; and I gave it.|$|R
6000|$|I {{understood}} {{quite well}} what she meant. We strolled on slowly. I refrained {{from looking at}} her. And it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> answering <b>my</b> own thoughts that I murmured-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Darwin {{had avoided}} taking on {{official}} posts which would take valuable time, turning down William Whewell's request that he become Secretary of the Geological Society with excuses including [...] "anything which flurries me completely knocks me up afterwards and brings {{on a bad}} palpitation of the heart", but in January 1838 he accepted the post. On 7 March he read to the Society his longest paper yet, which explained the earthquake he had witnessed at Concepción, Chile, in terms of gradual crustal movements, {{to the delight of}} Lyell. Despite hours of practice, as he later recalled; [...] "I was so nervous at first, I somehow could see nothing all around me, & felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> body was gone, & only my head left".|$|E
2500|$|Tripoli was {{occupied}} unopposed on 13 October by the 7th (Meerut) Division led once {{again by the}} XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery following Bulfin's orders for {{the continuation of the}} coastal advance northwards. The leading column was followed by the 19th Infantry Brigade Group commanded by Brigadier General W. S. Leslie which arrived on 18 October. The remainder of the 7th (Meerut) Division arrived not long after. Rothon arrived in Tripoli on 18 October, after a [...] march over mountain passes and sand. [...] "Felt absolutely done up when we got here and at times felt like lying down and giving in as I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> very life blood is being drawn from me in these long marches, in addition to which we are only at half strength which means double work for us all." [...] He was hospitalised in Tripoli shortly after and was still there {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
2500|$|James {{first learned}} to play the cello {{as a child in}} North Carolina and {{switched}} to the guitar in 1960. His guitar style evolved, influenced by hymns, carols, and the music of Woody Guthrie, and his technique derived from his bass clef-oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate's keyboards: [...] "My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> thumb were my left hand, and my first, second, and third fingers were my right hand." [...] He began attending Milton Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Massachusetts in fall 1961. Summering before then with his family on Martha's Vineyard, he met Danny Kortchmar, an aspiring teenage guitarist from Larchmont, New York. The two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together, and Kortchmar quickly realized that Taylor's singing had a [...] "natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that thing." [...] Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14, and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly. By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as [...] "Jamie & Kootch".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh my golly!" [...] gasped Jeekie in English, [...] "{{tell her}} not for Joe, Major, tell her most improper. Say Yellow God my dearest friend and go mad <b>as</b> hatter <b>if</b> <b>my</b> throat cut----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I daresay it's nothing," [...] he exclaimed, looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{ashamed of}} having spoken of it; [...] "only I feel exactly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> both <b>my</b> heels were cut off, and I were walking on tiptoe!" ...|$|R
60|$|And then, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{suspected}} <b>my</b> thoughts, he suddenly shifted his key.|$|R
60|$|It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> heart {{stood still}} with the presage {{of what was to}} come.|$|E
60|$|She {{sprang to}} her feet <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> last words had set the pursuers on her track.|$|E
60|$|I {{could do}} no more than stare at him. It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> mind were {{stricken}} numb.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where your mare and Fitzroy's Silver Heels are stabled," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply, whereupon I sprang up <b>as</b> <b>if</b> within <b>my</b> body was a stout steel spring which had lately been released.|$|R
60|$|Joy broke {{upon his}} face. He came nearer to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to lick <b>my</b> hand.|$|R
5000|$|... "In 1949, when I {{first saw}} the glacier, I felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>my</b> sins were washed away and I had truly {{attained}} rebirth. But now, {{it is impossible to}} experience that Ganga of the past." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. [Haughtily.] Something in what? I don't {{understand}} you. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> {{son would}} bring {{a man like that}} into the house! ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, as it were, {{within me}} [...] Something snapped, [...] <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> soul had largened: [...] Conscience-capped, I saw myself the snarer--them the trapped.|$|E
60|$|He {{waved his}} hand impatiently, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> {{penitent}} words were tangible things--ruffling, worrying things, like flies in summer--which he was putting away from him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Miss Fenne, now?" [...] {{he peered}} out, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> at <b>my</b> godmother herself. [...] "Why didn't she send word to France? Where is this providential step-grandfather, Monsieur Pierre de Ronvel, all this time? Not dead too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I should. Every {{one goes}} a wedding trip, it's {{part of the}} ceremony; and if two {{carriages}} and two bridal pairs don't leave here to-morrow, I shall feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>my</b> trouble had been thrown away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You make my task more difficult," [...] he {{observed}} deliberately. [...] "Does it amuse you to practise your profession before one so ignorant and so unappreciative <b>as</b> myself? <b>If</b> <b>my</b> brother should ever marry, {{it is my}} firm intention that he shall marry an honest woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should feel}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> mind was made up—as if I could do {{something}} clearly. Now it's all hazy—not {{knowing what to do}} next." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dillon {{had some}} {{business}} and brought me along," [...] said Deering with a noisy laugh. [...] "Looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> {{job was to}} guide adventurous youth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Bullfrog, {{upon your}} honor," [...] demanded I, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> life hung upon her words, [...] "is there {{no mistake about}} those five {{thousand}} dollars?" ...|$|E
60|$|I felt my face {{reddening}} {{at these}} ill words, so I stooped, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to clear <b>my</b> spur of mire.|$|R
5000|$|... "Random House {{will take}} good care of our books and authors," [...] Shrifte said. [...] "But it's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>my</b> {{children}} were being sent to a foster home. I'm trying not to cry while I break the news to our authors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like <b>as</b> not, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> {{part in it}} gets to be known," [...] pursued Mr. Smith, mournfully, [...] "I'll 'ave that gal of Kybird's {{scratching}} my {{eyes out}} or p'r'aps sticking a hat-pin into me. I had that once; the longest hat-pin that ever was made, I should think." ...|$|R
60|$|To-day {{has brought}} forth--nothing. Mrs. Tenbruggen still keeps away from us. It looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> Diary had {{something}} to do with the mystery of her absence.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{still she}} vouched, and still I said, [...] "O sprite, that cannot be!" [...] . It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> bosom bled, [...] So much she troubled me.|$|E
6000|$|Nanda, for {{admiration of}} it, broke almost {{for the first}} time into the semblance of a smile. [...] "You feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>my</b> {{grandmother}} were quite YOUR property!" ...|$|E
6000|$|You {{can do that}} <b>as</b> well <b>if</b> you're <b>my</b> wife.... You {{have before}} you a very {{difficult}} and trying time. Won't you let me help you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Mr. Fox stopped {{digging and}} pricked up his ears, making his voice sound mighty soft as he asked, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were <b>my</b> best friend: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{at first}} perhaps I would. But why--why don't I {{want to marry}} her or anybody? I feel {{sometimes}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I wronged <b>my</b> women, mother." ...|$|R
