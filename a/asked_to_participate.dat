25|$|Members of the Royal Family {{have been}} present in Canada since the late 18th century, their reasons {{including}} participating in military manoeuvres, serving as the federal viceroy, or undertaking official royal tours. A prominent feature of the latter are numerous royal walkabouts, the tradition of which was initiated in 1939 by Queen Elizabeth {{when she was in}} Ottawa and broke from the royal party to speak directly to gathered veterans. Usually important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of Canadian culture will warrant the presence of the monarch, while other royals will be <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in lesser occasions. A household to assist and tend to the monarch forms part of the royal party.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Metcalf {{was also}} {{active in the}} American Library Association. He served as its {{president}} in 1942 and 1943.

McCarthy never responded.|$|E
25|$|On July 3, 2003, District {{officials}} {{narrowed the}} field of candidates to Hines Interests/Charles E. Smith Residential/The Georgetown Co. and Forest City/Jarvis Co.

D.C. planning officials said they hoped to select one of the two as the project developer by late August. The finalists were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in a charrette over the next six weeks, to allow outside designers, members of the public, and other interested parties to view, comment on, and make improvements to the submitted designs.

Also, shorter, province-specific tours organized by the relevant provincial government have become more popular into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|By 1 November 1906 tenders for the {{construction}} of a new icebreaker, similar to but slightly larger than Sampo, had been received from four European shipyards. The most expensive tender, 1,608,900 Finnish markkas (FIM), was given by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft from Germany. It was followed by Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co Ltd from England (FIM 1,575,000), Gourlay Brothers Ship Builders of Dundee from Scotland (FIM 1,432,500), and Burmeister & Wain from Denmark (FIM 1,422,500). When a fifth tender for FIM 1,485,000 was received from the English shipbuilder R. & W. Hawthorn Leslie and Company nine days after the deadline, Armstrong Whitworth lowered their bid by 100,000 markkas to FIM 1,475,000. W√§rtsil√§ Hietalahti shipyard was also <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the call for tenders, but the domestic shipbuilding was not yet ready to accept such demanding projects and there were difficulties in acquiring and importing steel suitable for icebreakers. The tenders were evaluated by an expert committee appointed by the Senate and, after careful consideration, the icebreaker offered by Armstrong Whitworth turned out to be the most suitable. A number of changes were proposed to the original design including moving the bow propeller slightly abaft and upwards to protect it from grounding and improve the icebreaking characteristics of the ship by reducing the stem angle to 20 degrees. The shipbuilding contract was signed on 15 February 1907, and with the proposed changes the price of the vessel was 1,631,548.81 Finnish markkas.|$|E

Only first-classmen were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> on the team. The age of the players, however, ranged several years due to the academy's admission policy; the school allowed for men between the ages of 14 and 18 to be admitted as first year students, which future player John B.
