5|$|Roberts {{was one of}} a few Republicans to back <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> reform {{spending}} {{requirements in}} Colorado's state constitution. The proposal, which would have diverted excess revenues under TABOR to K-12 education, was regarded as a sweeping revision to competing constitutional mandates; it was not passed by the General Assembly, but was advanced as a citizens' initiative.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E

5|$|Aventicum (Avenches) {{was likely}} {{the capital of}} the Helvetii since its {{founding}} {{at the beginning of the}} 1st century. In the 40s, it benefited from the traffic brought over the St Bernard pass over a street expanded by Claudius, and in 71 it acquired the status of a Roman colony and of an allied city. This is believed to have been a favor of Vespasian for the city in which he had lived for a time, or <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> better control the Helvetii after the events of 69 by implanting a colony of veterans in their midst.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{bitterness}} of the campaign and {{the timing of the}} murder, speculation mounted that Sharp had been killed by an Anti-Relief partisan. For some time, rumors traveled that Darby was implicated in his death. Sharp's political rival, John J. Crittenden, tried to blunt such accusations by personally introducing a resolution condemning the murder and offering a $3000 reward for the capture of the assassin. The trustees of the city of Frankfort added a reward of $1000, and an additional $2000 reward was raised from private sources. In the 1825 session of the General Assembly, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> form Sharp County from Muhlenberg County died on the floor due to the tumultuous politics of the session.|$|E
5|$|Beshear called another special {{legislative}} session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall {{in the state}} budget. Later, Beshear amended the call to include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> expand gambling in the state by statute. With the threshold lowered from 60 votes {{for a constitutional amendment}} to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget and the economic incentives bills both passed in the 10-day session.|$|E

50|$|Voters reject <b>a</b> bond <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> {{replace the}} failing roof at Willamalane Pool. The {{facility}} is closed due to flood {{damage in the}} pool tank and rain damage to the roof structure. A few months later, voters approve <b>a</b> bond <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> replace the pool roof {{by a margin of}} 63 percent. However, fewer than 50 percent of the electorate cast ballots and the vote is ruled invalid. As a result, the pool roof is removed and facility opens as an outdoor pool. The following winters, voters approve <b>a</b> bond <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> replace the pool roof and make other improvements.|$|R

5|$|During the 2007 {{legislative}} session, Rice sponsored 16 {{pieces of}} legislation, including 11 {{as the primary}} sponsor in the House of Representatives. Among {{the most prominent of}} his bills was <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> set up a cold case unit within the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate Colorado's 1200 unsolved homicides. After passage, Gov. Ritter signed the bill into law. Rice also pursued legislation to cut taxes for businesses by raising the personal property tax exemption. After having passed the state house unanimously, the measure died in a Senate committee.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs {{was also}} viewed {{as one of}} the crucial swing votes on <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> repeal the death penalty in Colorado and use the {{resulting}} savings to fund a statewide cold case unit. Although he first voted to remove the death penalty repeal from the legislation, he later voted in support of a version of the bill containing the repeal, which came within one vote of passing the legislature {{on the final day of}} the session.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{legislative}} session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including {{a ban on}} the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> make carrying a concealed weapon a felony, and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced – one would have lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-lynching law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these bills were acted on; {{the vast majority of the}} Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|Powell {{implemented}} {{the use of}} the state's sinking fund to pay interest on school bonds, a measure which had passed over Governor Helm's veto, but Helm refused to carry out. In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|Rice also {{hoped to}} sponsor {{legislation}} supported by Ritter to raise vehicle registration fees {{in order to}} fund road and bridge repairs, but failed to find a suitable cosponsor for the bill.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, but it was also <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha and {{his entire}} {{administration}} campaigned {{on behalf of}} New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825, Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters. Desha's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary, but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question. Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire for a compromise, albeit one that would save face for the New Court Party. He promised that, if the legislature would again authorize appointment of {{a new set of}} judges, he would appoint them equally from both parties. Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges, with three appointed from each party. One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign, along with Desha, lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee, and all the legislators in the General Assembly, essentially allowing the state government to reset itself. This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. The House passed <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> restore the Old Court, but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee, the presiding officer in the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to defeat it.|$|E
5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E

It opened on 10 August 1947, and {{consisted}} of a main grass field, two gravel fields, two handball courts and two tennis courts. The main field had a spectator capacity for 37,000 on temporary stands, making it the second-largest stadium in the country. The long sides consisted of temporary wooden stands, with seating on the south stand and standing places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing for standing space for spectators without having to build stands. Changing rooms were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{its close}} in 2011, the {{operating}} budget was $341,000, which funded staffing, educational programs, and the museum's heating and lighting. In July 2011, Milford's Board of Aldermen approved allocating $26,000 via a $0.75 tax per ton of municipal solid waste, then representing the latest {{addition to a}} $100,000 fundraising drive. On August 25, 2011, the museum was closed after the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority Board of Directors voted to close the Garbage Museum immediately. In 2013, Connecticut State Senator Kevin C. Kelly introduced legislation to reopen the museum, but the amendment failed to garner support. In 2014, the Connecticut General Assembly approved <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> fund the museum by allowing the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to award a grant of up to $100,000 to the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority via funding of the Municipal Tipping Fee Fund.|$|E
5|$|The Garbage Museum was a waste-management themed museum {{located in}} Stratford, Connecticut, United States. Constructed and opened in 1994, the {{recycling}} facility and museum was constructed for {{a cost of}} $5 million and funded through a group of 19 local municipalities, collectively known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee. The museum was operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority which focused on empowering visitors with knowledge about waste management and allowed visitors to watch the sorting process of recyclables. The most iconic exhibit was Trash-o-saurus, a dinosaur sculpture made of garbage. Funding for the museum dropped in 2009 due to expiring contracts, but remained open until 2011. The closure of the museum followed a failed fundraising campaign. In 2014, the Connecticut General Assembly approved <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>to</b> fund the museum by allowing the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to award a grant of up to $100,000 to the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority.|$|E
