5|$|Plans for a {{link between}} Bømlo and Stord were first {{launched}} as a pontoon bridge in the 1960s. In the late 1980s, the plans evolved into a triangular project. There was controversy surrounding the project, in particular from environmentalists. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1996, and construction started the following year. The bridges <b>and</b> <b>link</b> between Stord and Bømlo opened on 28 December 2000, while the tunnel opened on 30 April 2001.

5|$|Free traders, {{independent}} of the Hudson's Bay Company and outside its jurisdiction, developed extensive commerce with the United States, making Saint Paul the principal entrepôt <b>and</b> <b>link</b> {{to the outside world}} for the Selkirk Settlement. The trade developed by and along the trails connecting Fort Garry with Saint Paul stimulated commerce, contributed to the settlement of Minnesota and North Dakota in the United States, and accelerated the settlement of Canada {{to the west of the}} rugged barrier known as the Canadian Shield. For a time, this cross-border trade even threatened Canada's control of its western territories. The threat diminished after completion of transcontinental trade routes both north and south of the border, and the transportation corridor through which the trails once ran declined in importance. That corridor has now seen a resurgence of traffic, carried by more modern means of transport than the crude ox carts that once travelled the Red River Trails.|$|E

After auditioning over eleven hundred candidates, Nikki Blonsky, an eighteen-year-old high school senior from Great Neck, New York who had no previous professional acting experience, was chosen for the lead role of Tracy. Relative unknowns Elijah Kelley and Taylor Parks were chosen through similar audition contests to portray siblings Seaweed and Little Inez Stubbs, respectively. John Travolta was finally cast as Edna, with Christopher Walken ultimately assuming the role of Wilbur.
