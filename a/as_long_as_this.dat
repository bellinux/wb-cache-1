On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent {{a bill for}} making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>this</b> excerpt, indicating that the symphony might be {{on a larger scale}} than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>this</b> is before the testator's death.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} the HBC {{had over}} the Americans was that it could take such losses. As a vast corporation with {{a large amount of}} capital, the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into their hands and not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable—the HBC had captured the trade. But Americans still traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>this</b> continued, the HBC continued to have to pay high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American-Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions of the Alaska Panhandle. This proved to be the final blow for the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether.|$|E

25|$|In My Life and Work Ford speaks (briefly) {{of racing}} {{in a rather}} dismissive tone, as {{something}} that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general.

Ford did not agree. But he was determined that <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>this</b> was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing.

25|$|In {{contemporary}} society, rural families {{no longer}} own land or pass {{it down to}} the next generation. They may, however, own and transmit houses. Rural families pay medical expenses and school fees for their children. Under the people's commune system in force from 1958 to 1982, the income of a peasant family depended directly on the number of laborers it contributed to the collective fields. This, combined with concern over the level of support for the aged or disabled provided by the collective unit, encouraged peasants to have many sons. Under the agricultural reforms that began in the late 1970s, households took on an increased and more responsible economic role. The labor of family members is still the primary determinant of income. But rural economic growth and commercialization increasingly have rewarded managerial and technical skills and have made unskilled farm labor less desirable. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>this</b> economic trend continues in the countryside in the late 1980s, peasant families are likely to opt for fewer but better educated children.|$|E
