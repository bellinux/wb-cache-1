5|$|There's {{going to}} be no more digital {{enhancements}} or digital additions to anything based on any film I direct.... When people <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. If you notice, when we did put out E.T. we put out two E.T.s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always tell people {{to go back to the}} '82 version.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} Reddit {{applications}} for iOS. These include Karma, Upvote, iReddit, iPad-specific {{applications such as}} Reddzine and Biscuit, and, until April 2016, Alien Blue. In September 2014, an official mobile application for browsing AMA (<b>Ask</b> <b>Me</b> Anything) threads was released for the iOS and Android platforms under the name <b>Ask</b> <b>me</b> Anything. In October 2014, Alien Blue was acquired by Reddit and became the official iOS Reddit app. In April 2016, Reddit released an official application called Reddit: The Official App, which is available on Google Play and the iOS App Store, and Alien Blue {{was removed from the}} App Store in favor of the new app.|$|E

25|$|Would you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> how I dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights? I can compare them and I do compare them, because I {{know what it means to}} be called a 'nigger' and I know what it means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E

25|$|Many other {{game shows}} feature a sudden-death playoff; usually, the next player {{to answer a}} {{question}} correctly wins. Often, the rules of sudden death provide that in the event a wrong answer is given, the opposing team wins (for instance, the radio quiz show <b>Ask</b> <b>Me</b> Another utilizes this format), even though wrong answers may otherwise not be penalized. Occasionally, the format is a numeric question, with the player making the closer guess winning.|$|E
25|$|President Barack Obama made a {{surprise}} half-hour {{visit to the}} social news website Reddit on August 29, 2012. Using an <b>Ask</b> <b>Me</b> Anything (AMA) format, the President garnered 3.8 million page views {{on the first page}} of his self-post. Users left 22,000 comments and questions for the President, 10 of which he answered. The answered questions' topics included more serious topics, from the most difficult decision made during his first term to a plan to end the corruption of money in politics. Some included a more lighthearted focus, like the recipe for the White House beer.|$|E
25|$|I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the radar screen. I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E

25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> for help.|$|E

30|$|There was one {{question}} that <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> how I {{felt about the}} way I was communicating with my wife while I was caring for her. And I don’t think anybody’s ever <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> that before. And generally, there is different emotions when you’re caring for things, depending on what physical state she’s in at the moment or what’s been happening prior in the day. Yeah, so I don’t think anybody has ever <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> a question about that before.|$|R

500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E
