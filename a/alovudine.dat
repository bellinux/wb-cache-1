40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{physiological}} and physico-chemical factors influencing the pharmacokinetics and distribution over the blood-brain barrier of antiviral nucleoside analogues in the rat, and to study the distribution to the human skin in vivo of an anti-herpetic nucleoside analogue. Microdialysis was used to sample the free (unbound) extracellular concentration of the nucleoside analogues from the brain tissue, muscle and blood in the rat and from the dermis of healthy human volunteers. Microdialysis was also used in vitro to determine the plasma protein binding of the nucleoside analogues. HPLC was used for analysis and quantification of the nucleoside analogues. The HPLC assays were optimised by using PLS (Partial Least Square analysis), which allows a rapid development of assays for new nucleoside analogues. The effect of varying perfusion medium osmolality on the in vivo microdialysis recovery of caffeine and 5 -chloro- 2 ', 3 '-dideoxy- 3 '-fluorouridine was investigated in rat brain. A linear correlation between the recovery over microdialysis membrane and osmolality of perfusion medium was demonstrated for both substances within a certain interval. At higher osmolality (> 627 mosmol/l) of the perfusion medium the increase of the recovery of caffeine was non-linear, indicating {{that there is an}} upper limit of the change in extracellular volume in the brain. The distribution of <b>alovudine</b> (3 '-fluorothymidine) to the brain and to the cerebrospinal fluid was studied after i. v. infusion and after s. c. injection. The concentration gradient between brain extracellular fluid and cerebrospinal fluid indicates that there is an active efflux of <b>alovudine</b> from the brain. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, inhibiting the cerebrospinal fluid production in the choroid plexus, had no influence on the AUC (Area Under the plasma concentration-time Curve) ratio brain/blood. This suggests that <b>alovudine</b> transport to the brain does not occur via the cerebrospinal fluid, but via cerebrovascular endothelium. Thymidine, administered locally or systemically, had no influence on the AUC ratio brain/blood, indicating that thymidine transport is not involved. Two inhibitors of transport proteins, probenecid and quinidine, were also used to study the <b>alovudine</b> transport system. Quinidine, but not probenecid, significantly decreased the <b>alovudine</b> concentration in the brain and increased the concentration gradient. Both perfusion through the microdialysis probe with <b>alovudine</b> solution at increasing concentration and quirridine administration significantly increased the microdialysis recovery of <b>alovudine.</b> The distribution into the rat brain of 5 -substituted <b>alovudine</b> analogues and physico-chemical properties of these substances was studied and a multivariate quantitative structure-kinetic relationship was calculated. No correlation between the transport over the blood-brain barrier and the lipophilicity (octanol/water partition coefficient) could be demonstrated. Instead the pKa and the electronic distribution properties of the 5 -substituent were found to influence the concentration gradient across the blood-brain barrier. This result indicates that <b>alovudine</b> analogues are subject to active transport (carrier-mediated) rather than passive diffusion across the blood-brain barrier. The distribution to the brain of the cytidine analogues: 2 ', 3 '-dideoxycytidine and 3 '-hydroxymethyl- 2 ', 3 '- dideoxycytidine over the blood-brain barrier were studied after s. c. administration. The pharmacokinetic properties were found to be similar. There was no significant difference with respect to blood-brain barrier transport between 2 ', 3 '-dideoxycytidine and 3 '-hydroxymethyl- 2 ', 3 '-dideoxycytidine. Thus, the sugar structure did not influence their transport into the brain. The distribution to the brain of penciclovir after i. v. injection or p. o. administration of its prodrug famciclovir and during i. v. infusion of penciclovir or famciclovir was studied in rats. Penciclovir was found to cross the blood-brain barrier and achieved significant concentrations in the brain. The distribution of penciclovir into the dermis of healthy volunteers was studied after a single dose of its prodrug, famciclovir, by microdialysis and by the suction blister technique. The results obtained with the suction blister technique and by microdialysis were similar and both showed that pencilovir reaches the skin in concentrations expected to inhibit herpes virus replication. However, microdialysis allows continuous sampling of the drug over a prolonged time after administration. The microdialysis concentration was decreased by cold and by adrenaline- mediated vasoconstriction...|$|E

Significant correlations between in vitro 50 % inhibitory concentrations {{and the daily}} human exposures (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h; in micromolar. hour) of these chronically administered drugs in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients that induced neutropenia or anemia were demonstrated by both linear regression and Spearman rank-order analyses. These quantitative correlations allow estimation of the exposure at which bone marrow toxicity may occur with candidate compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{nasal route}} has {{primarily}} {{been used to}} deliver drugs {{for the treatment of}} local diseases such as nasal infections, nasal congestion and allergies. The nasal route can also be used as a non-invasive alternative route to deliver drugs systemically when a rapid onset of action and/or avoidance of hepatic metabolism are desired. Moreover, there is a growing interest in the use of this route for direct transport of drugs from the nose to the brain. Most of the drugs that have been studied for nasal delivery are either small molecules which are lipophilic enough to passively diffuse through the nasal epithelia or macromolecules where bioavailabilities less than 1 % are clinically effective and acceptable. This study focused on identifying carrier proteins or transporters in the nasal mucosa that could improve the absorption of specific drug substrates across the nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelia. The presence of drug transporters in the nasal mucosa of humans and commonly used animal models were investigated. DNA microarray results for nasal samples from humans and two commonly used models, mice and rats, were obtained from GenBank and were analyzed in collaboration with the University of Iowa Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. While cow tissues are frequently used in in-vitro nasal permeability analyses, there is limited information available in GenBank for this species. Both DNA microarray analysis and RT-PCR were performed on bovine nasal explants to determine transporter expression. Good agreement between the microarray and RT-PCR results was observed. While human and three animal species commonly used as models in nasal drug delivery research (mouse, rat, and cow) show similar patterns of expression for several transporters, interspecies differences in the level of expression were observed. Therefore, the expression level of transporters remains a factor to consider when translating results obtained using animal models to humans. The nucleoside transporter family was selected for further evaluation of the potential to improve the nasal absorption of substrates. Nucleoside transporters are integral proteins responsible for mediating and facilitating the flux of nucleosides across cellular membranes; they are also known to be responsible for the uptake of nucleoside analog drugs such as anti-cancer and anti-viral agents. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to verify the presence of two transporter subtypes, ENT 1 and CNT 3, in the bovine nasal respiratory and olfactory mucosa. The expression level of both transporters in the respiratory mucosa was comparable to that in the olfactory mucosa. Using immunohistochemistry, ENT 1 and CNT 3 were found to be localized primarily at the apical surface of the nasal epithelial cells. This indicates that the nasal epithelium likely absorbs exogenous nucleosides for intracellular uses such as nucleic acid synthesis and regulating other cellular activities. The contribution of the nucleoside transporters to the permeation of a nucleoside analogue drug, <b>alovudine,</b> across the nasal epithelia was also studied. The transport of <b>alovudine</b> showed a non-linear increase with increasing donor concentration over the range of 50 to 3000 µM which suggests that nucleoside transporters play a role in its uptake. Polarized transport was not observed suggesting that the facilitative nature of ENT 1 {{plays a major role in}} <b>alovudine</b> transport. S-(4 -nitrobenzyl) - 6 -thioinosine (NBMPR), an ENT 1 inhibitor, incompletely decreased <b>alovudine</b> permeability across the nasal mucosa. This demonstrates that at least one transporter, ENT, plays a significant role in the uptake of this nucleoside drug across the nasal mucosa...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} 5 ′-O-dicarboxylic fatty acyl {{monoester}} derivatives of 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT), 2 ′, 3 ′-didehydro- 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxythymidine (stavudine, d 4 T), and 3 ′-fluoro- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (<b>alovudine,</b> FLT) were synthesized {{to improve the}} lipophilicity and potentially the cellular delivery of parent polar 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs. The compounds were evaluated for their anti-HIV activity. Three different fatty acids with varying chain length of suberic acid (octanedioic acid), sebacic acid (decanedioic acid), and dodecanedioic acid {{were used for the}} conjugation with the nucleosides. The compounds were evaluated for anti-HIV activity and cytotoxicity. All dicarboxylic ester conjugates of nucleosides exhibited significantly higher anti-HIV activity than that of the corresponding parent nucleoside analogs. Among all the tested conjugates, 5 ′-O-suberate derivative of AZT (EC 50 = 0. 10 nM) was found to be the most potent compound and showed 80 -fold higher anti-HIV activity than AZT without any significant toxicity (TC 50 3 ̆e 500 nM) ...|$|E
40|$|Fosalvudine tidoxil is a prodrug {{derived from}} the {{nucleoside}} reverse transcriptase inhibitor 3 -deoxy- 3 -fluorothymidine (FLT; <b>alovudine).</b> FLT effectively inhibits resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1, but its clinical development was stopped due to bone marrow and liver toxicity. In this study, we examined the long-term in vivo effects of fosalvudine tidoxil on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats received fosalvudine tidoxil (15, 40, or 100 mg/kg of body weight/day) by oral gavage {{during a period of}} 8 weeks. Didanosine (100 mg/kg/day) was used as a positive control for mitochondrial toxicity. mtDNA levels in liver, gastrocnemius muscle, sciatic nerve, and inguinal fat pad tissues were quantified by real-time PCR. In hepatic mitochondria, fosalvudine tidoxil induced significant mtDNA depletion. At doses of 15, 40, and 100 mg/kg, the mean hepatic mtDNA values were 62, 64, and 47 % of control values, respectively. Rats exposed to 100 mg/kg of fosalvudine tidoxil, unlike all other groups, had slightly elevated levels of glutamate pyruvate transaminase in sera. Didanosine induced a loss of mtDNA (to 48 % of the control level) similar to that induced by fosalvudine tidoxil. mtDNA levels in skeletal, neural, and adipose tissues in the negative control and treatment groups were similar. Our results suggest that fosalvudine tidoxil induces mitochondrial hepatotoxicity and that this effect warrants scrutiny in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|There are now exactly 20 anti-HIV drugs licenced (approved) for {{clinical}} use, and > 30 anti-HIV compounds under (pre) clinical development. The licensed anti-HIV drugs fall into five categories: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs: zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir and emtricitabine); nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate); non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs: nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz); protease inhibitors (PIs: saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, atazanavir and fosamprenavir); and fusion inhibitors (FIs: enfuvirtide). The compounds {{that are currently}} under clinical (Phase I, II or III) or preclinical investigation are either targeted at the same specific viral proteins as the licensed compounds (i. e., reverse transcriptase [NRTIs: PSI- 5004, (-) -dOTC, DPC- 817, elvucitabine, <b>alovudine,</b> MIV- 210, amdoxovir, DOT; NNRTIs: thiocarboxanilide, UC- 781, capravirine, dapivirine, etravirine, rilpivirine], protease [PIs: tipranavir, TMC- 114]) or other specific viral proteins (i. e., gp 120 : cyanovirin N; attachment inhibitors: AIs, such as BMS- 488043; integrase: L- 870, 812, PDPV- 165; capsid proteins: PA- 457, alpha-HCG); or cellular proteins (CD 4 downmodulators: CADAs; CXCR 4 antagonists: AMD- 070, CS- 3955; CCR 5 antagonists: TAK- 220, SCH-D, AK- 602, UK- 427857). Combination therapy {{is likely to remain}} the gold standard for the treatment of AIDS so as to maximise potency, minimise toxicity and diminish the risk for resistance development. Ideally, pill burden should be reduced to once-daily dosing so as to optimise the patient's compliance and reduce the treatment costs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{absence of}} any {{formally}} licensed antiadenovirus drugs and the increasing incidence of life-threatening adenovirus infections in immunosuppressed patients warrant the development of effective antiadenovirus compounds. A detailed study {{was performed on the}} antiadenovirus activities of several classes of nucleoside and nucleotide analogues in human embryonic lung fibroblast cells. The antiadenovirus activities were evaluated by three methods, viz. evaluating the adenoviral cytopathic effect, monitoring cell viability by a colorimetric assay, and real-time PCR quantitation of viral DNA as a direct parameter for virus replication. The most active and selective compounds were the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues cidofovir, its adenine analogue (S) - 9 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine [(S) -HPMPA], and the new derivative (S) - 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propoxy]pyrimidine [(S) -HPMPO-DAPy]; the NT-substituted acyclic derivative 2 -amino- 7 -(1, 3 - dihydroxy- 2 -propoxymethyl) purine (S- 2242); and the 2 ′, 3 ′- dideoxynucleoside analogues zalcitabine and <b>alovudine.</b> No antiadenovirus activity was observed for the antiviral drugs ribavirin, foscarnet, acyclovir, penciclovir, and brivudin, while ganciclovir displayed modest activity. However, in human osteosarcoma cells transfected with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, ganciclovir demonstrated highly potent antiadenovirus activity, suggesting that the efficacy of ganciclovir against adenovirus is limited by inefficient phosphorylation in adenovirus-infected cells, rather than by insufficient inhibition at the viral DNA polymerase level. Collectively, our antiviral data show that the adenovirus DNA polymerase exhibits sensitivity to a relatively broad spectrum of inhibitors and should be studied further as an antiviral target in antiadenovirus drug development programs.

40|$|In {{the first}} Manuscript, the {{synthesis}} and anti-HIV activities of 52 ̆ 6 feet;-O-dicarboxylic fatty acyl monoester derivatives of 32 ̆ 7 -azido- 32 ̆ 7 -deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT), 22 ̆ 7, 32 ̆ 7 -didehydro- 22 ̆ 7, 32 ̆ 7 -dideoxythymidine (stavudine, d 4 T), and 32 ̆ 7 -fluoro- 32 ̆ 7 -deoxythymidine (<b>alovudine,</b> FLT) are discussed. The compounds were synthesized {{to improve the}} lipophilicity and potentially the cellular delivery of parent polar 22 ̆ 6 feet;, 32 ̆ 6 feet;-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs. Three different fatty acids with varying chain length of suberic acid (octanedioic acid), sebacic acid (decanedioic acid), and dodecanedioic acid {{were used for the}} conjugation with the nucleosides. Among all the compounds, 52 ̆ 6 feet;- O-suberate derivative of AZT (1, EC 50 = 0. 10 nM) exhibited the best anti-HIV profile when compared to other fatty acyl derivatives. The compound showed 80 -fold higher anti-HIV activity than AZT without any significant toxicity (TC 50 3 ̆e 500 nM). In the second Manuscript, synthesis, anti-HIV activity, and preformulation tests of poly-L-arginine cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) conjugated with fatty acyl derivatives of anti-HIV nucleosides, FLT, lamivudine (3 TC) and emtricitabine (FTC) are discussed. All conjugates exhibited less anti-HIV activity when compared with the parent nucleoside analogues. For example, poly-L-arginine-fatty acyl derivative of 32 ̆ 6 feet;-fluoro- 32 ̆ 6 feet;-deoxythymidine, FLT-CO-(CH 2) 12 -CO-(Arg) 7, exhibited EC 50 values of 2. 9 µM and 3. 1 µM against X 4 and R 5 cell-free virus, respectively, while the FLT had EC 50 values of 0. 2 µM and 0. 1 µM, suggesting the limited uptake or intracellular hydrolysis to the parent analogue. Further preformulation studies were done on the FLT-conjugate by determining the lipid solubility (partition coefficient) and solution state degradation. The compound was found to be stable in acidic and alkaline conditions. The partition coefficient (Log P) of FLT conjugate was found to be - 0. 34. The derivative was also evaluated in dissolution studies using four different hydrogels with and without a thermogelling polymer. Gel formulations of the compound were manufactured using non-ionic (HPC-SL) and anionic (Carbopol) polymers with and without the inclusion of a thermo-reversible gelling (Pluronic F- 127) polymer. The compound was found to be unstable in the manufactured formulations as shown by HPLC profiles. ...|$|E
