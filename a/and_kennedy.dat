5|$|Other {{variations}} to {{the pattern}} {{can be observed}} at Islington and Warden stations, which both have a tricolour design. The current terminus stations of Kipling <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> stations resemble the second version of Union subway station.

5|$|Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch {{continued}} to feud with Paul London and Brian Kendrick while Jeff Hardy {{got involved in}} a rivalry with Mr. Kennedy. At No Mercy, London and Kendrick teamed up with Hardy {{to take on the}} team of Cade, Murdoch <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> in a six-man tag team match. Cade, Murdoch <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> won the match after Kennedy delivered a Green Bay Plunge to London. On the September 17 episode of Raw, Candice Michelle and Mickie James defeated Melina and Jillian in a tag team match. Beth Phoenix was at ringside during the match At No Mercy, Candice and Phoenix had a rematch for the Women's Championship, which Phoenix won to capture the title.|$|E
5|$|The 300 Bloor–Danforth bus {{provides}} late-night {{service to}} {{the area around the}} stations when the subway is not in operation. This service operates frequently along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue between East/West Mall <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> Stn via Danforth Road, Brimley Road, Eglinton Avenue East, North/South Service Road, Transway Crescent <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> Road. On Sundays, these routes operate through the early morning hours, because the subway starts at 9:00a.m. instead of the usual 6:00a.m. Frequency is 6–30 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the line}} started full operation, {{construction}} of extensions to the Bloor–Danforth line began. The extensions to Islington {{station in the}} west and Warden station in the east opened simultaneously on May 11, 1968.

5|$|He {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1972–73 season, his confidence and form suffered as defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over 14 stone. Captain Frank McLintock remarked to the management that Kennedy was only operating at 60% capacity, <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was fined £200 before he began to shed weight and rediscover his form. Arsenal finished the season in second place, and he scored just nine league goals throughout the campaign. Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Weinberg coauthored {{the first}} nuclear reactor textbook, The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors, with Wigner. The {{following}} year, 1959, {{he was elected}} president of the American Nuclear Society and, in 1960, began service on the President's Science Advisory Committee under the Eisenhower <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> administrations. Starting in 1945 with Patent #2,736,696, Weinberg, usually with Wigner, filed numerous patents on the light water reactor (LWR) technology that has provided the United States' primary nuclear reactors. The main LWR types are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), that serve in Naval propulsion and commercial nuclear power. In 1965 he was appointed vice president of Union Carbide's Nuclear Division.|$|E

5|$|On March 28, 1941, Seaborg, {{physicist}} Emilio Segrè <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{were able}} to demonstrate not only the presence of plutonium, but that was fissile, an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. Arthur Wahl then began exploring the chemistry of the newly discovered element. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where they did this work, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|The 1947–48 season brought Max Bentley to Toronto from Chicago in {{what has}} been called the biggest trade in NHL history as the Leafs gave up five regular players for the league's scoring leader. Evincing the depth of the team at centre, Bentley played on the team's third line, behind Apps <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> Decades later, Hap Day argued that this team was the strongest NHL team ever and Globe and Mail {{reporter}} Dick Beddoes also stirred up controversy by saying Wayne Gretzky would have been relegated to the fourth line on this Leaf team.|$|E
5|$|The Carter {{administration}} {{years were}} difficult for Kennedy; {{he had been}} the most important Democrat in Washington ever since his brother Robert's death, but now Carter was, <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> at first did not have a full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence. Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy's status as a political celebrity. Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy expressed to reporters that he was content with his congressional role and viewed presidential ambitions as almost far-fetched.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis was a tense {{confrontation}} between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba.

5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} {{had been passed}} to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive {{increase in the number of}} presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the sale}} of Jimmy Case, Kennedy began to become disillusioned with Liverpool, and was sent off twice {{in the space of}} a few weeks early in the 1981–82 season – the first red cards of his career. He made his final league {{appearance}} for the club on 5 December, when he scored in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. His final cup game for the club came eight days later, in a 3–0 defeat to Brazilian side Flamengo in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium. He was replaced in the team by Ronnie Whelan. Liverpool went on to win the league title after finishing four points ahead of second-place Ipswich Town, and Kennedy's 15 league appearances in the first half of the campaign were enough to earn him another league championship medal. Sunderland attempted to sign him on loan in January 1982, but were denied by Liverpool, <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> could not agree personal terms with manager Alan Durban so was not signed by Sunderland on a permanent transfer.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his research and teaching, Brode occupied {{a number of other}} positions. He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California, Clark Kerr from 1960 to 1965, and Charles J. Hitch from 1972 to 1973, and to Angus E. Taylor, the vice-president for academic affairs, from 1967 to 1972. He served on the selection panels for Rhodes, Fulbright <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> scholarships, and for awards from the State Department, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Institute of International Education. He was chairman of the Advisory Board of the Naval Ordnance Test Station from 1948 to 1955, a member of the National Research Council Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) from 1951 to 1957, and chairman of the American Association of Physics Teachers and the American Institute of Physics' Committee on Physics Faculties in Colleges from 1962 to 1965.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{staged a}} tiring, dangerous, and {{high-profile}} trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government's wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending {{a night in}} the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became {{a leader in the}} push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.|$|E

5|$|Scarborough is at {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway system. There are three subway stations in Scarborough: Victoria Park, Warden, <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> Beginning at Kennedy station, Line 3 Scarborough, {{also known as the}} Scarborough RT, runs north and east toward Scarborough City Centre. It runs at grade for two stops until Ellesmere Road where it becomes elevated until it reaches its terminus at McCowan Road. The system is nearing the end of its life and the city is planning an extension of the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth subway line to Scarborough Centre with construction slated to commence in 2018. In addition to the subway and RT, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) runs an extensive bus network throughout Scarborough. Many of the bus lines run to and from the subway and RT stations.|$|E
5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of {{a plan for the}} company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition to the movie business. In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy</b> sought.|$|E
5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark <b>and</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E
