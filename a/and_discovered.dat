5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in {{the bones}} of Majungasaurus. Scientists examined the remains of at least 21 individuals <b>and</b> <b>discovered</b> four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had been studied in large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had been examined in this manner. No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was a phalanx (toe bone) of the foot, which had apparently been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E

The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.|$|E

5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals <b>and</b> <b>discovered</b> that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds <b>and</b> <b>discovered</b> that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} {{a family with}} a hereditary thyroid cancer <b>and</b> <b>discovered</b> {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E
