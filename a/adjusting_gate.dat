40|$|The {{synthesis}} of a quantum computer remains an ongoing challenge in modern physics. Whereas decoherence stymies most approaches, topological quantum computation schemes evade decoherence at the hardware level by storing quantum information non-locally. Here we establish that a key operation—braiding of non-Abelian anyons—can be implemented using one-dimensional semiconducting wires. Such wires can be driven into a topological phase supporting long-sought particles known as Majorana fermions that can encode topological qubits. We {{show that in}} wire networks, Majorana fermions can be meaningfully braided by simply <b>adjusting</b> <b>gate</b> voltages, and that they exhibit non-Abelian statistics like vortices in a p+ip superconductor. We propose experimental set-ups that enable probing of the Majorana fusion rules and the efficient exchange of arbitrary numbers of Majorana fermions. This work should open a new direction in topological quantum computation that benefits from physical transparency and experimental feasibility...|$|E
40|$|The {{prospects}} for realizing a topological quantum computer have brightened since the apparent detection of Majorana fermions {{at the ends}} of semiconducting nanowires. These Majorana zero-modes persist {{in the presence of the}} strong disorder that may be present in such systems, protected by the mobility gap of localized systems. Recent proposals to manipulate quantum information in a Majorana chain involve adiabatically <b>adjusting</b> <b>gate</b> voltages in one-dimensional nanowire networks. However, as we show, in the adiabatic limit, a disordered system with multiple zero-mode Majorana fermions will undergo a non-local response to a local perturbation via a multi-level Landau-Zener transition. This will disperse the quantum information stored in the target zero-modes amongst other zero-modes that are present in the system, complicating the realization of controlled gates. There is however a solution that may work in practice: we show that there is an optimum window of intermediate time-scales during which the quantum information is approximately preserved under manipulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{photoelectric}} {{techniques are}} often used for the measurements of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) structure parameters. These methods, which consist in illuminating the MOS structure with a semitransparent metal gate by a UV light beam, are often competitive for typical electric measurements. The results obtained by different photoelectric methods are, in many cases, more accurate and reproducible than the results of other measurements. The flat-band voltage VFB is an important parameter of any MOS structure since its value influences the threshold voltage VT, which decides for example about power consumption of MOS transistors. One of the methods to measure the VFB value is the electric method of C(V) characteristic. This method involves certain calculations and requires the knowledge about parameters of the investigated sample. The accuracy of this method is rarely better than ± 100 mV (for higher doping of the substrates the accuracy is worse). The other method of VFB value determination, outlined in this article, is the photoelectric light pulse technique (LPT) method. This method {{based on the idea}} proposed by Yun is currently being optimized and verified experimentally. As will be shown later, the gate voltage VG at which u changes sign is the flat-band voltage of the MOS structure under investigation. Hence, by <b>adjusting</b> <b>gate</b> voltage VG to obtain u = 0 the VFB value can be determined. The main difficulty in practical application of the LPT and SLPT measurement methods results {{from the fact that the}} signal |u| in the accumulation range is in most of the cases several orders of magnitude smaller than in inversion and depletion (as schematically shown in Fig. 1). Hence, very high sensitivity of the measurement setup is required to correctly determine the VG value corresponding to u = 0...|$|E

The irrigation systems in Sri Lanka mostly designed for up-stream discharge control operation, with manually/mechanically <b>adjusted</b> <b>gated</b> structures, under steady state flow conditions. Further, topographical features of many gravity irrigation systems are varying at sub-system level due to presence of single and double bank reaches, inclusion of in-lined storage tanks. However, irrigation systems are operated under varying flow regime due to scheduled or unscheduled flows in water delivery. The adjustments of gates in structures in such situations are done by manually/mechanically by operators at different frequencies. Therefore these situations are analyzed by hydraulic simulations using SIC hydraulic model for three different topographical sub-systems under different frequency of adjustments. The actual performance in water delivery is evaluated by effective volume of water delivered, timeliness in water delivery, at the final delivery location while maintaining on-line water adequacy through delivery points along the canal. The results will provide guidance for operation of regulation structures for effective conveyance of water under varying flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two high-voltage circuits used {{in power}} management, a switching driver for buck converter with optimized on-resistance {{and a low}} dropout (LDO) voltage regulator with 2 -stacked pMOS pass devices. The circuit design is based on stacked MOSFETs, thus the circuits are technology independent. High-voltage drivers with stacked devices suffer from slow switching characteristics. In this paper, {{a new concept to}} <b>adjust</b> <b>gate</b> voltages of stacked transistors is introduced for reduction of on-resistance. According to the theory, a circuit is proposed that drives 2 stacked transistors of a driver. Simulation results show a reduction of the on-resistance between 27 and 86 % and a reduction of rise and fall times between 16 and 83 % with a load capacitance of 150 pF at various supply voltages, compared to previous work. The concept can be applied to each high-voltage driver that is based on a number (N) of stacked transistors. The high voltage compatibility of the low drop-out voltage regulator (LDO) is established by a 2 -stacked pMOS transistors as pass device controlled by two regulators: an error amplifier and a 2 nd amplifier adjusting the division of the voltages between the two pass transistors. A high GBW and good DC accuracy in line and load regulation is achieved by using 3 -stage error amplifiers. To improve stability, two feedback loops are utilized.
