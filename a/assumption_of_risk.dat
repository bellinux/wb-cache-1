50|$|The court {{recognized}} {{two categories}} of <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> The first was primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> where the defendant owes no duty of care to protect the plaintiff from the risk that caused the injury. The second category is secondary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> where the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiff and the plaintiff knowingly encounters the risk created by the defendant's breach of that duty. The court held that secondary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> had been merged into the comparative negligence scheme adopted in Li v. Yellow Cab Co. of California, but that primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> could still serve as a defense to negligence. The court determined that in a touch football game, the only duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff is to not be reckless and wanton. Because the plaintiff was injured in {{the normal course of}} the touch football game, the injury fell under primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and she was barred from recovery.|$|E
5000|$|What {{is usually}} meant by <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> is more {{precisely}} termed primary or [...] "express" [...] <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> It {{occurs when the}} plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the duty to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability {{on the theory that}} upon assumption of the risk, {{there is no longer a}} duty of care running from the defendant to the plaintiff; without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on his part. [...] However, primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> is not a blanket exemption from liability for the operators of a dangerous activity. The specific risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> to apply. Also, <b>assumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} simple efficiency hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased and efficient predictor of the future spot exchange rate. This hypothesis has been extensively tested, and is overwhelmingly rejected. However, researchers are unable to determine the exact cause of rejections {{since it is the}} result <b>of</b> joint <b>assumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> neutrality and rational expectations. An interest rate differential model is developed assuming that the spot rate follows a random walk process and the covered interest rate parity condition holds. In this model, the spot rate is equal to the sum of the lagged forward rate and the interest rate differential, and a random error term. This model shows that the interest rate differential term belongs to the relationship between the spot and lagged forward rates, but it is not accounted for by the simple efficiency hypothesis. Therefore, the simple efficiency hypothesis is rejected because the interest rate differential term belongs to the spot and forward relationship rather than because <b>of</b> <b>assumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> neutrality or rational expectations. Empirical evidence supports this model using the exchange rates of the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland versus the United States. Furthermore, the time series properties of interest rate differentials are sensitive to changes in monetary and fiscal policies. The interest rate differential is non-stationary, and the spot and forward rates are not cointegrated for samples between 1982 to 1993, which is a strong indication that the simple efficiency hypothesis is rejected because of interest rate differentials...|$|R
