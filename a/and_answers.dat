40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types in community question-answering sites (CQAs). The research questions addressed are the following: (a) How do <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (b) How do the relationships between <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed vary across question types? (c) How do the best quality <b>answers</b> <b>and</b> the fastest <b>answers</b> differ in terms of <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types? (d) How do trends in answer quality vary over time across question types? From the posting of 3, 000 questions in six CQAs, 5, 356 <b>answers</b> were harvested <b>and</b> analyzed. There {{was a significant difference}} in <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types, and there were generally no significant relationships between <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed. The best quality answers had better overall answer quality than the fastest answers but generally took longer to arrive. In addition, although the trend in answer quality had been mostly random across all question types, the quality of answers appeared to improve gradually when given time. By highlighting the subtle nuances in <b>answer</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> speed across question types, this study is an attempt to explore a territory of CQA research that has hitherto been relatively uncharted...|$|R

5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions <b>and</b> <b>answers</b> are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. When first playing the game, the scenarios for all six heroines are available. Once a scenario for any one heroine is completed, that scenario will be unavailable in the next play through because the last choice that will ultimately lead to that heroine's scenario becomes unavailable for players to choose. After the completion of these six routes, the final scenario called Refrain is made available, which serves to bring everything to a definite conclusion <b>and</b> <b>answers</b> questions brought up throughout the normal gameplay. Completing Refrain makes available all the heroine's scenarios that were previously made inaccessible during gameplay so that the player can revisit the scenarios again, along with some extra decision points that were previously unavailable.|$|E
