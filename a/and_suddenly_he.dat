500|$|In the {{original}} script, Frink appeared more evil. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed {{a voice for}} Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film The Nutty Professor, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide that [...] "He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is that, you give him a single lineand most of these characters have very few linesand he just brings it to life. Every time." [...] Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on {{to make him look}} even more like Lewis's character. He was named after television writer John Frink, who was later hired on The Simpsons. The nonsensical utterances that Frink makes are written in the scripts as [...] "Frink noise".|$|E
2500|$|Darius sends {{a secret}} message in ancient runes to MacLeod in Seacouver, Washington {{asking him to}} protect Victor Paulus, another protégé of his, from Grayson. MacLeod tells Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch) Darius' legend: two {{thousand}} [...] years old, an ancient general and Grayson was his second-in-command. Fifteen hundred years ago, Darius could have led his armies across Europe and ruled for a thousand years, but he turned his armies back to become a peacemaker and Grayson felt betrayed. MacLeod then recounts, [...] "The legend has it Darius killed a holy man {{at the gates of}} Paris. The oldest living Immortal at that time. <b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> changed. He turned his back on war." [...] Richie rationalizes that the holy man's Quickening went to Darius and made him benevolent, the only known example of a Light Quickening. However, a deleted line from the script has MacLeod say: [...] "Maybe what the Old One told him finally made sense to Darius", suggesting an intellectual realization of the horrors of war rather than the overwhelming positive power of the holy man's Quickening.|$|E
2500|$|.....The chief warder {{shows me}} the black smoked pot, filled with some food: 'I need your medical {{expertise}} regarding this meat.' I {{look into the}} pot, and hardly hold vomiting. The fibres of that meat are very small, and don't resemble me anything I have seen before. The skin on some pieces bristles with black hair (...) A former smith from Poltava, Kulesh worked together with Centurashvili. At this time, Centurashvili was only one month away from being discharged from the camp (...) <b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> surprisingly disappeared. The wardens looked around the hills, stated Kulesh's evidence, that last time Kulesh had seen his workmate near the fireplace, Kulesh went out to work and Centurashvili left to warm himself more; but when Kulesh returned to the fireplace, Centurashvili had vanished; who knows, maybe he got frozen somewhere in snow, he was a weak guy (...) The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed {{that it was an}} escape case, though they wondered why, since his imprisonment period was almost over (...) The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place. ... Just yesterday, one body part was found under two crossed logs.|$|E

2500|$|Children of Bodom's {{first world}} tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E
