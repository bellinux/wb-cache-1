50|$|The {{principle}} of acceleration, namely {{the idea that}} small changes in demand can produce large changes in output, is an older phenomenon which has been used since the early 1900s. Although Aftalion’s 1913 paper {{seems to be the}} first appearance of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>principle,</b> the essence of the accelerator framework could be found in a few other studies previously.|$|E
50|$|In {{his early}} work Studies in the Economics of Overhead Costs (1923), Clark {{developed}} {{his theory of}} the <b>acceleration</b> <b>principle,</b> that investment demand can fluctuate widely when consumer demand fluctuates. In this he anticipated key Keynesian theories of investment and business cycles. Clark also {{examined the relationship between}} firm size and production cost, demonstrating the way firms with high fixed costs could dramatically reduce average cost of production by expanding output, thus explaining the price leverage wielded by giant firms in capital-intensive industries. The work illustrated the critical importance of accurate cost information for those seeking the effective regulation of monopolistic or oligopolistic firms.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} an {{introduction}} and critique for Mr. PouI Winding's "The <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Principle</b> ". He started from micro-analysis, and explained retailer's inventory policy. To maximize the retailer's price margin, he showed optimum rate of inventory to sales, introducing the demand elasticity of price. Further {{he proceeded to}} <b>acceleration</b> <b>principle</b> of investment to fixed capital. He combined the cost curve of production and new investment from the enterpreneral view. According to the time shape of its product, new and re-investment rate will be changed to minimize the total cost. He analysed this problem in four cases. His analysis is brilliant, and succeeded to combine the micro analysis with <b>acceleration</b> <b>principle</b> in some degree. But we will point some problems. First, he avoided the aggregation problem, so that even if his analysis takes for the explanation of investment by certain enterprise, his theory can not explatn the macro-dynamic phenomena. Second, his analysis is pure theory, and it {{need to be examined}} by statistical data. If this procedure is not achieved, we will doubt its application to real flatuation of investment. Moreover his analysis assume that the change of demand to product is temporary, but in reality 'we meet the steady grrowth of demand very often. His theory does not exrplain the change of investment in such a case. Thirdly, his analysis for inventory is not combined to equip investment directly, but the planning of production will be established to realize the balance of these to investment...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{approaches}} to multi-agent reinforcement learning are either very limited or heuristic by nature. The main reason is: each agent's environment continually changes {{because the other}} agents keep changing. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms cannot properly deal with this. This paper, however, introduces a novel, general, sound method for multiple, reinforcement learning agents living a single life with limited computational resources in an unrestricted environment. The method properly takes into account that whatever some agent learns at some point may affect learning conditions for other agents or for itself at any later point.

40|$|AbstractConsidering {{two samples}} of Portuguese SMEs: 582 young SMEs and 1654 old SMEs, using the two-step {{estimation}} method and quantile regressions, the empirical evidence {{allows us to}} conclude that the determinants of investment have a different impact on young and old SMEs, depending on a firm’ level of investment. In the framework of <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Principle</b> and Neoclassical Theories, the determinants are relevant in explaining the investment of young and old SMEs with high levels of investment. The Growth Domestic Product, as the investment determinant of <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Principle</b> Theory, has a greater impact on the investment of young SMEs with high levels of investment. Sales, as the investment determinant of Neoclassical Theory, have greater impact on the investment of old SMEs with high levels of investment. Cash flow, as the investment determinant of Free Cash Flow Theory, is important in explaining the investment of young and old SMEs with low levels of investment. However, cash flow has greater impact on the investment of young SMEs with low levels of investment.

40|$|Interplanet and {{interstellar}} travels require long-term propulsion of spacecrafts, {{whereas the}} conventional schemes of propulsion {{are limited by}} the velocity of the ejected mass. In this study, alpha particles released by nuclear decay are considered as a potential solution for long-time <b>acceleration.</b> The <b>principle</b> of near-light-speed particle propulsion (NcPP) was elucidated and the stopping and range of ions in matter (SRIM) was Used to predict theoretical accelerations. The results show that NcPP by means of alpha decay is feasible for long-term spacecraft propulsion and posture adjustment in space. A practical NcPP sail can achieve a speed > 150 km/s and reach the brink {{of the solar system}} faster than a mass equivalent solar sail. Finally, to significantly improve the NcPP sail, the hypothesis of stimulated acceleration of nuclear decay (SAND) was proposed, which may shorten the travel time to Mars to within 20 days.
