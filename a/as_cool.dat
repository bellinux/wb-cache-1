5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

The climate was most likely <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> as or cooler than it is at Melaleuca now (an average yearly temperature of 11.5C, a average temperature of the coldest month of 4.5°C, a mean maximum temperature of the warmest month of 20°C), and possibly wetter, over 2400 mm annually.|$|E
25|$|Other {{fast food}} {{restaurants}} like Taco Bell have previously employed a similar strategy. In 2010, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) introduced the Double Down as an April Fools' Day joke. In 2012, Taco Bell, {{which is owned}} by Yum! Brands, introduced the Doritos Locos Tacos whose taco shell is composed of the Doritos chip. Offshoots followed <b>as</b> <b>Cool</b> Ranch, Nacho Cheese and Fiery Doritos. Consumerists Laura Northrup compared them to 7-Eleven's Doritos Loaded and Hostess Brands's deep-fried Twinkies sold at participating Walmart locations.|$|E

Although the summer months do see a relatively small amount of precipitation, {{the vast majority of}} it comes during the winter months <b>as</b> <b>cool,</b> moist air flows from the Pacific Ocean over the much colder B.C. coast. Despite its location on the relatively dryer east side of Vancouver Island, the resulting weak rain shadow is not enough to keep the city dry.|$|E
25|$|Walter: {{played by}} Ralph Bruneau, {{he is an}} air traffic controller. Though he envisions himself <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> and {{collected}} he is generally hyperactive and easily distracted. He acts overly friendly towards both Joe and Brian, both of whom find him highly irritating. In season 4, Walter gets married; though he doesn't appear on-screen anymore after that, he continues to be mentioned frequently. He takes a temporary leave of absence in Season 6 to have eye surgery to correct a double vision problem. In the final episode, {{he is said to}} be cheating on his wife.|$|E
25|$|Canada has {{a diverse}} climate. The climate varies from {{temperate}} {{on the west}} coast of British Columbia to a subarctic climate in the north. Extreme northern Canada can have snow for most of the year with a Polar climate. Landlocked areas tend to have a warm summer continental climate zone with the exception of Southwestern Ontario which has a hot summer humid continental climate. Parts of Western Canada have a semi-arid climate, and parts of Vancouver Island can even be classified <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> summer Mediterranean climate. Temperature extremes in Canada range from 45.0°C (113°F) in Midale and Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan on July 5, 1937 to −63.0°C (−81.4°F) in Snag, Yukon on Monday, February 3, 1947.|$|E

25|$|Haiyan, {{with its}} core {{disrupted}} by {{interaction with the}} Philippines, emerged over the South China Sea late on November 8. Environmental conditions ahead of the storm soon became less favorable, <b>as</b> <b>cool</b> stable air began wrapping into {{the western side of}} the circulation. Continuing across the South China Sea, Haiyan turned more northwesterly late on November 9 and through November 10 as it moved around the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge previously steering it westward. Rapid weakening ensued as Haiyan approached its final landfall in Vietnam, ultimately striking the country near Haiphong around 2100 UTC as a severe tropical storm. Once onshore, the storm quickly diminished and was last noted as it dissipated over Guangxi Province, China, on November 11.|$|E
