5|$|CAPS {{entreprise}} and Pathscale {{are also}} coordinating {{their effort to}} make hybrid multi-core parallel programming (HMPP) directives an open standard called OpenHMPP. The OpenHMPP directive-based programming model offers a syntax to efficiently offload computations on hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to/from the hardware memory. OpenHMPP directives describe remote procedure call (RPC) on an accelerator device (e.g. GPU) or more generally a set of cores. The directives <b>annotate</b> C or Fortran codes to describe two sets of functionalities: the offloading of procedures (denoted codelets) onto a remote device and the optimization of data transfers between the CPU main memory and the accelerator memory.|$|E

His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and <b>annotate</b> it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E

Two corpora, <b>annotated</b> with entities and relations, and containing a number of multiply <b>annotated</b> documents, are used to train named entity recognition and relation extraction systems. Several methods of automatically combining the multiple annotations to produce a single annotation are compared, but none produces better results than simply picking one of the <b>annotated</b> versions at random. It is also shown that adding extra singly <b>annotated</b> documents produces faster performance gains than adding extra multiply <b>annotated</b> documents. ...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the problem}} of {{mutation}} saturation in ancient molecular sequences, there is great interest in inferring phylogenies from higher-order types of molecular data that change more slowly, such as genomic organization and the secondary and tertiary structures of ribosomal RNA and proteins. In this paper, we dene edit distances based on two representations of RNA secondary structure, arc annota-tion and hierarchical string annotation, and give algorithms for computing these distances on pairs of <b>annotated</b> sequences, aligning pairs of <b>annotated</b> sequences, and computing 3 -median <b>annotated</b> sequences from triples of <b>annotated</b> sequences. The 3 -median algorithms {{can be used as}} part of a well-known iterative heuristic for inferring phylogenies.
