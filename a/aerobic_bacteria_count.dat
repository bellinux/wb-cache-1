This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of food handlers regarding food safety and hygienic practices in addition to assess the level of microbiological hygiene indicators. A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 16 slaughterhouses and 31 markets in Chiang Mai province. Overall 32 slaughterhouse workers and 51 pork sellers were assessed to determine their KAP by questionnaires including likert-scales. Microbiological hygiene indicators were determined by conventional cultural methods. KAP results indicated a high level of knowledge (80 to 100 %) concerning cross contamination, personal hygiene and time-temperature control but hold medium level (50 to 75 %) for foodborne illness. Eighty-five percent of food handlers knew that good personal hygiene could prevent foodborne disease. Identified gaps between attitudes and practices indicated that some hygiene measures are inappropriate {{in the context of their}} practical implementation and some of these hygiene practices are not in accordance with their socioeconomic status. There were variations of knowledge between slaughterhouse workers and sellers. Mean of <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> from carcass swabs at slaughterhouses and pork samples at markets were 3. 09 ± 1. 34 log 10 cfu/cm 2 and 5. 50 ± 0. 39 log 10 cfu/g. respectively.

40|$|Background: {{intestinal}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} (IBO) {{is related to}} small bowel motility and {{has been involved in}} the pathogenesis of bacterial translocation (BT) in experimental models, and both overgrowing gut flora and translocating bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes are common features in cirrhosis. Objectives: the aims of this study were to analyze cecal aero-bic bacteria and intestinal transit in cirrhotic rats, and their rela-tionship with BT, evaluating the role of intestinal bacterial over-growth and small bowel dismotility in the development of BT in experimental cirrhosis. Material and methods: we included twenty-seven male Sprague-Dawley rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis without ascites and ten controls. Cultures of mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), peripheral and portal blood, liver, spleen and cecal samples were carried out. Small intestinal transit was determined in ten cirrhotic rats and in ten control rats. Results: the prevalence of bacterial translocation was 56 %. Total cecal <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> was significantly higher in cir-rhotic rats than in control rats (p < 0. 001). Cirrhotic rats with translocated bacteria had higher total aerobic intestinal counts than culture-negative MLN bacteria (p < 0. 05). The prevalence of total intestinal bacterial overgrowth in cirrhotic animals was 67 %, and 0 % in control animals (p < 0. 001). According to BT, total IBO was more frequent in cirrhotic rats with BT versus those without BT (93 vs. 33 %) (p < 0. 001). Of the translocating bacte-ria, 95. 6 % were found to be overgrown in the cecum. The small-intestinal transit was slower in cirrhotic rats (60. 5 ± 12. 7 cm vs. 81. 2 ± 5. 7 cm) than in control animals (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: these results suggest that the increase of intesti-nal aerobic bacteria in experimental cirrhosis is associated with translocation. In addition, IBO is frequent in cirrhotic rats, and is supposed {{to play an important role}} in the development of BT. Im-paired motility of the small intestine is a common feature in cir-rhosis and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IBO. Key words: Intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Bacterial transloca-tion.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether ultraviolet light treatment of milk could be used in adjunct with pasteurization and to determine whether the microbial count in bulk tank raw milk was sufficient enough to receive significant results. Samples were collected from a bulk tank filled with 1600 gallons of raw Holstein and Jersey milk from the Cal Poly Dairy throughout the course of a week. Control (library) samples were also taken from the raw milk tank and stored without air or agitation for comparison. These samples were plated each day and examined 24 and 48 hours after preliminary plating to determine microbial load. The milk was then processed using extreme levels of UV light treatment in addition to pasteurization and traditional pasteurization controls in order to set boundaries for more specific testing. Samples were taken after each treatment stage for every process to determine microbial kill efficiency of each method. After treatment the finished product was bagged for final product evaluation. Bulk tank milk <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> increased over the course of the week as compared to library samples without air space and agitation; therefore it seems as if the bulk tank does not need to be inoculated with bacteria in order to gain significant results. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and coliform <b>counts</b> were greatly reduced in the various combinations of pasteurization and UV light treatment.

C. stepdown ration, there were no differences in percent eviscerated yield, percent change in weight after curing or percent cooked yield. Higher concentrations of salt and nitrite were found in the thigh meat than the breast meat. The low energy diet birds had the largest amount of salt and nitrite in the breast when compared to the high energy and step down diet. Smaller birds, while having no significant differences in weight after curing, were found to have a larger concentration of salt and better color development when compared to larger birds for the same duration of cure. Adequate cure ingredient absorption was obtained with 16 to 32 hours of curing by soaking with broiler chickens. However, brine injection in thickly muscled areas of medium to large turkeys seemed to be required. Cooking to an internal temperature of 76 ° C. gave better cooked yields than cooking to 79 ° C. (78. 6 % vs. 70. 5 %). Total <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> of smoked turkey averaged 2. 5 x 103 /cm. 2 after 3 weeks storage and 5. 5 x 106 /cm. 2 after 6 weeks...|$|R
40|$|In Nigeria, {{inadequate}} {{supply of}} pipe borne {{water is a}} major concern; hence many homes have wells {{as a source of}} water for household uses. The groundwater of forty wells in Agbowo community was assessed for Total <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Bacteria</b> <b>Counts</b> (TABC) and Total Coliform Counts (TCC). The location and distances of wells from septic tanks were determined using the Global Positioning System (GPS) device and a tape rule respectively. All the wells sampled had high TABC (4. 76 ± 1. 41 log CFU/mL) and TCC (2. 2 9 ± 0. 67 log CFU/mL) counts which exceeded the international standard of 0 per 100 mL of potable water. There {{were no significant differences in}} the bacterial counts between covered and uncovered wells (p> 0. 05). The mean distance (8. 93 ± 3. 61 m) of wells from the septic tanks was below the limit (15. 24 m or 50 ft) set by United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). TABC increased with a decrease in distance between the wells and septic tanks though not significant (p< 0. 05). A very weak positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 021) ensued between the distance from septic tank and CC, while a weak negative correlation (r 2 = ‒ 0. 261) was obtained between the TCC and TABC. This study accentuates the need to set standards for the siting of wells from septic tanks while considering all possible sources of well contamination as well as treatment of ground water before use...|$|R
40|$|In this study, twenty {{demijohn}} {{drinking water}} samples (5 different brands and 4 different samples from every brand) sold in Tekirdağ city of Turkey, were analyzed {{to determine their}} microbiological quality. Microbiological analysis of demijohn drinking water samples performed in three stages; 1 st: just after delivery of water to consumer, 2 nd: after plugging re-usable water pump, and 3 rd: from remainder water {{at the bottom of}} demijohn. Microbial contamination risks were determined these stages. Average total <b>aerobic</b> mesophilic <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> in water samples were determined as 8, 36 x 101 cfu/ml. By plugging pump, this value increased to a average 3. 43 x 103 cfu/ml. At the begining coliforms were not detected in any water samples. However, coliforms were determined in 60 percent of samples between 15 - 46 MPN/ml in the samples after using pump. Although microbiologic quality of demijohn waters were at the safety limits, microbial contamination increased due to the consumption period, pump hygiene and usage conditions during the consumption period...|$|R
40|$|Dry-cured pork neck {{samples were}} stored at 10 °C for 90 days under vacuum {{packaging}} (VP) or modified atmosphere packaging (MAP; 25 % CO 2 + 75 % N 2) conditions.

40|$|Under anoxic conditions, the Escherichia coli {{oxygen sensor}} FNR (fumarate nitrate reductase regulator) {{is in the}} active state and {{contains}} a [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster. Oxygen converts [4 Fe- 4 S]FNR to inactive [2 Fe- 2 S]FNR. After prolonged exposure to air in vitro, apoFNR lacking a Fe-S cluster is formed. ApoFNR can be differentiated from Fe-S-containing forms by the accessibility of the five Cys thiol residues, four of which serve as ligands for the Fe-S cluster. The presence of apoFNR in aerobically and anaerobically grown E. coli was analyzed in situ using thiol reagents. In anaerobically and aerobically grown cells, the membrane-permeable monobromobimane labeled one to two and four Cys residues, respectively; the same labeling pattern was found with impermeable thiol reagents after cell permeabilization. Alkylation of FNR in <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and <b>counting</b> the labeled residues by mass spectrometry showed a form of FNR with five accessible Cys residues, corresponding to apoFNR with all Cys residues in the thiol state. Therefore, aerobically growing cells contain apoFNR, whereas {{a significant amount of}} Fe-S-containing FNR was not detected under these conditions. Exposure of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen caused conversion of Fe-S-containing FNR to apoFNR within 6 min. ApoFNR from <b>aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> contained no disulfide, in contrast to apoFNR formed in vitro by air inactivation, and all Cys residues were in the thiol form...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the physico - chemical and microbiological parameters of a brewery effluent and its receiving stream in Ibadan, located in south-west of Nigeria from the month of December 1993 to June 1994. Results obtained indicated that brew house effluent had a higher pH (5. 2) than the receiving stream pH (4. 8), lower levels of chloride ions, dissolved oxygen, total solids, conductivity and BODs than its receiving stream. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> from sample A (brewery effluent) ranged from 180 x 103 cfu/ml to 150 x 103 cfu/ml and its receiving stream from 147 x 103 cfu/ml to 137 x 103, while the fungi counts from 1. 3 x 104 to 1. 1 x 104 and 5. 7 x 104 to 4. 5 x 104 respectively. Total coliform counts ranged from 2. 0 x 10 MPN/ 100 to 7. 0 x 10 MPN/ 100 and 2400 x 10 MPN/ 100 for sample A and B respectively. Microorganism isolated include Pseudomomonas sp, Acetobacter sp., Flavobacterium sp, and Lactobacillus sp, Aspergillus niger, Curvularia sp, Alternaria sp for sample A, while Bacillus sp, Pseudomonas sp Escherichia coli, Fusarium sp, Penicillum sp 1, Penicillium sp 2, and Aspergillus sp were isolates from sample B. There {{was no significant difference between}} the values of physico-chemical of the two samples at P< 0. 05. Results obtained indicated that the pH between 4. 8 and 5. 8 obtained coupled with objectionable odour for the two water samples were below the permissible level of pH values for stream water or natural water by World Health Organization (WHO) which is neutral pH of 7. 0 or slightly alkaline pH 8 and the water must be colourless and odourless. The acidity level of these samples is an indication of water pollution in these environments due to an ineffective treatment of the brewery effluent and the proliferation of fungi isolates isolated in this study. These results clearly indicate that the brewery treated effluents in Ibadan and its receiving stream is an excellent medium for fungal growth and could also be used as a fertilizer with some modifications...|$|R

Most probable number method was employed for presumptive coliform count {{and out of the}} 10 samples analyzed, 8 samples had less than 10 MPN/ml coliform which indicated that they were satisfactory and safe for consumption while the remaining two (2) samples had MPN/ml coliform greater than 10, indicating that they are unsatisfactory and may constitute health hazard. Confirmatory and completed test also confirmed the presence of E. coli and Klebsiella species. The pH of the samples determined ranges from 3. 61 to 4. 01, the average titratable acidity and their percentage occurrence in the samples were also calculated. Staphylococcus species (100 %), Escherichia species(90 %), Streptococcus species(80 %), Bacillus species (40 %) and Klebsiella species(10 %) were isolated in the nono samples. Methylene blue reduction test classified the nono into good (C, D, E, F), Fair (A,B,I,J) and Poor (G,H).

40|$|O. Obire, et al. ABSTRACT: The {{impact of}} National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria outfall {{effluent}} on the physicochemistry and bacteriology of Okrika creek was investigated during the sampling period from May to December, 1998. The National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria outfall effluent, the Okrika creek {{water and the}} Ikpukulubie creek (control) water samples were collected. The physico-chemical parameters analyzed for all the samples included temperature, pH, total chloride, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, free ammonia, total phosphate, urea, zinc and iron, while the bacteriological determinations were total culturable <b>aerobic</b> heterotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> and identification of representative isolates. The Okrika creek recorded higher concentrations for all the physico-chemical parameters and bacteria load than the control creek. The higher values of pH, Free NH 3, urea, TDS and the conductivity of the National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria outfall effluent above the FEPA standards reflect the poor effluent quality generated by National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria. The bacteria species isolated from the samples include Aerococcus viridans, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus. In general, the investigation revealed {{that there was an}} extremely adverse impact on the physico-chemical and bacteriological water quality characteristics of the Okrika creek {{as a result of the}} discharge of poor quality effluent from National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria operations...|$|R
