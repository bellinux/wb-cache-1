5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E

In addition, human face detection, recognition and identification techniques have numerous applications such <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> based systems and real-time video systems for surveillance and security, etc. In this study, we suggest an algorithm for face detection from 2 D color images using the quad-tree deformable template matching method. The deformable template matching method is used to find the face area and locate facial features. In {{order to make the}} algorithm insensitive to luminance, we convert the conventional RGB coordinates into the normalized CIE coordinates. The face detection procedure can speed-up under limited conditions and we also modify the algorithm for fast detection using the quad-tree hierarchical template of the face. The quad-tree template can easily and quickly sizable and the comparison between the template and the image is weighted according to the deviation of color. The template comparison results with the plain texture template and the quad-tree template are shown in this study...|$|E

In order to improve test design both in structure and appearance, {{it is necessary to}} demonstrate the mechanism that brings errors to learners. This paper aims to reveal why error occurs and how human makes mistakes through considering examinations or paper tests in English class. To inspect this issue, 119 1 st graders in Nagaoka National College of Technology were examined using their TOEIC-Bridge score, 1 st mid-term and final examination in 2008. According to the result shown in the bubble chart, it developed that unsuitability of test planning, direction for examiners and form design can bring errors besides learners' faults and shortage of preparation. Not only examiners, the user of a test consists of also researchers, makers, providers, markers, utilizers, and managers.

Hardware and software requirements as well <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> components {{all contribute to}} or detract from the overall dependability of a system. Assigning a `dependability number' to a system is becoming increasingly subjective due to the confluence of these three areas.

In this paper we shall present an approach that attempts to detect these dependability bottlenecks within embedded systems and investigate its ability to represent users' ability to interact with partially failed systems. We propose a graph-based approach that is partially based on composing and extending Unified Modeling Language (UML) standards. This `mission graph' concept is meant to take advantage of the user's perspective to help system designers understand what is really going on in complex systems. We apply this approach to an example embedded system, and examine the experimental results to determine the feasibility of the proposed approach. Finally, the mission graph approach is used to further investigate the workaround concept and how it applies to users attempting to accomplish their goals even in the face of component failures...|$|E
40|$|The {{arts and}} {{humanities}} are facing up to {{a whole range of}} challenges not least of which is qualifying what we mean by the term "humanness" in advanced cross-disciplinary, scientific and technological research contexts. This keynote paper explored notions of "going beyond humanness" to address current boundary problems and challenges confronting artists and designers when working in contexts associated with the new wireless media landscape, the modification of biological matter through nanotechnology and within artificial intelligence and synthetic biology contexts. The talk included screens excerpts and conceptual frame-working of recent video artworks 'Black Lace' and 'Intra-actions and Reconfigurings' - produced on an EPRSC (PIA) funded residency at the School of Medicine, University of Southampton. In addition to the keynote paper, a drawing workshop explored notions of direct sensory perception, embodiment and human enhancement. The workshop took the form of a collective rule based drawing exercise-exploring anomalies of conscious perception. The reflective observational drawing sessions formed the basis of a conversational seminar and a discussion panel.
