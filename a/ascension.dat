The text for the <b>Ascension</b> Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others.

5|$|Two extinct flightless {{species of}} rail were {{at one time}} placed in the genus Atlantisia with the Inaccessible Island rail. The <b>Ascension</b> crake (Mundia elpenor) and the Saint Helena {{swamphen}} (Aphanocrex podarces) were once considered congeners of A. rogersi. The <b>Ascension</b> crake disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist Peter Mundy in 1656. The Saint Helena swamphen disappeared before 1600 {{and has never been}} encountered alive by scientists. In 1973 Olson synonymised the genus Aphanocrex with the genus Atlantisia, and described the <b>Ascension</b> crake as being congeneric. Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with A. podarces probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus Mundia was erected and the Saint Helena swamphen moved back to Aphanocrex, leaving the Inaccessible Island rail the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Both the <b>Ascension</b> crake and the Saint Helena swamphen became extinct due to predation by introduced species, mainly cats and rats.|$|E
