40|$|This thesis investigates Tom Stoppard s {{inclusion}} {{of music and}} other aural effects (including juxtaposed silence) in his stage plays from 1967 to 2015. The analysis includes both diegetic and non-diegetic aural elements (the former being where aural elements are fixed within the narrative, and the latter being a form of commentary to the narrative, available to the audience {{but not to the}} on-stage characters). With particular focus on Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Travesties, Arcadia and Rock n Roll the thesis examines the way aural elements highlight themes, perform as temporal and geo-physical markers and define structure. Furthermore, the thesis scrutinizes resonant and dissonant choices of music and other aural effects and explores the <b>audience</b> <b>s</b> emotional reception in addition to their intellectual response to the spoken text and on-stage action. The analysis of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead concentrates on the author s inter-textual referencing of music from Hamlet as a structural and thematic device. Further comparison of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead with Travesties examines how aural elements underscore a sense of artifice in keeping with the tenets of the Theatre of the Absurd. In the case of Travesties, the thesis also discusses the additional effects of music and other aural effects on the development and audience reception of characters. The third play, Arcadia, exemplifies the use of off-stage sound effects as thematic signalers. In addition, the thesis proposes that aural elements in Arcadia blur temporal boundaries, thus conflating the play s two time periods. In the case of Rock n Roll, in which music is used as a chronological marker, the thesis demonstrates how aural elements and, especially, music juxtaposed with silence create receptive dissonance. Building on Stoppard s acknowledged mastery of the spoken word in performance literature, this thesis seeks to fill a perceived gap in the analysis of the theatre plays of Stoppard and show the multiple ways sound and silence elicit and expand an <b>audience</b> <b>s</b> response, and confirm and/or contradict their expectations...|$|R

Speaking well in public is apparently a birthright for a blessed few, but for many of us and not just novices it can be a nerve-racking event. Important too, because making speeches and presentations in public is becoming more frequent, as openness, participation and democracy grow and flourish. With the intensity and volume - in all senses - of public debate growing, it is essential for stakeholders in agricultural communities in ACP countries to stand up and be heard and heeded, and no longer just stand up and be counted. In particular, in the emerging pattern of multi-party stakeholder dialogues, where governments, private sector and non-governmental and civil society bodies come together, the positions of farmers organisations, women s groups and innovators need to be presented properly. These have been the key issues handled in a recent series of training seminars organised by CTA in Cape Verde in September, and in Mali, Namibia and Uganda in November 2000. The first seminar was for 20 women leaders of farmers groups and NGOs in the Portuguese-speaking countries of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique and São Tomé e Principe. Co-organised by CTA and CFA-INIDA, the Cape Verdian agricultural training centre, the week-long seminar covered the art of advocacy in a changing environment, public speaking, and interviews with radio and television. Similar sessions are planned in 2001 in the Central African Republic, Jamaica, Madagascar and Nigeria.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{establish}} how the fifth-century audience’s perception of Aeschylean tragedy {{was influenced by}} their prior knowledge of the myths on which the dramas were based. Thus we study references to these myths in earlier epic and lyric sources {{in an attempt to}} detect borrowings and deviations from the earlier material {{on the part of the}} poet. The earliest surviving tragedy, the Persae, has a historical basis and so mythical knowledge is supplanted by the audience's own first-hand experience of the recent war. We see how foreknowledge of the Greek victory at Salamis will prove a deep influence on the <b>audience</b> <b>s</b> perception of the presentation of the enemy court and how Aeschylus presents the Persians as being utterly devastated by the defeat. Likewise an appreciation of the Seven Against Thebes is greatly enhanced if we remember that from the very beginning of the drama the audience were anticipating the double fratricide from their knowledge of this events in previous versions of the myth. During the Supplices, the audience would have suspected that not only would the Argives accept the supplication of the Danaids but also that these helpless girls would shortly murder their bridegrooms on their wedding-night, and Aeschylus includes many dark hints at this future event during the course of his play. Our study of the myth of Agamemnon will enable us to appreciate the exploitation of audience expectation throughout the Oresteia and their foreknowledge that murder is plotted against Agamemnon on his return and that Orestes will return to exact vengeance proves vital to the tragic effect. In addition we detect certain areas in which Aeschylus may diverge from his inherited material, such as his presentation of Clytemnestra as the sole unaided killer of her husband and his inclusion of a trial of Orestes before the court of the Areopagus. Thus it is hoped that by considering the mythical knowledge shared by both Aeschylus and his audience we are able to gain a fuller appreciation of the effects sought by the poet in the fifth-century theatre...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Discourses about pornography have grown since the diffusion of print communication and the first erotic representations. In the 80 s, the so-called sex wars involved intense debates about pornography s liberating or objectifying nature, while in the 90 s, the emergence of porn studies offered a more balanced and contextualized analysis of pornography, highlighting the need for researchers to also focus on the <b>audience</b> <b>s</b> understanding of the experience. Although the majority of {{research in this field}} has focused on adults, much of the concern relates to children. To date, however, most of the research relating to children has focused on effects and on potential harm. Audience researchers in Cultural Studies have examined how children understand representations of sex, love and romance, but only in relation to mainstream media. Yet when it comes to pornography in particular, the discussion is to a great extent based on adults assumptions about what is potentially harmful for children. My aim is to approach children s use and interpretation of sexual content in the media through an audience reception approach. In a sense, this brackets off the question of possible risk or harm, in favour of focusing {{on the nature of the}} experience itself. My research is based on interviews conducted with young adults (18 - 22 years old) thinking retrospectively about their experiences with sexual content in childhood and early teenage life. Despite the number of disadvantages this approach may have, this thesis aims to focus on how participants themselves report and account for their actual experiences. Using a basic thematic coding, I consider the self-reported nature and context of young people s experiences. Next, I focus on the discourses used to interpret and contextualize their experiences. Finally, through a narrative approach I examine their constructions of identities in talking about sexuality. In these ways, this thesis wishes to offer new insights into the topic through an audience reception approach that until now has been largely missing from the academic agenda...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{production}} of Ein Volksfeind created in 2012 by Thomas Ostermeier in the Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin. A stage adaptation of Hernik Ibsen s En folkefiende made by Florian Borchmeyer presents an altered version of the play focused on contemporary western society with the overrule of market and consumer values replacing the values of truth and honesty. However, {{it is not the}} topic of the production that is at most interest, but its aesthetics. The speech of Doctor Stockmann is followed by the discussion with the spectators who are asked to reflect on the situation within the story line and compare it to their country s socio-political reality. The audience thereby finds itself between fiction and reality, between illusion and the need to act, between spectatorship and participation. Such in-between state, or liminal state, to borrow the term often used in ritual and theatre studies, presents interesting examples of <b>audience</b> <b>s</b> behaviour in theatre. Having watched Ein Volksfeind in three cities, Berlin, Oslo, and Moscow, I am comparing my three experiences in order to illustrate the variety of receptions within the same production and suggest possible explanations for it. Moreover, I believe that the question of spectatorship is closely linked to the discourse on political and aesthetical and can shed light on our understanding of the politics of performance. In the Introduction to the thesis I present an overview on how the role of spectator in theatre and the notion of political theatre developed. In addition, this section introduces the method of performance analysis used in my thesis, based on the works of Christopher Balme and Erika Fischer-Lichte. The next section contains production analysis of Ein Volksfeind and three performance analyses describing my experience as a spectator in Berlin, Oslo, and Moscow, with the use of phenomenological and semiotic approaches. ´ The discussion and comparison of the three performances is the subject of the last section. It describes the peculiarities of theatre event, which can be found in works of Max Herrmann and Erika Fischer-Lichte. Moreover, this section concerns itself with developing a tool for determining the politics of performance on the basis of Jacques Rancière s theory of political and aesthetical and Gareth White s method of studying participatory theatre. This research is intended to be a useful resource for anyone interested in the special nature of performance and ways of analysing it, as well as those concerned with the question of politics and its relation to arts and aesthetics...|$|R
