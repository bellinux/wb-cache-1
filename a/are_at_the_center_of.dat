5|$|The Lucy Stone Home Site {{is owned}} and managed by The Trustees of Reservations, a {{non-profit}} land conservation and historic preservation {{organization dedicated to}} preserving natural and historic places in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The site includes 61 acres of forested land {{on the side of}} Coys Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. Although the farmhouse in which Stone was born and married burned to the ground in 1950, its ruins <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the property. At the time of Stone’s wedding, both her parents and a married brother and his family lived in the two-and-one-half-story house, and family descendants continued to live there until 1936. In 1915, a pilgrimage of suffragists placed a memorial tablet on the house, which read: “This house was the birthplace of Lucy Stone, pioneer advocate of equal rights for women. Born August 13, 1818. Married May 1, 1855, died October 18, 1893. In grateful memory Massachusetts suffragists placed this tablet August 13, 1915.” That tablet, severely damaged but surviving the 1950 fire, is now in the Quaboag Historical Society Museum. After the fire, the surrounding farmland was abandoned and left to revert to forest, and it is now used for hunting and harvesting timber. The Trustees acquired the home site in 2002 and have been maintaining the property ever since.|$|E
