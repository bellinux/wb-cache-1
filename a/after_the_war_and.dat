From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia.

5|$|By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II. The {{resulting}} difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared {{they might not be}} able to resume operations easily <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, then they should also.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> as such {{it was not until}} 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E

5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|Haakon Steen Lie (22 September 1905 – 25 May 2009) was a Norwegian {{politician}} {{who served as}} party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party from 1945 to 1969.
