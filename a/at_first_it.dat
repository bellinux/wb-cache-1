5|$|Between 1906 and 1908, the Pentecostal message {{had spread}} among Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA) churches and conferences. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>it</b> was greeted {{positively}} by the CMA leadership, but {{the doctrine of}} initial evidence divided the organization.

Michael spoke both French and English fluently. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>it</b> seemed they would marry; however, the Orthodox Church prohibited the marriage of first cousins, and Michael's father and Beatrice's mother were siblings. Nicholas refused to permit the marriage and, to Michael's and Beatrice's mutual dismay, their romance ended.|$|E
5|$|In January 1531, Campeggio was {{dismissed}} as cardinal protector, {{although it did}} not become public knowledge until May. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>it</b> was unclear whether Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) {{in the event that}} Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E

In 2011, a transit of the planet was confirmed, allowing scientists to calculate its density. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>it</b> was suspected to be a water planet. As initial observations showed no hydrogen in its Lyman-alpha signature during transit, Ehrenreich speculated that its volatile materials might be carbon dioxide instead of water or hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|The DeKalb County Circuit Court {{came into}} {{existence}} in June 1839 when the first session of court met in Sycamore's first courthouse building, though the building was somewhat incomplete. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>it</b> seemed, that Sycamore {{might not be the}} location of the DeKalb County Courthouse; other towns were vying for the county seat title. A now defunct town called Brush Point was the choice of a Dr. Henry Madden and Rufus Colton would have preferred Coltonville, where he made his home.|$|E
5|$|Although Nash was {{responsible}} for the street's general development, some individual buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and Sir John Soane, amongst others. By 1819, the Crown were receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>it</b> was called New Street and became a dividing line between Soho, which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west. Carlton House did not last long following completion of the works and was demolished in 1829, to be replaced by Carlton House Terrace, also designed by Nash.|$|E
5|$|Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S {{was founded}} on 26 March 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen through his {{shipping}} company Braathens Rederi. Share capital was , plus loans from the shipping company. Braathens had made good money during World War II with the participation in the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission, and received permission to use US$1 million to purchase aircraft. The idea to start an airline had occurred to Braathen in 1936, when the ship Brajara had engine trouble while en route to Japan. The Japanese shipyards could not guarantee that they could repair the ship, and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>it</b> was considered whether the ship should be towed to Europe for repairs. The solution chosen was instead to have the necessary piece made in Amsterdam and flown by KLM. Braathen wanted to have an airline that {{would be able to}} fly crew and supplies to his and other ships throughout the world—primarily in the Far East.|$|E

5|$|George IV {{spent most}} of his later reign in {{seclusion}} at Windsor Castle, but he continued to intervene in politics. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>it</b> was believed that he would support Catholic emancipation, as he had proposed a Catholic Emancipation Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic emancipation in public. Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures. The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister Lord Liverpool so strong, that Catholic emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Lord Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory George Canning. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration to the effect that his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.|$|E

The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E

5|$|Parcells {{first year}} proved difficult. In {{his first major}} {{decision}} as head coach, he decided to bench Simms in favor of Brunner {{based on what he}} had done in the 1981 season after Simms was injured. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>it</b> appeared that Parcells' decision was justified, especially after a 27–3 victory over the Green Bay Packers gave the Giants a 2–2 record after 4 games. However, the Giants collapsed from there. The team went winless in their next seven games, losing six and garnering a tie with the St. Louis Cardinals, before defeating the Philadelphia Eagles to end the streak. The Giants then lost their remaining games to finish with a 3-12-1 record, including a 1-6-1 division record and a 1-7 home record (their only win was the game against the Packers; they defeated the Eagles at Veterans Stadium and their first win came at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium against the Falcons). Brunner had a subpar season, completing just 49.2% of his passes and throwing 9 touchdowns against 22 interceptions.|$|E

However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E
5|$|When the Second Boer War {{broke out}} in 1899, {{many members of the}} mounted police wanted to {{volunteer}} to serve in South Africa, motivated by sympathy for the British imperial cause and the strong military tradition within the force. Indeed, Commissioner Herchmer had proposed sending a force of 350 men to join the Sudan campaign in 1896, but was turned down by his superiors. Although there was public enthusiasm for a Canadian military response, <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>it</b> appeared that only a minimal deployment would be needed, and it was only after several British defeats that an offer of a more substantive force was welcomed by London. The Canadian government turned to the mounted police as their main source for experienced mounted soldiers, and members were given leave from the force for the duration of their service. Combined with the pressures of maintaining the commitments in the Yukon, this reduced the number of the police in the remaining territories to only 682 men by 1900.|$|E
