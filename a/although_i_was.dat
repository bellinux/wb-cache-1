25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was directed by}} Doug Nichol and filmed in Sardinia from 5-8 July 1999. Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E

500|$|After two years, Crane left Pennington for Claverack College, a quasi-military school. He later {{looked back}} on his time at Claverack as [...] "the happiest period of my life <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not aware of it." [...] A classmate remembered him as a highly literate but erratic student, lucky to pass {{examinations}} in math and science, and yet [...] "far in advance of his fellow students in his knowledge of History and Literature", his favorite subjects. While he held an impressive record on the drill field and baseball diamond, Crane generally did not excel in the classroom. Not having a middle name, as was customary among other students, he took to signing his name [...] "Stephen T. Crane" [...] in order [...] "to win recognition as a regular fellow". Crane was seen as friendly, but also moody and rebellious. He sometimes skipped class in order to play baseball, {{a game in which}} he starred as catcher. He was also greatly interested in the school's military training program. He rose rapidly in the ranks of the student battalion. One classmate described him as [...] "indeed physically attractive without being handsome", but he was aloof, reserved and not generally popular at Claverack. [...] Although academically weak, Crane gained experience at Claverack that provided background (and likely some anecdotes from the Civil War veterans on the staff) that proved useful when he came to write The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E
500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of fear. I however was convinced that I was going to forget everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E

I thought that wisdom's only function was to purge the out-wanderings of the heart and return it to a state of stillness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Political {{messages}} were also occasionally {{displayed in the}} backgrounds of scenes, as graffiti or fluttering newspapers displaying politically charged headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, and homelessness. For his part, Norm Breyfogle believed that his role in producing the comic was merely that of artist, and so felt that his contribution to the comic's themes were minimal. Of them he expressed, [...] "(The series) was quite obviously subversive. But as an artist I was just drawing Alan’s stories. I wouldn’t say that I was being particularly subversive, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a bit when I put graffiti on the walls in the backgrounds.|$|E

[...] Taylor also claimed he had no regrets and [...] "no animosity toward any man," [...] but his autobiography included hints of bitterness in regard to his treatment as a competitor: [...] "I always played the game fairly and tried my hardest, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not always given a square deal or anything like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily {{influenced}} by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym.

[...] However, his official website biography claims that [...] "at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career".

At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E

[...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to eat what was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal.

2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. <b>although</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
