In the Canning area, 1,500people were left without power, while electricity was also lost in Annapolis Valley, Yarmouth, Truro, Westville, Amherst, and Stellarton. A woman required rescue by firemen after her van plunged into the swollen River Philip. In Maccan, a tractor trailer loaded with lumber went off the road.

5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of <b>a</b> <b>hardware</b> malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E

25|$|If {{the disks}} are {{connected}} to a RAID controller, it is most efficient to configure it as a HBA in JBOD mode (i.e. turn off RAID function). If <b>a</b> <b>hardware</b> RAID card is used, ZFS always detects all data corruption but cannot always repair data corruption because the hardware RAID card will interfere. Therefore, the recommendation is to not use <b>a</b> <b>hardware</b> RAID card, or to flash <b>a</b> <b>hardware</b> RAID card into JBOD/IT mode. For ZFS {{to be able to}} guarantee data integrity, it needs to either have access to a RAID set (so all data is copied to at least two disks), or if one single disk is used, ZFS needs to enable redundancy (copies) which duplicates the data on the same logical drive. Using ZFS copies is a good feature to use on notebooks and desktop computers, since the disks are large and it at least provides some limited redundancy with just a single drive.|$|E
