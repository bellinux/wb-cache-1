500|$|After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby {{returned}} {{to work for the}} Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a [...]255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was [...]284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a [...]281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. [...] "It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams", Doby said after being named White Sox manager.|$|E
2500|$|Recruited {{from the}} Christian Young Men's Society in 1931, Curcio was a tough, hard ruckman, who also played {{well in the}} back line. He was [...] for {{protecting}} his smaller teammates. A bass violinist, Curcio combined his musical talents with his football prowess, but stood {{out of the game}} in 1937 to concentrate on his music. Ever conscious of safegarding his hands to work the strings of the bass violin, he once told North Melbourne's Fred Fairweather, Hit me <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, but don't hurt my fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] said O'Hara to Trevor, as {{they faced}} one another, [...] "and hit <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like. It won't be any {{practice}} if you don't. I sha'n't mind being hit. It'll do me good for Aldershot. See?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want 'ee to {{come down}} to the owld shaft with me, an' when I give 'ee the ward cut away <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>thee</b> legs can spank to Balaswidden, an' fetch the lads that are theere to the owld shaft. They knaw what to do, but tell 'em to make so little noise as they can. Dost a hear, my son?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, try and hit {{me on the}} nose," [...] {{he would}} say, {{standing}} before them in an attitude of defence. [...] "Don't be afraid. Hit <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> can." ...|$|R
60|$|GAYNOR. Well, perhaps I {{can get the}} Society to pay {{half for}} your daughter--if you're really <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> up <b>as</b> <b>you</b> pretend. They're {{willing to do that}} where it seems necessary.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Harry!" [...] the lad said cheerfully; [...] "hit me <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, {{under the}} {{circumstances}} I feel that I cannot kick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Came in the car, didn't you? Go off for Irvine <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can drive. Drop {{somebody}} {{at my place}} to run back with a gun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get into my sleigh, {{and drive}} to Harper's <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can!" [...] he said. [...] "Curtis was there when I passed; bring him here at once!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not fond of it," [...] Jack said. [...] "I don't {{care about}} it, {{one way or}} the other. It doesn't hurt me; I am <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> nails, <b>you</b> see, so I don't think more about {{fighting}} than I do about eating my dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>You</b> are <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> iron. <b>You</b> {{have that}} {{pleasant}} outside manner {{that makes people}} think you're very gentle and yielding, but all the time you're like adamant. I would rather die than ask your forgiveness for anything, and you'd rather let me than give it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Put {{the soda}} into the cream, {{and when it}} 'fizzles,' as Demi says, stir it into the flour, and beat it up <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> can. Have your griddle hot, butter it well, and then fry away till I come back," [...] and Aunt Jo {{vanished}} also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, you {{can drive}} {{one of those big}} Siwash craft <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can this sloop; that is, so long as you keep the sea astern of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then row <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] replied Captain Langless. He was at {{one pair}} of oars while Arnold Baxter was at another. Dan sat in the bow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then supposing you leg it for camp just <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] {{continued}} the explorer. [...] "Tell the Esquimaux and Mr. Camdal {{to come as}} quickly as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard work. Some {{doctor told}} his patient that if he'd live on half-a-crown {{a day and}} earn it, he'd soon be well. I'm sure that the same {{prescription}} holds good for all maladies of the mind. You can't earn the half-crown a day, but <b>you</b> may work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> though <b>you</b> did." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was much}} honesty {{displayed}} on this occasion. The Squire, {{when he was}} thus instigated to persevere, {{did his best to}} describe the manner in which he had been rejected. His powers of description were not very great, but he did not conceal anything wilfully. [...] "She was <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> nails, <b>you</b> know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled {{down from}} the bank and said, 'My young friend, {{if you do not}} now, {{immediately}} and instantly, pull <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster' (and by this he meant the Crocodile) 'will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{to watch}} that ranch," [...] he said. [...] "But I'd like one of you to ride to town <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can and take a message for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Row, Tony, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can! The launch {{has just}} passed that ship, and has changed her course. I expect the captain has called their {{attention}} to us. It's a race now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There,' said Squeers, when he {{had quite}} done; 'rub away <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, you won't rub that off in a hurry. Oh! you won't hold that noise, won't you? Put him out, Smike.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. I was <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> {{anyone on}} <b>you</b> before, for I have no {{patience}} with such insane folly, {{but if you}} keep straight {{no one will be}} more inclined to make things easy for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} so myself, Archer. You {{used to call me}} Frenchie, you know; but I {{did not think}}, at the time, that I was likely ever to see France. I should like to have had my old band behind me, in some of the fights we had there. I warrant <b>you</b> would have given <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> knocks <b>as</b> <b>you</b> got, and would have held your own there, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did many a time in the fights in the Cloisters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Fischer," [...] he said, [...] "you've had me {{practically}} in {{your power}} for {{the best part of}} a year, but now I'm through with you. I'm out of your debt, no thanks to you, and I'm going to keep out. I am working on your business <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> though <b>you</b> were my own brother, and I'll go on doing it. I'll get you out of this mess as well as I can, and after that you can take your damned business where you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{board at}} the bow, Mr. Glover, I will make for her quarter. Now, lay out, lads, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, the sooner you are there the less chance you have of being hit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then do {{your worst}} now, good Lord Scroope, [...] "And deal your blows <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can! [...] "It shall be tried, within an hour, [...] "Which of us two {{is the better}} man." ...|$|E
60|$|LEVER. [Stepping up to JOY, and {{standing}} with his hands behind him-- in a low voice.] Now {{hit me in the}} face--hit me--hit me <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can. Go on, Joy, it'll do you good.|$|E
6000|$|... "Faix, {{among them}} chaps it don't do {{to tell them}} {{too much of the}} truth. Look at that!" [...] And he brought out the sixpence again from his breeches'-pocket. [...] "And look at your reverence. Only that they've let you out for a while, they've been nigh <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> on <b>you</b> <b>as</b> though <b>you</b> were one of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was hard}} on Nell," [...] said Belding, simply. [...] "But it 'll be better now you're back. Dick, I know the girl. She'll refuse {{to marry you}} and you'll have a hard job to break her down, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> the one <b>you</b> just rode in off of. I think I know you, too, or I wouldn't be saying--" ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter from}} John Diefenbaker, 10 September 1965. It reads "I was delighted with your letter. Your loyalty is surpassed only by your enthusiasm. I hope {{all of our}} friends will work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> I know <b>you</b> will, and if so, we cannot fail. Keep up the good work, and I will {{look forward to seeing}} you during the campaign. With very best wishes...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't prevent you, my dear fellow--only {{remember}} this: I {{will not}} permit you to assert, without contradicting you, that I am responsible for Clem's fortune. Now, go on, and explain away <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} no reason for complaint, that way, in the future, Aggie, I promise you. But how could I tell? The last time I saw you, you were flirting, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could, with someone else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{you must}} be careful," [...] Mr. Purfleet said, [...] "because if it should get out, the {{consequences}} might be terrible. Now, then, four of you take the sticks, and all hit together, <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can--now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me assure you," [...] he said, [...] "that Draconmeyer {{would have}} done nothing of the sort. For one thing, we don't {{introduce}} over here {{as a matter of}} course, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do in America. And for another--well, I won't trouble you with the other reason.... Look here, Lane, take my advice, there's a sensible fellow. I am a man of the world, you know, and there are certain situations in which one can make no mistake. If <b>you</b> are <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> hit <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say you are, go for a cruise and get over it. Don't hang around here. No good will come of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Haldane was not offended, and did {{not seem}} surprised. [...] "You may be wrong, or you may be right; but {{if you and your}} neighbors are <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> to plunder <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are slow to take a favor, the other gentlemen will {{probably}} earn all they get," [...] he said. [...] "I presume you have no objections to my wishing you good luck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She hasn't," [...] replied Thorne. [...] "Her {{husband had}} his crop hailed out last fall. Still, you see, {{that kind of}} thing is a custom of the country. They're a hospitable people, and, in a general way, when you are in need of a kindness, you're most likely to get it from people who are <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> up <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are." [...] He paused with a {{whimsical}} smile. [...] "One can't logically feel hurt at the other kind for standing aside or shutting their eyes, but when they proceed to point out that if you had only emulated their virtues you would be equally prosperous, it becomes exasperating, especially as it isn't true. So far as my observation goes, it isn't the practice of the stricter virtues that leads to riches." ...|$|R
