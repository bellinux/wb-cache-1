5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|In the pre-Columbian era, the {{location}} {{of what is now}} the city of Lima was inhabited by several Amerindian groups.

40|$|Our {{previous}} work showed a semantic bias in interpreting ambiguous words in schizophrenia, with disproportionate misinterpretation of subordinate meanings (toast at a wedding). We proposed pre-selection in schizophrenia of dominant meaning networks at points of lexical ambiguity, thereby misleading thought. This selection bias {{may be due}} to semantic memory hyper-priming causing strong <b>associates</b> <b>to</b> dominate cognition. Alternately, later access verbal memory maintenance failure may cause weaker <b>associates</b> <b>to</b> fade more quickly than stronger associates from memory due to less initial activation. To further examine this semantic bias, patients and controls were presented short 4 word long sentences (The toast was buttered). The second word was a homograph or unambiguous noun. The last word disambiguated homographs (dominant or subordinate meaning) or was congruent or incongruent with unambiguous nouns. Previously, we showed increasingly larger N 400 from unambiguous <b>associates</b> <b>to</b> dominate <b>associates</b> <b>to</b> subordinate <b>associates</b> <b>to</b> unambiguous non-associates in controls. Pre-selection of dominant meanings predicts schizophrenia patients would show small N 400 <b>to</b> dominant <b>associates</b> and as large N 400 <b>to</b> subordinate <b>associates</b> as <b>to</b> incongruou...|$|R
