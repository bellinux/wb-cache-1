5|$|On Christmas Day, Archie tells Ian the CD of the {{recording}} is under Ian's Christmas tree for Jane, but Ian fails to find it. Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as {{he has made a}} surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> care if he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E
25|$|Cassatt {{saw that}} works by female artists were often {{dismissed}} with contempt unless {{the artist had}} a friend or protector on the jury, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> flirt with jurors to curry favor. Her cynicism grew {{when one of the}} two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided that she needed to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.|$|E

25|$|Becoming a Muslim {{results in}} more {{acceptance}} among Uyghurs of Han spouses, {{a case in}} Urumqi of a Han male who converted to Islam and married a Uyghur woman, was reported by an 18 year old Uyghur male, Ömär, {{who lived in the}} same area as the man and voiced the approval of the Uyghur community, the man adopted doppa hat, went to the mosque to pray and changed his name to Jümäkhun and was accepted as a real Muslim, while another case of a Han woman converting to Islam to marry a Uyghur was viewed with suspicion since the Uyghurs suspected her of faking the conversion <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> integrate with the Uyghur community at all.|$|E
25|$|The ship's boilers {{were fired}} and {{within an hour}} the ship was making steam for getting underway. However, leaks due to frame and shaft damage contributed to delays in {{preparing}} the ship. By 1140 hours the ship was secured from attempts to get underway when it was finally determined she could not make more than 10 knots {{for no more than}} five hours. The ship was moved to dry dock on 8 December. It was found that the ship suffered considerable stress fractures within its engineering piping and tanks. All of these would have to be replaced or repaired stateside at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California. The ship sailed out of Pearl Harbor a few weeks later <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be fully repaired until the end of June 1942.|$|E
25|$|The exiled Queen went to Milan {{where she}} had an {{interview}} with Napoleon. He promised her, as compensation {{for the loss of}} Etruria, the throne of a Kingdom of Northern Lusitania (in the North of Portugal), he intended to create after the Franco-Spanish conquest of Portugal. This was part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau between France and Spain (October 1807) that also had incorporated Etruria to Napoleons' domains. Napoleon had already ordered the invasion of Portugal but his secret aim was ultimately to depose the Spanish royal family and have access to the money remitted from Spanish colonies in the New World. As part of the agreement, Maria Luisa would marry Lucien Bonaparte, who would have to divorce his wife, but both refused: Lucien was attached to his wife and Maria Luisa considered those nuptials a misalliance, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> allow herself to be put in Portugal in the place of her eldest sister, Carlota. Napoleon wanted Maria Luisa to settle in Nice or Turin, but her intentions were to join her parents in Spain. She arrived at a court deeply divided and a country in unrest: her brother, Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias, had plotted against their father and the unpopular prime minister Manuel Godoy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented Sylvia in an {{indifferent}} tone, {{though she}} was slightly disturbed. Herbert was keen-witted, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> have had him {{take an interest in}} her affairs.|$|R

2500|$|On December 31, Momoiro Clover Z {{performed}} at Kōhaku Uta Gassen, an annual New-Year-Eve music show hosted by NHK, {{for the first}} time. Going to Kōhaku had been the group's goal for a long time. [...] During the January 1 Ustream broadcast, Momoiro Clover Z made several announcements: that the band set a new goal for itself — to give a concert at the National Olympic Stadium, an arena with 60–70,000 capacity, that they would release a new album in spring, and that Momoka Ariyasu had to undergo a throat treatment <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> sing or even talk {{until the end of}} January. The treatment was subsequently prolonged for another month, until the end of February. During the group's live Ustream broadcasts, Momoka communicated by drawing and writing on a markerboard. At live performances, other members took turns in singing her parts.|$|E

60|$|He did {{not seem}} to hear, but walked on, as in a dream, where Ethel guided him, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{interrupt}} him again.|$|E
60|$|Even {{when the}} {{neighbours}} thronged in, and Mrs Spurrell {{wanted to take}} the child up, pull off the flour, and anoint her with oil <b>and</b> spirit, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> hear of it.|$|R
60|$|Christine did {{not know}} how about that; perhaps <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>and</b> perhaps <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not.</b> It was a nice, pretty little cap; what would the little {{underground}} man give her for it? that was the question.|$|R
50|$|KLTV-8 News {{reported}} on May 10, 2010, that the Nevada Supreme Court ruled against convicted Rudin <b>and</b> ruled <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> get another trial. The lower Appeals Court's ruling was overturned {{and the original}} conviction stood.|$|R

60|$|There {{would be}} no child: she was glad. If {{there had been a}} child, it would have made little difference, however. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have kept the child <b>and</b> herself, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have gone to Skrebensky. Anton belonged to the past.|$|R
60|$|Running rapidly past horse <b>and</b> rider, for <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{speak to}} Marmaduke, {{she reached the}} cottage soon enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm not so sure. She coughed {{a little}} last night, and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> eat her supper. We always {{do have a}} little supper. A {{despatched}} crab it was; <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> eat it I {{knew there was something}} wrong." ...|$|R

60|$|She did {{not look}} frightened; there was more of {{annoyance}} in her expression, as if she thought it impertinent in fate to treat her in this way, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> stand it.|$|E
