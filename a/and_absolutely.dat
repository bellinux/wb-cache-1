25|$|Additional {{evidence}} {{is provided by}} the eyes of ichthyosaurs that among vertebrates are both relatively <b>and</b> <b>absolutely</b> the largest known. Modern Leopard seals can dive to up to one kilometre hunting on sight. Motani suggested that ichthyosaurs, with their relatively much larger eye sockets, {{should have been able to}} reach even greater depths. Temnodontosaurus, with eyes that had a diameter of twenty-five centimetres, could probably still see at a depth of 1600 meters. At these depths, such eyes would have been especially useful to see large objects. Later species, such as Ophthalmosaurus, had relatively larger eyes, again an indication that diving capacity was better in late Jurassic and Cretaceous forms.|$|E

With the permission of the Russian military authorities and with the aid of the United States Legation, Mr. Ament took possession of a Mongol house near the former mission premises, and as it was the headquarters for the Boxers who destroyed those premises, it was judged right and proper by all the authority then existing that the contents of this house should be regarded as confiscated and should be sold {{for the benefit of the}} Christians, which was done. This is the basis of the oft-repeated charge of 'missionary looting', and it is a total misuse of terms.|$|E

In the 1980s, he appeared on television in The Spoils of War and Witness for the Prosecution (1982), and played Sir Charles Baskerville in the 1983 TV film of The Hound of the Baskervilles, Earl Mountbatten of Burma in Charles & Diana: A Royal Love Story (1982), and H.H. Asquith in Number 10, and appeared in the film The Whistle Blower (1986), opposite Michael Caine. His final television appearances were in The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (The Illustrious Client) <b>and</b> <b>Absolutely</b> in 1991, and The Good Guys in 1992.

25|$|Malthus went on {{to argue}} that under such ideal conditions, the {{population}} could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul.... The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in {{for the support of}} the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food.... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, <b>and</b> <b>absolutely</b> independent of it human regulations.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{voice had}} fully {{recovered}} {{from the effects of}} laryngitis, allowing him to reach falsetto and indulge in gospel-style scat singing. In author Alan Clayson's estimation, with Harrison adopting a new, [...] "close-miked" [...] soft vocal style, much of Extra Texture reflected [...] "the more feathery emanations from Philadelphia by the likes of The Stylistics and Jerry Butler". Leng considers that Harrison [...] "was clearly targeting the mainstream U.S. audience" [...] and adds: [...] "There were few spiritual lyrics <b>and</b> <b>absolutely</b> no references to Krishna, while his much-criticized vocals were stronger, but recorded at a low level, as if the goal was to create a Harrison soul album for lovers." ...|$|E

Lloyd and the curator then decide what form the exhibit could take and where in the museum it could be displayed. In series one, the programme ended either with Lloyd and Bailey reading audience suggestions for additional exhibits or asking the audience curious questions [...] Bailey ended the show by giving a humorous comment on a Bertrand Russell quote. Both of these ideas were dropped in series two.|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the leading}} {{officials}} of the age, Peter was a controversial figure, receiving greatly differing assessments from his contemporaries. To John Lydus, a mid-level bureaucrat of the praetorian prefecture of the East, Peter was a paragon of every virtue, an intelligent, firm but fair administrator and a kind man. Procopius in his public histories attests his mild manners and desire to avoid giving insult, but in his private Secret History he accuses him of [...] "robbing the scholares" [...] (the members of the Scholae) and being [...] "the biggest thief in the world <b>and</b> <b>absolutely</b> filled with shameful avarice", as well as being responsible for the murder of Amalasuntha.|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "Patrick is the definition of stupid and his antics will have you laughing out loud." [...] In a review published in 2007, Peter Keepnews of The New York Times said, [...] "Patrick is a popular character, and the new episodes illustrate why: He is unfailingly enthusiastic, touchingly loyal <b>and</b> <b>absolutely</b> undeterred by his intellectual limitations. Hilariously voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, he is not just an endearing comic creation but a role model for idiots everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1981, the band's third studio album, 7, reached number 5 in the UK album {{charts and}} {{contained}} three hit singles: [...] "Grey Day" [...] (no. 4, April 1981), [...] "Shut Up" [...] (no. 7, September 1981), and [...] "Cardiac Arrest" [...] (no. 14, February 1982). In {{an article in}} 1979, Chris Foreman explained that the band's music would move with the times, and change styles as time goes on. This was shown to be the case, as unlike the two ska-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, 7 {{was something of a}} change in direction. Suggs' vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong accent from the previous albums had been watered down. The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of One Step Beyond... <b>and</b> <b>Absolutely,</b> and moved towards a pop sound; a trend that continued with subsequent albums.|$|E
