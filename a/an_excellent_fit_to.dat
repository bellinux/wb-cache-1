40|$|We {{combine the}} the stellar {{spectral}} synthesis code Starburst 99, the nebular modelling code MAP-PINGS iii and a 1 -D dynamical evolution model of Hii regions around massive clusters of young stars to generate improved {{models of the}} spectral energy distribution (SED) of starburst galaxies. We introduce a compactness parameter, C, which characterizes the specific intensity of the radiation field at ionization fronts in Hii regions, and which controls {{the shape of the}} far-IR dust re-emission, often referred to loosely as the dust “temperature”. We also investigate the effect of metallicity on the overall SED and in particular, on the strength of the PAH features. We provide templates for the mean emission produced by the young compact Hii regions, the older (10 − 100 Myr) stars and for the wavelength-dependent attenuation produced by a foreground screen of the dust used in our model. We demonstrate that these components may be combined <b>to</b> produce <b>a</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> the observed SEDs of star formation dominated galaxies which are often used as templates (Arp 220 and NGC 6240). This fit extends from the Lyman Limit to wavelengths of about one mm.

DESIGN: Case series demonstrating a new surgical technique. PARTICIPANTS: A 69 -year-old female with rosacea keratitis and peripheral corneal perforation; a 49 -year-old male with keratoconus, ipsilateral herpes simplex keratitis and an inferonasal corneal perforation; and a 12 -year-old female with an apparently spontaneous central corneal perforation. RESULTS: These 3 patients with full-thickness corneal perforations were successfully managed with this automated tectonic LK technique. CONCLUSIONS: Tectonic LK has benefits relative to tectonic penetrating keratoplasty but remains unpopular because it is technically difficult to prepare the host and donor corneas. This tectonic LK technique negates the need for challenging free-hand dissection and gives <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> donor <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> the host bed.

The second experiment used the model to test the hypothesis that source memory for individual context attributes is stochastically related in the case of conscious recollection but independent in the case of familiarity-based recognition judgments. The prediction was supported by the introduction of a “remember”–“know ” distinction in a multidimensional source memory test.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the hard X-ray (> 2. 5 keV) EPIC spectra from the first observations of NGC 4151 made by XMM-Newton. We fit the spectra with a model consisting of a power-law continuum modified by line-of-sight absorption (arising in both partially photoionized and neutral gas) plus additional iron-K emission and absorption features. This model provides <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> overall <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> the EPIC spectra. The iron Kα line is well modelled as a narrow Gaussian component. In contrast to several earlier studies based on data from ASCA, a relativistically broadened iron Kα emission feature is not required by the XMM-Newton data. The upper limit on the flux contained in any additional broad line is ∼ 8 % of that in the narrow line. The measured intrinsic line width (σ = 32 ± 7 eV) may be ascribed to (i) the doublet nature of the iron Kα line and (ii) emission from low ionization states of iron, ranging from neutral up to FeXVII. The additional iron absorption edge arises in cool material and implies a factor ∼ 2 overabundance of iron in this component...|$|R

Our analysis reaches substantially different conclusions regarding the evidence for a Super- Earth-mass planet in the star’s Habitable Zone. We were able to reproduce their reported χ 2 ν and RMS values only after removing some outliers from their models and refitting the trimmed down RV set. A suite of 4000 N-body simulations of their Keplerian model all resulted in unstable systems and revealed that their reported 3. 6 σ detection of e = 0. 32 for the eccentricity of GJ 581 e is manifestly incompatible with the system’s dynamical stability. Furthermore, their Keplerian model, when integrated only over the time baseline of the observations, significantly increases the χ 2 ν and demonstrates the need for including non-Keplerian orbital precession when modeling this system. We find that a four-planet model with all of the planets on circular or nearly circular orbits provides both <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> self-consistent <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> their RV data and also results in a very stable configuration. The periodogram of the residuals to a 4 -planet all-circular-orbit model reveals significant peaks that suggest one or more additional planets in this system.
