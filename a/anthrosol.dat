However, few studies have examined how it influences the mineralization of added organic matter (AOM) and its incorporation into soil physical fractions and whether BC decomposition is increased by AOM. BC-rich <b>Anthrosols</b> and BC-poor adjacent soils from the Central Amazon (Brazil) were incubated for 532 days either with or without addition of (13) C-isotopically different plant residue. Total C mineralization from the BC-rich <b>Anthrosols</b> with AOM was 25. 5 % (P < 0. 05) lower than with mineralization from the BC-poor adjacent soils. The AOM contributed to a significantly (P < 0. 05) higher proportion to the total C mineralized in the BC-rich <b>Anthrosols</b> (91 - 92 %) than the BC-poor adjacent soils (69 - 80 %). The AOM was incorporated more rapidly in BC-rich than BC-poor soils from the separated free light fraction through the intra-aggregate light fraction into the stable organo-mineral fraction and up to 340 % more AOM was found in the organo-mineral fraction. This more rapid stabilization was observed despite a significantly (P < 0. 05) lower metabolic quotient for BC-rich <b>Anthrosols.</b> The microbial biomass (MB) was up to 125 % greater (P < 0. 05) in BC-rich <b>Anthrosols</b> than BC-poor adjacent soils.

Similarly, the molecular composition of the core regions of micrometer-sized BC particles quantified by synchrotron-based Near-Edge X-ray Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy coupled to Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) remained similar regardless of their ages and closely resembled the spectral characteristics or fresh BC. BC decomposed extremely slowly to ail extent that {{it was not possible to}} detect chemical changes between Youngest and oldest samples, as also confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Deconvolution of NEXAFS spectra revealed greater oxidation oil the surfaces of BC particles with little penetration into the core of the particles. The similar C mineralization between different BC-rich soils regardless of soil texture underpins the importance of chemical recalcitrance for the stability of BC, in contrast to adjacent soils which showed the highest mineralization in the sandiest soil.

40|$|Plaggic <b>Anthrosols</b> are {{the result}} of {{historical}} forms of land management in cultural landscapes on chemically poor sandy substrates. Application of plaggic manure was responsible {{for the development of the}} plaggic horizons of these agricultural soils. Pollen diagrams reflect aspects of the environmental development but the interpretation of the pollen spectra is complicated due to the mix of the aeolian pollen influx of crop species and species in the surroundings, and of pollen occurring in the used stable fillings. Pollen diagrams and radiocarbon dates of plaggic <b>Anthrosols</b> suggested a development period of more than a millennium. Calluna is present in almost all the pollen spectra, indicating the presence of heath in the landscape during the whole period of soil development. Optically stimulated luminescence dating of the plaggic horizon made clear that the deposition of plaggic covers started in the 16 th century and accelerated in the 18 th century. The stable fillings, used for the production of plaggic manure and responsible for the rise of the soil surface, cannot be identified with pollen diagrams alone. Biomarker analyses provide more evidence about the sources of stable fillings. The oldest biomarker spectra of the plaggic horizons of three typical plaggic <b>Anthrosols</b> examined in this study were dominated by biomarkers of forest species such as Quercus and Betula while the spectra of middle part of the plaggic horizons were dominated by biomarkers of stem tissue of crop species such as Secale and Avena. Only the youngest spectra of the plaggic horizons were dominated by biomarkers of Calluna. This indicates that the use of heath sods as stable filling was most likely introduced very late in the development of the <b>Anthrosols.</b> Before the 19 th century the mineral component in plaggic manure cannot be explained by the use of heath sods. We conclude that other sources of materials, containing mineral grains must have been responsible for the raise of the plaggic horizon...|$|R

40|$|Runoff {{generation}} and soil loss from slopes {{have been studied}} for decades, but the relationships among runoff, soil loss and rill development are still not well understood. In this paper, rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in two neighbouring plots (scale: 1 m by 5 m) with four varying slopes (17. 6 %, 26. 8 %, 36. 4 % and 46. 6 %) and two rainfall intensities (90 and 120 mmh(- 1)) using two loess soils. Data on rill development were extracted from the digital elevation models by means of photogrammetry. The effects of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on runoff, soil loss and rill development were different for the two soils. The runoff and soil loss from the <b>Anthrosol</b> surface were generally higher than those from the Calcaric Cambisol surface. Higher rainfall intensity produced less runoff and more sediment for almost each treatment. With increasing slope gradient, the values of cumulative runoff and soil loss peaked, except for the treatments with 90 mmh(- 1) rainfall on the slopes with <b>Anthrosol.</b> With rainfall duration, runoff discharge decreased for <b>Anthrosol</b> and increased for Calcaric Cambisol for almost all the treatments. For both soils, sediment concentration was very high {{at the onset of}} rainfall and decreased quickly. Almost all the sediment concentrations increased on the 17. 6 % and 26. 8 % slopes and peaked on the 36. 4 % and 46. 6 % slopes. Sediment concentrations were higher on the <b>Anthrosol</b> slopes than on the Calcaric Cambisol slopes. At 90 mmh(- 1) rainfall intensity, increasingly denser rills appeared on the <b>Anthrosol</b> slope as the slope gradient increased, while only steep slopes (36. 4 % and 46. 6 %) developed rills for the Calcaric Cambisol soil. The contributions of rill erosion ranged from 36 % to 62 % of the cumulative soil losses for <b>Anthrosol,</b> while the maximum contribution of rill erosion to the cumulative soil loss was only 37. 9 % for Calcaric Cambisol.

We hypothesized that deeper {{parts of the}} soil, soil parent material and especially paleosols provide beneficial conditions in terms of, e. g., nutrient contents, thus supporting their utilization and exploitation by deep roots. We aimed to decipher the different phases of soil formation in Dutch drift sands and cover sands. The study site is located at Bedafse Bergen (southeastern Netherlands) in a 200 -year-old oak stand. A recent Podzol developed on drift sand covering a Plaggic <b>Anthrosol</b> that was piled up on a relict Podzol on Late Glacial eolian cover sand. Root-free soil and sediment samples, collected in 10 – 15  cm depth increments, were subjected to a multi-proxy physical and geochemical approach. The Plaggic <b>Anthrosol</b> revealed low bulk density and high phosphorous and organic carbon contents, whereas the relict Podzol was characterized by high iron and aluminum contents. Frequencies of fine (diameter [*]≤[*]  2  mm) and medium roots (2 – 5  mm) were determined on horizontal levels and the profile wall for a detailed pseudo-three-dimensional insight. On horizontal levels, living roots were most abundant in the uppermost part of the relict Podzol with ca. 4450 and 220  m− 2, significantly exceeding topsoil root abundances. Roots of oak trees thus benefited from the favorable growth conditions in the nutrient-rich Plaggic <b>Anthrosol,</b> whereas increased compactness and high aluminum contents of the relict Podzol caused a strong decrease of roots. The approach demonstrated the benefit of comprehensive root investigation to support interpretation of soil profiles, as fine roots can be significantly underestimated when quantified at the profile wall. The possible rooting of soil parent material and paleosols long after their burial confirmed recent studies on the potential influence of rooting to overprint sediment–(paleo) soil sequences of various ages, sedimentary and climatic settings. Potential consequences of deep rooting for terrestrial deep carbon stocks, located to a relevant part in paleosols, remain largely unknown and require further investigation...|$|E

Among others they include those whose surface horizon has been modified by topsoil disturbance and/or irrigation associated to different types of agriculture; those which have formed on human-transported, -manufactured or -mobilised sediments, including here landforms created or altered by humans; and soils whose surface horizons have become significantly transformed {{as a result of}} human-induced inputs (see also Dudal 2005). <b>Anthrosols</b> are ubiquitous on a planetary scale (FAO 1998) : they vary in spatial extent from compost heaps that concentrate organic matter in the backyard of households to entire landscapes modified by agricultural or industrial activity. Below we focus on <b>anthrosols</b> variously known as terras pretas de índio or Amazonian Dark Earths (Sombroek 1966; Hilbert 1968; Woods and McCann 1999; Lehmann et al. 2003; Glaser and Woods 2004).

Our approach focuses on relict signatures of past human agencies (e. g. French 2003; Davidson and Simpson 2005) in a soilscape that we understand as a ‘moving target’, i. e. one whose variability is dictated by its position in specific landscape evolutionary pathways. From this vantage point, with a sincere hope of contributing to the broader enterprise of understanding past anthropogenic landscape transformations in the Amazon basin, and in fond memory of Wim Sombroek, undoubtedly a pioneer in investigations of these soils, we offer below two interlinked sets of remarks about the physical and chemical characteristics of anthropogenic dark earths.

Carbonaceous particles were identified through micromorphological analysis and the determination of O:C ratios using an electron microprobe. Despite the use of different inputs in recent centuries and different current land management, the resultant anthropogenic soils are remarkably similar in field and analytical properties. Nevertheless, subtle changes in particle size can be explained by parent material influences, material imported by farmers and by inputs by other processes such as by wind. The results from microprobe analysis demonstrate the importance of carbonaceous particles in storing phosphorus. Thus the inherent fertility of these <b>Anthrosols</b> can be explained in part by the application of carbonised material in the past...|$|R
