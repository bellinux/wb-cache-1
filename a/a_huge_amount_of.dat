Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Automated {{model-free}} anomaly and {{fault detection}} using large collections of sensor suites {{is vital to}} increasing safety and reducing maintenance costs of complex aerospace systems, such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine. Current anomaly and fault detection methods are deficient in that they either require <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> laborious expert analysis or rely on models that fail to capture unmodelled anomalies. To overcome these deficiencies, model-free statistical approaches to this analysis are needed {{that do not require}} significant user input. This paper presents two general automated analysis methods that detect anomalies in sensor data taken from large sets of sensors. The first approach uses entropy analysis over the entire set of sensors at once to detect anomalies that have broad system-wide impact. The global nature of this approach reduce...|$|R

The proposed system consists of a controller that combines feedback and feedforward information to determine a configuration that minimizes power consumption while meeting the performance target. The controller can also be configured to accomplish power minimization in a stable manner, without causing large oscillations in the resource allocations.

However, in the particular case of the “extreme limit prediction” for a considered system, other factors assume a prominent importance instead of fuel consumption, like the ability to use all the available power to keep the position in heavy weather conditions. When the maximum operating cases for a vessel are analysed, other effects like thruster–hull interaction and thruster–thruster interaction are rarely considered. To take into account the above-mentioned effects, different thrust allocation strategies were studied and implemented in a capability prediction suite. In this paper a new allocation philosophy is presented, with the aim of maximising the DP capability of a vessel operating in heavy whether conditions. An application of the procedure on two existing offshore vessels is also considered to highlight the effects of different allocation strategies and of the interaction effects on the resulting DP capability in terms of “operational rosettes”...|$|R
