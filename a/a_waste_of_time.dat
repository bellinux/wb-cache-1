5|$|Sheldon goes {{to visit}} Mr. D'Onofrio in hospital. When the nurse sees him with scissors, expecting {{to get a}} haircut, she calls {{security}} {{and he has to}} leave. He accepts that {{he is not going to}} get a haircut, but also abandons all of his meticulous planning (for example, his bowel chart spreadsheet), realizing it has been <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|The journal has {{developed}} {{standards for the}} publication of mouse mutant studies. Many mouse mutant studies have serious methodological problems leading to fatally flawed scientific conclusions, causing <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> effort, and research resources, and leading to ethical problems because of the unnecessary use of live animals for flawed studies. These standards are gradually being accepted more widely in the field.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly did {{not enjoy}} his time at the overcrowded Sydney Teachers College (STC), decrying the lack of {{practical}} training and the predominance of pedagogical theory. Regarding it as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> he happily accepted an offer of work experience from Major Cook-Russell, the head of physical education at STC, to help at Naremburn College instead of attending lectures. This angered Professor Alexander Mackie, the head of STC, whom both Cook-Russell and O'Reilly regarded as incompetent.|$|E
5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer. At age27, she became obsessed with ballet, which she had studied as a girl. She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that {{she did have a}} fair degree of talent. But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife's desire to become a professional dancer, considering it <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious {{force to be reckoned}} with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{contacted}} Chien-Shiung Wu, {{who identified}} {{the cause of}} the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, {{which turned out to be}} 30,000 times that of uranium. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium. Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{fin whale}} was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, {{but it was}} relatively safe, because it could easily outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band's first choice, but had been too busy following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E

5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case is <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and they should return to Washington.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Kenney {{became a}} student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, the Air Corps' {{advanced}} training school. He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the Army's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers. Most Air Corps officers, including Kenney, considered the course largely irrelevant to them, and therefore <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> but nonetheless a prerequisite for promotion in a ground-oriented Army. Afterwards, he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor. He taught classes of attack aviation. He was particularly interested in low-level attacks, as a means of improving accuracy. There were tactical problems with this, as low-flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire. There were also technical problems to be solved, as an aircraft could be struck by its own bomb fragments. His interest in attack aviation would ultimately set him apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E
