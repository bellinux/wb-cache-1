500|$|Breaking {{was created}} in the South Bronx, New York City during the early 1970s. It is the first hip-hop dance style. At the time of its creation, it was the only hip-hop dance style because Afrika Bambaataa {{classified}} it as one of the five pillars of hip-hop culture along with MCing (rapping), DJing (turntablism), graffiti writing (bombing), and knowledge. Though African Americans created breaking, Puerto Ricans maintained its growth and development when it was considered a fad in the late 1970s. In a 2001 interview Richard [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Colón, the president of Rock Steady Crew, commented on how Puerto Ricans contributed to breaking: [...] "I think the difference is when the brothas first started doing [...] and it was at its infancy they weren't doing acrobatic moves. That didn't come into play until more Puerto Ricans got involved in the mid 70s. We then took the dance, evolved it and kept it alive. In '79 I was getting dissed. I would go into a dance <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> dissed by a lot of brothas who would ask 'Why y'all still doing that dance? That's played out'. By 79, there were very few African American brothas that was doing this... We always maintained the flava. It was like a changing of the guard and all we did was add more flava to something that already existed." [...] Breaking includes four foundational dances: toprock, footwork-oriented steps performed while standing up; downrock, footwork performed with both hands and feet on the floor; freezes, stylish poses done on your hands; and power moves, complex and impressive acrobatic moves. Transitions from toprock to downrock are called [...] "drops." ...|$|E

[...] "Linda <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> high and Heather would say the most amazing things...I'd think, 'This is André Breton at six years old!'" [...] He adds that he found Linda's relationship with Heather a [...] "very charming aspect of her life with this wonderful child." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is also to}} eat with," [...] {{replied the}} boy. [...] "If I didn't put food into my mouth, <b>and</b> eat it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> hungry <b>and</b> starve.|$|R
60|$|ASHER. I {{told him}} I couldn't discuss certain aspects. His {{emotional}} state troubled me,--he was going away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> imagined he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> over it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am much obliged, Greening," [...] he said, [...] "but I don't want to {{go through}} life with this thing hanging over me. Miller has a copy of the article, without a doubt. If you turn him down, he'll find some one else to publish it. I should never know when the {{thunderbolt}} was going to fail. I am prepared now <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>get</b> it over." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{said that}} I {{would get him}} the file, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> him what broken bits of food I could, and I would come {{to him at the}} Battery, early in the morning.|$|E
60|$|Walkirk {{very soon}} {{discovered}} that I had no intention whatever of giving up the writing of my book, and I quieted the fears of my grandmother, in regard to my health, by assuring her that the sedentary work connected with the production of my volume would not be done by me. Secretaries could be had, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> one.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} June {{the weather}} became fine again. Hay harvest was to begin {{as soon as it}} settled. There were only two fields to be mown this year, to provide just enough stuff to last until the spring. As my {{vacation}} had begun I decided I would help, and that we three, the father, George <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> in the hay without hired assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I merely lit {{that fire}} because <b>I</b> was dull, <b>and</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a little {{excitement}} by calling {{you up and}} triumphing over you as the Witch of Endor called up Samuel. I determined you should come; and you have come! I have shown my power. A mile and half hither, and a mile and half back again to your home--three miles {{in the dark for}} me. Have I not shown my power?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1943, Drury {{moved to}} Washington. [...] "I went East {{and wound up}} in Washington, which fascinated me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a job {{for about a year}} for {{experience}} before coming back to the coast. I came back twenty years later, finally." ...|$|R
6000|$|But why go on? The {{traditions of}} Silverland {{are filled with}} {{instances}} like these, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>get</b> through enumerating them were I to attempt do it. I only desired to give, the reader an idea of a peculiarity of the [...] "flush times" [...] which I could not present so strikingly in any other way, and which some mention of was necessary to a realizing comprehension {{of the time and}} the country.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{you have}} not been used to {{wholesome}} exercise in large families. I dare say it seems formidable; but, my dear, you are looking quite pale. I can't allow you to stay stuffed up there, poking over a book all the afternoon. It is very bad for you. We are going to have some historical tableaux. They are to have one set, and I thought perhaps you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> up some for them to guess in turn.' ...|$|E
60|$|Whereat {{we would}} rehearse for our mutual {{encouragement}} the manifold virtues and excellences of the Snark. Also, I would borrow more money, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> down {{closer to my}} desk and write harder, and I refused heroically to take a Sunday off and {{go out into the}} hills with my friends. I was building a boat, and by the eternal {{it was going to be}} a boat, and a boat spelled out all in capitals--B--O--A- -T; and no matter what it cost I didn't care. So long as it was a BOAT.|$|E
60|$|With {{precaution}} I {{would go}} {{up the side of}} my own particular corpse, and would feel her as cold as ice itself and as slippery under my feet. My cold berth would swallow up like a chilly burial niche my bodily shivers and my mental excitement. It was a cruel winter. The very air seemed as hard and trenchant as steel; but it would have taken much more than this to extinguish my sacred fire for the exercise of my craft. No young man of twenty-four appointed chief mate {{for the first time in}} his life would have let that Dutch tenacious winter penetrate into his heart. I think that in those days I never forgot the fact of my elevation for five consecutive minutes. I fancy it kept me warm, even in my slumbers, better than the high pile of blankets, which positively crackled with frost as I threw them off in the morning. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> up early for no reason whatever except that I was in sole charge. The new captain had not been appointed yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "After that I {{flew back}} to the big maple tree close by the house," [...] {{continued}} Tommy. [...] "You know Farmer Brown's boy has kept a piece of suet tied in that tree all winter for me. <b>I</b> was hungry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a bite to eat, but there wasn't any suet there. That pig of a Sammy Jay {{had managed to get}} it untied and had carried it all away. Of course that made me angry, and twice as hungry as before. I was trying to make up my mind what to do next when I happened to look over on the window sill, {{and what do you think}} I saw there?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was {{perfectly}} obvious that if I sat in that kite it {{was bound to}} crash <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>get</b> killed. Anyone with an ounce of gallantry would have stayed at the controls and tried to miss the innocent bystanders. I haven’t got an ounce of gallantry. I don’t intend to kill myself to save {{three and a half}} civilians. It’s their war as well as mine, so they can jolly well take some of the risk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, {{we thought}} of a dinner-party {{for as many as}} possible. Frank and Charlie won't mind dining in the schoolroom, <b>I</b> know, <b>and</b> having the rest for a dance in the evening; but if Julius did think it unclerical--Jenny says he won't, and papa laughs, and says, 'Poh! poh! Julius is no fool;' but people are so much more {{particular}} than they used to be, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>get</b> the dear boy into a scrape for the world." ...|$|R
60|$|The worthy Hermann {{himself was}} not very entertaining, though his English was fairly comprehensible. Mrs. Hermann, who always let off one speech at least at me in an hospitable, cordial tone (and in Platt-Deutsch I suppose) I could not understand. As to their niece, however {{satisfactory}} to look upon (and she inspired you somehow with a hopeful view as to the prospects of mankind) she was a modest and silent presence, mostly engaged in sewing, only now and then, as I observed, falling over that work {{into a state of}} maidenly meditation. Her aunt sat opposite her, sewing also, with her feet propped on a wooden footstool. On {{the other side of the}} deck Hermann <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a couple of chairs out of the cabin and settle down to a smoking match, accompanied at long intervals by the pacific exchange of a few words. I came nearly every evening. Hermann I would find in his shirt sleeves. As soon as he returned from the shore on board his ship he commenced operations by taking off his coat; then he put on his head an embroidered round cap with a tassel, and changed his boots for a pair of cloth slippers. Afterwards he smoked at the cabin-door, looking at his children with an air of civic virtue, till they got caught one after another and put to bed in various staterooms. Lastly, we would drink some beer in the cabin, which was furnished with a wooden table on cross legs, and with black straight-backed chairs--more like a farm kitchen than a ship's cuddy. The sea and all nautical affairs seemed very far removed from the hospitality of this exemplary family.|$|E
5000|$|Dalton {{was also}} {{impressed}} by the intelligence of McCartney's daughter. [...] "Linda <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> high and Heather would say the most amazing things...I'd think, 'This is André Breton at six years old!'" [...] He adds that he found Linda's relationship with Heather a [...] "very charming aspect of her life with this wonderful child." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{being the}} undisputed [...] "King of the Discotheque," [...] Piro never opened his own club. Asked why, he replied, [...] "I like {{things the way}} they are. I don't want to be {{watching}} a cash register, watching the waiters - it would take all the beauty of dancing away from me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> old." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, good father," [...] said Robin, [...] "but thou seest that {{my clothes}} {{are of the}} finest <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fain <b>would</b> not <b>get</b> them wet. Methinks thy {{shoulders}} are stout and broad; couldst thou not find it in thy heart to carry me across?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Greswell {{returned}} to Sri Lanka after war service and resumed his non-first-class cricket career there. In October 1920, {{he was picked}} for the Ceylon team {{to play in a}} one-day match against the England team that was heading for an Ashes drubbing in Australia. He took the first four wickets to fall as the England side held on for a draw. In a letter, Greswell wrote: [...] "Douglas (the England captain) repeatedly asked me when I was coming back to England <b>and</b> said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> into the England side if I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am old {{and very}} poor," [...] she said, [...] "and I work for my living. There {{was no way}} but to confess. If I hadn't they might have set me free. That would ruin me, for no one <b>would</b> forget that <b>I</b> had been {{suspected}} of being a witch, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> no more work, <b>and</b> wherever <b>I</b> went they <b>would</b> set the dogs on me. In a little while <b>I</b> <b>would</b> starve. The fire is best; it is soon over. You have been good to me, you two, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thank you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Soon after Hitler {{had given}} me the first large {{architectural}} commissions, I began to suffer from anxiety in long tunnels, in airplanes, or in small rooms. My heart would begin to race, I would become breathless, the diaphragm would seem to grow heavy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the impression that my blood pressure was rising tremendously ... Anxiety amidst all my freedom and power! ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{sessions}} with White, however, proved unsuccessful, with Smith stating: [...] "I had these glorified ideas about San Francisco and its drug culture. I thought inspiration would just hit me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> these San Francisco drugs in my system {{and all of}} a sudden an amazing record would come out. But that's not really what happened at all. We sat down in a studio and, instead of picking up a guitar and having some beautiful thing come out, I just had no idea what the fuck I was doing there and gave up before I even started." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{have to give}} a lot {{of credit}} to Doug Yatesand the guys at the engine shop. We had great horsepower. I could get a pretty good start on the bottom and either Denny or Dale Jr. could push me for awhile and then they just couldn’t stay {{attached}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> away from them just in time to get in front of Greg and the two of us together could make some unbelievable speed. I have to thank Greg. We worked together really good all day long. He had a really fast car all day as well. Kenseth, speaking in victory line about his second Daytona 500 win.|$|E
6000|$|... “Not he [...] . <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{wish you}} <b>would</b> <b>get</b> {{away from it}} to where one can see your face. I hate talking to a man’s back. You stand there like a hermit on a sea-shore {{growling}} to yourself. I {{tell you what it}} is, Geoffrey, you don’t like mankind.” ...|$|R
5000|$|These {{experiences}} led him {{to demand}} increasing rights and ownership of all television concepts he authored. By the mid-1960s, he had distilled this demand into a boiler plate for all his contracts. [...] "I was getting paid my royalty and my fee whether I did the show or not. If I conceived the show, and got it on the air, anyone could produce it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> still <b>get</b> paid just as if I was doing it [...] [...] [...] That became known as 'the Huggins contract'. Every producer in television would say, 'I want the Huggins contract', {{and some of them}} got it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the next}} few years Horsley worked as a miner in various locales {{throughout}} the American West. He later recalled in his autobiography:"During all this time I did not save any money, though I worked nearly all the time and always got the highest wages... I made many good resolutions and often saved up a few hundred dollars <b>and</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> into some little business for myself. When <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> away from town, as I often did, in some out-of-the-way place, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> save my money and make good resolutions; but how soon <b>I</b> <b>would</b> forget them when <b>I</b> <b>would</b> strike town <b>and</b> see a faro game running, or a game of poker. My money would burn my pocket. There were many other attractions, and money always soon got away. I always bought plenty of good clothes and lived well." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sweden {{has long}} winters, but their short summers are amazing. Australia is easy living, {{but so far}} away from {{everything}} ... It's pretty hard for anyone to deal with long cold winters, but being a skateboarder and dealing with it is way harder. I used to play a lot of video games and skate the local indoor park. But you get bored of skating the same old park every day for like nine months. I tried snowboarding a couple of time; it was pretty fun. My homie's dad owned a house in the hills <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> to go kick it there sometimes and snowboard.|$|E
5000|$|Goodwin {{recalled}} {{that he came}} in at [...] "the 11th hour": ...Gil and I would talk about working together. ... And then Gil would get {{into a situation where}} he was ready to begin a project. I would find myself in other situations so I couldn't work on the project. He would begin getting other people to do stuff. It wouldn't work out totally to his satisfaction. He would ask me, [...] "Gee, can you come in on this thing?" [...] And on both Name is...Savage and Blackmark, I came in on them after they were started. the synopsis was written, Gil <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> involved in the breaking-down and the layout-out of the stuff and reshaping it. But we would always be reshaping it as we would go along, because by then the deadline was on us.|$|E
5000|$|Their daughter, Elsie Nilgak, states:"When {{they were}} trying to start the Co-op my mother was given drawing paper to make {{drawings}}. She would make drawings when we were at our outpost camp at Walker Bay the coast north of Minto Inlet. The drawings would show the way people used to dress and live. She did drawings for some of the sealskin tapestries also. There were about five women, including my mother, who sewed sealskins for the Co-op. I still remember the first drawings and designs by my mother for kamiks, parkas, mitts, and other craft items. There were about five women who made sealskin clothing and mats. I remember coming into Holman in the summer by boat to sell some of my mother’s finished drawings <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> more art supplies to take back for her. This was after my father passed away 1960." ...|$|E
5000|$|I was {{not even}} able to touch the floor, the {{concrete}} floor of the warehouse… After the shooting, I felt a strange kind of heat, warmth, which was actually coming from the blood that covered the concrete floor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was stepping on the dead people who were lying around. But there were even people who were still alive, who were only wounded, {{and as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> step on him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hear him cry, moan, because I was trying to move as fast as I could. I could tell that people had been completely disembodied, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could feel bones of the people that had been hit by those bursts of gunfire or shells, I could feel their ribs crushing. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> up again <b>and</b> continue [...] [...] [...] [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{make the}} fire immediately, Hassan; {{the sooner the}} sheik has a little nourishment, the better. If he seems strong enough to bear it, I want to carry him off to the {{mountains}} at once. It {{is quite possible that}} the French may be searching the villages round for wounded fugitives, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> fain <b>get</b> him up among the hills. Sidi, too, has an ugly wound in the head, and needs a few days' rest. I think I have everything that they can want for {{the next two or three}} days, and you have a good supply of fruit. We must find some place among the rocks sheltered from the sun. When it is dark you must go down to the fountain and fill up your water-skins there." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, she debuted on television, {{playing the}} role of black-haired Kim Jordan on the {{short-lived}} day-time soap opera The Best of Everything. On the role, Glass commented: [...] "Everything happened to me on that series. I played a very intense young woman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> lost my boyfriend to another woman. I even got stabbed ... it happened on a Friday <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was left for dead. I went home that weekend feeling very strange." [...] The actress told the press in another interview she <b>would</b> <b>get</b> into her role too much, saying: [...] "I was so much into the part, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be standing on the sidelines watching the actor playing my boyfriend kiss the other woman <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> actually <b>get</b> jealous. The actor was a nice guy but I never thought of him romantically off the set. But when I play a character for a while, I begin to think and feel like that character." ...|$|R
