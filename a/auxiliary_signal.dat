The underlying {{protection and control}} system is called TBTC, which stands for Transmission-Based Train Control. The computer does everything except opening and closing the doors, starting the train at every station, mending faults and dealing with passengers. If ATO fails but TBTC is still operational, the trains can still be manually driven at line speed under PM (Protected Manual) conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the train receives lots of updates in a short time, it is considered impossible for the driver to drive in this mode in regular service, and the train will be taken out of service and moved off the line as quickly as possible. If TBTC fails on an individual train then it would be put into Restricted Manual mode, which means that the train operator can drive the train at 5–10mph (8–16km/h) to the next station, where the train would be taken out of service until the fault is mended by technicians.

Usually, the acquisition method for BOC(1, 1) signal is used to capture CBOC signal, while the research of special acquisition method for CBOC signal is rare. In this letter, according to the principle and characteristics of CBOC signal, a special side-peak cancellation method (SSCM) is proposed and simulated. In this method, two special <b>auxiliary</b> <b>signals</b> are introduced.

40|$|Having {{been charged}} with finding a method to hide a digital {{signature}} into an analog audio signal, {{the first order of}} business was searching literature to see if the problem had already been solved. Extensive database searches indicated that such encoding had been performed in the digital domain, but not in the analog. For a short time the possibility was considered of adapting the digital methods to the analog realm. It soon became evident, however, that an entirely new approach was required.

40|$|Parameter {{estimation}} of a sinusoidal signal in real-time is encountered in applications in numerous areas of engineering. Parameters of interest are usually amplitude, frequency and phase wherein frequency tracking {{is the fundamental}} task in sinusoidal estimation. This thesis deals {{with the problem of}} identifying a signal that comprises n (n ≥ 1) harmonics from a measurement possibly affected by structured and unstructured disturbances. The structured perturbations are modeled as a time-polynomial so as to represent, for example, bias and drift phenomena typically present in applications, whereas the unstructured disturbances are characterized as bounded perturbation. Several approaches upon different theoretical tools are presented in this thesis, and classified into two main categories: asymptotic and non-asymptotic methodologies, depending on the qualitative characteristics of the convergence behavior over time. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the asymptotic estimators, which typically consist in a pre-filtering module for generating a number of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>signals,</b> independent of the structured perturbations. These <b>auxiliary</b> <b>signals</b> can be used either directly or indirectly to estimate—in an adaptive way—the frequency, the amplitude and the phase of the sinusoidal signals. More specifically, the direct approach is based on a simple gradient method, which ensures Input-to-State Stability of the estimation error with respect to the bounded-unstructured disturbances. The indirect method exploits a specific adaptive observer scheme equipped with a switching criterion allowing to properly address in a stable way the poor excitation scenarios. It is shown that the adaptive observer method can be applied for estimating multi-frequencies through an augmented but unified framework, which is a crucial advantage with respect to direct approaches. The estimators’ stability properties are also analyzed by Input-to-State-Stability (ISS) arguments. In the second part we present a non-asymptotic estimation methodology characterized by a distinctive feature that permits finite-time convergence of the estimates. Resorting to the Volterra integral operators with suitably designed kernels, the measured signal is processed, yielding a set of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>signals,</b> in which the influence of the unknown initial conditions is annihilated. A sliding mode-based adaptation law, fed by the aforementioned <b>auxiliary</b> <b>signals,</b> is proposed for deadbeat {{estimation of}} the frequency and amplitude, which are dealt with in a step-by-step manner. The worst case behavior of the proposed algorithm in the presence of bounded perturbation is studied by ISS tools. The practical characteristics of all estimation techniques are evaluated and compared with other existing techniques by extensive simulations and experimental trials. Open Acces...|$|R
