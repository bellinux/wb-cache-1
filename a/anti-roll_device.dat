40|$|In recent years, active {{secondary}} suspension concepts {{have been proposed}} in high-speed railway vehicles {{as a means to}} increase service speed maintaining the same level of ride comfort for passengers. Aim {{of this paper is to}} present the development of a concept for an active hydraulic <b>anti-roll</b> <b>device</b> to be introduced in the {{secondary suspension}} of a railway vehicle, replacing the traditional mechanical anti-roll bar, incorporating the capability to provide carbody tilt up to 2 Deg. target, reducing passengers’ exposure to lateral acceleration in curves and allowing to raise service speed on existing high speed lines. The performances of the proposed active suspension are assessed by means of numerical simulation, showing the possibility to raise the speed of the vehicle on an existing high-speed line from 300 to 340 km/h keeping a comparable level of comfort...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-speed}} catamaran boat used by {{this study}} has attached trim tabs to the stern both sides as the antirolling 	device for reducing the rolling. A PD control was initially employed in the system, and the observed data from 	the instrument showed the anti-rolling effect. However no significant improvement was observed for passengers 	although instrumental data showed good results. Therefore, it is not evaluated highly as the <b>anti-rolling</b> <b>device.</b> In 	this paper, fuzzy control system {{is applied to the}} <b>anti-rolling</b> <b>device</b> of a high-speed catamaran boat in order to improve 	the passenger comfort. Measurements of rolling data using the real ship were carried out. From the analysis 	results of the frequency analysis, the presented fuzzy control system suppressed the rolling of ship about 60 % in 	maximum peak than the PD control. Also, crews have felt the anti-rolling effect of the fuzzy control, and it showed 	that this system provided good comfort ride. 本研究で扱う高速双胴船には,横揺れの低減のためのアンチ・ローリング装置として,両側の船尾にト 	リムタブが取り付けられている. この装置の制御にはPD制御が用いられており,計測器から得られるデー 	タより,減揺効果がある程度認められている. しかし,実際の乗客の体感としては,さほど効果が得られ 	ておらず,減揺装置としては高い評価が得られていない. そこで本論文では,乗客の乗り心地を改善する 	ために,高速双胴船のアンチ・ローリング装置の制御にファジィ制御を用いる. 実船における実験より, 	ローリングデータを計測し,周波数分析を行った. 分析結果より,最大ピーク時でファジィ制御の方がPD 	制御より約 60 %揺動が抑制されていた. また,ファジィ制御の揺動抑制効果は乗組員によっても体感する 	ことができ,スムーズな制御を感じることができた...|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{request of}} the United States Department of the Navy, the National Academy of Sciences {{established}} a committee chaired by Durand to investigate <b>anti-rolling</b> <b>devices</b> on ships. The ability to stabilize a ship such as an aircraft carrier would be extremely useful during the landing of airplanes. The committee established an experimental laboratory at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Dr. Nicolas Minorsky worked on roll stabilization of ships for the navy from 1934 to 1940, designing in 1938 an activated-tank stabilization system into a 5-ton model ship. [...] A full-scale version of the system was tested in the USS Hamilton but exhibited control stability problems. Very promising results were beginning to appear when {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War interrupted further development as the Hamilton was called to active duty and the 5 ton model was put into storage.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some background}} for {{an analysis of}} the risk of severe parametric roll motion for a ship operating in head seas. This background includes a consideration of basic probabilistic qualities of parametric roll in head seas: ergodic qualities and distributions, since these results are necessary to establish a method of prediction of extreme values. The ship motions that generate parametric excitation, heave and pitch, have also been studied in this analysis. The post-Panamax C 11 class container carrier was chosen for analysis, since a vessel of this type is known to have suffered significant damage in an incident attributed to severe parametric roll. It was shown that despite large-amplitude of motion, pitch and heave retain their ergodic qualities and normal character of distribution, while the roll motions are clearly non-ergodic and do not have a normal distribution. The analysis is built upon the numerical simulation of ship motion in head seas using Large Amplitude Motion Program (LAMP). The paper also considers the effectiveness of <b>anti-rolling</b> <b>devices</b> in mitigating parametric roll by suppressing the parametric excitation. It was shown with numerical simulation that correctly tuned U-tube type of anti-rolling tank has to potential to reduce the occurrence of parametric roll and significantly increase the stability and safety of large modern container carriers...|$|R
50|$|Z-bar and roll-inducing springs: Mercedes-Benz introduced, to {{help their}} low-pivot swing-axle, a coil spring mounted transversally above the differential, which would {{transfer}} load {{from one side to}} the other, so as to force down one wheel when the other side went up. This coil spring increases the load bearing capacity of the rear suspension, so a new lower pressure set of springs was substituted for the usual ones to maintain ride suppleness. A similar effect was achieved by VW's Z-bar, a roll-bar, as opposed to <b>anti-rolling</b> bar. Both <b>devices</b> increase the rolling tendency of the rear axles, thus reducing the oversteering tendency. Aftermarket roll-inducing springs, also called camber compensators, are available for Porsche, VW and early Corvairs, which reduce oversteering tendencies at the cost of increasing suspension harshness.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 Micro Electro-Machnical Systems (MEMS) {{applications}} are fastest development technology present. MEMS processes leverage mainstream IC technologies to achieve on chip sensor interface and signal processing circuitry, multi-vendor accessibility, short design cycles, more on-chip functions and low cost. MEMS fabrications {{are based on}} thin-film surface microstructures, bulk micromaching, and LIGA processes. This thesis centered on developing optical micromaching inertial sensors based on MEMS fabrication technology which incorporates bulk Si into microstructures. Micromachined inertial sensors, consisting of the accelerometers and gyroscopes, {{are one of the}} most important types of silicon-based sensors. Microaccelerometers alone have the second largest sales volume after pressure sensors, and it is believed that gyroscopes will soon be mass produced at the similar volumes occupied by traditional gyroscopes. A traditional gyroscope is a device for measuring or maintaining orientation, based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The essence of the gyroscope machine is a spinning wheel on an axle. The device, once spinning, tends to resist changes to its orientation due to the angular momentum of the wheel. In physics this phenomenon is also known as gyroscopic inertia or rigidity in space. The {{applications are}} limited by the huge volume. MEMS Gyroscopes, which are using the MEMS fabrication technology to minimize the size of gyroscope systems, are of great importance in commercial, medical, automotive and military fields. They can be used in cars for ASS systems, for <b>anti-roll</b> <b>devices</b> and for navigation in tall buildings areas where the GPS system might fail. They can also be used for the navigation of robots in tunnels or pipings, for leading capsules containing medicines or diagnostic equipment in the human body, or as 3 -D computer mice. The MEMS gyroscope chips are limited by high precision measurement because of the unprecision electrical readout system. The market is in need for highly accurate, high-G-sustainable inertial measuring units (IMU's). The approach optical sensors have been around for a while now and because of the performance, the mall volume, the simplicity has been popular. However the production cost of optical applications is not satisfaction with consumer. Therefore, the MEMS fabrication technology makes the possibility for the low cost and micro optical devices like light sources, the waveguide, the high thin fiber optical, the micro photodetector, and vary demodulation measurement methods. Optic sensors may be defined as a means through which a measurand interacts with light guided in an optical fiber (an intrinsic sensor) or guided to (and returned from) an interaction region (an extrinsic sensor) by an optical fiber to produce an optical signal related to the parameter of interest. During its over 30 years of history, fiber optic sensor technology has been successfully applied by laboratories and industries worldwide in the detection of a large number of mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic, radiation, chemical, motion, flow and turbulence of fluids, and biomedical parameters. The fiber optic sensors provided advantages over conventional electronic sensors, of survivability in harsh environments, immunity to Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI), light weight, small size, compatibility with optical fiber communication systems, high sensitivity for many measurands, and good potential of multiplexing. In general, the transducers used in these fiber optic sensor systems are either an intensity-modulator or a phase-modulator. The optical interferometers, such as Mach-Zehnder, Michelson, Sagnac and Fabry-Perot interferometers, have become widely accepted as a phase modulator in optical sensors for the ultimate sensitivity to a range of weak signals. According to the light source being used, the interferometric sensors can be simply classified as either a coherence interferometric sensor if a the interferometer is interrogated by a coherent light source, such as a laser or a monochromatic light, or a lowcoherence interferometric sensor when a broadband source a light emitting diode (LED) or a superluminescent diode (SLD), is used. This thesis proposed a novel micro electro-mechanical gyroscope system with optical interferometer readout system and fabricated by MEMS technology, which is an original contribution in design and research on micro opto-electro-mechanical gyroscope systems (MOEMS) to provide the better performances than the current MEMS gyroscope. Fiber optical interferometric sensors have been proved more sensitive, precision than other electrical counterparts at the measurement micro distance. The MOMES gyroscope system design is based on the existing successful MEMS vibratory gyroscope and micro fiber optical interferometer distances sensor, which avoid large size, heavy weight and complex fabrication processes comparing with fiber optical gyroscope using Sagnac effect. The research starts from the fiber optical gyroscope based on Sagnac effect and existing MEMS gyroscopes, then moving to the novel design about MOEMS gyroscope system to discuss the operation principles and the structures. In this thesis, the operation principles, mathematics models and performances simulation of the MOEMS gyroscope are introduced, and the suitable MEMS fabrication processes will be discussed and presented. The first prototype model will be sent and fabricated by the manufacture for the further real time performance testing. There are a lot of inventions, further research and optimize around this novel MOEMS gyroscope chip. In future studying, the research will be putted on integration three axis Gyroscopes in one micro structure by optical sensor multiplexing principles, and the new optical devices like more powerful light source, photosensitive materials etc., and new demodulation processes, which can improve the performance and the interface to co-operate with other inertial sensors and navigation system...|$|R
