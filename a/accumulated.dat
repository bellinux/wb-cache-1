With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans.

After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{accumulation}} {{is central to}} the idea of integration, and therefore {{is at the core of}} understanding many ideas and applications in calculus. On one hand, the idea of accumulation is trivial. You <b>accumulate</b> a quantity by getting more of it. We <b>accumulate</b> injuries as we exercise. We <b>accumulate</b> junk as we grow older. We <b>accumulate</b> wealth by gaining more of it. There are some details to consider, such as whether it makes sense to think of <b>accumulating</b> a negative amount of a quantity, but the main idea is straightforward. On the other hand, the idea of accumulation is anything but straightforward. First, students find it is hard to think of something <b>accumulating</b> when they cannot conceptualize the “bits ” that <b>accumulate.</b> To understand the idea of accomplished work, for example, as accruing incrementally means that one must think of each momentary total amount of work as the sum of past increments, and of every additional incremental bit of work as being composed of a force applied through a distance. Second, the mathematical idea of an accumulation function, represented as F x () = f t () dt a...|$|R
