5|$|After the season, Kershaw and the Dodgers {{agreed on}} a seven-year, $215 million, {{contract}} extension. The deal was the richest in MLB history for a pitcher, eclipsing the seven-year, $180 million, contract signed by Justin Verlander the previous year. The average <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of $30.7 million was also the largest ever for a baseball player, beating the $28 million Roger Clemens received in 2007 and the 10-year, $275 million contract that Alex Rodriguez signed that same year.|$|E
5|$|With {{one year}} {{remaining}} until {{he would become}} eligible for free agency, Jeter signed a ten-year, $189million contract before the 2001 season to remain with the Yankees. Alex Rodriguez had signed a ten-year, $252million contract with the Texas Rangers earlier in the offseason, setting the market for Jeter's negotiations. Jeter became the second-highest-paid athlete across all team sports and auto racing, trailing only Rodriguez. The $18.9million average <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of Jeter's contract was the third-highest in baseball, behind only Rodriguez ($25.2million) and Manny Ramirez ($20million).|$|E
50|$|Precipitation is {{relatively}} {{lower in the}} central part of the region where the total <b>annual</b> <b>values</b> are around 700 - 800 mm. In the areas with higher elevation (such as Žďárské Vrchy or the foothills of Orlické Hory) there is higher precipitation with <b>annual</b> <b>values</b> of 800 - 1,000 mm.|$|R

5|$|With {{the salary}} cap {{decreasing}} in the off-season Vancouver needed to unload salary. Ballard had two years remaining on his contract with an <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> $4.2 million. The Canucks tried to trade Ballard {{in an attempt to}} avoid using a compliance buyout on him. When that failed the team placed him on waivers. He cleared waivers before Vancouver ultimately bought him out. Two days after becoming a free agent he signed a two-year $3 million contract with the Minnesota Wild.|$|E
5|$|From medieval times, English {{companies}} {{thrived in}} Calais. Calais {{was a particularly}} important centre in the production and trade of wool and cloth, which outweighed the costs of maintaining the town as part of England. In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English. There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees. The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware. Principal imports in the early 20th century included cotton and silk goods, coal, iron and steel, petroleum, timber, raw wool, cotton yarn and cork. During the five years 1901–1905 the average <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of exports was £8,388,000 (£6,363,000 in the years 1896–1900), of imports £4,145,000 (£3,759,000 in 1896–1900).|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Boras {{negotiated}} a record five-year, $28 million contract for Greg Maddux with the Atlanta Braves, eclipsing the second-best offer by $9 million. The contract trailed only David Cone's contract {{in terms of}} <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> and was two years longer.|$|E

40|$|Thermoluminescence {{dosimetry}} {{has been}} used to measure air kerma in 29 sites in Sicily. Four three month measurement campaigns have been carried out in order to assess seasonal variations. Average <b>annual</b> <b>values</b> between 20 and 90 nGy h 1, after cosmic background subtraction, are reported. Average <b>annual</b> <b>values</b> are strongly dependent on site lithology, and we find that winter data are generally the highest, while spring and autumn rates are generally the lowest with very similar trends in any site. Summer values generally lay in between. Largest seasonal variations are found in sites along the southern coast of the island, probably because of stronger action of winds affecting radon, along with its progeny, concentrations at ground level...|$|R

25|$|On July 5, 2017, McDavid {{signed an}} 8-year, $100 million {{extension}} with the Edmonton Oilers. The average <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of $12.5 {{million per year}} is {{the highest in the}} NHL, surpassing the $10.5 million contracts held by Carey Price, Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane.|$|E
25|$|Around 1508, having {{inherited}} his father's wealth, Colet formed {{his plan}} for the re-foundation of St Paul's School, which he completed in 1512, and endowed with estates of an <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of £122 and upwards. The school, dedicated to the Child Jesus, was in place to give young boys a Christian education.|$|E
25|$|Rainfall is {{distributed}} unevenly, with minimal amounts in Turda–Câmpia Turzii (about 550mm) and maximum in Vlădeasa Massif (about 1,400mm). On average, <b>annual</b> <b>values</b> of rainfall reach 600–650mm in the Transylvania Plain, 650–700mm in the Someș Plateau and over 900–1000mm in mountainous areas.|$|R

25|$|On November 5, 2014, the Penguins signed Fleury to a {{four-year}} extension with an average <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of $5.75 million. On November 18, 2014, he earned his first shutout against the Montreal Canadiens, making 27 saves for a league-leading fourth shutout of the season, with a final score of 4–0. On November 24, 2014, Fleury recorded his 300th NHL win, becoming the third-youngest player and third-fastest to reach the milestone. On April 11, Fleury recorded his league leading tenth shutout in a 2–0 victory against the Buffalo Sabres to secure the last wild card spot in the East.|$|E
25|$|The Domesday survey {{therefore}} {{recorded the}} names of the new holders of lands and the assessments on which their tax was to be paid. But it did more than this; by the king's instructions, it endeavoured to make a national valuation list, estimating the <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of all the land in the country, (1) at the time of Edward the Confessor's death, (2) when the new owners received it, (3) {{at the time of the}} survey, and further, it reckoned, by command, the potential value as well. It is evident that William desired to know the financial resources of his kingdom, and it is probable that he wished to compare them with the existing assessment, which was one of considerable antiquity, though there are traces that it had been occasionally modified. The great bulk of Domesday Book is devoted to the somewhat arid details of the assessment and valuation of rural estates, which were as yet the only important source of national wealth. After stating the assessment of the manor, the record sets forth the amount of arable land, and the number of plough teams (each reckoned at eight oxen) available for working it, with the additional number (if any) that might be employed; then the river-meadows, woodland, pasture, fisheries (i.e. fishing weirs), water-mills, salt-pans (if by the sea) and other subsidiary sources of revenue; the peasants are enumerated in their several classes; and finally the <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of the whole, past and present, is roughly estimated.|$|E
25|$|Illinois {{is one of}} the nation's {{manufacturing}} leaders, boasting <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> added productivity by manufacturing of over $107billion in 2006. As of 2011, Illinois {{is ranked}} as the 4th most productive manufacturing state in the country, behind California, Texas, and Ohio. About three-quarters of the state's manufacturers are located in the Northeastern Opportunity Return Region, with 38 percent of Illinois's approximately 18,900 manufacturing plants located in Cook County. As of 2006, the leading manufacturing industries in Illinois, based upon value-added, were chemical manufacturing ($18.3billion), machinery manufacturing ($13.4billion), food manufacturing ($12.9billion), fabricated metal products ($11.5billion), transportation equipment ($7.4billion), plastics and rubber products ($7.0billion), and computer and electronic products ($6.1billion).|$|E

25|$|When in 1551 the {{mismanagement}} of Sir William Dansell, King's Merchant to the Low Countries, {{had caused the}} English Government much financial embarrassment, the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals. Gresham advocated the adoption of various methods– highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair— for raising {{the value of the}} pound sterling on the bourse of Antwerp which proved so successful that {{in just a few years}} King Edward VI had discharged almost all of his debts. The Government sought Gresham's advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services received from King Edward various grants of lands, the <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of which at that time amounted ultimately to about 400 pounds a year.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that same}} year, the Capitals signed Jágr to the then-largest {{contract}} ever in NHL history at $77 million over seven years, an average <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of $11 million, with {{an option for}} an eighth year. Jágr, however, did {{not live up to}} expectations in Washington, as the Capitals failed to defend their division title and missed the playoffs in 2002. For the first time during his tenure with the Capitals, Jágr failed to finish among the NHL's top scorers, make the post-season or make the NHL All-Star Team. During the summer of 2002, the Capitals reunited Jágr with former linemate Robert Lang. In 2002–03, Washington managed to finish sixth overall in the Eastern Conference, but lost to the upstart Tampa Bay Lightning {{in the first round of}} the 2003 playoffs despite winning the series' first two games.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the nuances of the term {{reasonable}} may have allowed the UK courts to deal with the merits of grievances rather than questions of legality, and hence to engage in judicial policy-making. However, it seems that Singapore courts have so far avoided substituting their opinion for that of decision-makers in applying the Wednesbury test. In Lines International, the High Court clearly noted that in considering Wednesbury unreasonableness courts are not entitled to substitute their views of how the discretion should be exercised, nor is unreasonableness established if the court is of the view that the policy or guideline may not work as effectively as another. This principle has been adopted and emphasized in subsequent cases. In City Developments the court declined to interfere with the Chief Assessor's assessment of the <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of the applicant's real property for property tax purposes, finding his explanations logical and commonsensical. The courts came to similar conclusions in Chee Siok Chin and Kang Ngah Wei.|$|E

50|$|The {{island of}} Montecristo, {{like all the}} islands of the archipelago, has a mild climate, with a {{constant}} sea breeze, lots of sun, and very little rainfall (average <b>annual</b> <b>values</b> much lower than 500 mm); the climate is characterised by mild and moderately rainy winters and summers that are hot and dry, but sometimes very muggy.|$|R
25|$|Students are {{admitted}} after {{they pass the}} Higher Secondary Exam (HSC exam). In earlier days students partake in entrance examinations, a separate one for each department. But now students need to partake under unit of different faculty. This has been a contentious issue, as {{there used to be}} only one exam for each faculty, after which students would be allocated to departments according to their result and choice of program. As a public university, University of Rajshahi's tuition fees are relatively low; nevertheless, a hike in admission fees, during the 2006–07 session, have drawn criticism from student bodies. As of 2007, the university awards a total of 340 scholarships, whose <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> is around 1.1million taka. In addition, there are merit awards given by residential halls, departments and the university itself. Students are also eligible for the Prime Minister's Gold Medal award. All colleges of the northern and southern regions of the country used to be affiliated with University of Rajshahi. However, the administration of colleges across the country was taken over by the National University when it was established in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the reign}} of Queen Anne, such {{pensions}} and annuities were charged on the hereditary revenues of the sovereign and were held to be binding on the sovereign's successors. By the Taxation, etc. Act 1702 (I Anne c. 7) it was provided that no portion of the hereditary revenues could be charged with pensions beyond {{the life of the}} reigning sovereign. This act did not affect the hereditary revenues of Ireland and Scotland, and many persons were quartered, as they had been before the act, on the Irish and Scottish revenues who could not be provided for in England for example, the Duke of St Albans, illegitimate son of Charles II, had an Irish pension of £800 a year (£ today); Catherine Sedley, mistress of James II, had an Irish pension of £5,000 a year; the Duchess of Kendall and the Countess of Darlington, respectively mistress and half-sister of George I, had pensions of the united <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of £5,000 (£ today), while Madame de Wallmoden, a mistress of George II, had a pension of £3,000 (£ today).|$|E
25|$|Trafficking {{diverted}} {{an estimated}} one cent of each SNAP dollar ($330 million annually) from SNAP benefits between 2006 and 2008. Trafficking has declined over time from nearly 4 {{percent in the}} 1990s. About 8.2 percent of all stores trafficked from 2006 to 2008 compared to the 10.5 percent of SNAP authorized stores involved in trafficking in 2011. A variety of store characteristics and settings {{were related to the}} level of trafficking. Although large stores accounted for 87.3 percent of all SNAP redemptions, they only accounted for about 5.4 percent of trafficking redemptions. Trafficking was much less likely to occur among publicly owned than privately owned stores and was much less likely among stores in areas with less poverty rather than more. The total <b>annual</b> <b>value</b> of trafficked benefits increased at about the same rate as overall program growth. The current estimate of total SNAP dollars trafficked is higher than observed in the previous 2002–2005 time period. This increase is consistent, however, with the almost 37 percent growths in average annual SNAP benefits from the 2002–2005 study periods to the most recent one. The methodology used to generate these estimates has known limitations. However, given variable data and resources, it is the most practical approach available to FNS. Further improvements to SNAP trafficking estimates would require new resources to assess the prevalence of trafficking among a random sample of stores.|$|E
