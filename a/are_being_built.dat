5|$|As {{the cost}} of solar {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>built.</b> Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>built</b> every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E

5|$|Electricity for Canberra mainly {{comes from}} the {{national}} power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan). Power was first supplied from a thermal plant built in 1913, near the Molonglo River, but this was finally closed in 1957. A 20 megawatt photovoltaic solar plant, described as the largest photovoltaic solar farm in Australia, was officially opened at Royalla on 3 September 2014. The 2.3 megawatt Mount Majura solar farm was opened in Majura on 6 October 2016. Construction is under way on a 13 megawatt solar farm at Mugga Lane, Hume and an 11 megawatt solar farm at Williamsdale. The Williamsdale solar farm was originally planned to be built at Uriarra but faced local opposition. In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot water systems. Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at Belconnen and Mugga Lane. There are currently no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>built</b> or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020. This will raise the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these {{are expected to be}} operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power per year from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016. The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available {{for the establishment of a}} facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.|$|E

25|$|When {{situated}} on a suitable site, a gravity dam can {{prove to be}} a better alternative to other types of dams.
