5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has {{implemented}} a mine-awareness educational programme {{aimed at reducing}} the frequency of mine-related accidents through an ongoing information campaign. The programme is conducted by the Croatian Red Cross, the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports {{and a number of}} NGOs in cooperation with the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The Croatian Mine Action Centre actively supports NGOs to develop as many programmes as possible and <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> NGOs to mine-awareness and educational activities. It maintains an accessible online database with cartographic information on the location of mine-suspected areas in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year, Amazing {{contained}} primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to <b>attract</b> <b>new,</b> high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, and Murray Leinster all avoided Amazing because Gernsback {{took so long}} to pay for the stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known to many of the other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.|$|E

5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress {{to suspend}} the anti-slavery clause of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years. Harrison claimed it was {{necessary}} to increase the territory's population more quickly and <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal government would not longer have to financially support it. In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, {{amendments}} to the Indian Act made school attendance compulsory for Indigenous children between 7 and 16 years of age. The changes included a series of exemptions regarding school location, {{the health of the}} children and their prior completion of school examinations. It was changed to children between 6 and 15 years of age in 1908. The introduction of mandatory attendance was the result of pressure from missionary representatives. Reliant on student enrollment quotas to secure funding, they were struggling to <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> students due to increasingly poor school conditions.|$|E

Only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day. Future tenants will include Kids Creative, Legends Hospitality, the BMB Group, Servcorp, and GQ.|$|E

For {{a short period of}} time, Concourse D was used by Corporate Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became a regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection, at which point the concourse was closed by the MNAA. Currently, plans exist to expand Concourse D with additional gates to increase capacity and <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> airlines, as well as provide new retail and dining offerings.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, Children of Israel {{purchased}} land on Adams Avenue, {{with the}} intent of building a new synagogue there, but financial pressures delayed the project, and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and find a better one. They sold the lot in 1882, and instead purchased land on Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets. By 1884, they had completed a new synagogue building there, at a cost of $39,130 (today $). The Byzantine Revival structure had an impressive façade featuring twin tall spires and a large round window containing a Star of David. The building helped <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> members; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined, for a total of 173 member families, and the congregation was again debt-free. That year, the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Romeo Guest, a {{building}} contractor, {{met with the}} North Carolina state treasurer, Brandon Hodges, {{and the president of}} Wachovia, Robert Hanes, to discuss building a research park in North Carolina to <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> industries to the region. They obtained support for the concept of Research Triangle Park from state governor Luther Hodges and the three universities that form the research triangle: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University and North Carolina State University. The Research Triangle Institute (now RTI International) was formed as the research park's first tenant in 1958 by the park's founders. The following January they announced that $1.425 million had been raised by the Research Triangle Foundation to fund the park and that $500,000 of it had been set aside for RTI.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft {{considered}} Viva Piñata {{a success}} and the sequel's development team sought to make a more definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure set up for its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and a worthwhile improvement on the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks but were mixed on its multiplayer modes and camera integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> players to the franchise. Trouble in Paradise was later included in the developer's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, are dry towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some {{of them are}} dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. For example, the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> businesses and increase property tax revenue.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{believed}} that the Populists' embrace of free silver would be the main issue to <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> members to the party. After the election, he attended {{a meeting of the}} American Bimetallic League, a pro-silver group, and gave speeches advocating an inflationist monetary policy. In the meantime, the Panic of 1893 caused bank failures, factory closures, and general economic upheaval. As the federal gold reserves dwindled, President Cleveland convinced Congress to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which ensured the government would purchase less silver for coining and which further disconcerted free silver supporters. While depletion of gold reserves slowed after the repeal, the country's economy still floundered.|$|E

5|$|When Daniels was elected, {{he stated}} his number one {{priority}} was job creation. To achieve that goal, he created the public-private Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), became chairman of its board, and ordered it to “act {{at the speed of}} business, not the speed of government,” to <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> jobs. During its first year, the IEDC closed more transactions than similar efforts had during the previous two years combined. Between 2005 and 2008, 485 businesses committed to creating more than 60,000 new jobs and invest $14.5 billion into the Indiana economy. By the end of the administration, IEDC claimed to have closed on almost 1,500 deals to create a projected 169,000 new jobs since 2005.|$|E
5|$|White's {{ability to}} <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> writers {{suffered}} {{because of the}} low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would <b>attract</b> <b>new</b> industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E
