In these epistles, {{it would have been}} natural for me to have pointed out to my father and my friend, that I was at present in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could improve myself in no respect, unless in the mysteries of hunting and hawking; and where I was not unlikely to forget, in the company of rude grooms and horse-boys, any useful knowledge or elegant accomplishments which I had hitherto acquired. It would also have been natural that I should have expressed the disgust and tedium which I was likely to feel among beings whose whole souls were centred in field-sports or more degrading pastimes--that I should have complained of the habitual intemperance of the family in which I was a guest, and the difficulty and almost resentment with which my uncle, Sir Hildebrand, received any apology for deserting the bottle. This last, indeed, was a topic on which my father, himself a man of severe temperance, was likely to be easily alarmed, and to have touched upon this spring would to a certainty have opened the doors of my prison-house, and would either have been the means of abridging my exile, or at least would have procured me a change of residence during my rustication.|$|E

40|$|While type I interferons (IFNs) are universally {{acknowledged}} {{for their}} antiviral and immunostimulatory functions, {{there is increasing}} appreciation of the detrimental effects of inappropriate, excessive, or mistimed type I IFN responses in viral and bacterial infections. The underlying mechanisms by which type I IFNs promote susceptibility or severity include direct tissue damage by apoptosis induction or suppression of pro-liferation in tissue cells, immunopathology due to excessive inflammation, and cell death induced by TRAIL-and Fas-expressing immune cells, as well as immunosuppression through IL- 10, IL- 27, PD-L 1, IL- 1 Ra, and other regulatory molecules that antagonize the induction or action of IL- 1, IL- 12, IL- 17, IFN-g, KC, and other effectors of the immune response. Bacterial superinfections following influenza infection are a prominent example of <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> type <b>I</b> IFNs can misdirect the immune response.

[...] Within days of the EPs release, Watson had attracted the attention of just about every record label in the land and soon inked a deal with Warner Bros. Records. Part of the appeal, he says, was the labels long-running success with male solo artists as diverse as David Gray, Damien Rice, and Neil Young. Later that year Watsons second EP Another four sad songs was released. It included a cover of [...] "Lamplight", a song originally by Bombay Bicycle Club.|$|R

The dilemma reflects <b>a</b> classroom <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> as <b>an</b> educator have trouble dividing my focus, my focus is either put on entire the class or on the child with special needs. Through this self-perceived situation I have started to question how children with special needs find their place in the school today. I discuss how I can handle and look at the unique situation that occurs when meeting this child. Terms like integration, inclusion, segregation, social rights and the expression "a school for everyone" will be discussed in this text, as well as how we can connect these terms and expressions to the problems I find in the school system’s way of handling children with special needs. I also highlight my dilemma from different ethical perspective. I chose to use Kants duty ethics, Mills utilitarianism (commercial ethics) and Aristotle’s virtue ethics to bring light on my dilemma, but also to find help in my professional role as a leisure pedagogue. The main question my essay deals with is this: How can you, as an educator, have a focus on the class as a whole, {{but at the same time}} pay attention to the child with special needs...|$|R
60|$|Hard by {{the scene}} of this pathetic passage a pair of quite well-dressed young people had thrown themselves, side by side, on the September grass {{as if it had}} been the sand at any American seashore, or the embrowned herbage of Hyde Park in July. Perhaps the {{shelving}} ground was dryer than the moist levels where the professional unemployed lay in scores; but I do not think it would have mattered to that tender pair if it had been very damp; so warmly were they lapped in love's dream, they could not have taken cold. The exile could only note the likeness of their open-air love-making to that in public places at home, and contrast it with the decorum of Latin countries where nothing of the kind is known. If anything, English lovers of this type are franker than with us, doubtless because of the greater simplicity of the English nature; and they seem to be of a better class. One day when I was sitting in a penny chair in Green Park, the agent of the company came and collected the rent of me. I thought it a hardship, for I had purposely chosen <b>an</b> inconspicuous <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> should not be found, and it was long past the end of the season, when no company should have had the heart to collect rent for its chairs. But I met my fate without murmuring, and as the young man who sold me a ticket good for the whole day at a penny, was obviously not pressed with business, I tried to recoup myself by a little conversation.|$|R
5000|$|For {{about four}} months in 1998, Cantrell locked himself in his home to write the 25 songs.

[...] Consequently, Degradation Trip boasts various dark themes and bleak visuals. Songs like [...] "Bargain Basement Howard Hughes" [...] and [...] "Pig Charmer" [...] directly relate to the relationship between Cantrell and former bandmate Layne Staley. [...] "Owned" [...] and [...] "Pro False Idol" [...] question the career of Cantrell and his status as a musician, while [...] "Feel the Void" [...] and [...] "31/32" [...] explore the concept of lives wasted. Cantrell elaborated, [...] "Throughout the process of making this record, I often wondered at times whether I was insane or not. Sitting here, thinking back on it now, I probably had my moments." [...] He also noted, however, the satisfaction in having released the album as he wanted and being able to put all of the intimate expression to bed.|$|E
5000|$|The Grinch first {{appeared}} in a 32-line illustrated poem by Dr. Seuss called [...] "The Hoobub and the Grinch," [...] which was originally published in the May 1955 edition of Redbook magazine. Dr. Seuss began work on How the Grinch Stole Christmas! a couple years later, around the beginning of 1957. He had recently completed The Cat in the Hat {{and was in the}} midst of founding Beginner Books with Phyllis and Bennett Cerf and his wife, Helen Palmer Geisel. Helen, who had ongoing medical problems and had suffered a small stroke in April 1957, nevertheless acted as an unofficial editor, as she had with previous Dr. Seuss books. Dr. Seuss wrote the book quickly and was mostly finished with it within a few weeks. Biographers Judith and Neil Morgan wrote, [...] "It was the easiest book of his career to write, except for its conclusion." [...] According to Dr. Seuss, [...] "I got hung up getting the Grinch out of the mess. I got into <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> sounded like a second-rate preacher or some biblical truisim... Finally in desperation... without making any statement whatever, I showed the Grinch and the Whos together at the table, and made a pun of the Grinch carving the 'roast beast.' ... I had gone through thousands of religious choices, and then after three months it came out like that." [...] By mid-May 1957, the book was finished and in the mail to the Random House offices in New York. In June, the Dr. Seuss and his wife took a month-long vacation to Hawaii, where he checked and returned the book's galley proof. The book debuted in December 1957, in both a book version published by Random House and in an issue of Redbook. Dr. Seuss dedicated the book to Theodor [...] "Teddy" [...] Owens, the one-year-old son of his niece, Peggy Owens.|$|E

The studio completed a theatrical trailer for the film, which was shown in theaters and prior to the Universal ride created by Zombie. Zombie later received a call for a meeting with Stacey Snider, head of Universal, requesting a meeting. Zombie recalled fearing that the studio would demand a re-shoot, though he later learned that Snider's fears of the film receiving an NC-17 rating had led to the company's refusal {{to release the}} film. The film remained shelved for several months, with Zombie eventually purchasing the rights to the film from Universal. Zombie claimed that many urged him to scrap the film following the fallout with Universal, though he continued to search for a new distributor.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} upon the impact of fiscal incentives on firm’s innovative performance. We use data from the 7 th, 8 th and 9 th waves of the â€œIndagine sulle Imprese Manifatturiere Italianeâ€ by Unicredit (previously managed by Capitalia-Mediocredito Centrale), which contains information on both product and process innovation by manufacturing firms, on the amount of resources invested in R&D (if such amount is positive) and it is also informative of the existence of forms of fiscal incentive for R&D and investment in innovative activities. In our study we use different techniques. First we look at Average Treatment Effects, under the assumption of â€œselection on observablesâ€, implying that the econometrician has access to all the variables affecting the likelihood of being treated. In this part of the paper we verify whether -everything else constant (i. e. for a given value of the propensity score) - there is evidence that firms that have access to fiscal incentives tend to innovate more. In the second part of our study we cast some doubts on the plausibility of the â€œselection on observablesâ€ assumption and we look more in depth at one specific case of fiscal incentive: the one provided by Law 140 / 1999 to firms located in â€œdepressed areasâ€ (as defined by the law itself). We focus on this law because it is particularly important from a policy perspective within the Italian dual economy, but also because it allows us a more precise estimate of the treatment effect in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> treatment status (<b>i.</b> e. access to the incentive) is likely to depend to the same (unobserved) factors that affect the innovation outcome. In such <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> OLS estimated are biased and inconsistent and we have to use instrumental variable estimation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the claim that}} social rationality explains the emergence of one type of bubble in competitive asset markets that we shall refer to as “credit market bubble, ” and that individual rationality explains the subsequent crash. The bubble is defined as <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> (<b>i)</b> the debt is priced above its intrinsic value and (ii) the debt is rolled over even though each creditor should cash in as it is commonly known that the debtor {{would never be able}} to repay the debt at face value. Building on evidence from behavioral game theory, we conjecture that credit market bubbles emerge whenever the debtor’s payment ability, although never sufficient, grows over time. As such, bubbles are beneficial, even if they eventually lead to crashes which cause re-distribution of wealth away from those who ride the bubble too long. We argue that this captures the essence of many financial bubbles alleged to have been observed in the real world. Experimental data confirm the emergence of bubbles in this setting. The bubbles are robust – they re-emerge upon replication – but decay can be avoided by adding noise, e. g., through random replacing participants with (informed) newcomers. The presence of financial markets increases the overall beneficial effects of the bubbles. Prices always remain abov...|$|E

40|$|My work {{centers around}} the fact that I am a {{glassblower}} working with glass objects within a glasstradition. My BFA project from 2009 entitled ”the bastards have landed” was my first attempt atmapping out what that ultimately meant {{to me as a}} practitioner in a contemporary craft context. Theresult of that project was a discovery of my making as a way of using tradition to tell stories aboutitself. My conclusion was that by using the traditional objects as symbols I had a channel throughwhich I could communicate. Glass is a material who´s domains are closely connected to a domesticand consumeristic environment. It is put in a position where we react to its appearance with ourbody memory while also carries different social and material values depending on its appearance. When entering the master program at Konstfack University of Art Craft and Design, my idea wasthat over the next coming two years my focus would lie in the exploration and research of thesemechanisms as well as my own position as a maker and practitioner within these mechanisms. Craft, design and making are subjects that are constantly being talked about and analyzed from anumber of perspectives. There are philosophers, sociologists, historians and art historians constantlynegotiating what the field of craft is dealing with. This is something that I over the years have foundas something quite disturbing in some cases. This leaves me in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am no longerdefining my own practice. And when I am to define my practice I always do it through the ideas ofpeople from ”outside” my own position. There are many good writers from variousdisciplines writing about craft and making that I have had great use of and input from but I feel thatthere is a big lack of craft practitioners who are defining their discipline from their own standpoint. This situation is to me a bit outdated. So as mentioned above I have entered the master program with an idea {{to find out how to}} deal withveiled subjects such as tacit knowledge and material culture in order to try to transform them into acommunicative body of knowledge. My work during the past three semesters have been spread outover a number of different projects dealing with these subjects both based on objects as well asforming a discussion together with my master group. The main cause in this thesis is as always in my case to shed light on and to formulate questionsand hopefully answers around my own practice and its related subjects. The main reason for this is that craft and making as a tool for knowledge production is a cloudedsubject but according to me it holds a lot of potential.

40|$|Understanding and {{estimating}} {{the impact of}} fiscal incentives on innovation are crucial elements for policy evaluation. This is so because innovation- be it of the product or the process type- is able to move the production frontier and hence, ultimately, enlarge society’s consumption possibilities (as shown by the endogenous growth literature). However, {{despite the fact that}} innovation is the final goal of public policy, most studies look at the relationship between R&D expenses and fiscal policy, perhaps considering that the relationship between innovation and R&D is strong and deterministic. However, there exists evidence that such a relationship is neither strong nor deterministic. In fact, if the innovation is a process to which many factors contribute (including R&D), from our perspective the interesting policy question becomes: do fiscal incentives designed–directly or indirectly (i. e. through R&D) to promote innovation - work? Hence, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the impact that fiscal incentives have on firms’ innovative performance. For this, we use data from the 7 th, 8 th and 9 th waves of the “Indagine sulle Imprese Manifatturiere Italiane” by Unicredit (previously managed by Capitalia-Mediocredito Centrale), which contains information on both product and process innovation by manufacturing firms, on the amount of resources invested in R&D (if such amount is positive) and it is also informative of the existence of forms of fiscal incentive for R&D and investment in innovative activities. This information is crucial for our study since it permits us to link firms’ innovation (the dependent variable in our exercise) to fiscal incentives. In our work, we use different techniques. First we look at Average Treatment Effects, under the assumption of “selection on observables”, implying that the econometrician has access to all the variables affecting the likelihood of being treated (i. e. have access to incentives for innovative activities). In this part of the report, we just want to verify whether- everything else remaining constant (i. e. for a given value of the propensity score obtained with the conditioning variables) - there is evidence that firms that have access to fiscal incentives tend to innovate more. In the second part of our study, we cast some doubts on the plausibility of the “selection on observables” assumption and we look in more depth at one specific case of fiscal incentive: the one provided by Law 140 / 1999 to firms located in “depressed areas” (as defined by the law itself).

This was important because it helped me imagine what I am trying to depict in my paintings. I didn’t just want to paint a picture of someone who looked depressed or anxious. I want whoever looks at these paintings to have some sort of insight into how people feel when they experience these mental illnesses, and I want someone who is feeling depressed or anxious to be able to look at the paintings and see them as a reflection of how they are feeling. Next, I began to work on the actual paintings. While painting, I decided it would be best if I was in a state of depression or anxiety (depending on which one I was working on). I started with depression. The biggest challenge of this painting was that I was trying to paint an emotion that is mostly a lack of emotion. After a few nights of working on the painting, I finally felt it accomplished what I was looking for. Anxiety was a bit more difficult for me to paint. I usually feel anxious when I’m in a crowd of people or overwhelmed with stressed, but when I had time to work on this painting, I was not in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> would normally have anxiety. I decided to try to trigger my anxiety, instead. By doing a few things that I would normally avoid (drinking a lot of caffeine and listening to specific noises), I was able to put myself into an anxious state. I was able to create an image that I felt represented anxiety, and from there, I could build it up and give it more depth without having to be in an anxious state. In between creating paintings and writing down what was going through my head, I formed some loose poems to go along with the paintings. Though I don’t want to force people to think of anything too specific while looking at my paintings, I think the poems help the viewer better understand what someone is going through while battling with these mental illnesses. I think my paintings will help viewers understand the day-to-day struggle for someone diagnosed with anxiety or depression. I also hope that these will bring awareness that depression isn’t just “feeling sad,” and anxiety isn’t just “worrying. ” They are very complex emotions that can take a huge toll on someone’s professional and personal life. I plan to create more paintings when I am feeling these and other emotions, and I hope they will help me better understand my own feelings as well as be a way for me to cope with them...|$|E
40|$|As {{professionals}} {{working in}} museum and academic settings, {{many of you}} have probably found yourselves feeling at times like 2 ̆ 2 poor cousins 2 ̆ 2 [...] textiles simply do not garner the same prestige as other types of artifacts and art forms. I now find myself in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> feel like an even poorer cousin: although I am involved with textiles of all kinds, I find myself particularly fascinated or compelled by a type of textile-related artifact that is rarely considered seriously, even by textile historians. I am speaking of fancywork, specifically of small items such as tidies, wallpockets, sewing cases, flowerpot covers, and penwipers. Such items continue to engage time and attention, even today, but were especially prevalent in the nineteenth century. Instructions for fancywork filled the pages of women 2 ̆ 7 s magazines and manuals, and 2 ̆ 2 fancy fairs, 2 ̆ 2 where the items were sold for fundraising purposes, were ubiquitous and profitable events. Fancywork once filled the Victorian parlor and boudoir, and fills the shelves of our museums today. The items are frequently dismissed as 2 ̆ 2 silly little things 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 useless 2 ̆ 2 time fillers [...] Geoffrey Warren, author of A Stitch in Time, even pronounced them a waste of intelligence and a sign of limited imagination (p. 16). Such contemporary judgements preclude real analysis, however, and do not take the items on their own terms. These sewn and stitched objects remain as nonverbal 2 ̆ 2 documents 2 ̆ 2 that tell us about the reality of the Victorian women who made them, and we must learn to read their expressive story. I will return to the objects themselves momentarily, but wish to begin with a consideration of terminology. No satisfactory definition of fancywork is available. Present-day dictionaries refer to it simply as decorative or ornamental needlework [...] it is contrasted with plain work — but there is no indication of boundary, no point where plain becomes fancy, and no delineation of technique or media. Today fancywork is often thought of as embroidery, knitting and crochet, but in nineteenth century usage the term was inclusive, and shell, wax, leather and even pine cone work was referred to the same way. Fancywork is an interesting term, one which is full of inherent contradictions, and captures the ambivalent Victorian attitude toward women and work. Women did of course work in actuality, but given the strong distinction and separation between the outside world of work and the inside world of the home, women were by definition not 2 ̆ 2 workers. 2 ̆ 2 Most of their tasks carried other names, but light, ornamental and non-pecuniary efforts — those that involved cloth and similar materials [...] were dubbed needlework or fancywork. 2 ̆ 7 Embroidery sections in the periodicals were called 2 ̆ 2 work sections, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 work departments, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 work baskets. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Women 2 ̆ 7 s work 2 ̆ 2 displays at county fairs were filled with needlework rather than vegetables or other products of agricultural labor. The 2 ̆ 2 fancy 2 ̆ 2 part of the term, however, implies almost the opposite of work. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a fancy is a fantasy or mental conception; it is synonymous with imagination. It is also a whim, a supposition resting on no solid ground; an entertainment; an invention; or something bred or manipulated into a more beautiful form (pp. 60 - 62) ...|$|E
40|$|Welcome to the June {{issue of}} EBLIP, our firstto be {{published}} with an HTML version as wellas PDFs for each article. I hope you enjoy andfind the alternative formats useful. As usualthe issue comprises an interesting range ofevidence summaries and articles that I hopeyou will find useful in applying evidence toyour practice. When considering evidence, two recent trips toEdinburgh got me {{thinking about the}} widerange of study designs or methods that areuseful for generating evidence, and also howwe can learn about their use from otherprofessions. The first trip was {{as part of the}} cadre of the LISDREaM project ([URL] has been set up by the LISResearch Coalition to develop a sustainableLIS research network in the UK. As part ofthis, a series of workshops aims to introduceLIS practitioners to a wider range of researchmethods, thus expanding the methods used inLIS research. Indeed, a quick scan of thecontents of this issue show a preponderance ofsurveys, interviews, and citation analysis,suggesting that broadening our knowledge ofmethods may well be a useful idea. Theworkshops are highly interactive and, at eachsession experts from outside the LIS disciplineintroduce particular research methods andoutline how they could be used in LISapplications. As a result, I can see the valueand understand when to use research methodssuch as social network analysis, horizonscanning, ethnography, discourse analysis, andrepertory grids – as well as knowing that datamining is something I’m likely to avoid! So farI’ve shared my new knowledge with a PhDstudent who was considering her methodologyand incorporated my new knowledge ofhorizon scanning into a bid for researchfunding. The next (and more exciting) step isto think of <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can apply one ofthese methods to examining an aspect of LIS practice. The second trip was the British Association ofCounselling and Psychotherapy ResearchConference, an event which I've attended forthe last few years (don’t ask!). Each time, I've been struck by both the similarities and differences between counselling and LIS research in the UK. Counselling research is conducted by {{a relatively small number of}} individuals and, as in LIS, the vast majority of practitioners don’t engage in writing any research up for publication (Clapton, 2010). Particular types of research dominate in counselling, but most are highly qualitative in manner, e. g. using biographical approaches. I can’t immediately see how these could become widely used in LIS, but I do find it fascinating to hear about different approaches and the evidence this provides. Like many of the things that LIS professionals do, counselling and psychotherapy is a complex intervention and it is not always immediately apparent what has caused an effect. It may well be that the counsellor is only one of a number of elements that has led to a positive outcome or a change in effect. This makes it difficult to generate evidence about the effectiveness of counselling, similar, for example, to trying to generate evidence regarding the effectiveness of information literacy. Due to political drivers there is an increasing interest (and resistance) to a more evidence based approach in counselling and psychotherapy. One of the main areas of resistance towards evidence based practice (EBP) in counselling is that the medical model or paradigm of EBP and the view that the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the method of choice for providing high quality evidence on the effectiveness of services doesn't fit with the way counsellors provide services to their clients. Each client is seen as an individual and therapy is provided according to a client’s particular needs at that time rather than following a set manual or course. This makes it impossible to assess in a "randomized controlled" manner, before even beginning to worry about the ethical and practical implications of conducting an experimental study. The unsuitability of the RCT has also been raised regarding generating evidence for EBLIP (e. g. Banks, 2008); however, “best evidence” doesn’t need to be an RCT. The definition of EBLIP provided by Booth (2006) mentions best quality evidence (generated from research, among other elements, but makes no mention of particular research designs). In addition, both Eldredge (2004) and Crumley and Koufogiannakis (2002) have argued for the consideration of a wide type of study designs as evidence within EBLIP, a viewpoint with which I have long agreed. After all, it is much more important to choose a design that is suitable to answer the question at hand and provide good quality evidence, rather than trying to use a "good quality" design at the expense of finding relevant evidence. Bearing that in mind, I'm racking my brains to think of how I can use webometrics and techniques from history to investigate my practice. At the same time, I urge you to think widely about research evidence and try exploring some different methodologies and see what evidence they can reveal...|$|E
