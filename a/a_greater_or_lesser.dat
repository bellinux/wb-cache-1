40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to outline the necessity for a subject philosophical basis for Industrial Psychology. The paper offers a number of examples of issues which might effect a shift of interest from everyday practice of science to the essential nature of Industrial Psychology as a subject discipline - that is, ultimately, a subject philosophical grounding of Industrial Psychology. The issues that are raised therefore do touch, to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> extent, on the presuppositions on which the subject Industrial Psychology rests...|$|R
5|$|The swans, {{ducks and}} geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic {{existence}} with webbed feet and bills which are flattened to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> extent. In many ducks the male is colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists {{of a variety of}} animals and plants. The family is well represented in the counties, especially in winter when large numbers visit from further north.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage. Thayer was mocked to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> extent by other scientific reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than}} the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E

50|$|The PID {{is usually}} {{calibrated}} using isobutylene, and other analytes may produce <b>a</b> relatively <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesser</b> response on <b>a</b> concentration basis. Although many PID manufacturers provide {{the ability to}} program an instrument with a correction factor for quantitative detection of a specific chemical, the broad selectivity of the PID means that the user must know {{the identity of the}} gas or vapor species to be measured with high certainty. If a correction factor for benzene is entered into the instrument, but hexane vapor is measured instead, the lower relative detector response (higher correction factor) for hexane would lead to underestimation of the actual airborne concentration of hexane.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBased on the {{hypothesis}} that states that the underlying cause {{of the crisis in}} the euro area is a combination of exchange-rate misalignments with uncoordinated wage policies, we explore different exchange-rate arrangements that may help to reduce imbalances between surplus and deficit countries. These alternative configurations of the eurozone, which imply abandoning the common currency to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> extent, are tested with a theoretical four-country stock-flow consistent model.

40|$|Knowledge and {{information}} have new {{importance in the}} context of the information society. Today, when we think of both values it is necessary to look at them under the educational, economical and cultural perspectives because the information process is global and has to do with every country directly <b>or</b> indirectly in <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> extent. Therefore, Latin American countries must use infomation transfer in order to solve great problems such as illiteracy, digital exclusion and the lack of a contents industry.

40|$|A {{study of}} centenarians in Sardinia {{detected}} {{the existence of}} an area where the number of centenarians is higher than elsewhere, in particularly for men. There is a widespread opinion that the existence of <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> number of centenarians largely depends on mortality features between 80 and 100 years. This study aims to cast light on our knowledge of elderly mortality differentials, total and by cause of death, in Sardinia, and attempts to verify this hypothesis. To do so, an analysis is conducted of age and sex mortality trends over time at province and municipality level. Results fully confirm the underlying hypothesis. causes of death, centenarians, geography of mortality, Italy, life expectancy, mortality, oldest old, Sardinia, survival differences...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{little has changed}} over the past 130 years when it comes to {{negative}} representations of trafficked women.

It argues that the JAPGW stigmatised these women, placing most of the blame for trafficking upon them and positioning them to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> extent as ‘undesirable and undeserving working-class foreigners’ who could never become respectable English women. The article also contends that the JAPGW, in outlining what was wrong with certain female migrants, drew a line between ‘the migrant’ and respectable English society at large, and paradoxically endorsed the extension of the very ‘anti-alienist’ and Antisemitic prejudices that it strove to dispel...|$|R
