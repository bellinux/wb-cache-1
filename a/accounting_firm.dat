In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s.

To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of audit quality, {{measured}} by financial statements audited by the big four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms,</b> on the investors' ability to predict future earnings for profitable and unprofitable firms. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the returns-earnings regression model and interacts all independent variables in this model with a dummy variable, AUDIT, which is set to equal one if financial statements audited by the big four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms,</b> zero otherwise. Future earnings response coefficient is the measure of earnings predictability. Findings – The paper finds that investors are able to better anticipate future earnings when financial statements are audited by the big four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms.</b> However, the findings are not applicable for unprofitable firms. Practical implications – The findings of the paper have implications for auditing related academic research and the users of financial statements. In particular, the study shows that the big four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> have not lost their audit quality advantage and that financial statements audited by the big four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> are arguably of higher quality than those audited by non-big four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms.</b> Originality/value – It is believed that there is no UK study to date examining the association of the quality of financial statements audited by the big four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> and the returns-earnings association. Consequently, this paper significantly contributes to the limited literature on the perceived value relevance of audit quality.

40|$|Title: The {{organizing}} {{and the balance}} between profession and profit in the Big Four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> Introduction: Globalization has lead to a world with increasing similarities and a larger market where only efficient organizations survive why information is important for survival and success. <b>Accounting</b> <b>firms</b> fulfill an important role by securing information {{and contribute to the}} prosperity of society through an efficient market. But they differ both from non-PSF and among each other due to the need of managing the balance between profession and profit. The current research on <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> is limited and lacking. This thesis contributes to the current research by providing a new perspective to the existing research on <b>accounting</b> <b>firms.</b> Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to understand how the Big Four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> organize in order to manage the balance between profession and profit. Method: The thesis uses a qualitative research method in which data and information is collected from financial statements and websites that is compiled into multiple case studies on the Big Four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> to give a detailed description of how they organize to manage the balance between profession and profit. Conclusions: The result demonstrates that there are similarities between how the Big Four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> organize to manage the balance between profession and profit. The thesis moreover shows that there are connections between the factors of organizing (goal, environment, strategy and structure latter of which is divided in organizational structure, partnership, knowledge, reward system, informal and formal management processes and responsibility distribution) and the balance between profession and profit which indicates that the Big Four <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> considers the balance between profession and profit in the organizing for the survival and success in the market...|$|R

In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum dropout age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum dropout age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the managed care plans did not generate sufficient savings. The bill also called for the hiring of an independent <b>accounting</b> <b>firm</b> to assess the savings achieved by the managed care plans. Beshear then used his line-item veto to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the version of the bill signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E
