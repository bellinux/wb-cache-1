40|$|This {{working paper}} {{describes}} the second version of MIDAS (an acronym for ‘Microsimulation for the Development of Adequacy and Sustainability'), a dynamic population model with dynamic cross-sectional ageing. This model simulates the life spans {{of individuals in}} the base dataset, including with their interactions, for the years between 2003 and 2060. It enables to produce, on that period, adequacy assessment of pensions in Belgium that is coherent with the baseline budgetary projections of the 2009 report of the Study Committee for Ageing realized by the Federal Planning Bureau's semi-aggregated MALTESE model. Indeed, MIDAS aligns its socio-economic and demographic projections and its macro-economic assumptions on the 2009 report of the Study Committee for Ageing.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a multidimensional {{approach to the}} <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pension</b> system, recognising it as the most relevant in comparative analyses <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> systems, {{as well as more}} authoritative than a one-dimensional approach based exclusively on pensioners’ income calculated {{on the basis of the}} replacement rate. <b>Adequacy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pension</b> system can be also understood to mean the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> system when assessing its ability to realize income objectives. Starting from the micro- and macro functions <b>of</b> the <b>pension</b> system, OMC and World Bank objectives in terms <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy,</b> and taking into account the indicators used by the European Commission to monitor the attainment of OMC objectives, the paper presents the overall concept <b>of</b> multidimensional <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pension</b> system. Three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> are defined: income, poverty, and differentiation of pensioners’ material situation by gender. Next, sub-indicators measuring the individual dimensions <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> are proposed, along with an aggregation procedure based on the tools of multidimensional statistical analysis. First the sub-indicators are aggregated into synthetic indicators for individual dimensions, and finally the synthetic indicators for individual dimensions are aggregated into a single synthetic indicator <b>of</b> the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pension</b> system (APS). Based on the proposed procedure, the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pensions</b> systems <b>of</b> 26 European countries is measured, and the quality of this measurement is assessed.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the <b>adequacy</b> degree <b>of</b> the public <b>pension</b> system in Romania, {{as well as that}} of the systems from other member states of the European Union, we applied the calculation methodology proposed by Filip Chybalski in the study entitled “Measuring the Multidimensional <b>Adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pension</b> Systems in European Countries”. Therefore, we started from a series of indicators put forward by the European Commission, which were grouped into three categories corresponding to the three main dimensions used when defining the adequate character <b>of</b> a <b>pension</b> system, namely income indicators, indicators reflecting poverty levels and gender differences (related to income and poverty levels). Employing these indicators, we determined/measured the <b>adequacy</b> degree <b>of</b> a <b>pension</b> system from a multidimensional perspective. The calculations were applied to 26 European countries over a three-year period, namely 2007, 2009 and 2011. Thus, the outcome of our research included a comparison and, implicitly, a classification.

40|$|The Dutch {{pension system}} is highly ranked on adequacy. These rankings, however, {{are based on}} fictitious {{replacement}} rates for median income earners. This paper investigates whether the Dutch pension adequacy is still high when we {{take into account the}} resources that people really accumulate, using a large administrative data set. A comprehensive approach is followed: not only public and private pension rights, but also private savings and housing wealth are taken into account. Summed over all age- and socioeconomic groups we find a median gross replacement rate of 83 % and a net replacement rate of 101 %. At retirement age, 31 % of all households face a gross replacement rate that is lower than 70 % of current income. Public and occupational pensions each account for more than 35 % of total pension annuities. Private non-housing assets account for 14 % and imputed rental income from net housing wealth accounts for about 10 %. Some vulnerable groups, such as the self-employed, have below average replacement rates. Results are fairly similar to results found in the UK, indicating that we should be careful in evaluating the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> systems on the basis of fictitious replacement rates...|$|E

40|$|Reforming {{pensions}} is {{a central}} policy issue in developed and developing countries alike. However, it is challenging and controversial because it involves long-term planning by governments faced with numerous short-term pressures. Pension reform usually provokes heated ideological debates and, often, street protests. There are valuable {{lessons to be learned}} from other countries’ pension systems and their experiences of retirement-income reforms. However, national pension systems are very complicated and international comparisons are consequently very difficult. Many international analyses get bogged down in institutional, technical, and legal detail, making it impossible to transfer policy lessons between countries. This study combines painstaking, rigorous analysis with clear, easy-to-understand presentation <b>of</b> empirical results. <b>Pensions</b> Panorama does not advocate any particular kind <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> system or type <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> reform. We hope the analysis in this report can inform debates on retirement-income systems by presenting “hard” data that people with different visions for the future <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> can all use as a reference point. International comparisons of retirement-income regimes to date have tended to focus on the question of fiscal and financial sustainability: whether the pension promises made to today’s workers will be affordable in the future. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the future <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> benefits, to the impact <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> reforms on the distribution of income among older people, and on the means to combat old-age poverty. These issues, which may be termed social sustainability, are a core concern of this study. The OECD published the report Pensions at a Glance: Public Policies across OECD Countries in 2005. This study extends the analysis to cover 23 countries that are not members of the OECD. These nations lie in three different regions of the world: Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa. Together, the countries covered in this report account for a quarter of the world’s population and approximately 58 percent of workers around the world who are covered by formal pension systems. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} on request, not during a conference but during a closed {{meeting of the}} ESRI {{and representatives of the}} cabinet of the prime minister of JapanSince about a decade, the pension policy of member states is a focal point of attention on the European level, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world. Traditionally, the focus was primarily on securing the fi-nancial sustainability. But a sensible assessment of financial sustainability cannot do without taking into account the social impact of ageing, budgetary and pension policy. Specifically should the devel-opment of pension adequacy be taken into account. This presentation starts by giving an overview of applied dynamic microsimulation modelling as a re-search field, and recent developments therein. Next, it discusses how such integrated approach using shared demographic and macroeconomic assumptions has been developed in Belgium. It describes the dynamic microsimulation model MIDAS (an acronym for ‘Microsimulation for the Development of Adequacy and Sustainability’), highlighting how it aligns to the simulation results of the Belgian semi-aggregate model MALTESE. Three example of a joint assessment of recent pension policy on both the sustainability and <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> in Belgium are discussed: the recent increase of the means-tested minimum benefit for the elderly, a change of the long term growth rate of wages, and a change in the employment rate of the older active population. The two models demonstrate that the important increase of the means-tested minimum pension benefit in 2006 has a limited impact on the costs of ageing (0. 045 % GDP), but a very important and immediate impact on the risk of poverty among the elderly. Furthermore, they show that a higher growth rate or a higher employment rate among the older active population have a comparable impact on the budgetary costs of ageing (from 5. 3 % GDP in the base-variant to 4. 5 or 4. 7 % GDP), but that the impacts on the development of the risk of poverty among the elderly are far from comparable. Contrary to the high-employment rate variant, the high-growth rate variant results in a gradual increase in the risk of poverty among the elderly from 2020 on.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{and compares}} the {{development}} and characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>pension</b> systems in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. It uses a policy index to compare the inputs <b>of</b> these four <b>pension</b> systems {{as well as their}} social outputs. The thesis starts by reviewing the ancient Chinese welfare and political ideologies and practices and the Western welfare ideologies and regimes to discover the core values behind the Chinese Community pensions. Four country case studies examine {{the development and}} performance <b>of</b> these state <b>pension</b> schemes {{in the context of the}} family support system and demographic trends. They explore the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> provisions, the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> public <b>pensions,</b> personal and private sources of retirement income. The problems <b>of</b> these four <b>pension</b> provisions are thus revealed. The policy index constructed through the radar chart and Surface Measure of Overall Performance (SMOP) approaches is used to compare the performances <b>of</b> these four <b>pension</b> systems on policy inputs and social outputs. The conclusion of the research is that Confucianism and capitalism integrate into a new paternalism through the patriarchal values they share and which dominate the Chinese Community nowadays. But the features <b>of</b> these four <b>pension</b> systems vary due to the different political, historical, economic and social contexts of each state. The findings show that none <b>of</b> these <b>pension</b> provisions can effectively prevent elderly people from poverty in old age. They all rely on personal social security responsibility and the continuation of the family support system. This thesis concludes that all these states lack a needs-based basic pension system to secure retirees’ income level. ...|$|R

With an increasingly diverse, ageing population in Britain, this research {{seeks to investigate}} the complexities of retirement behaviour and pensions in relation to ethnicity. The main aims will include: examining the extent and nature <b>of</b> private <b>pension</b> saving among ethnic minorities; identifying differences in post-retirement incomes of various ethnic minority groups; analysing the disparity {{in terms of the}} labour market and demographic variables. It will also explore the attitudes and the key strategies used by ethnic minority groups in relation to retirement, and their attitudes to saving. Methodologically, the research project will incorporate a mixed methods approach - major existing datasets such as the Family Resources Survey, English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Quarterly Labour Force Survey will identify differences in post-retirement incomes between ethnic minority groups. In addition focus groups and interviews will be conducted with individuals from ethnic minority groupings including Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Black Africans, Black Caribbeans and a white British control group. By investigating the current attitudes to, and patterns of saving among the ethnic minority working groups and pensioners the research will comment on the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> current <b>pension</b> policy in addressing the needs of this particular sector of society...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary Pension {{reform has}} again been {{high on the}} {{political}} agenda in France in 2013. In the winter of 2013 - 2014, the Ayrault government introduced a new pension reform which included: an increase in employee and employer contributions, a gradual {{increase in the minimum}} contribution required for a full pension from 41. 5 years for people born in 1955 to 43 years for people born in 1973, the creation of a personal account for the prevention of hard working conditions (compte personnel de prévention de la pénibilité) as well as a series of changes aimed at improving pension adequacy for women, youths and workers employed in non-standard forms of employment. Despite these compensatory measures and despite suggestions by recent official reports that replacement rates cannot be expected to decline dramatically in the future, this new reform will make it harder for workers to reach the minimum contribution period required to get a full pension. Both the official projections of replacement rates and the government’s calculations about the long-term financial situation of public pension schemes are based on very optimistic macro-economic assumptions (for example regarding the level of growth and of unemployment). It is clear that more reforms will be needed in the future. Promoting longer working lives should be a priority both in order to ensure the sustainability and the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>pensions.</b> In this context, it would seem reasonable to increase the statutory retirement age – and reform it by transforming it into a flexibile, and not a minimum, retirement age – so as to send a clear signal both to employers and employees that they will need to work longer. In 2012 and 2013, there has not been any important reform of the French Health care system, since the most important reform was adopted in 2009 (loi HPST) and since the government was concentrated on the pension reform in 2013. Moreover, deficits have started to decrease in the health care sector, thus leading to no important measures in that field. In Summer 2013, the government has launched a collective discussion on “National Health strategy” that will be presented in Summer 2014. In late 2013, some decisions have been taken regarding pharmaceutical goods on one hand, and aiming at increasing resources on the other. While LTC has been a central topic in the political debate for many years now, and while there have been many promises made to reform the LTC system in order to find a sustainable mode of financing and a simplified mode of governance, the reforms have been continuously postponed and a clear consensus on the mode of financing has yet to emerge. The government elected in 2012 has announced that long-term care would be one of its priorities, and that a reform would be undertaken to better cover the needs of the dependent elderly. Three reports have been published since then, but no major decision have been decided yet, except for an increase in tax paid by retired people, supposedly aimed at finaincing LTC...|$|E
40|$|Long-term trends, such as {{the aging}} of the population, the {{increased}} life-expectancy, and the consequences of the recent financial crisis, have raised concerns about the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> systems. Consequently, many OECD countries have proposed and implemented reforms to alleviate the pension system from the pressure of demographic aging and to create sustainable pension systems for the future. Many of the reforms implemented are related to increasing both the statutory and effective retirement age, making pension benefits less generous and increasing contributions. As a consequence, the proposed and implemented reforms have raised a lot of discussion about the financial position of current and future retirees. This thesis collects five studies regarding Pensions, Retirement, and the Financial Position of the Elderly and aims to understand the effects of aging on people’s retirement behavior and the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> their (future) <b>pensions.</b> The thesis focuses on the role of selfemployment and part-time employment in retirement behavior and the financial resources available at retirement.

40|$|Successive reforms enacted {{since the}} 1990 s have {{dramatically}} changed Europe’s pensions landscape. This paper tries {{to assess the}} impact of recent reforms on the ability of systems to alleviate poverty and maintain living standards, using estimates <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> wealth for a number of hypothetical cases. By focusing on all prospective pension transfers rather than just those at the point of retirement, this approach can provide additional insights on the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> systems in the light of increasing longevity. Our estimates indicate that while reforms have decreased generosity significantly, in most countries poverty alleviation remains strong. However, moves to link benefits to contributions have made some systems less progressive, raising adequacy concerns for certain groups. In particular, unless the labour market outcomes of women and of lower-income individuals change substantially over the coming decades, state pension transfers will prove inadequate, particularly in Eastern European countries. Similarly while the generosity <b>of</b> minimum <b>pensions</b> appears to have either been safeguarded by pension reforms, or improved in some cases, these transfers generally remain inadequate to maintain individuals above the 60 % relative poverty threshold throughout retirement. Our simulations suggest that the gradual negative impact of price indexation on the relative <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> state <b>pensions</b> is becoming even more substantial in view of the lengthening of the time spent in receipt of retirement benefits. The consumption smoothing function <b>of</b> state <b>pensions</b> has declined noticeably, strengthening the need for longer careers and additional private saving. When pressed, policymakers, particularly in Western Europe, seem to have been more willing to sacrifice the income smoothing function <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> rather than its poverty alleviation function. Policymakers in some counties, notably Germany, France and the UK, have sought to refocus state pension systems towards generating better outcomes for people in the bottom half of the income distribution, probably with the insight that middle- to high-income individuals are possibly in a better position to accommodate the effect <b>of</b> state <b>pension</b> reforms by increasing their private saving. However in some cases, notably in Eastern Europe, results suggest that policymakers may not have fully considered the full impact of their policies on those on low incomes, on those with incomplete careers and on women. ...|$|R
40|$|Pension {{systems are}} complex and diverse, so {{comparing}} them is consequently difficult. Yet there are valuable {{lessons to be learned}} from the <b>pension</b> experiences <b>of</b> other nations. International comparisons <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> systems have focused almost wholly on the fiscal aspects of ageing populations. This paper provides consistent data on pension entitlements for the 30 member countries of the OECD, allowing cross-country analysis <b>of</b> the <b>adequacy</b> and distribution <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> promises. The following section provides {{a brief description of the}} 30 retirement-income regimes and compares key parameters, such as pension eligibility ages, ceilings on pensionable earnings, contribution rates to defined-contribution schemes and accrual rates for defined-benefit plans. Section 2 sets out the methodology for and assumptions used in modelling pension entitlements. Section 3 presents replacement rates, the most commonly used indicator in pension analysis. Section 4 calculates pension wealth, the present value of the flow <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> entitlements, which captures the effects of cross-country differences in life expectancy, pension eligibility ages, and indexation <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> in payment. The concept of weighted averages is introduced in Section 5 : a way of summarizing the main indicators across the range of individual earnings. The structure <b>of</b> the <b>pension</b> package, that is the role that different components of the retirement-income system play, is explored in Section 6.

5000|$|Early {{financial}} gerontology research {{focused on}} the interaction of (and longitudinal trends in) in middle-aging and older-aging, and their combined impact on savings, retirement, health care, and long-term care. Research on aging and money often juxtaposes old age with the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> financial resources (<b>pensions,</b> Social Security, {{and a variety of}} savings and investment approaches, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "three legged stool", to support quality of personal and family later life. The integration of middle age as an essential dimension of financial gerontology reflected Gregg's and Cutler's conceptualization of the [...] "Human Wealth Span" [...] introduced in 1991-1992 As Gregg noted in the 1992 Boettner Lecture, the Human Wealth Span [...] "mirrors" [...] the better known Human Life Span concept which speaks not only patterns of maturation and development, but also to identifiable stages in development.|$|R
40|$|Asia 2 ̆ 7 s general {{reliance}} on {{defined benefit schemes}} could potentially lead to unfunded liabilities similar to those experienced in some countries in Europe, once the tipping point is reached. Some {{segments of the population}} lack meaningful <b>pensions,</b> a feature <b>of</b> many developing economies in the region, which means the whole system of retirement income in Asia needs urgent attention. Summary•	This is the second research brief in a three-part series that looks at Asia in the ageing century, with a particular focus on the countries of East and South-East Asia. •	The context is outlined in the first brief, which describes population, urbanisation and social trends in the region. Specifically, it notes that population ageing in East and South-East Asia is happening faster and at a lower level of economic development than in the West. Many Asian countries now have a decade or so to prepare for the later stages of demographic transition. •	With the challenges set out, we turn to responses and opportunities. In this regard, Parts II and III of the series focus on two areas of economic activity which are both pertinent and have enormous scale: providing retirement income (covered in the present brief) and healthcare (outlined in Part III). Getting these right could result in favourable macro-economic rebalancing of growth in the region – where individuals can pool risks and reduce the need for excessive precautionary savings. •	As in Europe, Asia’s {{reliance on}} defined benefit schemes may result in unfunded liabilities when the ratio <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> recipients to contributors increases, unless sustainability features are built in. China’s generous urban workers’ scheme is only affordable because it is not yet mature or widespread. And poorly designed access arrangements can result in excessive costs and disincentives to work that waste the potential of healthy older people. For example, pension access ages are low in East and South-East Asian countries: on average 59 for men and 57 for women. •	Alongside issues <b>of</b> sustainability, <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> benefits remains important. Many Asians have no pension entitlements. This is not surprising given the region’s economic development, but if demographic and social development is considered, the situation demands more urgent action. Adequacy also depends on ensuring regular retirement income, which is unlikely in the absence of preservation and annuities. •	There are also private sector opportunities, including providing financial services to help Asian workers transition into retirement as has happened with assets accrued by baby boomers in the West. The size <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> assets already offers opportunities, but there are varying strategies for foreign entrants to choose from with different levels of capital investment – from opening local branches to building long-term links. •	Lastly, a viable private pension sector requires the right set of preconditions. Here, experts from countries such as Japan and Australia have an opportunity to contribute to developing the region’s pension and insurance infrastructure. Both countries have experience in population ageing research and policy implementation.  ...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{retirement}} phenomena, the development and utilization <b>of</b> private <b>pensions</b> {{may be viewed as}} a market response based on individual and collective recognition of the need to plan to finance retirement from the labor force. This market response however, is shown to have produced a profusion <b>of</b> independent differential <b>pension</b> schemes which may vary with respect to their administrative mechanisms, the type and <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> benefits paid, the level at which contributions are made to the plan by participants and the basis of these contributions, and the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> funding.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to investigate the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> funds' investment strategy in the Czech Republic and the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> {{the current level of}} real estate investments in their portfolios. We employ Markowitz portfolio theory and construct the optimal market investment portfolio. The optimal portfolio is then compared with the portfolio <b>of</b> Czech <b>pension</b> funds and the loss arising from asset class misallocation is estimated. Besides, the comparison of portfolio structures <b>of</b> all current <b>pension</b> funds in the Czech Republic is done with the intention to detect whether they follow significantly different investment strategies or not.

40|$|Many European countries, {{faced with}} {{demographic}} challenges owing to ageing populations and their socio-economic consequences, {{have had to}} implement pension reforms with common factors. This paper examines microeconomic evidence on provisions and <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> post-retirement income of ageing populations across Europe by {{using data from the}} Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This article presents the key changes introduced by European governments to pension systems and illustrates how recent reforms aim at increasing the sustainability <b>of</b> state <b>pension</b> systems by introducing and encouraging private schemes. The authors build on the findings of Pedersen (2004) and suggest that unless a complementary relationship between public and private pension exists, where private components are added to the basic level <b>of</b> state <b>pensions</b> and do not substitute them, the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> retirement income will be affected...|$|R
