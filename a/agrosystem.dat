40|$|To {{discriminate}} between {{the contributions of}} ecosystems and the human subsidies to agricultural systems, we propose using an additional terminology to bring clarification into the controversial discussion about i) ecosystems versus agrosystems and ii) ecosystem services versus <b>agrosystem</b> services. A literature review revealed that {{with the exception of}} some very recent publications, this has not yet been sufficiently reflected, neither within the scientific nor in the policy discussion. The question remains whether to spoil the discussion with new terms again and again. We reason that it makes sense to underpin the case-specific share of agricultural inputs to the supply of agroecosystem services and to add “agro” to the terminology. We conclude, {{that there is a need}} to promote the new terminology of <b>agrosystem</b> services and to strengthen the use of the already established term agroecosystem services within this context. To emphasise the production patterns behind the multiple benefits agricultural systems provide to humans (commodity and non-commodity outputs) and to guarantee a reasonable weighting of related externalities in policy processes, we suggest to introduce the term <b>agrosystem</b> services into the discussion on ecosystem services. <b>Agrosystem</b> services in this context describe the anthropogenic share of agroecosystem services’ generation. Agroecosystem services include multiple provisioning, regulating and cultural services from agricultural ecosystems. The inclusion of <b>agrosystem</b> services might accommodate the ecology-based ecosystem services concept to the specificity of managed agricultural ecosystems and therefore could be better implemented by mostly economy-driven agricultural production systems and agricultural policy...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLike many African cities, Ouagadougou {{is having}} a great {{increase}} of its cultivated area. More generally, urban <b>agrosystems</b> are now highlighted worldwide, at least in scientific community. In this connection, urban nature, whatever its form is, is praised, because it contributes to the life quality in city and offers many ecosystem services (air quality improvement, recreational activities, etc.). These services are associated more particularly to urban <b>agrosystems,</b> adding provisioning services. We are questioning some of these services {{in the framework of}} an interdisciplinary research conducted in Ouagadougou. Our first results confirm that, in this city, <b>agrosystems</b> offer provisioning and cultural services, not only to gardeners. Market gardening, the main agriculture in Ouagadougou, supplies city markets with fruits and vegetables up to 90 %. The cultivated areas also prove to be life places, where the people cultivate, harvest but also sell, buy, talk together, even pray and eat. We can argue that some of these services come from facilities (prayer places, restaurants) but the same idea can be given for recreational activities in urban parks. Beyond and despite these confirmations, our research shows that, in Ouagadougou, like in other African cities, urban <b>agrosystems</b> are not accepted by all; they are even condemned by authorities, who highlight the negative sides. And indeed, urban agriculture also has disservices, linked to the way it is practiced. In Ouagadougou, agriculture faces two difficulties: the soil poverty and the water rarity. Gardeners use the nearby resources, all the more they receive no support from authorities. They then use spent waters to irrigate their plots and waste to fertilize soil. But consequently, the products coming from theses <b>agrosystems</b> present public health risks. Some efforts have to be made to reduce these disservices and increase services, in order that these <b>agrosystems</b> fully contribute to poverty alleviation and, in the same way, to the life quality in Ouagadougou...|$|R

Amphibians, with complex life cycles, are particularly susceptible to habitat alterations, and their survival may be impaired in anthropized habitats. Increased mortality is a well-known consequence of anthropization. Life-history theory predicts higher reproductive investment when mortality is increased. In this work, we compared age, body size, and different indicators of reproductive investment, as well as prey availability, in natterjack toads (Epidalea calamita) from agrosystems and adjacent natural pine groves in Southwestern Spain. Mean age was lower in agrosystems than in pine groves, possibly {{as a consequence of}} increased mortality due to <b>agrosystem</b> environmental stressors. Remarkably, <b>agrosystem</b> toads were larger despite being younger, suggesting accelerated growth rate.

40|$|Background: Traditional <b>agrosystems</b> are {{the places}} were crop species have evolved and {{continue}} to evolve under a combination of human and environmental pressures. A better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of crop diversity in these <b>agrosystems</b> is crucial to sustain food security and farmers’ self-reliance. It requires as a first step, anchoring {{a description of the}} available diversity in its geographical, environmental, cultural and socio-economic context. [br/] Methods: We conducted interviews with farmers cultivating durum wheat in two contrasted traditional <b>agrosystems</b> of Morocco in the Pre-Rif (163 farmers) and in the oases of the Atlas Mountains (110 farmers). We documented the varietal diversity of durum wheat, the main characteristics of the farms, the farming and seed management practices applied to durum wheat, and the farmers’ perception of their varieties. [br/] Results: As expected in traditional <b>agrosystems,</b> farmers largely practiced diversified subsistence agriculture on small plots and relied on on-farm seed production or informal seed exchange networks. Heterogeneity nevertheless prevailed on many variables, especially on the modernization of practices in the Pre-Rif region. Fourteen (resp. 11) traditional and 5 (resp. 3) modern varieties were identified in the Pre-Rif region (resp. in the Atlas Mountains). The majority of farmers grew a single variety, and most traditional varieties were distributed in restricted geographical areas. At the farm level, {{more than half of the}} varieties were renewed in the last decade in the Pre-Rif, a more rapid renewal than in the Atlas Mountain. Modern varieties were more prevalent in the Pre-Rif region and were integrated in the traditional practices of seed production, selection and exchange. They were clearly distinguished by the farmers from the landraces, the last ones being appreciated for their quality traits. [br/] Conclusions: The surveyed traditional <b>agrosystems</b> constitute open, dynamic and heterogeneous entities. We suggest that competing factors could favour or limit the cultivation of improved varieties and the erosion of original durum wheat diversity. This first description opens the way to focused further investigations, including complementing variety names with cultural, genetic and phenotypic information and unravelling the multidimensional factors and consequences of modern variety adoption...|$|R

However, the design of cropping systems including cover plants relies largely on expert knowledge. There is a lack of methods to select the best suited cover plants according to their role in the <b>agrosystem.</b> We propose to use functional traits to select cover plants suited to sustain ecological services in the banana agrosystems of the French West Indies. Our objectives were (i) to characterize a collection of cover plants on a trait basis, according to their potential to provide the services expected in a banana <b>agrosystem</b> and (ii) to discuss the potential use of this characterization for the design of innovative multi-species banana cropping systems. In these systems, four main services are targeted, i. e. controlling weeds, controlling plant-parasitic nematodes, improving soil fertility and particularly N availability, and avoiding competition with banana for resource acquisition. Three experiments were conducted, under field and controlled conditions, to evaluate the potential of a collection of 28 tropical cover plants to achieve the functions related to these services. For each cover plant, a functional profile was constructed from a combination of plant traits that are easy to assess experimentally. It described plants' potential to achieve the functions expected in a banana <b>agrosystem.</b> Functional profiles required for cover plant usages were also identified. The comparison of the plant functional profiles and the functional profiles required for their usages enabled us to select the best suited plants for each usage. However, these functional profiles rarely corresponded, meaning that a cover plant is rarely sufficient to achieve all the functions required for a usage. Functional complementarities obtained by the mixture of different species of cover plants are thus often required. Compared to classical approaches of innovative cropping system design based on the experimental testing of spatial and temporal plant combinations, such a trait-based approach saves time by focusing on a shortlist of cover plants best suited according to their functions in the <b>agrosystem.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

These methods were tested in two different environments: Vanua Lava (Vanuatu; heterogeneous landscape, very ancient plantations) and Ivory Coast (Marc Delorme Research Station, monoculture, regular spacing, oil palm plantations); and their results were evaluated against manually digitized photo-interpretation maps. In both situations, the PAPRI method produced better results than that of Teina (global kappa of 0. 60 vs. 0. 40). Spectral signatures do not allow a sufficiently accurate mapping of coconut and do not differentiate it from oil palm, despite their different NDVI signatures. The PAPRI method differentiates productive coconut from mixed plantations and other vegetation, either high or low (70 % accuracy). In both situations, Teina's method allows counting 65 % of the coconut trees when they are well spaced. To increase the method accuracy, we suggest (1) field surveys (for small scale studies) and/or finer image resolution, allowing a high precision in manual mapping with a better discrimination between coconut and oil palm, thus limiting the proportion of mixed pixels.

A recent systematic analysis of existing cropland maps identified priority areas for cropland mapping and highlighted a major need for the Sahelian and Sudanian <b>agrosystems.</b> This paper proposes a knowledge-based approach to map cropland in the Sahelian and Sudanian <b>agrosystems</b> that benefits from the 100 -m spatial resolution of the recent PROBA-V sensor. The methodology uses five temporal features characterizing crop development throughout the vegetative season to optimize cropland discrimination. A feature importance analysis validates the efficiency of using a diversity of temporal features. The fully-automated method offers the first cropland map at 100 -m using the PROBA-V sensor with an overall accuracy of 84 % and an F-score for the cropland class of 74 %. The improvements observed compared to existing cropland products are related to the hectometric resolution, to the methodology and {{to the quality of the}} labeling layer from which reliable training samples were automatically extracted. Classification errors are mainly explained by data availability and landscape fragmentation. Further improvements are expected with the upcoming enhanced cloud screening of the PROBA-V sensor...|$|R
40|$|Background: Crop {{diversity}} {{managed by}} smallholder farmers in traditional <b>agrosystems</b> is {{the outcome of}} historical and current processes interacting at various spatial scales, and influenced by factors such as farming practices and environmental pressures. Only recently have studies started to consider the complexity of these processes instead of simply describing diversity for breeding purposes. A first step in that aim is to add multiple references to the collection of genetic data, including the farmers' varietal taxonomy and practices and the historical background of the crop. Results: On the basis of interview data collected in a previous study, we sampled 166 populations of durum wheat varieties in two traditional Moroccan <b>agrosystems,</b> in the Pre-Rif and Atlas Mountains regions. Using a common garden experiment, we detected a high phenotypic variability on traits indicative of taxonomical position and breeding status, namely spike shape and plant height. Populations often combined modern (short) with traditional-like (tall) statures, and classical durum squared spike shape (5 flowers/spikelet) with flat spike shape (3 flowers/spikelet) representative of primitive domesticated tetraploid wheat (ssp. dicoccum). By contrast, the genetic diversity assessed using 14 microsatellite markers was relatively limited. When compared to the genetic diversity found in a large collection of tetraploid wheat, it corresponded to free-threshing tetraploid wheat. Within Morocco, the two studied regions differed for both genetic diversity and variety names. Within regions, neither geography nor variety names nor even breeding status constituted strong barriers to gene exchange despite a few significant patterns. Conclusions: This first assessment of morphological and genetic diversity allowed pointing out some important factors that may have influenced the structure and evolutionary dynamics of durum wheat in Morocco: the significance of variety names, the occurrence of mixtures within populations, the relative strength of seed exchange between farmers and local adaptation, {{as well as the}} fate of modern varieties once they have been introduced. Further, multidisciplinary studies at different spatial scales are needed to better understand these complex <b>agrosystems</b> of invaluable importance for food security...|$|R

We suggest typifying of the centres or zones of species distribution on zonal-coenotic basis in all types of biotopes; characterization of area differentiation for each species according to the level of its dispersal and injuriousness using annual mapping of the species range for ascertaining rates and direction of distribution; implementation of studying phytoqurantine species on populational basis etc...|$|R
