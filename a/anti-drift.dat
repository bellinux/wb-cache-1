On January 25, 2016 the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied EPA's motion to vacate its Enlist Duo registration. Dow stated the product would be available in 15 US states and Canada for the 2016 crop season.|$|E
40|$|In a {{fluorescent}} nano-resolution microscope based on single molecular localization, drift of focal plane will bring an additional deviation {{to the accuracy}} of single molecular localization. Consequently, this will reduce the final resolution of the reconstructed image and cause image degradation. Therefore, it is vital to control the system drift to a minimum level as much as possible. In recent years, the <b>anti-drift</b> ways emerged in endlessly. In this paper we made a systematic study aiming at the method in which optical measurement and negative feedback control are used. The basic principle and its implementation of the system are analyzed, and possible error is also evaluated. Finally, the precision of the system is tested experimentally. With this device, axial drift can be detected and corrected automatically in time, and the axial <b>anti-drift</b> accuracy as high as 9. 93 nm can be achieved, which is one order higher than that of the existing commercial microscopies...|$|E

40|$|Tracking with a discriminative {{classifier}} becomes popular recently. The online updating {{makes it}} easy to adapt to target appearance variations. However, this also brings drifting problem. It’s necessary to find a tracking method with strong adaptivity and <b>anti-drifting</b> ability. In this paper, an online semi-supervised boosting method is proposed at first, and based on it, we propose a novel tracking framework that treats samples differently when updating the classifier under different conditions. This tracking framework can significantly alleviate the drifting problem and keep adaptive enough to appearance variations. Experimental results on challenging videos show that our method can track accurately and robustly, and outperform many other state-of-the-art trackers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the control challenges {{posed by the}} Ares I vehicle, the flight control system design and performance analyses used to test and verify the design. The major challenges in developing the control system are structural dynamics, dynamic effects from the powerful first stage booster, aerodynamics, first stage separation and large uncertainties in the dynamic models for all these. Classical control techniques were employed using innovative methods for structural mode filter design and an <b>anti-drift</b> feature to compensate for translational and rotational disturbances. This design was coded into an integrated vehicle flight simulation and tested by Monte Carlo methods. The product of this effort is a linear, robust controller design that is easy to implement, verify and test...|$|E
40|$|Spray {{drift of}} {{pesticides}} {{has a negative}} impact on aquatic ecosystems and the environment, including damage to non-target organisms. Particularly, the drift of some insecticides can have detrimental effects on beneficial arthropods such as predatory mites. The aim of these trials was to evaluate, for two spray drift reduction techniques: 1) the spatial patterns of in-field droplets, 2) the efficacy against key pests on apple and grape (Cydia pomonella L. and Lobesia botrana Denis & Schiffermüller respectively), 3) the side effects on predatory mite populations. Results showed that the two spray drift reduction techniques effectively increased droplets amounts next to sprayer, reducing potential drift on both apple orchards and vineyards and were generally as effective as standard nozzles without additional side effects on beneficial arthropods. Results suggest that the use of spray drift reduction techniques such as low-drift nozzles and <b>anti-drift</b> adjuvants can be effective in managing key pests and also in decreasing the environmental impact of using insecticides...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aligning a pair {{of images}} in a mid-space is a common {{approach}} to ensuring that deformable image registration is symmetric – {{that it does not}} de-pend on the arbitrary ordering of the input images. The results are, however, gen-erally dependent on the choice of the mid-space. In particular, the set of possible solutions is typically affected by the constraints that are enforced on the two transformations (that deform the two images), which are to prevent the mid-space from drifting too far from the native image spaces. The use of an implicit atlas has been proposed to define the mid-space for pairwise registration. In this work, we show that by aligning the atlas to each image in the native image space, im-plicit-atlas-based pairwise registration can be made independent of the mid-space, thereby eliminating the need for <b>anti-drift</b> constraints. We derive a new symmetric cost function that only depends on a single transformation morphing one image to the other, and validate it through diffeomorphic registration exper-iments on brain magnetic resonance images. ...|$|E
40|$|Drift of {{pesticides}} {{is a critical}} element in achieving the plant protection management. As a phenomenon influenced by multiple factors {{is likely to be}} reduced, but not totally eliminated. Actually in Province of Trento most growers who sprays next to drift sensitive areas (houses, roads, bicycle patches, etc.) use mainly spray lances. To mitigate drift many other technologies are available along with several techniques. On the other hand the differences between training and pruning systems, planting distances, cultivation environments, etc., must be taken into consideration to achieve the highest level of reduction. The main characteristics of the rural landscape of Trentino are: strict connection with inhabited areas, medium or steep slope of most apple plots and intensive orchard growing with height of trees up to four meters. Comparative tests have been carried out in 2009 during different wind conditions (almost total absence and presence of wind) to verify the mitigation ability of <b>anti-drift</b> nozzles, used with different sprayer adjustments and coupled with other devices. Due to the instability of wind conditions during treatments, as to ensure the maximum level of drift reduction, other technical solutions were tested in 2011 and resulted adoptable together with the devices already tested...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide {{reference}} values for a single, popular breed of pet rabbit. Moreover, additional objectives were to determine whether sex, body position or age alter Netherland Dwarf rabbit electrocardiographic variables and whether the use of electrocardiographic filters affects those variables. Forty Netherland Dwarf rabbits were examined clinically and standard six-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded in sternal and then dorsal recumbency. At first power-line and <b>anti-drift</b> filters were used and then they were disabled. The following variables were measured in lead II: heart rate; P wave duration and amplitude; P-R interval; QRS duration; R wave amplitude (with and without filters); Q-T interval; T wave duration and amplitude; S-T segment; J-T duration; and mean electrical axis (MEA) (with and without filters). MEA was determined by 3 different methods. After statistical processing of the data, our results showed that there were no significant differences between both recumbencies, with the exception of the J-T duration, which was higher in dorsal recumbency. The R wave amplitude using electrocardiographic filters showed significant differences between males (0. 083 mV) and females (0. 115 mV; P< 0. 05); and between younger rabbits (0. 108 mV) and older rabbits (0. 097 mV; P< 0. 05). These differences were not shown between R waves with filters disabled. Moreover, the strongest correlation was between 2 MEA methods without filters. MEA was more leftward in the pet rabbit than in other species (dog or cats). In conclusion, electrocardiography recording without electrocardiographic filters should be assessed when it is possible, and the specific ECGs characteristics for Netherland Dwarf rabbit should be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{environmental}} issues related to spraying of pesticides on cultivated crops is the drift phenomenon. Because of the wind, small droplets may drift away from the targeted crop and cause contamination. One {{way to reduce the}} drift is to control the spray drop size distribution and reduce the proportion of small drops. In this context, <b>anti-drift</b> additives have been developed, including dilute oil-in-water emulsions. Although being documented, the effects of oil-in-water emulsions on spray drop size distribution are not yet understood. The objective of this work is to determine the mechanisms at the origin of the changes of the spray drop size distribution for emulsion-based sprays. Agricultural spraying involves atomizing a liquid stream through a hydraulic nozzle. At the exit of the nozzle, a free liquid sheet is formed, which is subsequently destabilized into droplets. In order to elucidate the mechanisms causing the changes of the spray drop size distribution, we investigate the influence of emulsions on the destabilization mechanisms of liquid sheets. Model single-tear experiments based on the collision of one tear of liquid on a small solid target are used to produce and visualize liquid sheets with a fast camera. Upon impact, the tear flattens into a sheet radially expanding in the air bounded by a thicker rim. Different destabilization mechanisms of the sheet are observed depending on the fluid properties. A pure water sheet spreads out radially and then retracts due to the effect of surface tension. Simultaneously, the rim corrugates forming radial ligaments, which are subsequently destabilized into droplets. The destabilization mechanism is drastically modified when a dilute oil-in-water emulsion is used. Emulsion-based liquid sheets are destabilized through the nucleation of holes within the sheet that perforate the sheet during its expansion. The holes grow until they merge together and form a web of ligaments, which are then destabilized into drops. The physical-chemical parameters of the emulsion, such as emulsion concentration and emulsion droplet size distribution, are modified to rationalize their influence on the perforation mechanism. We correlate the size distribution of drops issued from conventional agricultural spray with the amount of perforation events in single-tear experiments, demonstrating that the single-tear experiment is an appropriate model experiment to investigate the physical mechanisms governing the spray drop size distribution of <b>anti-drift</b> formulations. We show that the relevant mechanism causing the increase of drops size in the emulsion-based spray is a perforation mechanism. To gain an understanding of the physical mechanisms at the origin of the perforation events, we develop an optical technique that allows the determination of the time and space-resolved thickness of the sheet. We find that the formation of a hole in the sheet is systematically preceded by a localized thinning of the liquid film. We show that the thinning results from the entering and Marangoni-driven spreading of emulsion oil droplet at the air/water interface. The localized thinning of the liquid film ultimately leads to the rupture of the film. We propose the perforation mechanism as a sequence of two necessary steps: the emulsion oil droplets (i) enter the air/water interface, and (ii) spread at the interface. We show that the formulation of the emulsion is a critical parameter to control the perforation. The addition of salt or amphiphilic copolymers can trigger or completely inhibit the perforation mechanism. We show that the entering of oil droplets at the air/water interface is the limiting step of the mechanism. Thin-film forces such as electrostatic or steric repulsion forces stabilize the thin film formed between the interface and the approaching oil droplets preventing the entering of oil droplets at the interface and so inhibit the perforation process...|$|E
40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{plays an}} improtant role in analytical science {{because of its}} unique characteristics, such as non-contact and non-destructive detecting, fewer sample consumption, high sensitivity and other characteristics, and it provides a powerful analytical tool for the modern basic research fields. Because of the combination of confocal microscopy technology and Raman spectroscopy technology, confocal Raman microscopy {{has the advantage of}} both high resolution spectroscopy and chromatography detection, which inherits from confocal microscopy and raman spectroscopy. As a result, it is widely used in many fields, such as physical chemistry, materials science, biomedical, archaeological, cultural identification, and forensic science. But with the environmental changing, the system drifting or other issues, during the long detection process, the system turns to defocusing. As a result, during the hole scanning process, the system can not be focused on every detection point, and then it would lead to a mistake. Eventurally, conventional confocal Raman system could obtain the presence of measurement error even erroneous results in the long process. In this paper, on the basis of conventional confocal Raman system, a confocal Raman spectroscopy method based on quadratic curve fitting is proposed to solve this problem. Based on the principle that the maxium of the concal curve corresponding the system foucs, the steps to find system foucus as follows: fist, usesing quadratic curve to fit confocal curve; second, finding the maxium of the confocal curve; and last obtaining the system foucs. With this method, during the scanning process, every point should be focused, therefore, the effect of defocusing is eliminated efficiently, and accurate measurements of confocal Raman spectroscopy system is achieved. Through simulation and experimental results show that: the proposed method that confocal Raman spectroscopy method based on quadratic curve fitting can effectively eliminate the influence of system defocus on experimental result, and effectively improve the axial system of fixed focus accuracy, which could provide a guarantee for further application of confocal Raman spectroscopy. This <b>anti-drift</b> method is effective and accurate in focusing with great potential to be applied in broader areas...|$|E

Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a irrigaÃÃo noturna e diurna de um sistema por aspersÃo convencional, utilizando o Coeficiente de Uniformidade de Christiansen (CUC), bem como tÃcnicas de controle de qualidade. O experimento foi realizado no ColÃgio AgrÃcola Estadual Adroaldo Augusto Colombo, em Palotina, PR. Nas irrigaÃÃes, foram utilizados quatro aspersores Xcel-wobbler, com sistema antideriva nos perÃodos diurno e noturno.

Sprinkler irrigation, {{an artificial}} method of water application, supplies the whole {{or part of}} water that crops need. It {{can be used in}} several crops. Besides, it is easily adapted to different soils and topographies. Irrigation should be carried out according to the right bulk and uniformity, since it is an important factor to be considered when irrigation systems are under evaluation. Most losses are associated to a direct evaporation and wind drift of water. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating daytime and nighttime irrigation of a conventional sprinkler system, using the Christiansen Uniformity Coefficient (CUC) and quality control techniques. It was carried out at Adroaldo Augusto Colombo, a State Agricultural School in Palotina, ParanÃ. At the irrigation period, four Xcel-wobbler sprinklers were used, with an <b>anti-drift</b> system during day and nighttime.
