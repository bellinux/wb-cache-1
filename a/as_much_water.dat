5|$|In 2013, China led {{the world}} in {{renewable}} energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. As of 2014, China leads {{the world in}} the production and use of wind power, solar photovoltaic power and smart grid technologies, generating almost <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water,</b> wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity. Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E

He is devastated, but then the Princess puts on the same dress she had {{when she told him}} she loved him <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>water</b> and salt. She explains to him how it is to eat without water and salt, so they embrace.|$|R
50|$|The brose is {{prepared}} by steeping {{a volume of}} oatmeal overnight in three times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> cold <b>water,</b> then straining the liquid through muslin (discarding the oatmeal fiber).|$|R
25|$|Milk {{production}} is also resource intensive. On a global weighted average, {{for the production}} of a given volume of milk, a thousand times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> has to be used.|$|E
25|$|Dehydration {{may also}} have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better {{planning}} and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.|$|E
25|$|The Terry Thomas {{was also}} {{designed}} to conserve <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as possible. A storm water drainage system {{was designed to}} detain runoff into an on-site tank, and then slowly release it to the city storm water system. Low-flow fixtures, dual-flush toilets and waterless urinals were installed {{in order to save}} an approximate 50% of the water during everyday operation as compared to a typical office building.|$|E
50|$|Scyphozoans have no durable hard parts, {{including}} no head, no skeleton, and no specialized organs for respiration or excretion. Marine jellyfish can {{consist of}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 98% <b>water,</b> so are rarely found in fossil form.|$|R

50|$|As with {{surface water}} and {{riparian}} rights, three theories of underground water rights have evolved. The first theory, {{known as the}} absolute ownership theory, derives from English Law and affords landowners the right to withdraw <b>as</b> <b>much</b> underground <b>water</b> <b>as</b> they wish, for whatever purpose, requiring their neighbors to fend for themselves. Under the second theory, known as the American rule, landowners may withdraw <b>as</b> <b>much</b> underground <b>water</b> <b>as</b> they like {{as long as it}} is not done for a malicious purpose or in a wasteful manner. This theory is now applied in a majority of jurisdictions in the United States.|$|R
25|$|Sugar cane tolerates hot climates better, but the {{production}} of sugar cane needs approximately four times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as {{the production}} of sugar beet. As a result, some countries that traditionally produced cane sugar (such as Egypt) have built new beet sugar factories since about 2008. Some sugar factories process both sugar cane and sugar beets and extend their processing period in that way.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Uganda {{completed}} a second hydroelectric {{complex in the}} area, the Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station, with World Bank assistance. By 2006, the water levels in Lake Victoria had reached an 80-year low, and Daniel Kull, an independent hydrologist living in Nairobi, Kenya, calculated that Uganda was releasing about twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as is allowed under the agreement, and was primarily responsible for recent drops in the lake's level.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{has been}} known to {{mitigate}} the production of antidiuretic hormone, which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favour water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which relay osmotic pressure information to the posterior pituitary, the site of antidiuretic hormone release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the antidiuretic hormone. As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as they should be absorbing, leading to creation of excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration.|$|E
50|$|Grey water {{filtration}} {{systems are not}} equipped to handle the highest levels contaminants. Discretion is required as to when to use the grey water system. This includes consideration of what appliances to connect, as well <b>as</b> how <b>much</b> <b>water</b> is being processed at any given time.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 Herschel Space Observatory {{detected}} {{the signature of}} vaporized water in the comet's coma. Hartley 2 contains half <b>as</b> <b>much</b> heavy <b>water</b> <b>as</b> other comets analyzed before, with the same ratio between heavy water and regular water as found in Earth's oceans.|$|R
50|$|The {{private company}} {{received}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> raw <b>water</b> from the asset holding company as it needed for free. While higher efficiency was an {{objective of the}} privatization, the private operator had no incentives to improve operating efficiency by reducing water losses because of the free availability of water.|$|R
25|$|In Guayaquil, {{the largest}} port city in Ecuador, the {{services}} {{were transferred to}} a private operator, Interagua, in 2001. At that time, 50% of the city had only 10 hours service per day. In five years the company brought 24 hours service to all the city and served an additional 55,000 families, mostly low income {{in the southern part}} of the city. Access to water supply increased from 64 percent in 2000 to 72 percent in 2003, and access to sewerage has grown from 46 percent to 55 percent during the same period. Families were able to consume twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> while paying one fifth of what they paid before, when they bought it from vendors distributing it in tankers and charging $3.50 per cubic meter. Interagua charges only 34 cents per cubic meter for the first 15 cubic meters per month.|$|E
25|$|Sphagnum is a genus of {{approximately}} 380 accepted species of mosses, {{commonly known as}} peat moss. Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for {{a wide array of}} peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.|$|E
25|$|The Northern {{boundary}} between the British and French mandates was defined in broad terms by the Franco-British Boundary Agreement of December 1920. That agreement placed {{the bulk of the}} Golan Heights in the French sphere. The treaty also established a joint commission to settle the precise border and mark it on the ground. The commission submitted its final report on 3 February 1922, and it was approved with some caveats by the British and French governments on 7 March 1923, several months before Britain and France assumed their Mandatory responsibilities on 29 September 1923. Under the treaty, Syrian and Lebanese residents would have the same fishing and navigation rights on Lake Hula, Lake Tiberias, and the Jordan River as citizens of the Palestine Mandate, but the government of Palestine would be responsible for policing of the lakes. The Zionist movement pressured the French and British to include <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> sources as possible to Palestine during the demarcating negotiations. These constant demands influenced the negotiators and finally led to the inclusion of the whole Sea of Galilee, both sides of the Jordan river, Lake Hula, Dan spring, and part of the Yarmouk. The High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, had demanded full control of the Sea of Galilee. The new border followed a 10-meter wide strip along the northeastern shore.|$|E
50|$|Many organic molecules, {{as well as}} {{inorganic}} molecules, form crystals {{that incorporate}} water into the crystalline structure without chemical alteration of the organic molecule (water of crystallization). The sugar trehalose, for example, exists in both an anhydrous form (melting point 203 °C) and as a dihydrate (melting point 97 °C). Protein crystals commonly have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 50% <b>water</b> content.|$|R
30|$|Communities {{with the}} {{greatest}} and most diverse citizen participation are often resilient and strong. Engaging citizens to address common issues is essential for educated decision-making. No other field of urban infrastructure intervention benefits <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>water</b> infrastructure {{and to a lesser}} extent waste management from active citizen participation and engagement [9]. In this context, the successful deployment at a municipal level of innovative and novel solutions, be they technology-based or concerned with governance, is of vital importance to establish the EU as a world leader in such technologies and in its attempts to create green jobs, healthier societies and improved economies.|$|R

25|$|The {{harmonic}} {{movements of}} the dolphin kick and flutter kick are {{in contrast to the}} breaststroke whip kick, which really deserves the name kick. Scissor kick and frog kick are intermediate. Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes are bent, the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small “lifting” force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the knee is maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, {{at the end of the}} kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect like in a jelly fish. Therefore, training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision. The sudden sideways stress on knee at the kick can lead to uncomfortable noise and feeling for the beginner and to wear for the senior.|$|E

500|$|Some have {{expressed}} {{concerns over the}} oil shale industry's use of water. In 2002, the oil shale-fired power industry used 91% of the water consumed in Estonia. Depending on technology, above-ground retorting uses between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil. A 2008 programmatic environmental impact statement issued by the US Bureau of Land Management stated that surface mining and retort operations produce [...] of waste water per [...] of processed oil shale.
