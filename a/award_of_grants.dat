On 25 July 2013, the Commission presented a new legislative proposal, including the following proposed modifications:speeding-up of payments;the introduction of possible advance payments (10% of anticipation, capped at EUR 30 million);a clearer definition of the scope for intervention through the Solidarity Fund, both in general terms and in the event of slowly unfolding disasters such as droughts;a new and simplified definition of ‘regional disasters’, introducing a damage threshold of 1.5% of GDP;a simplification of the administrative procedures by combining decisions on the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>grants</b> with the implementation agreement.

Aviation programs, such as the Federal Aviation Administration’s Collegiate Training Initiative, a hiring source for air traffic controllers, are direct beneficiaries of research in this area. Recently, reports and studies that have addressed retention issues have renewed discussions on gender-related choices in curriculum development, suggesting that changes should be made to accommodate women. The data suggest that a gender intervention may be needed.

40|$|The {{increase}} {{number of}} scientific publications has made digital scientific literature search {{a difficult task}} and highly dependent of the researcher ability to search, filter and classify content. Most used scientific literature search engines and portals, such as Google Scholar, Citeseer and ACM, use only simple text-base and citation-base score to rank the query result, and the rank is barely useful. The number of references that a scientific publication has received (known as citations) determines the impact that the contribution has made to the community. Many methods (known as index) to measure or rank researchers are citation based. A fair index for these {{is important because it}} is used to evaluate and compare researchers for different purpose, such as university recruitment, faculty advancement, <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>grants,</b> among others.

40|$|The Gender and Excellence {{expert group}} {{was set up}} to provide {{recommendations}} on the improvement of transparency in the procedures used in selection committees for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>grants</b> and fellowships and in access to research funding in general. This report gives an analysis of the gender dynamics among applicants, recipients and gatekeepers of research funding, in funding processes, instruments and criteria, and the role of key funding organisations in promoting gender equality in research. The analysis was carried out in 33 countries, an overview of which is annexed to the report. These countries could be roughly divided into two groups: proactive countries, which promote and monitor gender equality in research and research funding with active policies and measures, and countries relatively inactive in this area, with few, if any, initiatives. The expert group has not found a large and systematic gender imbalance in terms of success rates in research funding in the funding systems studied, although a few exceptions exist. However, there is a clear difference in application behaviour: women are less likely to apply for funding than men, and this needs further study. To encourage the funding organisations and other stakeholders to take the gender challenge in research funding seriously in practice and take action, this report provides a number of recommendations, flags up some good practices, and outlines future research themes...|$|E
40|$|Quantifying an author’s {{scientific}} {{impact is}} becoming increasingly important for evaluation and comparison purposes (e. g., for university recruitment and advancement or the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>grants).</b> To this end, a number of quantitative metrics have been proposed that (in principle) allow the comparison of individuals’ scientific quality or impact (Cartwright and McGhee 2005; Cheek et al. 2006; Meho 2007; although for a discussion on the potential pitfalls of this approach, see e. g., Garfield 1979; MacRoberts and MacRoberts 1996). These generally fall into the categories of reputation, yield or productivity, and influence or impact (Avital and Collopy 2001). Commonly used metrics include {{the total number of}} papers published, which is commonly used to gauge basal productivity and is likely to be positively correlated with factors such as funding obtained and research group size; the mean or total number of citations received, which are assumed to indicate the scientific utility of a study and can thus be used as a partial indicator of a study’s quality and impact (Lawani 1986); and the journals where the papers were published and these journals’ impact parameter (e. g., Steinpreis et al. 1999). In particular, publication productivity and measures of citation frequency are commonly used to assess influence, although other metrics have also been proposed that incorporate both measures into a single metric. For example, the h-index, developed by Hirsch (2005), aims to measure the cumulative impact of a researcher’s output by looking at the quantity of papers published along with the number citations his/her work has received. The effective evaluation of such metrics is likely to require an understanding of factors such as visibility, the size of citing community, and the extent of integration into social and professional networks (Ward et al. 1992). However, the relationship between these factors and scientific impact is unclear. Here, I investigate how variation in individual scientific impact is related to the structure of the scientific collaboration network (specifically, the coauthorship network) of which they are a part...|$|E
