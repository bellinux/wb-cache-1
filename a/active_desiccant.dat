40|$|The Phase 1 report (ORNL/Sub/ 94 -SVO 44 / 1), {{completed}} {{earlier in}} this program, involved a comprehensive field survey and market analysis comparing various specialized outdoor air handling units. This initial investigation included conventional cooling and reheat, conventional cooling with sensible recovery, total energy recovery systems (passive desiccant technology) and various <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> systems. The report concluded that several markets do promise a significant sales opportunity for a Climate Changer-based <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> system offering. (Climate Changer is a registered trademark of Trane Company.) This initial market analysis defined the wants {{and needs of the}} end customers (design engineers and building owners), which, along with subsequent information included in this report, have been used to guide the determination of the most promising <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> system configurations. This Phase 2 report begins with a summary of a more thorough investigation of those specific markets identified as most promising for <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> systems. Table 1 estimates the annual sales potential for a cost-effective product line of <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> systems, such as that built from Climate Changer modules. The Product Development Strategy section describes the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> system configurations chosen to best fit the needs of the marketplace while minimizing system options. Key design objectives based on market research are listed in this report for these <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> systems. Corresponding performance goals for the dehumidification wheel required to meet the overall system design objectives are also defined. The Performance Modeling section describes the strategy used by SEMCO to design the dehumidification wheels integrated into the prototype systems currently being tested as part of the U. S. Department of Energy's Advanced Desiccant Technology Program. Actual performance data from wheel testing was used to revise the system performance and energy analysis modeling initially presented in the Phase 1 report. This section also provides a revised payback analysis comparing the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> systems selected with the other, more conventional approaches to specialized outdoor air handling units listed in the Phase 1 report. This report concludes {{with a look at the}} importance of analyzing <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> systems on the basis of ''latent air conditioning'' and not the more traditional ''total cooling capacity''. Since handling latent load will always be the primary reason for using an <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> system, it is concluded that the technology must be positioned as a ''latent air conditioner'' in the marketplace. In past analyses, <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> systems have been too often compared with conventional cooling systems based on total cooling output. The resulting $/ton ratios that have resulted almost always made the active approach appear as if a very significant first-cost premium were required...|$|E
40|$|A solid {{desiccant}} based {{ventilation system}} has been installed to provide ventilation, and cooling/heating as needed, to the Intelligent Workplace (IW) of Carnegie Mellon University, {{as part of the}} IW Energy Supply System (IWESS). Since its installation, extensive testing data have been collected and analyzed to characterize the operating performance and cost of each major component, namely the enthalpy recovery module, the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> module, the heat pump module, and the overall system. It has been determined that the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> wheel is expensive to operate due to the high price of natural gas in the current fuel market. In order to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the operating cost of the overall system, it has been proposed to regenerate the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> wheel using the rejected heat from a bio diesel engine generator. Given the temperature and quantity of the rejected heat available, performance maps that relate the supply air temperature and humidity with various system operating variables have been constructed for the proposed integrated system, based on the predictions from an equation-based performance model of the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> wheel. Using the IWESS project as a specific example, a procedure has been outlined for developing operating strategies for the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> wheel integrated Combined Heating and Power (CHP) system...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of the performance of two <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> cooling systems that were installed as pilot systems in two locations [...] a college dormitory and a research laboratory [...] during the fall of 1999. The laboratory system was assembled in the field from commercially available Trane air-handling modules combined with a standard total energy recovery module and a customized <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> wheel, both produced by SEMCO. The dormitory system was a factory-built, integrated system produced by SEMCO that included both <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> and sensible-only recovery wheels, a direct-fired gas regeneration section, and a pre-piped Trane heat pump condensing section. Both systems were equipped with direct digital control systems, complete with full instrumentation and remote monitoring capabilities. This report includes detailed descriptions of these two systems, installation details, samples of actual performance, and estimations of the energy savings realized. These pilot sites represent a continuation of previous <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> product development research (Fischer, Hallstrom, and Sand 2000; Fischer 2000). Both systems performed as anticipated, were reliable, and required minimal maintenance. The dehumidification/total-energy-recovery hybrid approach was particularly effective in all respects. System performance showed remarkable improvement in latent load handling capability and operating efficiency compared with the original conventional cooling system and with the conventional system that remained in another, identical wing of the facility. The dehumidification capacity of the pilot systems was very high, the cost of operation was very low, and the system was cost-effective, offering a simple payback for these retrofit installations of approximately 5 to 6 years. Most important, the dormitory system resolved numerous indoor air quality problems in the dormitory by providing effective humidity control and increased, continuous ventilation air...|$|E
40|$|The {{final report}} for Phase 1 of this {{research}} effort (ORNL/SUB/ 94 -SV 004 / 1) concluded that a significant market opportunity would exist for <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> systems {{if it could be}} demonstrated that they can remove a significant proportion of common airborne contaminants while simultaneously performing the primary function of dehumidifying a stream of outdoor air or recirculated building air. If the engineering community begins to follow the intent of ASHRAE Standard 62, now part of all major building codes, the outdoor air in many major cities may need to be pre-cleaned before it is introduced into occupied spaces. Common air contaminant cosorption capability would provide a solution to three important aspects of the ASHRAE 62 - 89 standard that have yet to be effectively addressed by heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment manufacturers: (1) The ASHRAE standard defines acceptable outdoor air quality. If the outdoor air contains unacceptable levels of certain common outdoor air contaminants (e. g., sulfur dioxide, ozone), then the standard requires that these contaminants be removed from the outdoor air stream to reach compliance with the acceptable outdoor air quality guidelines. (2) Some engineers prefer to apply a filtration or prescriptive approach rather than a ventilation approach to solving indoor air quality problems. The ASHRAE standard recognizes this approach provided that the filtration technology exists to remove the gaseous contaminants encountered. The performance of current gaseous filtration technologies is not well documented, and they can be costly to maintain because the life of the filter is limited and the cost is high. Moreover, {{it is not easy to}} determine when the filters need changing. In such applications, an additional advantage provided by the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> system would be that the same piece of equipment could control space humidity and provide filtration, even during unoccupied periods, if the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> system were operated in a recirculation mode. (3) Almost all major medical, university, and research facilities face the dilemma that the air exhausted from a building exits near the intake of another building. As a result, contaminants exhausted outdoors are pulled back into the same or an adjacent building. The removal of contaminants from outdoor air that an <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> system offers would be attractive to applications in such cases. The primary objective {{of this research}} project was to quantify the ability of the SEMCO composite desiccant dehumidification wheel to purify outdoor and recirculated air streams by removing gaseous contaminants commonly encountered in actual applications. This contaminant removal is provided simultaneously with dehumidification (removing the latent load) of these air streams at conditions encountered in HVAC applications. This research builds upon initial seed work completed by the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) during 1993 (Bayer and Downing 1993) ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a research}} and development program that produced a stand-alone <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> module (ADM) {{that can be easily}} integrated with new or existing packaged cooling equipment. The program also produced a fully integrated hybrid system, combining the <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> section with a conventional direct expansion air-conditioning unit, that resulted in a compact, low-cost, energy-efficient end product. Based upon the results of this investigation, both systems were determined to be highly viable products for commercialization. Major challenges [...] including wheel development, compact packaging, regeneration burner development, control optimization, and low-cost design [...] were all successfully addressed by the final prototypes produced and tested as part of this program. Extensive laboratory testing was completed in the SEMCO laboratory for each of the two ADM system approaches. This testing confirmed the performance of the ADM systems to be attractive compared with that of alternate approaches currently used to precondition outdoor air, where a return air path is not readily available for passive desiccant recovery or where first cost is the primary design criterion. Photographs, schematics, and performance maps are provided for the ADM systems that were developed; and many of the control advantages are discussed. Based upon the positive results of this research and development program, field tests are under way for fully instrumented pilot installations of ADM systems in both a hotel/motel and a restaurant...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} a series of manganese oxides and an analysis of their sorptive, structural, and surface characteristics as low-energetic desiccants for passive dehumidification and <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> cooling systems. A cusped Type III isotherm for the adsorption of water is reported for the first time. The data are interpreted as evidence of a first-order phase change from a two-dimensional gas to a liquid film in the first reversibly adsorbed layer. It appears that the water adsorption characteristics of MnO 2 compared to standard desiccants which exhibit Type II isotherms are due at least in part to differences in the physical topography and electronic properties of the desiccant substrates: MnO 2 is a p-type semiconductor with essentially-flat, monoenergetic surface structures, while standard desiccants like silica gel are electronic insulators with irregular, heteroenergetic surfaces...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a research and development (R&D) program to design and optimize an active desiccant-vapor compression hybrid rooftop system. The primary objective was to combine the strengths of both technologies to produce a compact, high-performing, energy-efficient system that could accommodate any percentage of outdoor air and deliver essentially any required combination of temperature and humidity, or sensible heat ratio (SHR). In doing so, such a product would address the significant challenges imposed on the performance capabilities of conventional packaged rooftop equipment by standards 62 and 90. 1 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers. The body of work completed as part of this program built upon previous R&D efforts supported by the U. S. Department of Energy and summarized by the Phase 3 b report ''Active Desiccant Dehumidification Module Integration with Rooftop Packaged HVAC Units'' (Fischer and Sand 2002), in addition to Fischer, Hallstrom, and Sand 2000; Fischer 2000; and Fischer and Sand 2004. All initial design objectives established for this development program were successfully achieved. The performance flexibility desired was accomplished by a down-sized <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> wheel that processes only a portion of the supply airflow, which is pre-conditioned by a novel vapor compression cycle. Variable-speed compressors are used to deliver the capacity control required by a system handling a high percentage of outdoor air. An integrated direct digital control system allows for control capabilities not generally offered by conventional packaged rooftop systems. A 3000 -cfm prototype system was constructed and tested in the SEMCO engineering test laboratory in Columbia, MO, and was found to operate in an energy-efficient fashion relative to more conventional systems. Most important, the system offered the capability to independently control the supply air temperature and humidity content to provide individual sensible and latent loads required by an occupied space without over-cooling and reheating air. The product was developed using a housing construction similar to that of a conventional packaged rooftop unit. The resulting integrated <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> rooftop (IADR) is similar in size to a currently available conventional rooftop unit sized to provide an equivalent total cooling capacity. Unlike a conventional rooftop unit, the IADR can be operated as a dedicated outdoor air system processing 100 % outdoor air, as well as a total conditioning system capable of handling any ratio of return air to outdoor air. As part of this R&D program, a detailed investigation compared the first cost and operating cost of the IADR with costs for a conventional packaged approach for an office building located in Jefferson City, MO. The results of this comparison suggest that the IADR approach, once commercialized, could be cost-competitive with existing technology [...] exhibiting a one-year to two-year payback period [...] while simultaneously offering improved humidity control, indoor air quality, and energy efficiency...|$|E
40|$|ABETI/IWESS is {{a project}} carried out by Carnegie Mellon's Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics, the CBPD, {{supported}} by the U. S. Department of Energy/EERE, to design, procure, install, operate, and evaluate an energy supply system, an ESS, that will provide power, cooling, heating and ventilation for CBPD's Intelligent Workplace, the IW. The energy sources for this system, the IWESS, are solar radiation and bioDiesel fuel. The components of this overall system are: (1) a solar driven cooling and heating system for the IW comprising solar receivers, an absorption chiller, heat recovery exchanger, and circulation pump; (2) a bioDiesel fueled engine generator with heat recovery exchangers, one on the exhaust to provide steam {{and the other on}} the engine coolant to provide heated water; (3) a ventilation system including an enthalpy recovery wheel, an air based heat pump, an <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> wheel, and an air circulation fan; and (4) various convective and radiant cooling/heating units and ventilation air diffusers distributed throughout the IW. The goal of the ABETI/IWESS project is to demonstrate an energy supply system for a building space that will provide a healthy, comfortable environment for the occupants and that will reduce the quantity of energy consumed in the operation of a building space by a factor of 2 less than that of a conventional energy supply for power, cooling, heating, and ventilation based on utility power and natural gas fuel for heating...|$|E
40|$|Air {{infiltration}} has {{a significant}} impact on the heating and cooling loads of small office and residential buildings. In a radiantly heated and cooled office, air infiltration normally determines whether this type of system can operate without condensation on the radiant cooling surface in summer, because infiltration may bring considerable moisture into the space. The office studied experiences infiltration that seriously limits the effectiveness of the radiant cooling system and <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> dehumidification system. Earlier infiltration measurements using the tracer gas procedure showed infiltration levels of 0. 78 – 1. 12 ACH, while CO 2 concentration measurements gave values from 0. 1 – 0. 2 ACH. This paper reports the results of infiltration levels determined from blower door measurements and logged humidity data from the ventilation unit as well as a reanalysis of the CO 2 data. There were still significant discrepancies that are resolved by combining the measured results with a calibrated simulation and additional site measurements. It is found that infiltration in the studied office is from two sources: one is outdoor air; the other is the indoor air from the floor below the studied office. The total air infiltration for the studied space may vary from 0. 74 ACH in the summer to 1. 5 ACH in the winter, while the under floor space air leaking into the studied office may range from 0. 46 - 1. 03 ACH...|$|E
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{sorption}} wheels, a passive wheel which transfers both sensible and latent heat (enthalpy wheel) and an <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> wheel, which removes moisture while adding heat to the incoming air stream (desiccant wheel) are analysed using developed mathematical models, measured and compared {{with data from}} the industry. In the present paper, a useful correlation model is also presented to evaluate the performance of an active rotary LiCl desiccant wheel based on ventilation cycle. The model has been derived from the interpolation of experimental data obtained from an experimental setup, while the correlations {{have been developed for}} predicting outlet temperature and humidity ratio of the process and regeneration air streams of the wheel. The performance of both sorption wheels depends on a group of parameters and conditions, implicating the system's operation such as the mass flow rate, the process air inlet (to the wheel) and regeneration air inlet (to the wheel) as well as the rotational speed of the wheel. The sorption wheels operate at different rotational speeds. High rotational speeds have a high moisture transport and lower rotational speeds are used for enthalpy exchange. For desiccant wheels, useful expressions are derived so as to predict their performance in various climatic conditions while for enthalpy wheels, the performed dehumidification is not sufficient and thus they frequently need an additional cooling coil for removal of moisture. © 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S. r. l. - All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a field verification pilot site investigation that involved the installation of a hybrid integrated active desiccant/vapor-compression rooftop heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) unit at an elementary school in the Atlanta Georgia area. For years, the school had experienced serious humidity and indoor air quality (IAQ) problems that had resulted in occupant complaints and microbial (mold) remediation. The outdoor air louvers of the original HVAC units had been closed in an attempt to improve humidity control within the space. The existing vapor compression variable air volume system was replaced by the integrated <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> rooftop (IADR) system that was described in detail in an Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) report published in 2004 (Fischer and Sand 2004). The IADR system and all space conditions have been monitored remotely for more than a year. The hybrid system was able to maintain both the space temperature and humidity as desired while delivering the outdoor air ventilation rate required by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers Standard 62. The performance level of the IADR unit and the overall system energy efficiency was measured and found to be very high. A comprehensive IAQ investigation was completed by the Georgia Tech Research Institute before and after the system retrofit. Before-and-after data resulting from this investigation confirmed a significant improvement in IAQ, humidity control, and occupant comfort. These observations were reported by building occupants and are echoed in a letter to ORNL from the school district energy manager. The IADR system was easily retrofitted in place of the original rooftop system using a custom curb adapter. All work was completed in-house by the school's maintenance staff over one weekend. A subsequent cost analysis completed for the school district by the design engineer of record concluded that the IADR system being investigated was actually less expensive to install than other less-efficient options, most of which were unable to deliver the required ventilation while maintaining the desired space humidity levels...|$|E
40|$|Radiant {{heating and}} cooling has a {{reputation}} of increasing the comfort level and reducing the energy consumption of buildings. The main advantages of radiant {{heating and cooling}} are low operational noise and reduced fan power cost. Radiant heating and cooling has been supplied in several forms, including floor heating, ceiling heating and cooling, radiant panels and fa?ade heating and cooling. Among them, fa?ade heating and cooling is the most recently developed system. This dissertation provides a comprehensive study of several technical issues relative to radiant heating and cooling systems that have received little attention in previous research. The following aspects are covered in this dissertation: First, a heat transfer model of mullion radiators, one type of fa?ade heating and cooling, is developed and verified by measured performance data. The simulation demonstrates that the heating or cooling capacity of mullion radiators is a semi-linear function of supply water temperature and {{is affected by the}} thermal conductive resistance of mullion tubes, the room air temperature, the supply water flow rate, and the outside air temperature. Second, the impact of the positions of radiators on energy consumption and thermal comfort is studied. This dissertation compares the heating load and comfort level as measured by uniformity of operative temperature for two different layouts of radiators in the same geometric space. The air exchange rate has been identified as an important factor which affects energy saving benefits of the radiant heating systems. Third, the infiltration and the interaction of infiltration and mechanical ventilation air to produce moisture condensation in a radiantly cooled office are examined. The infiltration of the studied office is also explored by on-site blower door measurement, by analyzing measured CO 2 concentration data, and through modeling. This investigation shows the infiltration level of the studied office to range between 0. 46 and 1. 03 air changes per hour (ACH). Fourth, the integrated sensible heating and cooling system is simulated and compared with a single duct variable air volume (VAV) system. The results show that, at the current infiltration level, the studied sensible heating and cooling system with an integrated <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> ventilation unit consumes 5. 6 % more primary energy than a single duct VAV system; it would consumes 11. 4 % less primary energy when the system is integrated with a presumed passive desiccant ventilation unit...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the investigation of}} two <b>active</b> <b>desiccant</b> module (ADM) pilot site installations initiated in 2001. Both pilot installations were retrofits at existing facilities served by conventional heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems that had encountered frequent humidity control, indoor air quality (IAQ), and other operational problems. Each installation involved combining a SEMCO, Inc., ADM (as described in Fischer and Sand 2002) with a standard packaged rooftop unit built by the Trane Company. A direct digital control (DDC) system integral to the ADM performed the dual function of controlling the ADM/rooftop combination and facilitating data collection, trending, and remote performance monitoring. The first installation involved providing preconditioned outdoor air to replace air exhausted from the large kitchen hood and bathrooms of a Hooters restaurant located in Rome, Georgia. This facility had previously added an additional rooftop unit {{in an attempt to}} achieve occupant comfort without success. The second involved conditioning the outdoor air delivered to each room of a wing of the Mountain Creek Inn at the Callaway Gardens resort. This hotel, designed in the ''motor lodge'' format with each room opening to the outdoors, is located in southwest Georgia. Controlling the space humidity always presented a serious challenge. Uncomfortable conditions and musty odors had caused many guests to request to move to other areas within the resort. This is the first field demonstration performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory where significant energy savings, operating cost savings, and dramatically improved indoor environmental conditions can all be claimed as the results of a retrofit desiccant equipment field installation. The ADM/rooftop combination installed at the restaurant resulted in a reduction of about 34 % in the electricity used by the building's air-conditioning system. This represents a reduction of approximately 15 % in overall electrical energy consumption and a 12. 5 -kW reduction in peak demand. The cost of gas used for regeneration of the desiccant wheel over this period of time is estimated to be only $ 740, using a gas cost of $ 0. 50 per therm [...] the summer rate in 2001. The estimated net savings is $ 5400 annually, resulting in a 1 - 2 year payback. It is likely that similar energy/cost savings were realized at the Callaway Gardens hotel. In this installation, however, a central plant supplied the chilled water serving fan coil units in the hotel wing retrofitted with the ADM, so it was not metered separately. Consequently, the owner could not provide actual energy consumption data specific to the facility. The energy and operating cost savings at both sites are directly attributable to higher cooling-season thermostat settings and decreased conventional system run times. These field installations were selected as an immediate and appropriate response to correct indoor humidity and fresh air ventilation problems being experienced by building occupants and owners, so no rigorous baseline-building vs. test-building energy use/operating cost savings results can be presented. The report presents several simulated comparisons between the ADM/roof HVAC approach and other equipment combinations, where both desiccant and conventional systems are modeled to provide comparable fresh air ventilation rates and indoor humidity levels. The results obtained from these simulations demonstrate convincingly the energy and operating cost savings obtainable with this hybrid desiccant/vapor-compression technology, verifying those actually seen at the pilot installations. The ADM approach is less expensive than conventional alternatives providing similar performance and indoor air quality and provides a very favorable payback (1 year or so) compared with oversized rooftop units that cannot be operated effectively with the necessary high outdoor air percentages...|$|E
