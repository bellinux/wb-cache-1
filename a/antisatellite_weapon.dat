40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{criterion for}} a pursuer to intercept a target {{in a class}} of differential games is obtained in terms of future cones: Topological cones that contain all attainable trajectories of target or interceptor originating from an initial position. An interception solution exists after some initial time iff the future cone of the target lies within the future cone of the interceptor. The solution may be regarded as a kind of Nash equillibrium. This result is applied to two examples: 1. The game of Two Cars: The future cone condition is shown to be equivalent to conditions for interception obtained by Cockayne. ref 2 2. Satellite warfare: The future cone for a spacecraft or direct-ascent <b>antisatellite</b> <b>weapon</b> (ASAT) maneuvering in a central gravitational field is obtained and is shown to equal that for a spacecraft which maneuvers solely by means of a single velocity change at the cone vertex. The latter result is illustrated with an analysis of the January 2007 interception of the FengYun- 1 C spacecraft. Comment: 27 page...|$|E
40|$|This report {{outlines}} recent {{activities and}} future plans in China's civilian space sector. It also discusses benefits and trade-offs of possible U. S. -China collaboration in space, {{as well as}} several options to improve space relations, including information exchange, policy dialogue, and joint activities. The report also includes discussion of China's controversial January 2007 testing of <b>antisatellite</b> <b>weapons...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2014, a {{feasibility}} study {{was carried out}} by the National Aerospace Laboratory of Amsterdam, for use of pulsars in place of GPS in navigation. The advantage of pulsar navigation would be more available signals than from satnav constellations, being unjammable, with the broad range of frequencies available, and security of signal sources from destruction by <b>antisatellite</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
30|$|However, the {{two most}} {{well-known}} recent debris generating events occurred in 2009 and 2007. In 2009, the operational US Iridium 33 satellite collided with the nonoperational Russian Cosmos 2251 satellite at 790  km altitude and a closing velocity of greater than 11  km/sec, generating more than 2000 trackable debris objects. In 2007, the Chinese destroyed their nonoperational Fengyun- 1 C weather satellite during an <b>antisatellite</b> (ASAT) <b>weapon</b> test. While ASAT tests {{have been carried out}} by other nations as well, destruction of the Fengyun- 1 C propelled fragments from the nearly circular orbit of 845 × 865  km to orbits with a perigee and apogee range from 200 to 4000  km (NASA ODPO 2007). This event currently tops the list as the worst fragmentation event recorded as measured by the United States Space Surveillance Network (NASA APPEL 2012). These 2007 and 2009 events are reflected in stepwise debris increases in Fig.  3.|$|R
40|$|Yale Journal of International Law, SummerThe {{future of}} peace and {{security}} in outer space is at a critical juncture. The legal regime that guides commercial, military and scientific activities in space is fragmented and increasingly inadequate {{to meet the challenges}} posed by the growing number of actors seeking to exploit space. The most serious challenge to the space regime is posed by the stated intent of the present administration of the United States to pursue national dominance in space, which may eventually include stationing weapons there. Although space is already militarized to some degree, that is, used for military support purposes, no nation has yet placed weapons in space. Such a move would cross an important and longstanding threshold,likely provoking a battle for national superiority in space dominated by the United States. It would seriously undermine the current legal order in space widely supported {{by the rest of the}} world. The deployment of ground-based <b>antisatellite</b> <b>weapons</b> would also constitute a serious departure from the current regime. Without a concerted effort to develop a more comprehensive legal regime for space that will limit unconstrained weaponization, the international community will likely face a new military competition in space, with destabilizing consequences for national and global security. Such a competition will place at risk existing military, commercial, and scientific activities in space. With events of September 11, 2001, and the war against Iraq dominating the headlines, the issue of national missile defense, and with it the larger issue of the control and weaponization of space, have receded from the front pages. However, the problem is imminent as the United States moves forward with Pentagon plans to develop "space control" and "global engagement" capabilities, which imply the deployment of weapons in space. If conflict over the use of space, or even actual conflict in space, is to be prevented or at least significantly constrained by general agreement, the international community will need to agree on permitted activity in space and more refined arrangements for distributing the benefits of that activity. Such a regime would be in the strong interest of commercial, scientific and military support constituencies worldwide. Without such agreement, space will largely be shaped by the short-term interests of power rather than the long-term interests of law...|$|R
