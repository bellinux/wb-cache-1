5|$|Asplenium montanum is {{globally}} secure, but threatened at {{the edges}} of its range. It is known only historically from Missouri, and NatureServe considers it critically imperiled in Indiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, <b>and</b> <b>Vermont,</b> imperiled in New Jersey, and imperiled to vulnerable in Connecticut and New York. The principal threat to New York populations is rock climbing.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened from two to four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York <b>and</b> <b>Vermont,</b> the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E
5|$|The fungus is saprobic, and so derives {{nutrients}} from breaking down dead plant material, such as leaves, bark, needles, and twigs, that {{has fallen to}} the ground. Fruit bodies are usually found growing in groups or scattered on leaf litter in beech and beech-hemlock forests {{during the summer and}} autumn, although it has been recorded growing on lawns. It is also often found under eastern North American oaks. The distribution includes the US states Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Michigan, <b>and</b> <b>Vermont.</b> It has also been collected in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
5|$|After Bunker Hill, Lafayette went to Maine <b>and</b> <b>Vermont,</b> thus visiting {{all of the}} states. He {{met again}} with John Adams, {{then went back to}} New York and then to its rival city, Brooklyn, where he laid the {{cornerstone}} for its public library. Lafayette celebrated his 68th birthday on 6 September at a reception with President John Quincy Adams at the White House, and departed the next day. He took with him, besides the soil to be placed on his grave, other gifts. Congress, at Monroe's request, had voted him $200,000 in gratitude for his services to the country, and a large tract of public lands in Florida. The passage back to France was aboard a ship that was originally called the Susquehanna, but was renamed the USS Brandywine in honor of the battle where the Marquis de Lafayette shed his blood for the United States.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials {{formally}} {{established the}} U.S. Highway System {{and many of the}} New England inter-state routes were redesignated as U.S. Routes. The portion of New England Route 14 from Barre to Burlington was assigned to U.S. Route 2, while the portion in New Hampshire was assigned to U.S. Route 4. This shortened Route 14 in the south to US 4/US 5 in White River Junction, and in the north to US 2 in the city of Barre. In 1935, the portion of US 2 between Montpelier and St. Johnsbury was relocated to a more northerly alignment using a section of then Vermont Route 18. The old US 2 alignment was redesignated as US 302. VT 14 was extended northward several miles to East Montpelier, ending at the junction of newly relocated US 2 <b>and</b> <b>Vermont</b> Route 12.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolutionary War, Lyon {{initially}} {{served under}} Horatio Gates in upstate New York <b>and</b> <b>Vermont.</b> In {{a version of}} the event later circulated by his political opponents, he was cashiered for cowardice and ordered to carry a wooden sword to represent his shame. In Lyon's version, he and his men were assigned to guard wheat growing in the fields near Jericho, Vermont; unhappy at not being put to good use, he asked to leave Gates' command and join the regiment commanded by Seth Warner. Lyon's conduct was vindicated by both Arthur St. Clair and James Wilkinson.|$|E
5|$|Except for James Whitcomb, all of Indiana's {{governors}} {{have been}} married {{at the time of}} their election. Whitcomb married while in office. About half of the governors {{have been married}} multiple times, all due to the death of their first wives. Three governors' wives, including Whitcomb's, died while their husbands were in office. Except for Jonathan Jennings and Thomas R. Marshall, all of the state governors have also had children. After leaving office, Marshall adopted a young boy. Only twenty of Indiana's governors were native to the state. Seven were born in Pennsylvania, four born in Ohio, and four born in Kentucky. Other governors have come from Michigan, Virginia, New York, <b>and</b> <b>Vermont.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gray {{was born}} in Sauquoit, New York, on November 18, 1810, to Moses Gray (b.February26, 1786), then a tanner, and Roxanna Howard Gray (b. March 15, 1789). Born {{in the back of}} his father's tannery, Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray's {{paternal}} great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors had moved to New York from Massachusetts <b>and</b> <b>Vermont</b> after Shays' Rebellion. His parents married on July30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn, and the lumber supply in the area had been shrinking, so Gray's father used his profits to buy farms in the area, and in about 1823 sold the tannery and became a farmer.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} plan for the U.S. Highway System, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY22 to Amenia, where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut to use old New England Route4 through Massachusetts <b>and</b> <b>Vermont</b> {{all the way to}} the Canadian border. Apparently New York State did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by AASHO (now known as AASHTO) had been amended so that the southern end of US7 began in Norwalk, Connecticut instead.|$|E
5|$|September saw Maine <b>and</b> <b>Vermont</b> go heavily Republican {{in their}} state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, {{dissident}} Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would win the election, and Hanna {{saw to it that}} the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.|$|E

5|$|South Carolina has two {{official}} mottos, both {{of which}} are in Latin. Kentucky, North Dakota, <b>and</b> <b>Vermont</b> also have two mottos, one in Latin and the other in English. All other states and territories have only one motto, except Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, which do not have any mottos. English and Latin are the most-used languages for state mottos, each used by 25 states and territories. Seven states and territories use another language, of which each language is only used once. Eight states and two territories have their mottos on their state quarter; thirty-eight states and four territories have their mottos on their state seals.|$|E
5|$|The species most {{frequently}} adopted {{as a state}} reptile is the painted turtle, with four states designating it: Colorado (the western subspecies), Illinois, Michigan, <b>and</b> <b>Vermont.</b> Three southern states—Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi—represent themselves with the American alligator. A species of box turtle, Terrapene carolina or common box turtle, has been chosen by three states, with North Carolina and Tennessee using the Terrapene carolina carolina (eastern box turtle) subspecies, and with Missouri using the Terrapene carolina triungus (three-toed box turtle) subspecies. Two bordering western states, California and Nevada, chose the desert tortoise. The loggerhead sea turtle was named by South Carolina as state reptile, while Florida chose it as state saltwater reptile. Florida also named an official tortoise, the gopher tortoise, the same animal as Georgia's state reptile.|$|E
5|$|The {{work which}} led to the {{recognition}} of Adiantum viridimontanum as a distinct taxon began in the early 20th Century. Following the discovery of disjunct specimens of western maidenhair fern, then classified as A.pedatum var. aleuticum, on the serpentine tableland of Mount Albert by Merritt Lyndon Fernald in 1905, botanists began to search for western maidenhair on ultramafic outcrops elsewhere in Quebec <b>and</b> <b>Vermont.</b> It was first identified in Vermont by L. Frances Jolley in 1922 at Belvidere Mountain in Eden. In 1983, William J. Cody transferred A.pedatum growing on serpentine, both in eastern and western North America, to A.pedatum ssp. calderi instead. Many of the stations for the fern in Vermont were described in 1985, in a survey of ultramafic outcrops in that state.|$|E

5|$|Threatening {{much of the}} East Coast of the United States, {{hurricane}} warnings {{were issued}} from Georgia to Maine. An estimated 500,000people evacuated coastal areas accordingly. Overall, impacts from Belle were less than expected and mainly attributed to flooding across New England. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power due to high winds. A total of 12people lost their lives, mostly incidents indirectly related to the hurricane, and damage reached an estimated $100million. Portions of New Jersey, New York, <b>and</b> <b>Vermont</b> were later declared major disaster areas by then-President Gerald Ford. Some damage also took place in New Brunswick, Canada, from heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|Vice President Sherman {{had been}} renominated at Chicago; seriously ill during the campaign, he died six {{days before the}} election, and was {{replaced}} on the ticket {{by the president of}} Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler. But few electors chose Taft and Butler, who won only Utah <b>and</b> <b>Vermont,</b> for a total of eight electoral votes. Roosevelt won 88, and Wilson 435. Wilson won though he had only a plurality of the popular vote and less of it than Taft and Roosevelt combined. Taft had hoped to better Roosevelt in the popular vote, but finished with just under 3.5 million, over 600,000 less than the former president. Taft was not on the ballot in California, due to the actions of local Progressives, nor in South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to {{the east coast of}} the United States in late 1914, Vermont resumed her normal routine of training cruises and exercises. The ship was temporarily placed in reserve from 1 October to 21 November 1916, though after {{returning to}} service she supported a Marine expeditionary force sent to Haiti. This duty lasted from 29 November to 5 February 1917, after which she took part in battle training in Cuban waters. Vermont arrived back in Norfolk on 29 March before proceeding to Philadelphia for maintenance on 4 April. While she was in dry dock, the United States entered World War I be declaring war on Germany. Vermonts overhaul was completed on 26 August, and she was assigned as a training ship for engine room personnel, based at Hampton Roads. On 28 May 1918, the remains of the Chilean ambassador to the United States were brought aboard the ship. The US ambassador to Chile, Joseph Hooker Shea, came aboard the ship on 3 June, <b>and</b> <b>Vermont</b> departed Norfolk that day. She transited the Panama Canal on 10 June, stopped briefly in Tongoy, Chile on the 24th, and arrived in Valparaiso three days later. Admiral William B.
