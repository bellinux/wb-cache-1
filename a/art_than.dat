5|$|Rhee Taekwon-Do {{teaches the}} {{military}} style of taekwondo, closer to traditional martial <b>art</b> <b>than</b> modern martial sport in nature. Training consists of exercises {{that may be}} classified as: basics (group drill exercises; similar to kihon in karate), destruction (breaking), hyung (patterns or forms), self-defence, and sparring. Basics, destruction, hyung, and self-defence are similar to equivalent exercises in other traditional martial art schools. Rhee Taekwon-Do teaches the Chang Hon hyung.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen was creatively active {{from his}} youth. He drew {{pictures}} with crayons on sidewalks, and invented stories {{for his friends}} about knights and legends. He even convinced his young friends to buy him crayons so he could depict the local cycling championship. At school as well, he {{was more interested in}} telling stories and learning about <b>art</b> <b>than</b> anything else. His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who introduced him to the works of Pieter Brueghel. Outside school, {{he spent most of his}} time with comic magazines and adventure books by Jules Verne or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill. At 13, he enrolled at the Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp to study sculpture, and two years later he started working as sculptor and decorator, just like his father.|$|E
25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Mesolithic in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced, and remained a less common element in <b>art</b> <b>than</b> relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot.|$|E
40|$|Public Participation in the Arts (SPPAs) {{were used}} in this {{analysis}} of participation in the arts via television, radio, and sound recordings. The arts examined were jazz, classical music, opera, musicals and operettas, plays, dance, and the visual arts. Selected findings are as follows: (1) Arts participation increases with age. (2) An aging population will increase arts participation. (3) Arts participation increases with education. (4) Arts participation rises with income. (5) Income plays a lesser role in participation via the broadcast media than that of live performance participation. (6) Urban residents are more likely to participate in the <b>arts</b> <b>than</b> are rural residents. (7) Urban residence is not as important a determinant of participation via the broadcast media and recordings as it is for live performance participation. (8) Men are less likely to participate in the <b>arts</b> <b>than</b> are women. (9) Whites are more likely to participate in the <b>arts</b> <b>than</b> are other racial groups. Polic...|$|R

25|$|During {{the later}} {{years of its}} publication, the {{magazine}} embraced more modernist <b>art</b> <b>than</b> before, although it never dropped realist illustrations completely. Several of the cover issues from 1916 and 1917 attest to this shift. Instead of featuring crayon drawings of realistic scenes with gentle social satire, they featured cover girls often clad in modern attire and embodying a modernist style.|$|E
25|$|During that period, Theo van Doesburg {{started looking}} for other artists {{to set up a}} journal and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more {{successful}} writing about <b>art</b> <b>than</b> working as an independent artist. Quite adept at making new contacts due to his flamboyant personality and outgoing nature, he had many useful connections in the art world.|$|E
25|$|In 1880 Gude had {{between five}} and eight students, but this number had shrunk {{to two or three}} by 1890. In part this {{reduction}} of pupils was {{due to a lack of}} interest in the Berlin academy, as explained to Gude by Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke who wrote that he, as well as numerous other young artists, had more of a taste for French <b>art</b> <b>than</b> German.|$|E
50|$|Vikram Dev: His munificence towards {{promotion}} {{of education and}} arts saw the establishment and growth of several educational institutions both in Jeypore (Odisha) and Visakhapatnam. He {{was more interested in}} the {{promotion of}} <b>arts</b> <b>than</b> his kingdom.|$|R

25|$|Many {{traditional}} Chinese martial artists, {{as well as}} {{practitioners of}} modern sport combat, have become critical of the perception that forms work is more relevant to the <b>art</b> <b>than</b> sparring and drill application, while most continue to see traditional forms practice within the traditional context—as vital to both proper combat execution, the Shaolin aesthetic as art form, as well as upholding the meditative function of the physical art form.|$|E
25|$|Jacob van Ruisdael is {{considered}} the most versatile of all Dutch Golden Age landscape painters. The popularity of landscapes in the Netherlands was in part {{a reflection of the}} virtual disappearance of religious painting in a Calvinist society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with Romanticism to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century <b>art</b> <b>than</b> they had assumed before.|$|E
25|$|The 18th {{century was}} also a great age for the {{topographical}} print, depicting more or less accurately a real view {{in a way that}} landscape painting rarely did. Initially these were mostly centred on a building, but {{over the course of the}} century, with the growth of the Romantic movement pure landscapes became more common. The topographical print, often intended to be framed and hung on a wall, remained a very popular medium into the 20th century, but was often classed as a lower form of <b>art</b> <b>than</b> an imagined landscape.|$|E

25|$|Philadelphia {{has more}} public <b>art</b> <b>than</b> any other American city. In 1872, the Association for Public Art (formerly the Fairmount Park Art Association) was created, the first private {{association}} in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning. In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association {{helped create the}} Percent for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city. The program, which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art, {{is administered by the}} Philadelphia Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency.|$|E
25|$|The large mound {{has been}} {{estimated}} to date from c. 3200 BC. The passages are independent of each other, leading to separate burial chambers. The eastern passage arrives at a cruciform chamber, not unlike that found at Newgrange, which contains three recesses and basin stones into which the cremated remains of the dead were placed. The right-hand recess is larger and more elaborately decorated with megalithic <b>art</b> <b>than</b> the others, which is typical for Irish passage graves of this type. The western passage ends in an undifferentiated chamber, which is separated from the passage by a sill stone. The chamber seems to have also contained a basin stone which was later removed and is now located about two-thirds down the passageway.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia {{has more}} public <b>art</b> <b>than</b> any other American city. The {{inclusion}} of decorative art in Philadelphia structures {{goes back to}} the 19th century. In 1872, the Fairmount Park Art Association was created, the first private association in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning. The Association is responsible for the art along the Schuylkill River drives. In the late 1950s, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority included a clause in its development contracts requiring that at least one percent of construction budget be allocated to fine art. In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association helped create the Percent for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city. The program, which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art, is administered by the Philadelphia Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his life, Bernstein {{demonstrated}} an enthusiasm {{for an even}} wider spectrum of the <b>arts</b> <b>than</b> his childhood interests would imply and, in 1959, when he was scoring The Story on Page One, he considered becoming a novelist and asked the film's screenwriter, Clifford Odets, to give him lessons in writing fiction.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{critical}} interpretation of the Biblical data, the Kenites were a clan settled on the southern border of Judah, originally more advanced in <b>arts</b> <b>than</b> the Hebrews, and from whom the latter learned much. They supposedly migrated from southern Asia. In the time of David the Kenites were finally settled among the tribe of Judah.|$|R
50|$|The Nazis {{regarded}} Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese as {{sharing a}} similar origin with Germans from ancient Indo-Aryan migration. Despite classifying these populations as Aryans and regarding them as more superior in <b>arts</b> <b>than</b> Nordics and Germans, the Nazis considered them less industrious than Nordics, Germans, Western Europeans and Honorary Aryans, thus marginally inferior than these races.|$|R
25|$|Often, if {{the skill}} {{is being used}} in a common or {{practical}} way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers {{have argued that the}} difference between fine art and applied art {{has more to do with}} value judgments made about the <b>art</b> <b>than</b> any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.|$|E
25|$|With a placid personality, Infante Francisco de Paula {{was more}} {{interested}} in <b>art</b> <b>than</b> in politics. The Infante, who in his childhood had received drawing lessons from the court painter and miniaturist Antonio Carnicero, was himself an amateur painter. Some of his works, including an oil painting of Saint Jerome, have survived. The Infante's main passion was music. Until he was forced to leave Spain for exile in 1808, he received music lessons from Pedro Anselmo Marchal and violin lessons from Francesco Vaccari. The Infante was a skillful singer with a good bass singing voice. His rooms at the Royal Palace were a gathering place for musicians and singers and he used to sing with them. The Infante also sang during musical evenings at the royal palace in the company of professional singers. From his youth until the end of his life, Francisco de Paula gathered an extensive sheet music collection that included almost 700 scores. This collection, acquired by the Biblioteca Nacional de España, has been preserved to this day. When Ferdinand VII created the Madrid Royal Conservatory in 1830, the infante was made an honorary member.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Italian art {{historian}} Anna Maria Carruba and the Etruscologist Adriano La Regina contested the traditional dating {{of the wolf}} {{on the basis of}} an analysis of the casting technique. Carruba had been given the task of restoring the sculpture in 1997, enabling her to examine how it had been made. She observed that the statue had been cast in a single piece using a variation of the lost-wax casting technique that was not used in ancient times; ancient Greek and Roman bronzes were typically constructed from multiple pieces, a method that facilitated high quality castings with less risk than would be involved in casting the entire sculpture at once. Single-piece casting was, however, widely used in medieval times to mould bronze items that needed a high level of rigidity, such as bells and cannon. Carruba argues, like Braun, that the damage to the wolf's paw had resulted from an error in the moulding process. In addition, La Regina, who is the state superintendent of Rome's cultural heritage, argues that the sculpture's artistic style is more akin to Carolingian and Romanesque <b>art</b> <b>than</b> that of the ancient world.|$|E

25|$|The {{other two}} groups of protesters, however, {{maintained}} their positions for weeks to come. The art gallery closed {{for the duration of}} the occupation, probably more because of the spectacle of shabbily dressed homeless men juxtaposed against the opulent exhibits of high <b>art</b> <b>than</b> for any logistical reasons. The RCPU emphasized discipline among its members in order to win rather than alienate public sympathy, which was evident at the other two locations that remained open to the public. Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster attempted to persuade the men to leave, telling them that they had made their point and should now go home. Brodie responded that if they had homes, they would be in them, and invited the colonel to arrest them. They offered to submit to arrest peacefully, and continued to do so {{for the duration of the}} occupation. Foster refused, and instead sought to manage the situation rather than clog the local prison with 1000 demonstrators and giving them the publicity they sought. The attorney-general agreed with Colonel Foster that the strikers would likely vacate on their own in a matter of days. But even as the strike dragged on from days into weeks, the police stood by awaiting orders before proceeding with an eviction. Colonel Foster had earned a reputation for diplomacy with the unemployed during the 1935 strike, which he appeared to be cultivating again in 1938. Behind the scenes, however, Foster was plotting with politicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to evacuate the post office and art gallery.|$|E

A profound belief that chess merit resided in the players' genius rather than inherent in the position on the board pervaded chess practice.|$|E
