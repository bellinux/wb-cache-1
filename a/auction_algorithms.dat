50|$|The {{ideas of}} the <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> and ε-scaling are also central in preflow-push {{algorithms}} for single commodity linear network flow problems. In fact the preflow-push algorithm for max-flow can be derived by applying the original 1979 <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> to the max flow problem after reformulation as an assignment problem; see the 1998 Network Optimization book, by Bertsekas, Section 7.3.3. Moreover, the preflow-push algorithm for the linear minimum cost flow problem is mathematically equivalent to the ε-relaxation method, which is obtained by applying the original <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> after the problem is reformulated as an equivalent assignment problem.|$|R

50|$|A later {{variation}} of the auction algorithm that solves shortest path problems was introduced by Bertsekas in 1991.It is a simple algorithm for finding shortest paths in a directed graph. In the single origin/single destination case, the auction algorithm maintains a single path starting at the origin, which is then extended or contracted by a single node at each iteration. Simultaneously, at most one dual variable will be adjusted at each iteration, in order to either improve or maintain {{the value of a}} dual function. In the case of multiple origins, the auction algorithm is well-suited for parallel computation. The algorithm is closely related to <b>auction</b> <b>algorithms</b> for other network flow problems. According to computational experiments, the auction algorithm is generally inferior to other state-of-the-art algorithms for the all destinations shortest path problem, but is very fast for problems with few destinations (substantially more than one and substantially less than the total number of nodes); see the article by Bertsekas, Pallottino, and Scutella, Polynomial <b>Auction</b> <b>Algorithms</b> for Shortest Paths.|$|E

40|$|We study auction-like {{algorithms}} for the distributed {{allocation of}} tasks to cooperating agents. To reduce the team cost of sequential single-item <b>auction</b> <b>algorithms,</b> we generalize them to assign {{more than one}} additional task during each round, which increases their similarity to combinatorial <b>auction</b> <b>algorithms.</b> We show that, for a given number of additional tasks to be assigned during each round, every agent needs to submit only a constant number of bids per round and the runtime of winner determination is linear {{in the number of}} agents. The communication and winner determination costs do not depend on the number of tasks and thus scale to a large number of tasks for small bundle sizes. We then demonstrate empirically that the team cost of sequential bundlebid single-sale (= single-item) <b>auction</b> <b>algorithms</b> can be substantially smaller than that without bundles for multiagent routing problems with capacity constraints. ...|$|E

The first paper [Ber 91] introduced the auction algorithm for the shortest paths. This algorithm had pseudo-polynomial time-complexity.

40|$|When {{a vehicle}} on a {{scheduled}} trip breaks down, {{one or more}} vehicles need to be rescheduled to serve the customers on that trip with minimum operating and delay costs. The problem of reassigning vehicles in real-time to this cut trip {{as well as to}} other scheduled trips with given starting and ending times, {{is referred to as the}} vehicle rescheduling problem (VRSP). This paper considers modeling, algorithmic, and computational aspects of the single-depot VRSP. The paper formulates a model for this problem and develops several fast algorithms to solve it, including parallel synchronous <b>auction</b> <b>algorithms.</b> The concept of the common feasible network (CFN) is introduced to find a good set of initial “prices ” for speeding up the auction algorithm. Computational experiments on randomly generated problems are described. Computational results show that, for small problems, all of the developed algorithms demonstrate very good computational performances.

40|$|This paper surveys {{a new and}} {{comprehensive}} class of algorithms for solving the classical linear network flow problem and its various special cases such as shortest path, max-flow, assignment, transportation, and transhipment problems. The prototype method, from which the other algorithms can be derived, is the auction algorithm for the assignment problem.

Conceptually, <b>auction</b> <b>algorithms</b> represent a significant departure from the cost improvement idea that underlies primal simplex and dual ascent methods; at any one iteration, they may deteriorate both the primal and the dual cost. <b>Auction</b> <b>algorithms</b> perform very well for several important types of problems, both in theory and in practice, and they are also well suited for parallel computation. 1 Research supported by NSF under Grant No. DDM- 89 [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} market equilibrium. Firstly we {{consider}} the model (Fischer model) {{where there is a}} supply of money associated with each buyer and a quantity associated with each item. The market equilibrium problem is to compute a price vector which ensures market clearing, i. e. the demand of a good equals its supply, and subject to his endowment, each buyer maximizes his utility. Each item has a utility for a given buyer. We assume that the utility function is an increasing, differentiable, concave function. We show that under the assumptions of gross substitutibility, an <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> can determine approximate market clearing. Not only does this algorithm extends the class of utility functions for which market equilibrium can be determined polynomially, the <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> is efficient and in this model O(n) faster than the <b>auction</b> <b>algorithm</b> for the case of linear utilities in the Arrow-Debreu model.
