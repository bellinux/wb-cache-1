Both Kaufman and Johnson have described the process of stop-motion animation as [...] "laborious" [...] and found challenges in making the puppets look life-like and relatable. Animator Dan Driscoll explains the process as starting with finding people on whom to model the puppets, studying human movement and facial expressions in order to produce <b>a</b> <b>precise</b> <b>result,</b> then creating the puppets and building the sets and, finally, placing the puppets on the sets and moving them frame by frame in order to create the illusion of movement.
