5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} practices emphasize {{the use of}} safe {{body piercing}} materials, frequently utilizing specialized tools developed for the purpose. Body piercing is an invasive procedure with some risks, including allergic reaction, infection, excessive scarring and unanticipated physical injuries, but such precautions as sanitary piercing procedures and careful aftercare are emphasized to minimize the likelihood of encountering serious problems. The healing time required for a body piercing may vary widely according to placement, from <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> month for some genital piercings {{to as much as}} two full years for the navel.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} time it {{typically}} takes a piercing to heal varies widely according to the placement of the piercing. Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the clitoral hood and Prince Albert piercings healing in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> month, though some may take longer. Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E
5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended {{in part on the}} wind.|$|E
50|$|In April 2013, the meet-up service {{released}} its Grouper iPhone app. The company {{has reported that}} the app, which features push notifications and alerts, allows users to set up <b>a</b> Grouper in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> hour, avoiding the long questionnaires other services require their users to fill out.|$|R
50|$|The air marshals may be {{deployed}} on <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> hour's notice and at high-risk locations. Undercover air marshals were deployed on flights {{in and out}} of New Orleans during Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002; flights coming near Salt Lake City during the 2002 Winter Olympics; and cities visited by the President.|$|R

5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and {{the leaves of the}} Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} Solar System object can be deduced {{from its}} optical magnitude, its distance, and its albedo. Objects appear bright to Earth {{observers}} either because they are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (albedo) can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the albedo is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hundred days, a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid. It is thought {{that most of the}} fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth.|$|E

5000|$|Early in the investigation, it {{is found}} that the Captain shut down the aircraft’s one good engine for no {{apparent}} reason, and that he may have been drinking <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> hour before the flight. The captain's wartime buddy, airline executive Sam C. McBane (Glenn Ford), is convinced of his friend's innocence and doggedly investigates. Flashbacks deal with both Jack's past and Sam meeting him, plus others they used to know.|$|R
5|$|Accessibility to Odense {{was greatly}} {{increased}} when the ferry service {{between the two}} main Danish islands, Zealand and Funen, {{was replaced by the}} Great Belt Bridge – opened in 1997 for rail traffic, 1998 for road traffic. When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> hour and a quarter.|$|R

25|$|In statistics, an L-{{estimator}} is an estimator {{which is}} an L-statistic – a linear combination of order statistics of the measurements. This can be <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single point, as in the median (of an odd number of values), or as many as all points, as in the mean.|$|E
25|$|The Moon has a {{stabilizing}} {{effect on}} Earth's obliquity. Frequency map analysis conducted in 1993 suggested that, {{in the absence}} of the Moon, the obliquity can change rapidly due to orbital resonances and chaotic behavior of the Solar System, reaching as high as 90° in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> few million years (also see Orbit of the Moon).|$|E
25|$|Global warming {{associated}} with large accumulations {{of carbon dioxide}} in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of Earth's surface would require <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> millennium.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} plays {{have come}} down to us today only in fragmentary form, if at all. They are known through quotations in other works, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single line, or through pieces of papyrus or partial copies in manuscript form; some are known thanks {{to the survival of}} part of a collection of hypotheses (or summaries) in papyrus, and others through being parodied in the works of Aristophanes. Some of the fragments are extensive enough to allow tentative reconstructions to be proposed.|$|E
25|$|When rocks melt, they do {{so slowly}} and {{gradually}} because most rocks are made of several minerals, which all have different melting points; moreover, the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex. As a rock melts, for example, its volume changes. When enough rock is melted, the small globules of melt (generally occurring between mineral grains) link up and soften the rock. Under pressure within the earth, <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source.|$|E
25|$|Akureyri has a subpolar {{oceanic climate}} (Cfc) {{bordering}} a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cold though not severe winters and mild summers. The snow cover starts forming in late October and melts in April, yet snow can {{lie on the}} mountain peaks around Akureyri for the whole year. Akureyri is a very cloudy town, averaging only 1047 sunshine hours annually, with barely any sunshine between November and February, but precipitation is much lower than in southern Iceland because the prevailing winds are from the south — it is <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fifth {{as much as in}} Vík í Mýrdal.|$|E

25|$|Barfly, {{released}} in 1987, is a semi-autobiographical film written by Bukowski and starring Mickey Rourke as Henry Chinaski, who represents Bukowski, and Faye Dunaway as his lover Wanda Wilcox. Sean Penn {{had offered to}} play the part of Chinaski for <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dollar {{as long as his}} friend Dennis Hopper would provide direction, but the European director Barbet Schroeder had invested many years and thousands of dollars in the project and Bukowski felt Schroeder deserved to make it. Bukowski wrote the screenplay for the film and appears as a bar patron in a brief cameo.|$|E
25|$|A {{command is}} a {{military}} formation that handles a specific task or region, and can direct forces as large as multiple corps or <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> few battalions. Previously the Army had regional commands in the UK, including Aldershot Command, Eastern Command, Northern Command, Scottish Command, Southern Command and Western Command. In addition, there were functional commands, such as Anti-Aircraft Command (disbanded in the 1950s), and overseas commands, such as Middle East Command. Gradually, these were consolidated into a land command in the UK, Headquarters UK Land Forces, and a land command in Germany, British Army of the Rhine. Eventually, both were merged into Land Command.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to such obvious dangers as insecticides and weed killers, other common household substances {{that should be}} used with caution in areas where cats may be exposed to them include mothballs and other naphthalene products, as well as phenol based products often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, such as Pine-Sol, Dettol (Lysol), hexachlorophene, etc. which, although they are widely used without problem, have been sometimes seen to be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> teaspoonful can be fatal. Essential oils are toxic to cats {{and there have been}} reported cases of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, and tea tree oil-based flea treatments and shampoos.|$|E
50|$|The most {{recognized}} {{cause of}} a toxic optic neuropathy is methanol intoxication. This can be a life-threatening event that normally accidentally occurs when the victim mistook, or substituted, methanol for ethyl alcohol. Blindness can occur with drinking <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ounce of methanol, but this can be counteracted by concurrent drinking of ethyl alcohol. The patient initially has nausea and vomiting, followed by respiratory distress, headache, and visual loss 18-48 hours after consumption. Without treatment, patients can go blind, and their pupils will dilate and stop reacting to light.|$|R
5000|$|Fabrics of {{the time}} {{included}} wild goat’s hair cloth (tus) and pashmina, light and warm wool. Silks were often embroidered with gold and silver thread and embellished with laces. Any {{and all of these}} cloths were regularly scented with rose water. Shawls were reportedly so thin they could pass through a finger ring. The various muslins had poetic names like ab-i-rawan, meaning [...] "running water", and daft hawa, meaning [...] "woven air". Each garment weighed <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ounce and would wear out after a single use.|$|R

25|$|A gyrocompass, {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quarter of an hour.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} diagnostic tools {{will include}} the use of LED microscopes and DNA-based diagnosis. Using LEDs rather than standard phosphorescent lights in microscopes forms a clearer image and improves TB detection rates in patients' sputum from 50 to 65 per cent. And DNA testing, which can determine which strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are present in sputum has 98 per cent accuracy and can be used to detect drug-resistant strains in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> day. DNA-based diagnosis is also cost-effective. As well as diagnosis, new management methods such as mobile phone text messaging and medicine kits with built-in reminder alarms will be used to enhance patients' drug compliance. Drug combinations — where different drugs are combined in the same pill — will also be used {{to reduce the number of}} pills a patient has to take from around 13 to three or four a day.|$|E
25|$|Telescopic {{fishing rods}} are {{designed}} to collapse down to a short length and open to a long rod. 20 or even 30ft rods can close to <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> foot and a half. This makes the rods very easy to transport to remote areas or travel on buses, compact cars, or public buses and subways. Telescopic fishing rods are made from the same materials as conventional multi-piece rods. Graphite, carbon, and sometimes fibreglass, or composites of these materials, {{are designed to}} slip into each other so that they open and close. The eyes on the spinning rods are generally, but not always, a special design to aid in making {{the end of each}} section stronger. Various grade eyes available in conventional rods are also available in telescopic fishing rods. The eyeless Tenkara style rods are also of this type and are typically made from carbon and/or graphite.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, largely <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} {{widespread}} scandal surrounding phone-ins, ITV Play was permanently axed, since when Nightscreen now regularly runs from around 04:00.
