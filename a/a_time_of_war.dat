5|$|The game, {{which acts}} as a {{companion}} to Type-0, was set {{in the world of}} Orience during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> between its four nations.

The original protagonists of Type-0 appear in different roles and act as secondary characters. The story was intended to be played repeatedly, tying into the nature of the game's world and the eventual culmination of a player becoming the Agito.|$|E

50|$|It {{took time}} for the idea to catch hold, but in 1882 the Church Army was born. Why 'Army?' Carlile's answer was that the evangelists {{intended}} to make war against sin and the devil.

5|$|One {{month after}} her {{attempted}} suicide, Wollstonecraft agreed {{to undertake the}} long and treacherous journey to Scandinavia in order to resolve Imlay's business difficulties. Not only was her journey to Scandinavia fraught with peril (she was a woman travelling alone during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war),</b> it was also laced with sorrow and anger. While Wollstonecraft initially believed that the trip might resurrect their relationship, she eventually recognized that it was doomed, particularly after Imlay failed to meet her in Hamburg. Wollstonecraft's despair increased as her journey progressed.|$|E

5|$|Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the {{coronation}} {{there was a}} banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> At {{the beginning of the}} reign, Charles was more often than not away from Vienna, so he had a telephone line installed from Baden (where Charles's military headquarters were located) to the Hofburg. He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences with the Prime Minister or military briefings, and she had a special interest in social policy. However, military matters were the sole domain of Charles. Energetic and strong-willed, Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front, as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war-wounded.|$|E

50|$|The major {{critique}} {{of the notion of}} a global citizens movement centers on the potential for the emergence of solidarity on issues at the global level. Nationalism, racism, and the dominance of the Westphalian state system are considered antithetical to the adoption of a global civic identity. However, some scholars point out that the historical emergence of nationalism must have felt just as improbable in <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>warring</b> city-states, and yet in retrospect it appears inevitable.|$|R

5|$|Music for <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>War</b> is a 2011 concert {{program and}} {{subsequent}} album by the Oregon Symphony under the artistic direction of Carlos Kalmar. The program {{consists of four}} compositions inspired by war: Charles Ives The Unanswered Question (1906), John Adams The Wound-Dresser (1989), Benjamin Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem (1940) and Ralph Vaughan Williams Symphony No. 4 (1935). The program was performed on May 7, 2011, at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon, and again the following day. Both concerts were recorded for album release. On May 12, the Oregon Symphony repeated the program at the inaugural Spring for Music Festival, at Carnegie Hall. The performance was broadcast live by KQAC and WQXR-FM, the classical radio stations serving Portland and the New York City metropolitan area, respectively. The concerts marked the Oregon Symphony's first performances of The Wound-Dresser as well as guest baritone Sanford Sylvan's debut with the company.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation in <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to London in April 1795, seeking Imlay, but he rejected her; {{the next month}} she attempted to commit suicide, but he saved her life (it is unclear how). In a last attempt to win him back, she embarked upon a hazardous trip to Scandinavia from June to September 1795, with only her one-year-old daughter and a maid, in order to conduct some business for him. Wollstonecraft's journey was daunting not only because she was travelling to what some considered a nearly uncivilized region during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> but also because she was travelling without a male escort. When she {{returned to}} England and realized that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide a second time. She went out on a rainy night, walked around to soak her clothes, and then jumped into the River Thames, where a stranger rescued her.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E

Competition between states led to rapid technological advancement. Iron tools became available, producing agricultural surpluses that ended whatever had once existed of the well-field system.

25|$|Most of the convicted San Patricios {{were sentenced}} to death by hanging: 30 from the Tacubaya trial and 18 from San Ángel.

Hanging was reserved only for spies (without uniform) and for “atrocities against civilians", neither of which activities were among the charges brought against any members of the Saint Patricio's Battalion.
