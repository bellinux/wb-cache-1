40|$|Batting and {{pitching}} {{statistics for}} the Colorado Rockies have long been considered inflated by sports writers and fans. Schaffer and Heiny (2006) documented a <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> effect on slugging percentage. This research examines the <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> effect on pitching statistics, ERA and on-base percentage. n their 14 years of existence, the Colorado Rockies have not yet distinguished themselves as a “good team”. They have only made the playoffs once, as a wildcard team, in the strike shortened season of 1995. It {{would be easy to}} blame Rockies pitching, since their statistics are perennially {{at the bottom of the}} league. In fact, the Rockies ranked 26 out of 28 teams in opponent batting average in the only season they made the playoffs. The Rockies have always had to make up for their weak pitching with their offensive prowess, aided in part by the elevation of their ballpark, <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> Schaffer and Heiny (2006) demonstrated a significant slugging percentage advantage by playing half of their games in the thin air of <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> Is the elevation of <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> the bane of Rockies and visiting pitchers?

Chacón put {{up one of the}} most bizarre stat lines in baseball history for a closer. Chacón was ninth in the National League with 35 saves but was also tied with a league leading nine blown saves. His record was 1-9 and his ERA 7.11. His home/road splits were even odder, as he was 1-5 at home with a 6.81 ERA and 20 saves. He allowed more hits than innings pitched, and while on the road his ERA was even worse, standing at 7.56 and notching only 15 saves. In 2005, Chacón was 1-7 with a career low 4.09 through 13 games before being traded mid season to the Yankees, ending his five-year tenure with the Rockies. A few months prior to the trade, Chacon told a sports reporter that nobody wanted to pitch <b>at</b> high altitude <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> because the ball would not curve in the light air. After Chacon went to the Yankees, Rockies manager Hurdle said that a player unhappy with the Rockies would leave quickly. [...] He finished 24-45 in 150 games with 35 saves for the Rockies.|$|R

Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers <b>at</b> <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him {{in the late summer}} that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, Manning had the second surgery on September 8.|$|E
