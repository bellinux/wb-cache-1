2500|$|A {{principal}} {{motivation for}} establishing {{the show was}} that the Nine Network had the highest-rating Australian television news service for many years, but has seen its viewing audience abandon the network in favour of the Seven Network's Seven News and Today Tonight. [...] This is not only due to Seven's increasing ratings for its news programming, but also due to their highly successful game show Deal or No Deal which airs in the 5:30pm timeslot, leading into the news. [...] Leading up to the program's February 2006 launch there was speculation that the network may delay the program until mid-year and instead show reruns of Friends in the 5:30pm timeslot. [...] Network executives <b>are</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> Friends reruns will reignite the timeslot and allow Bert's Family Feud to premiere to a solid audience.|$|E

2500|$|In sports, {{competition}} tests who {{has better}} skill and ability {{at the time}} of the game through play. Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two chickens that have similar abilities. Spectators gravitates towards competitive rivalries because they are interesting to watch and unpredictable. Society follows competitions because competitions influence [...] "the unity of society". Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that <b>are</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different teams do not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting. Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of getting something so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting. Because this is an acceptable practice, there are many supporters of competition as they fuel a way for the people to participate in a rivalry without the consequences of fighting. However, when the competition is not enough in sports and the tensions are high fighting does ensue.|$|E

60|$|I am {{glad you}} like Frederick Tennyson's poems. They {{are full of}} atmospherical poetry, and very melodious. The poet is still better than the poems--so truthful, so direct, such a {{reliable}} Christian man. Robert and I quite love him. We very much appreciate, too, young Lytton, your old friend. He is noble in many ways, I think, and affectionate. Moreover, he has an incontestable faculty in poetry, and I expect great things from him as he ripens into life and experience. Meanwhile he has just privately printed a drama called 'Clytemnestra,' too ambitious because after Æschylus, but full of promise indeed. We <b>are</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> he will come down and see us {{in the course of}} our rustication at the Baths, and occupy our spare bedroom....|$|E
