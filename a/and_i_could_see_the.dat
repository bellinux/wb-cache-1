2500|$|The {{greatest}} MMA fighter of {{all time}} is considered by experts, fighters and fans to be either heavyweight Fedor Emelianenko or middleweight Anderson Silva. UFC color commentator Joe Rogan responded to a fan's question: [...] "Joe, is Fedor the Greatest Of All Time? It's him or Anderson, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> argument going either way honestly. Both guys have had truly magical moments in competition {{against some of the}} best in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to quit the role after six years playing Natalie. She {{comments}} “'I'd been back {{for five years and}} had very little to do the year before. I quite like being busy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> scriptwriters were struggling with Natalie and where to place her so it seemed like the right time to go. It's nice that they've left it open, I'd hate to think the door was shut behind me. Absolutely, I'd like to go back, never say never. Maybe I'll track Janine down.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The song follows {{what would}} become {{trademark}} Brian May themes such as coming-of-age, nostalgia {{over the loss of}} childhood to the past, and the difficulties of life as an adult. There is also what could be an ambiguous reference to [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", in the lyric: [...] "When I was young it came to me; <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sun breaking; Lucy was high and so was I; Dazzling, holding the world inside." [...] May is admittedly a Beatles fan and has commented in numerous interviews on their impact on him.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that she was crying.|$|R
60|$|Grace turned pale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that her}} sweet countenance became {{thoughtful}} and repentant.|$|R
60|$|Grace's cheeks flushed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that she}} was {{extremely}} gratified, though still tremblingly anxious.|$|R
60|$|Again {{her eyes}} flamed upon inc. Her lips parted a little, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> white glimmer of her teeth.|$|E
60|$|Cudworth {{held his}} hand {{to me in the}} moonlight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> scars. It {{looked as if it had}} been mangled by a dog.|$|E
60|$|Father {{was silent}} for a few minutes. He was {{thinking}} deeply, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lines of decision forming in his face. At last he spoke.|$|E
60|$|At this, I {{began to}} feel uneasy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that my wife shared my trouble.|$|R
60|$|But he {{grew tired}} of looking around, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he was {{beginning}} to get frightened.|$|R
60|$|Mr. John came {{up by the}} car, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he {{was in one of}} his moods.|$|R
6000|$|... "None {{want them}} now," [...] he repeated, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tears start in his eyes. [...] "Why is it so? Has the world {{forgotten}} its {{sympathy with the}} lost children wandering in the wood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{a little}} frightened," [...] she said, [...] "when the mule came {{tumbling}} down close to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> jaguar's eyes within a few yards of me, but I had my dagger ready." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{held out}} my hand. He shook it, but his hand felt clammy. He {{cleared his throat}} in embarrassment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sweat {{starting}} out on his forehead. It was evident that he was badly frightened.|$|E
60|$|The first peep of morning, then, {{showed us}} this horrible place, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Alan knit his brow.|$|R
60|$|It {{was bright}} starlight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that we were}} making a {{complete}} circuit in the smooth water.|$|R
60|$|The figure glided yet nearer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that it was}} trembling, and now {{its arms}} were {{extended}} also.|$|R
60|$|Jacob gripped my hand {{tightly as}} the Oneidas appeared, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{corners of the}} sergeant's mouth {{twitching}} {{as if he had}} suddenly lost that feeling of security which had been so strong upon him until this moment.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} imagine what might cause this strong lateral flow, for the main channel of the river was plainly visible to me from where I sat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{rippling}} junction {{of it and the}} mysterious current which had aroused my curiosity.|$|E
60|$|Being {{upon the}} works of the fort, on a sudden I heard the dreadfulest cry raised in the city that can be imagined; 'tis not {{possible}} to express the manner of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> women and children running about the streets in a most lamentable condition.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by {{the look}} of her now how sorely in need she was of my aid and comfort.|$|R
60|$|Rupert's {{surprise}} was now more natural, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that his interest--shame on our propensities for it!--was very natural, too.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} a short silence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that she was crying under her veil. I laid my hand upon hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, a hotel. I {{suspected}} it all along. I {{picked up a}} tennis racket on the beach the first day; and after that I walked over the ridge and through the jungle <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> roof of the hotel. Only," [...] he added rather shamefacedly, [...] "I didn't like to tell her." ...|$|E
60|$|The limb {{of the law}} was now on {{the wrong}} side of public opinion, and, what heartened me to go on, the {{position}} was rapidly changing in our favour. Already the Major was paying his shot to the very indifferent landlord, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> white face of King at the back-door, making signals of haste.|$|E
60|$|From {{out of the}} fog {{came the}} mournful tolling of a bell, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pilot turning the wheel with great rapidity. The bell, which had seemed {{straight}} ahead, was now sounding from the side. Our own whistle was blowing hoarsely, {{and from time to}} time the sound of other whistles came to us from out of the fog.|$|E
60|$|Silver paused, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by {{the faces}} of George and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain.|$|R
5000|$|... "If the ACC {{continues}} to struggle, and Florida State {{goes off to}} the SEC or something like that, and Clemson moves in a different direction, {{all of a sudden}} Virginia, Duke , and North Carolina — which are all very similar institutions to the Big Ten, there is a real possibility that we may end up having that kind of T which goes south. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them joining us. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them having a real interest in joining us." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{occurred}} to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted me into a sitting position, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> with my own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{messenger}} sat {{quiet for}} a little, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> glint of {{his eyes as he}} stared at me through the gloom. He was partly stunned, I think, by the force with which I had hurled him into his seat. And also he was pondering, perhaps, what he should do next. Presently he got his mouth partly free from the cravat.|$|E
60|$|I {{sought out}} Dejah Thoris in the throng of departing chariots, but {{she turned her}} {{shoulder}} to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> red blood mount to her cheek. With the foolish inconsistency of love I held my peace when I might have plead ignorance {{of the nature of}} my offense, or at least the gravity of it, and so have effected, at worst, a half conciliation.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} I had {{nothing of the}} sort, {{and gave him a}} wider berth. If he had known, his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sun twinkle on the steel of the butt. But by the better luck for me, he knew nothing, thought all was covered, and lied on in the dark.|$|E
60|$|The man leaned {{upon his}} oar, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{in the gloom}} that his face was thrust forward, {{and that it was}} {{wrinkled}} with suspicion.|$|R
60|$|The man's brow grew {{black with}} anger. He was very angry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that it was}} with {{difficulty}} he kept his hands off me.|$|R
60|$|My dearie stood {{straight}} up and the trembling left her. She stepped back, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her face, white as the dead, but calm and resolved.|$|R
