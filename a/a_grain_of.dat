5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something smaller than <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% {{of people can}} correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5000|$|Titanium dioxide (...) , {{has been}} shown to have {{increased}} hardness and ductility at the nanoscale.

[...] In the same experiment, the ductility of titanium dioxide was measured. The strain rate sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 250 nanometer <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> titanium dioxide was about 0.0175, while <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> with size <b>of</b> about 20 nanometers had a strain rate sensitivity of approximately [...]037; a significant increase.|$|R

5|$|On {{top of the}} sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is {{supported}} by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles. The lions may {{be based on the}} Florentine , as if to mark John XXIII {{in the same manner as}} a conquered city-state. As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.1342) in the Bargello.|$|E
5|$|Isis was {{originally}} a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion, {{which did not}} include Greek-style mysteries. Some Egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests, out of public view, but ordinary Egyptians were never permitted to join in. Other rituals may have reenacted events from Egyptian mythology, such as the ceremonies in honor of Osiris, {{the god of the}} afterlife and the mythological husband of Isis, that were performed at Abydos. The Greeks interpreted these myth-based rituals as mysteries. The historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BCE, was the first to do so. He referred to Egyptian rites reenacting the myth of the murder of Osiris as mysteries, likening them to the mysteries of Dionysus he was familiar with in Greece. He further said that the Greek worship of Dionysus was influenced by the worship of Osiris in Egypt. Various Greek writers who came after Herodotus viewed Egypt and its priests as the source of all mystical wisdom. They claimed that many elements of Greek philosophy and culture came from Egypt, including the mystery cults. Burkert and the Egyptologist Francesco Tiradritti both say there is <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> truth in these claims, as the oldest Greek mystery cults developed in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, {{at the same time that}} Greece was developing closer contacts with Egyptian culture. The imagery of the afterlife found in the mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in Egyptian afterlife beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E

40|$|The coercive {{field of}} {{permanent}} magnets decreases with increasing grain size.
