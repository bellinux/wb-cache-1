5000|$|A {{cold saw}} is a {{circular}} saw designed to cut metal {{which uses a}} toothed blade to transfer the heat generated by cutting to the chips created by the saw blade, allowing both the blade and material being cut to remain cool.

50|$|A saw {{is a tool}} {{consisting}} of a tough blade, wire, or chain with a hard toothed edge. It is used to cut through material, very often wood. The cut is made by placing the toothed edge against the material and moving it forcefully forth and less forcefully back or continuously forward.

40|$|Samples of two Thermal Spray Coating (TSC) alloys on a {{low carbon}} steel {{substrate}} were obtained: alloy C 276 and Nicko-Shield 200. Specimens of each alloy were subjected to heat treatments at temperatures at 1100 ° for 60 minutes and 1200 ° for 10 minutes, with some specimens left in the as-sprayed condition. Three replicates were prepared for each condition. Thin 1 ” strips were cut using a diamond wafering blade for porosity measurements and 2 ” x 1 ” specimens were cut for corrosion testing using a SiC <b>abrasive</b> <b>saw.</b> The porosity specimens were mounted in acrylic resin, polished, and examined using SEM. From these images, area percent porosity was calculated using automatic image analysis software. The average porosity of the untreated specimens was 2. 51 % for C 276 and 2. 2 % for Nicko-Shield 200; these values were not statistically different. Heat treatment resulted in no significant change in area percent porosity. The corrosion specimens were mounted in acrylic so that only the coating surface was exposed to the environment. These specimens were immersed in 20 % H 2 S 04 at 65 °C for 200 hrs. Each specimen was weighed before and after immersion to measure mass loss due to corrosion. The average mass loss of as-sprayed Nicko-Shield 200 was 6. 405 mm/yr. The heat treated specimens of Nicko-Shield 200 showed improved corrosion resistance, with an average mass loss rate of 0. 92 and 0. 54 mm/year after treatments at 1100 ° for 60 minutes and 1200 ° for 10 minutes, respectively. C 276 failed corrosion testing under all conditions. Overall, heat treating was found to increase corrosion resistance without effecting porosity. Visual {{evidence suggests that the}} change in corrosion behavior was caused by the formation of an oxide layer during heat treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Multi-wire sawing {{process has}} been widely used for wafer slicing of silicon {{substrates}} for solar cells. Usually {{there are two different}} kinds of wire saw in multi-wire sawing process including free <b>abrasive</b> wire <b>sawing</b> with SiC grits and fixed <b>abrasive</b> wire <b>sawing</b> with diamond wire. For free <b>abrasive</b> wire <b>sawing</b> process, the material removal mechanism can be considered as lapping and the fixed <b>abrasive</b> wire <b>sawing</b> can be considered as grinding. This paper is to investigate the characteristics of the surface texture of silicon substrate fabricated by these two wire sawing process. Experimental results have been observed by white light interferometry and SEM. Some different properties of both processes have compared been with variant characteristics including 2 -D and 3 -D surface roughness parameters.

40|$|Abstract. The main aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the practical aspects and compare two of the most common machining techniques employed in the crack compliance method for the determination of residual stresses, namely WEDM and circular <b>abrasive</b> <b>saws.</b> For the circular saws, the effect of the rotational speed and blade thickness was also evaluated. Results show that the associated level of errors introduced during thin saw machining can be as low as the results obtained by WEDM machining. However, for practical reasons, WEDM machining offers a better control of cut increment length than sawing techniques. Additionally, higher rotational saw speeds are likely to introduce larger errors in strain readings probably due to higher frictional heat and plasticity generation ahead of the slot tip...|$|R

50|$|In the 20th century, stonemasonry saw {{its most}} radical {{changes in the}} way the work is accomplished.

Cranes and forklifts have made moving and laying heavy stones relatively easy for the stonemasons. Motor powered mortar mixers have saved much in time and energy as well. Compressed-air powered tools have made working of stone less time-intensive. Petrol and electric powered <b>abrasive</b> <b>saws</b> can cut through stone much faster and with more precision than chiseling alone.

40|$|Solar grade silicon {{production}} is an energy intensive and {{harmful to the}} environment process. Yet 40 % of this valuable product material is lost into sawdust (kerf loss) during wafering. The kerf waste from Fixed <b>Abrasive</b> <b>Sawing</b> of PV silicon wafers is pelletized and then remelted in an induction furnace. The furnace has a square cross-section quartz crucible, surrounded by graphite susceptors and heated by an induction coil that enables directional solidification of the new ingot. Top and bottom 'pancake' coils provide additional temperature control. Once melted, silicon becomes electrically conductive and subject to stirring by induction. To recycle the silicon, particulate impurities (due to the sawing, condensed silicon oxides or carbides) need to be removed. Flow control and the electromagnetic Leenov-Kolin force are used to expel particulates, through a novel dual frequency induction scheme. Three-dimensional, multi-physics numerical modelling captures the electromagnetic, fluid-flow and heat-transfer effects in this process.

40|$|Semiconductor wafers {{are getting}} thinner and thinner. GaAs wafers are not {{excluded}} by this trend. Since new dicing technologies {{are required for}} wafer thicknesses less than 150 µm. Significant differences are noted among existing dicing methods. <b>Abrasive</b> <b>sawing</b> does not provide the desired cutting speed and yield because of mechanical damage (cracking, chipping). Cutting with conventional lasers should be avoided because of significant heat damage and safety issues (arsenic oxides). The Laser-Microjet, which combines a laser and a water jet, is currently the most promising technology for thin wafer dicing. It is faster and cleaner than any other process on thin GaAs wafers and generates an impressive kerf quality. The water jet, combined with a thin water film on the wafer surface, removes any deposition generated by laser ablation. No toxic gas is emitted, since all toxic material is carried away by water. The Laser-Microjet also allows omni-directional cutting, which is impossible with blades. Specifically, it can cut at 45 ° to the crystal plane. Edge grinding of thin wafers represents one application of omni-directional cutting, reducing breakage by removing the sensitive wafer edge containing micro-cracks...|$|R

5000|$|Silicon {{epi wafers}} were first {{developed}} around 1966, and achieved commercial acceptance {{by the early}} 1980s. Methods for growing the epitaxial layer on monocrystalline silicon or other wafers include: various types of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) classified as Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) or metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), as well as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Two [...] "kerfless" [...] methods (without <b>abrasive</b> <b>sawing)</b> for separating the epitaxial layer from the substrate are called [...] "implant-cleave" [...] and [...] "stress liftoff". A method applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are the same material employs ion implantation to deposit {{a thin layer of}} crystal impurity atoms and resulting mechanical stress at the precise depth of the intended epi layer thickness. The induced localized stress provide a controlled path for crack propagation in the following cleavage step. In the dry stress lift-off process applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are suitably different materials, a controlled crack is driven by a temperature change at the epi/wafer interface purely by the thermal stresses due to the mismatch in thermal expansion between the epi layer and substrate, without the necessity for any external mechanical force or tool to aid crack propagation. It was reported that this process yields single atomic plane cleavage, reducing the need for post lift-off polishing, and allowing multiple reuses of the substrate up to 10 times.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{usage of}} diamond-plated wire to produce silicon wafers for the {{photovoltaic}} industry {{is still a}} new and highly investigated wafering technology. The requirements regarding {{the quality of the}} wafer surface are very high and they have to compete with the cost effectiveness and quality of wafers produced by the established loose <b>abrasive</b> <b>sawing</b> technology. Hence, the wafer topography, the fracture stress and the corresponding sub-surface damage have to be investigated and improved. This paper discusses the topographic parameters, the crack depths and the fracture stress of mono- and multi-crystalline silicon wafers that were produced on multi-wire saws using diamond-plated wire and comparable process parameters. Especially multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers exhibit lower fracture stress values compared to mono-crystalline silicon (cz-Si) wafers. We investigated the relations between crack depth and fracture stress. In detail, we determined a 15 % higher median and a 40 % increased interquartile range of the crack depth of mc-Si wafers in comparison to similar produced cz-Si wafers. That correlates with lower fracture stress values of textured mc-Si wafers compared to cz-Si wafers. In the following, we studied the sub-surface damage as a function of crystal orientation in detail. It was found that the crack depths increases from the { 100 } plane over the { 111 } plane to the { 101 } plane. However for the { 101 } plane two grains were investigated, resulting in a discrepancy of 4 μm. This {{may be related to the}} unknown rotation angle between the corresponding { 111 } cleavage planes and the wire direction and requires further investigations...|$|R

Effects of processing parameters on the performance of the diamond wire sawing processes are investigated by using the Taguchi method for this design of experiment (DOE). The analysis of the result shows that the optimal combinations for good surface roughness are small grain size, high wire speed, and low feed rate. Wire speed and feed rate are positively related to material removal rate...|$|R

The problem of wire saw strength is mathematically formulated, and the effective parameters are analyzed. The surface morphology is analyzed for the developed diamond wire saw.
