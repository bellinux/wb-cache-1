50|$|Although the DFA is {{essentially}} a polarization independent amplifier, {{a small proportion of}} the dopant ions interact preferentially with certain polarizations and a small dependence on the polarization of the input signal may occur (typically < 0.5 dB). This is called Polarization Dependent Gain (PDG). The absorption and emission cross sections of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites. The random distribution of the orientation of the ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an <b>anisotropic</b> <b>distribution</b> by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers - i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not. In an ideal doped fibre without birefringence, the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibres small amounts of birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fibre length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibres give rise to polarization mode dispersion) produce a misalignment of the relative polarizations of the signal and pump lasers along the fibre, thus tending to average out the PDG. The result is that PDG is very difficult to observe in a single amplifier (but is noticeable in links with several cascaded amplifiers).|$|E
