40|$|Eye–hand {{coordination}} {{was investigated}} {{with the global}} effect paradigm. In this paradigm, saccades typically land in between the target and a nearby presented distractor, the configuration’s center of gravity. This so-called global effect, or spatial averaging, is attributed to incomplete target selection. Four experiments demonstrated a similar effect for hand movements; thus, eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> are coupled during target selection. However, under some conditions the global effect was different for eye <b>and</b> <b>hand,</b> suggesting that their coupling is not achieved through a shared target representation. Instead, eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> seem to use 2 separate target representations that exchange information. The convergent amplitudes of eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> with simultaneous execution support this interpretation. Latencies showed a similar converging pattern. A great number of daily activities require the coordinated action of eye <b>and</b> <b>hand.</b> Whether reaching for a coffee cup or playing tennis, {{it is necessary to}} couple motor information with visual information for these actions to be successful. Because the hand motor system relies on visual information, {{it seems likely that the}} motor systems of eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> are closely coupled. Coupling can be studied with respect to the time of movement initiation and the representation of target position of both eye <b>and</b> <b>hand.</b> It is generally assumed that the information used for movement initiation differs for eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements (e. g., Gielen, van den Heuvel, & van Gisbergen, 1984), at least in the case of reactive movements (Sailer, Eggert, Ditterich, & Straube, 2000). This as-sumption is supported by the rather weak correlations found be-tween eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movement latencies toward visual target...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} the reliability of tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength <b>and</b> endurance measurements in old adults using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI). Method: Thirty aged-care residents (6 males and 24 females) aged 79 – 97 years were tested on four occasions two weeks apart to determine test–retest reliability. The primary outcome measures were isometric anterior and posterior tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength (best of three trials) and isometric tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> endurance time at 50 % of maximal strength. Results: Changes in the mean between sessions for tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength indicated acceptable (<[*] 10 %) reliability particularly with familiarisation. The within-subject variation (mean-typical error expressed as a coefficient of variation, CV) indicated higher than acceptable variation for anterior and posterior tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength. Intra-class correlations (ICC) indicated moderate to strong reliability for anterior (ICC 0. 58 – 0. 77) and posterior (ICC 0. 77 – 0. 84) tongue strength <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength (ICC 0. 79 – 0. 96). No tongue or hand endurance measures were regarded as reliable. Conclusion: These findings indicate that overall tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength values demonstrate acceptable reliability in the elderly, especially where familiarisation with the IOPI is provided. Further investigation to reduce sources of variability in tongue endurance measurements is warranted...|$|R

In the present study, eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements were simultaneously measured during visually guided wrist step-tracking tasks in 16 patients with intention tremor and 15 healthy controls. The coupling between eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements was analyzed during simultaneous eye-hand tracking, and interactions were studied by comparing the coordinated eye-hand condition with isolated eye- or hand-tracking conditions. Despite movement abnormalities, the onset of eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements was highly correlated and an invariant coupling between the saccadic completion time <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> peak velocity was found, suggesting that the temporal coupling was very much preserved. The differences between the experimental tracking conditions suggest that, in MS patients with intention tremor, the ocular system influenced the hand movements.

A multi-centre cohort study was conducted, recruiting consenting patients with early rheumatoid arthritis from eight outpatient occupational therapy departments. Wrist <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> joint impairment <b>and</b> function were assessed by measuring joint pain and swelling, range of motion and joint deviation, handgrip <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> dexterity. The results demonstrated that the non-dominant hand showed less pathological structural and functional involvement than the dominant hand in all but one outcome measure. These differences reached statistical significance between dominant <b>and</b> non-dominant <b>hands</b> on active range of motion in the wrist and some digits. Dominant <b>hand</b> structural impairment <b>and</b> dysfunction in this early RA sample was consistently greater than the non-dominant <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> bilateral handgrip ratio did not reflect healthy values for norms.

Unlike previous gesture databases, this data requires knowledge about both body <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> in order to distinguish gestures. It is also focused on a clearly defined gesture vocabulary from a real-world scenario that has been refined over many years.
