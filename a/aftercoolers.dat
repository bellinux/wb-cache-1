50|$|Junkers {{still did}} not give up. Using the {{original}} 46.4 litre displacement A/B design, they added a new two-stage supercharger including a trio of <b>aftercoolers,</b> one per pair of neighboring cylinder banks for high-altitude use, producing the 222E and F-series. Although sea-level performance was unchanged, the engine was able to produce 1,439 kW (1,930 hp) at 9,000 m (29,530 ft). By this point {{it appeared that the}} problems were finally being worked out, but bombing of the Junkers Motorenwerke's headquarters factories in Dessau made production almost impossible. A final attempt for even higher altitude performance resulted in the turbocharged 222G and H, built only to the extent of a few testbed prototypes.|$|E
5000|$|The inter prefix in {{the device}} name {{originates}} from historic compressor designs. In the past, aircraft engines were built with Charge-Air Coolers that were installed between multiple stages of supercharging, thus {{the designation of}} inter.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the investigation of the}} feasibility of rapid drilling in ice sheets and glaciers to depths of up to 600 m, with cuttings and cores continually transported by air reverse circulation. The method employs dual wall drill rods. The inner tubes provide a continuous pathway for the chips and cores from the drill bit face to the surface. To modify air reverse circulation drilling technology according to the conditions of a specific glacier, original cutter drill bits and air processing devices (air-cooled <b>aftercoolers,</b> air receivers, coalescing filters, desiccant dryers) should be used. The airflow velocity for conveying a 60 -mm diameter and 200 -mm long ice core should not be lower than 22. 5 m/s, and the minimal airflow rate for continual chip and cores transport is 6. 8 m 3 /min at 2. 3 – 2. 6 MPa. Drilling of a 600 -m deep hole can be accomplished within 1. 5 days in the case of 24 h drilling operations. However, to avoid sticking while drilling through ice, the drilling depth should to be limited to 540 m at a temperature of − 20 °C and to 418 m at a temperature of − 10 °C. この論文では、氷床や氷河の深度 600 mまでの氷コア掘削について、空気を循環して送ることで氷の切削と氷コアの輸送を連続的に行う高速掘削の実行可能性について述べている。この方法は、二重のチューブにしたドリルロッドを使うことで可能である。二重ドリルロッドの内側チューブは、ドリルの切削面から地上までの切削チップおよび氷コアの輸送経路となる。様々な氷河の状況によって空気循環掘削技術を適応するために、それに対応するドリルロッドのカッターと空気処理装置（乾燥した冷たい空気を送るための、空冷クーラー、空気貯留タンク、空気乾燥機など）を使用する必要がある。直径 60 mm、長さ 200 mmの氷コアを運ぶための空気速度は 22. 5 m/s以上でなければならず、連続的な切削チップおよび氷コア輸送のための最小空気流量は 2. 3 〜 2. 6 MPaの時に 6. 8 m 3 /分になる。 24 時間の掘削作業の場合には、 600 mの深さの孔を 1. 5 日以内に掘削することが可能である。しかし、氷河や氷床の掘削中にスタックするのを避けるためには、掘削深度を− 20 ℃の氷温では 540 mに、− 10 ℃の氷温では 418 mに制限する必要がある...|$|E
40|$|TutorialTutorial 10 A: Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are subject}} to transient events, such as emergency shutdowns, which can cause energetic surge events during rapid shutdown transients. Many modeling tools are used to predict the behavior of compressor systems during fast transient events. Even more, centrifugal compressor dynamic modeling is a valuable assessment tool that can help improve {{the design of the}} compressor anti-surge system to prevent harsh conditions while the unit is coasting down. Modeling of centrifugal compressor transient events requires a detailed evaluation of many system variables to obtain accurate results. Additionally, many parameters should be included and analyzed to adjust the model and obtain acceptable predictions. Those parameters can include recycle valve characteristics, the controller and actuator, suction and discharge piping volumes, <b>aftercoolers,</b> and operating conditions. Other parameters, such as machine coast down speed and inertia and different control response times will determine if the compressor will reach its surge limit at a detrimental high head condition, avoid it or go through it at low acceptable energy conditions. Many designs use general guidelines to select and plan the compressor anti-surge system and its main components. For example, the recycle valve type, size and actuation time are key parameters during the shutdown of the compressor unit since they directly affect the amount of flow through the compressor and its reaction time. Other factors are also relevant and should be assessed in detail to assure a proper design to avoid such transient events as a sudden shutdown of a compressor from a full load or high head operating conditions resulting in damaging surge events. In order to refine the simulation approach of the transients in centrifugal compressors, an extensive assessment has been conducted of the main parameters that will affect the modeling predictions. Parameters such as recycle valve size, type, actuation time, after-cooler volume, friction factors, unit speed coast down predictions, compressor map, isolation valve control, acting time, as well as placement of the discharge check valve influence the modeling predictions considerably. Therefore, parametric studies of some of those variables have helped to refine and adjust the modeling technique while improving the accuracy of the results. Moreover, computational predictions have been compared against high fidelity ? high accuracy data collected in a full scale compressor system. Initial comparisons indicated reasonable results while adjustments in the technique and main assumptions improved the modeling predictions considerably. A generic methodology to improve modeling predictions and main considerations are part of the analysis. In addition, a comparison of the modeling results and experimental data are presented and complemented with parametric studies of different variables. In general, this work should provide guidelines for advancing the modeling of centrifugal compressor transients as well as showing the application of a valuable tool for designing surge control systems for centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|In 1989, the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), which {{includes}} the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), {{was placed on the}} Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) National Priorities List. The Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) (DOE 1992), effective January 1, 1992, now governs environmental restoration activities conducted under CERCLA at the ORR. Following signing of the FFA, U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the state of Tennessee signed the Oak Ridge Accelerated Cleanup Plan Agreement on June 18, 2002. The purpose of this agreement is to define a streamlined decision-making process to facilitate the accelerated implementation of cleanup, resolve ORR milestone issues, and establish future actions necessary to complete the accelerated cleanup plan by the end of fiscal year 2008. While the FFA continues to serve as the overall regulatory framework for remediation, the Accelerated Cleanup Plan Agreement supplements existing requirements to streamline the decision-making process. Decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) activities of Bldg. K- 25, the original gaseous diffusion facility, is being conducted by Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC (BJC) on behalf of the DOE. The planned CERCLA action covering disposal of building structure and remaining components from the K- 25 building is scheduled as a non-time-critical CERCLA action as part of DOE's continuous risk reduction strategy for ETTP. The K- 25 building is proposed for D&D because of its poor physical condition and the expense of surveillance and maintenance activities. The K- 25 /K- 27 D&D Project proposes to dispose of the commingled waste listed below from the K- 25 west side building structure and remaining components and process gas equipment and piping at the Environmental Management Waste Management Facility (EMWMF) under waste disposal proxy lot (WPXL) 6. 999 : (1) Building structure (e. g. concrete floors [excluding basement slab], roofing, structural steel supports, interior walls, and exterior walls) and support system components including the recirculation cooling water (RCW); electrical; communication; fire protection; ventilation; process coolant; process lube oil; utilities such as steam, water and drain lines; (2) Process Piping; (3) Seal Exhaust Headers; (4) Seal Exhaust Traps; (5) Process Valves; (6) Differential Blind Multipliers (DBM) /Partial Blind Multipliers (PBM); and (7) <b>Aftercoolers</b> (also known as Intercell coolers). Converters and compressors while components of the process gas system, are not included in this commingled waste lot. On January 6, 2009, a meeting was held with EPA, TDEC, DOE and the team {{for the sole purpose of}} finalizing the objectives, format, and content of WPXL 6. 999. The objective of WPXL 6. 999 was to provide a crosswalk to the building structure and the PGE components profiles. This was accomplished by providing tables with references to the specific section of the individual profiles for each of the WLs. There are two building profiles and eight PGE profiles. All of the waste identified in the individual profiles will be commingled, shipped, and disposed exclusively under WPXL 6. 999. The individual profiles were provided to the EPA and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) for information purposes only. This summary WPXL 6. 999 will be submitted to EPA, TDEC, and DOE for review and approval. The format agreed upon by the regulators and DOE form the basis for WPXL 6. 999. The agreed format is found on pages v and vi of the CONTENTS section of this profile. The disposal of this waste will be executed in accordance with the Action Memorandum for the Decontamination and Decommissioning of the K- 25 and K- 27 Buildings, East Tennessee Technology Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (DOE 2002), Removal Action Work Plan for the K- 25 and K- 27 Buildings, Process Equipment Removal and Demolition, K- 25 /K- 27 Project, East Tennessee Technology Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (DOE 2008 a); Waste Handling Plan for Demolition of the K- 25 and K- 27 Building Structures and Remaining Components Located at the East Tennessee Technology Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (DOE 2005); and Waste Handling Plan for Building K- 25 West Wing Process Equipment and Piping at the East Tennessee Technology Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (DOE 2008 b) ...|$|E
