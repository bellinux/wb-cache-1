5|$|Because all of Germany's {{powerful}} dreadnoughts {{had either}} been scuttled in Scapa Flow or ceded to the Allies as war prizes, the Braunschweig-class battleships were recommissioned into the newly reorganized Reichsmarine. In {{the years following}} World War I, Braunschweig, Elsass, and Hessen were to be rebuilt as coastal defense ships, although this plan was abandoned. Braunschweig served in the Reichsmarine from 1921 to 1926, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> she was withdrawn from active duty. On 31 May 1931, she was stricken and converted into a hulk at Wilhelmshaven, and eventually scrapped. Elsass saw active duty in the fleet from 1924 until 25 February 1930, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>point</b> she was removed from active service. On 31 March 1931, she was stricken, hulked in Wilhelmshaven. On 31 October 1935, Elsass was sold to Norddeutscher-Lloyd in Bremerhaven, and scrapped in 1936.|$|E

5|$|US11 and NY41 follow Port Watson Street into {{downtown}} Cortland, {{where they}} meet NY13 at Church Street.

Here, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the city of Cortland. The overlap between NY41 and NY222 ends two blocks later when US11 and NY41 turn north onto Main Street.
