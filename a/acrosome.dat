25|$|Head: It has {{a compact}} nucleus with only {{chromatic}} substance and {{is surrounded by}} only a thin rim of cytoplasm. Above the nucleus lies a cap-like structure called the <b>acrosome,</b> formed by modification of the Golgi body and which secretes enzyme spermlysin (hyaluronidase, corona-penetrating enzyme, zona eyesin, or aerosin.) On {{the surface of the}} head lies a decapcitating substance which is removed before fertilisation.|$|E
25|$|During spermiogenesis, the {{spermatids}} {{begin to}} form a tail by growing microtubules {{on one of the}} centrioles, which turns into basal body. These microtubules form an axoneme. Later the centriole is modified in the process of centrosome reduction. The anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive. The Golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus, becoming the <b>acrosome.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The second {{process in}} sperm {{activation}} is the <b>acrosome</b> reaction. This involves releasing {{the contents of}} the <b>acrosome,</b> which disperse, and the exposure of enzymes attached to the inner acrosomal membrane of the sperm. [...] This occurs after the sperm first meets the egg. [...] This lock-and-key type mechanism is species-specific and prevents the sperm and egg of different species from fusing. [...] There is some evidence that this binding is what triggers the <b>acrosome</b> to release the enzymes that allow the sperm to fuse with the egg.|$|E
40|$|In {{mice and}} humans, a normal {{offspring}} {{can be obtained}} by injecting a single spermatozoon into an oocyte, the process called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). When three or more mouse spermatozoa with intact <b>acrosomes</b> were injected into individual mouse oocytes, an increasing proportion of oocytes became deformed and lysed. Oocytes did not deform and lyse when acrosome-less spermatozoa were injected, regardless of the number of spermatozoa injected. Injection of more than four human spermatozoa into a mouse oocyte produced vacuole-like structures in each oocyte. This vacuolation did not happen when spermatozoa were freed from <b>acrosomes</b> before injection. Hamsters, cattle, and pigs have much larger <b>acrosomes</b> than the mouse or human. Injection of a single acrosome-intact hamster, bovine, and porcine spermatozoon deformed and lysed many or all mouse oocytes. This deformation did not happen when these spermatozoa were freed from <b>acrosomes</b> before ICSI, regardless of the number of spermatozoa injected. Because trypsin and hyaluronidase mimicked the action of acrosome-intact spermatozoa, {{it is likely that the}} acrosomal enzymes deform and lyse the oocytes. Injection of small amounts of trypsin and hyaluronidase into normally fertilized mouse eggs disturbed their pre- and postimplantation development. In view of potentially harmful effects of acrosomal enzymes on embryo development, the removal of <b>acrosomes</b> before ICSI is recommended for animals with large sperm <b>acrosomes.</b> The removal of <b>acrosomes</b> may increase the efficiency of ICSI in these animals. Although human and mouse spermatozoa do not need to be freed from <b>acrosomes,</b> the removal of <b>acrosomes</b> before ICSI is theoretically preferable...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-seven {{different}} batch {{dates of}} frozen bull semen from 26 bulls {{were used in}} this study. The semen was in 0. 5 -ml straws, and 23 of the batch dates were in whole milk extender while 4 were in egg yolk-tris extender. Straws from each batch of semen were incubated for 2 hours in a water bath at 37 degrees C. Following this, the percentage of progressive motility, the rate of motility, {{and the percentage of}} intact <b>acrosomes</b> were determined for each unfixed sample. Each batch of semen was fixed in 2 different solutions of 0. 2 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (glutaraldehyde 1 and glutaraldehyde 2) and in 10 % neutral buffered formol saline (formol saline). The percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> for each sample in these fixatives was determined at Day 0 and Day 7. There {{were no significant differences in}} the percentages of intact <b>acrosomes</b> among the unfixed samples and the samples in the 3 fixatives at Day 0. At Day 7, the samples in formol saline had a significantly higher percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> than those in glutaraldehyde 2. When the percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> for the unfixed samples at Day 0 was compared with the percentages of intact <b>acrosomes</b> for glutaraldehyde 1, glutaraldehyde 2, and formol saline at Day 7, only the percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> for formol saline was significantly higher than for the unfixed samples. Only one of the batches of semen in egg yolk-tris extender could be evaluated in formol saline because of a heavy precipitate that formed. There was a significant interaction between extender and storage. For the whole milk extender, the percentages of intact <b>acrosomes</b> at Day 7 were higher than for Day 0 for all the fixatives used. For the egg yolk-tris extender, the percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> decreased from Day 0 to Day 7. The correlations between the percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> for the unfixed samples and the post-incubation percentage of progressive motility and rate of motility were 0. 65 and 0. 46, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The Andean puma (Puma concolor) has {{not been}} widely studied, {{particularly}} in reference to its semen characteristics. The aim {{of the present study}} was to define the morphometry of puma sperm heads and classify their subpopulations by cluster analysis. Samples were recovered postmortem from two epididymides from one animal and prepared for morphological observation after staining with the Hemacolor kit. Morphometric data were obtained from 581 spermatozoa using a CASA-Morph system, rendering 13 morphometric parameters. The principal component (PC) analysis was performed followed by cluster analysis for the establishment of subpopulations. Two PC components were obtained, the first related to size and the second to shape. Three subpopulations were observed, corresponding to elongated and intermediate-size sperm heads and <b>acrosomes,</b> to large heads with large <b>acrosomes,</b> and to small heads with short <b>acrosomes.</b> In conclusion, puma spermatozoa showed no uniform sperm morphology but three clear subpopulations. These results should be used for future work in the establishment of an adequate germplasm bank of this species...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{existence}} of a trypsin-like enzyme (TLE) in <b>acrosomes</b> ofepididymal spermatozoa was confirmed and was further demonstrated {{to be present in}} <b>acrosomes</b> of ejaculated and capacitated spermatozoa. TLE rapidly removes the zona pellucida of the ovum. Extracts of <b>acrosomes</b> of ejaculated spermatozoa contain an inhibitor that is separated from the TLE by purification of the TLE. The inhibitor of TLE is also present in seminal plasma. This enzyme=m- enzyme inhibitor relationship appears analogous to the corona-removing enzyme-decapacitation factor relationship and part of capacitation very likely involves removal of the inhibitor from TLE and decapacitation factor from the corona-removing enzyme. TLE is inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor and less effectively by mercaptoethanol. Yamane (1935 a, b) showed that canine sperm extracts obtained by toluene treatment had the ability to remove the external layers of ova and contained a trypsin-like enzyme (TLE). Buruiana (1956) also reported the presence of trypsin activity in spermatozoa of several species...|$|R
50|$|Galea species {{usually have}} smaller body size but the {{relative}} sizes of their testes and epididymitis are twice those of Cavia species. In {{the majority of}} cases, the <b>acrosomes</b> of Galea sperm are smooth in outline, and only occasionally are degenerate forms present or are the <b>acrosomes</b> absent. In Galea, the spermatozoa of the epididymis are always single-cell whereas those of Cavia are agglutinated {{in the form of}} rouleaux. Galea spermatozoa swim more slowly than those of Cavia. While some Galea species are promiscuous - for example G. musteloides - Cavia exhibits polygynous behavior, which means that males are selected for aggression so that multiple matings will be prohibited.|$|R
50|$|There are {{considerable}} species {{variations in}} the morphology and consequences of the <b>acrosome</b> reaction. In several species the trigger for the <b>acrosome</b> reaction has been identified in a layer that surrounds the egg.|$|E
50|$|As {{the sperm}} {{approaches}} the zona pellucida of the egg, which {{is necessary for}} initiating the <b>acrosome</b> reaction, the membrane surrounding the <b>acrosome</b> fuses with the plasma membrane of the sperm's head, exposing {{the contents of the}} <b>acrosome.</b> The contents include surface antigens necessary for binding to the egg's cell membrane, and numerous enzymes which are responsible for breaking through the egg's tough coating and allowing fertilization to occur.|$|E
50|$|Acrosin is {{the major}} proteinase present in the <b>acrosome</b> of mature spermatozoa. It is stored in the <b>acrosome</b> in its {{precursor}} form, proacrosin. Upon stimulus, the <b>acrosome</b> releases its contents onto the zona pellucida. After this reaction occurs, the zymogen form of the protease is then processed into its active form, β-acrosin. The active enzyme then functions in the lysis of the zona pellucida, thus facilitating penetration of the sperm through the innermost glycoprotein layers of the ovum.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of glycoconjugates in the testis of lizard Podarcis s. campestris De Betta was investigated by HRP-conjugated lectins during the annual spermatogenetic cycle. In addition, pretreatments of sections with neuraminidase and removal of alkali-labile O-linked sequences by beta-elimination allowed {{the structure of}} glycoconjugates to be further explored. Leydig cells displayed changes of lectin-binding sites during annual cycle, and during the abortive spermatogenesis period lacked N-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans. Sertoli cells stained by Con A, WGA, RCA 120, BS I-B 4, showed, except in July, O-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans. Spermatogonia bound Con A and WGA. Spermatocytes bound also BS I-B 4, SBA, UEA I, and during spring spermatogenesis, revealed O-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans. The <b>acrosomes</b> of spermatids were also stained by RCA 120 and PNA, whereas the heads of spermatozoa did not bind SBA and PNA. During the abortive spermatogenic period, the <b>acrosomes</b> showed O-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans and N-linked glycans terminating in beta-galactosyl residues. During the reproductive period, the <b>acrosomes</b> of spermatozoa expressed O- and N-linked sialylgalactosyl glycans and beta-galactosyl terminal residues on O- and N-linked glycans. This, in the testis of lizard, the two spermatogenesis periods show the emergence {{of different types of}} glycosylation...|$|R

40|$|Four bulls that {{produced}} spermatozoa {{with a high}} percentage of abnormal <b>acrosomes</b> were individually placed in pens with females for 21 days. Frozen semen from 2 of the bulls was used for artificial insemination. One of the bulls was placed in a competitive mating situation with normal bulls at pasture. First service pregnancy rates were determined by transrectal ultrasonography 28 days after bull removal from breeding pens, or after the last artificial insemination. The results of competitive mating at pasture were determined from breeding observations, the phenotypic characteristics of calves sired, and blood typing for parentage. The results of these studies suggest that bulls that produce {{a high percentage of}} spermatozoa with indented <b>acrosomes</b> may have normal fertility when used in artificial insemination or in single sire mating; however, their fertility may be low when breeding competitively with bulls with normal spermiograms...|$|R
50|$|Acrosin is a {{digestive}} enzyme {{that acts as}} a protease. In humans, acrosin is encoded by the ACR gene. Acrosin is released from the <b>acrosome</b> of spermatozoa {{as a consequence of the}} <b>acrosome</b> reaction. It aids in the penetration of the Zona Pellucida.|$|E
5000|$|This {{shedding}} of the <b>acrosome,</b> or <b>acrosome</b> reaction, can be stimulated {{in vitro}} by substances a sperm cell may encounter naturally such as progesterone or follicular fluid, {{as well as}} the more commonly used calcium ionophore A23187. This can be done to serve as a positive control when assessing the <b>acrosome</b> reaction of a sperm sample by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy.

40|$|Effect {{of storage}} of {{domestic}} ca ity dio useo N ge, Lo sed fo Available online at www. sciencedirect. com Postmortem sperm {{recovery from the}} epididymides may constitute {{a powerful tool for}} the conservation of valuable genetic material. The domestic cat (Felis catus) is a good model for wild felids and, using this model, we have explored the effect of epididymides storage time on sperm motility and percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> upon sperm recovery and after cryopreservation. We also examined the effect of time of sperm equilibration with glycerol before freezing on sperm motility and the percentage of intact <b>acrosomes.</b> Motility varied between sperm recovered from epididymides that were stored for different times. Significant differences were seen in the sperm motility index (SMI) before freezing (55. 91 2. 02, 48. 21 1. 47, and 43. 03 1. 32) and after thawing (51. 81 3. 02, 41. 90 2. 14, and 42. 35 1. 95) of sperm recovered from epididymides stored for 0, 48, or 72 h, respectively. The percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> did not vary significantly with storage time (average 60. 33 1. 38 % before and 52. 50 1. 91 % after freezing, respectively). The percentage of normal sperm after different storage times did not differ (average 19. 22 1. 25 % normal sperm after recovery). When epididymides were stored for 72 h, time of sperm equilibration with glycerol (30 vs. 120 min) resulted in significant differences in both motility (SMI = 39. 17 2. 76 and 45. 00 2. 65, respectively) and the percentage of intact <b>acrosomes</b> (45. 76 4. 91 % and 60. 67 3. 64 %, respectively) after thawing. In conclusion, best results are achieved when sperm are recovered from epididymides within 24 h of cool storage and when they are equilibrated with glycerol during 120 min before freezing. The current results should be useful in the further development of techniques for the rescue and cryostorage of epididymal spermatozoa of endangered felids...|$|R

40|$|This study reports {{observations}} on the collection and characteristics of semen from free-range populations of flying fox in Brisbane, Australia. Semen was successfully recovered by electroejaculation from 107 of 115 wild flying foxes (Pteropus alecto, Pteropus poliocephalus and Pteropus scapulatus). A proportion of ejaculates collected from all three species contained seminal vesicle secretions, the incidence of which appeared related to breeding season. Ejaculate volume was small (5 - 160 mu L), requiring a specialised collection vessel and immediate extension to avoid desiccation. Sperm morphological abnormalities and characteristics are described for the first time. In two species (P. scapulatus and P. alecto), sperm quality varied with breeding season. Dilution in Tris-citratefructose buffer and subsequent incubation (37 degrees C) of Pteropus semen for 2 - 3 h appeared to {{have a negative impact}} on sperm motility and the percentage of sperm with intact plasma membranes and <b>acrosomes</b> and represents a concern for the potential development and use of assisted breeding technology in these species. Preliminary attempts to develop a short-term chilled preservation protocol for flying fox semen revealed that spenn viability (percentage motility and percentage live sperm with intact <b>acrosomes)</b> was significantly reduced after 102 h chilled storage at 5 degrees C; nevertheless, approximately 40 % of the spermatozoa were still motile and contained intact <b>acrosomes.</b> Glycerol was neither protective nor detrimental to sperm survival during chilled storage. Microbial flora of the prepuce, urethra and semen of all species were isolated and their antibiotic susceptibility tested. Tetracycline, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime were the most effective antibiotics in preventing growth of all identified bacteria; however, their effects on sperm survival were not investigated.
