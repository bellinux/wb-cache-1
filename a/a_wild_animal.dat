5|$|In Winter of the Fisher, Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a fisher and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest. The recluse frees the fisher from a trap and nurses it back to health. The fisher tolerates the attention, but being <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal,</b> returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses the ecology and known habits of the fisher to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern woods of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal),</b> carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E

5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrive at}} a cave. Tintin ventures inside and finds Chang, who is feverish and shaking. The Yeti {{suddenly}} appears, revealed as a large anthropoid, reacting with anger at Tintin's attempt to take Chang. As it lunges at Tintin, the flash bulb of Tintin's camera goes off, and scares the Yeti away. Chang tells Tintin that the Yeti saved his life after the crash. Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang. As the party travels home, Chang muses that the Yeti is not <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal,</b> but has a human soul. The Yeti sadly watches their departure from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} of the myth provide Set's motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the Pyramid Texts, Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave him, whereas in a Late Period text, Set's grievance is that Osiris had sex with Nephthys, who is Set's consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut. The murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The Egyptians believed that written words {{had the power to}} affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris's death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered. In some cases the texts suggest that Set takes the form of <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal,</b> such as a crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris's corpse is thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred. Even the identity of the victim is changeable in texts, as it is sometimes the god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris's son by Isis.|$|E

A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the Bourbon Restoration, making knowledge of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room which was barricaded like the cage of <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal.</b> The story runs that food was passed through the bars to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.|$|E
25|$|Nier: Automata is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} players take the role of combat androids from the YoRHa units across an open world environment. In addition to standard navigation on foot, using a special item allows the player to summon <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> to ride, and in some scenarios pilot a flying mech to fight enemies. As with the previous game, during navigation in some environments, the camera shifts from its standard third-person view to an overhead or side-scrolling perspective. Some areas also include platforming elements, requiring the player to navigate via jumping between platforms or over obstacles. The player can complete side quests for non-playable characters found throughout the world. Shops available in hub locations allow the player to purchase items, including consumables which recover health.|$|E
25|$|Turtle racing has {{garnered}} controversy {{at times}} {{due to the}} treatment of turtles and the gambling that occurs at many races. The annual turtle races at the Gala Days in the Canadian village of Ailsa Craig have drawn particular scrutiny. After news of the annual turtle race was popularized in 2010, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources told the organizers to cancel the event. Ministry officials intervened due to wild turtles being caught in a nearby river in order {{to be used in the}} race, threatening to fine anyone who entered <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> in the race. A ministry spokesperson cited the danger of spreading disease and disrupting the ecosystem by catching wild turtles and then putting them back. The spokesperson also cited the stress that the race caused the turtles. The event later proceeded as planned after turtles were rented from a nearby pet store for use in the race. Many residents had been catching turtles for weeks in order to enter them in the race, and area residents had to release over one hundred turtles.|$|E

25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as {{you get to the}} second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of the}} nature connectedness construct.|$|E
500|$|Seton's {{intention}} {{in writing}} his stories was to [...] "freely translate" [...] the animals' language into English, as they [...] "have no speech {{as we understand}} it".

500|$|The {{generic name}} Addax {{is thought to}} be {{obtained}} from an Arabic word meaning <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> with crooked horns. It is also thought to have originated from a Latin word. The name was first used in 1693. The specific name nasomaculatus comes from the Latin words nasus (or the prefix naso-) meaning nose, and maculatus meaning spotted, referring to the spots and facial markings of the antelope. Bedouins use another name for the addax, the Arabic bakr (or bagr) al wahsh, which literally means the cow of the wild. The name can be used to refer to other ungulates, as well. The other common names of addax are [...] "white antelope" [...] and [...] "screwhorn antelope".|$|E

This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where {{he would not be}} disturbed by visitors. In response to a proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people walking on the street, {{they should be able to}} find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.|$|E
500|$|Some of Heinlein's {{other works}} {{have also been}} {{described}} as racist, though Franklin argues {{that this was not}} unique to Heinlein, and that he was less racist than the U.S. government of the time. Heinlein's early novel Sixth Column was called a [...] "racist paean" [...] to a white resistance movement against an Asian horde derived from the Yellow Peril. In 1978, Moorcock wrote that Starship Troopers [...] "set the pattern for Heinlein's more ambitious paternalistic, xenophobic" [...] stories. Robert Lowndes argues that the war between the Terrans and the Arachnids is not about a quest for racial purity, but rather an extension of Heinlein's belief that man is <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal.</b> According to this theory, if man lacks a moral compass beyond the will to survive, and he was confronted by another species with a similar lack of morality, then the only possible moral result would be warfare.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Mountain States Legal Foundation (foundation) and the Rock Springs Grazing Association (association) won a writ of {{mandamus}} by the District Court requiring the BLM {{to remove all}} horses from the private lands of the [...] "checkerboard" [...] of private and public lands grazed by the association, and {{to reduce the number}} of horses on the public lands. [...] The District Court, however issued a summary judgement for the government against the contention that feral horses who ate grass or drank water on privately owned lands had [...] "taken" [...] these resources from the ranchers in violation of the [...] "takings clause" [...] of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the government must compensate the private landowners $500,000. [...] The foundation appealed the summary judgement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Hodel, 799 F.2d 1423 (1986), cert. den'd. 480 U.S. 951 (1987), the appeals court remanded the summary judgement back to the district court, which ultimately ruled that <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> was not an [...] "agent" [...] of the federal government and hence could not be found guilty of [...] "taking" [...] the ranchers' grass or water. [...] However, in 2000, the [...] "takings" [...] argument was brought up again, this time in Bradshaw v. United States U.S. Court of Federal Claims 47 Fed.Cl. 549 (Sept. 15, 2000) wherein the plaintiffs held that free-roaming horses were taking forage that they paid for with their grazing permit, and the horses were drinking water from springs for which they owned the water rights. [...] The court dismissed the argument, referring back to the earlier court findings.|$|E

This results from the fact that, in legal terms, bees become <b>wild</b> <b>animals</b> as soon as they leave their hive. <b>As</b> <b>wild</b> <b>animals</b> can't be owned by anyone, the said sections provide for the former owner to keep his claim over that swarm.
