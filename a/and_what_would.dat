5|$|Congress {{was not as}} {{enthusiastic}} about a customs union as Blaine and Harrison were, but tariff reciprocity provisions were ultimately included in the McKinley Tariff that reduced duties on some inter-American trade. Otherwise, the conference achieved none of Blaine’s goals in the short-term, but did lead to further communication <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> eventually become the Organization of American States.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this money to buy {{productive}} property, in a year he would gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or so, he would have regained the 100,000 strings <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be divided among the family would be interest. If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He would still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E

5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be left on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{world was}} {{populated}} {{by a great}} variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad interpretation of what was sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. The Maya interpretation of deities was intrinsically tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmovision. The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union was {{established}} in 1922. However, the country's first constitution was adopted in 1924. Before that time, the 1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was adopted as {{the constitution of the}} USSR. According to the 1918 Constitution, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (CEC), whose chairman was head of state, had the power to determine what matters of income and taxation would go to the state budget <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> go to the local Soviets. The CEC could also limit taxes. In periods between convocations of the Congress of Soviets the CEC held supreme power. In between sessions of the Congress of Soviets the CEC was responsible for all the affairs of the Congress of Soviets. The CEC and the Congress of Soviets was replaced by the Presidium and the Supreme Soviet by several amendments to the 1936 constitution in 1938.|$|E

5|$|When the German Army {{closed in}} on Paris during the Second World War, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria fled the city on bicycles. He {{eventually}} {{made his way to}} Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he applied his knowledge of nuclear physics to prospecting for oil and minerals. In 1943, he joined the British Tube Alloys team at the Montreal Laboratory in Canada. This became part of the Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic bombs. At Chalk River Laboratories, he worked on the design of the nuclear reactor ZEEP, the first reactor outside of the United States that went critical in 1945, followed by the NRX reactor in 1947. He also looked into cosmic rays, the decay of muons, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become his obsession, neutrinos. He moved to Britain in 1949, where he worked for the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.|$|E

However, they did not know the extent of the Sokoto Caliphate.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} he {{attended}} St. John's College, Scrope had his first real experiences with what would become his geologic specialty – volcanoes <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be called igneous petrology. During the winter break of 1817 through 1818, George went on a vacation {{with his mother and}} father in Italy. In Naples he explored Mount Vesuvius and other areas of volcanism in the region.|$|E
25|$|Other people {{finished}} {{exploring and}} mapping the Sierra. Bolton Coit Brown explored the Kings River watershed in 1895–1899. Joseph N. LeConte mapped {{the area around}} Yosemite National Park <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become Kings Canyon National Park. James S. Hutchinson, a noted mountaineer, climbed the Palisades (1904) and Mount Humphreys (1905). By 1912, the USGS published a set of maps of the Sierra Nevada, and the era of exploration was over.|$|E

25|$|The early halakha sought only {{to define}} the compass and scope of {{individual}} laws, asking under what circumstances of practical life a given rule was to be applied <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be its consequences. The earlier Midrash, therefore, aims at an exact definition of the laws contained in the Scriptures by an accurate interpretation {{of the text and}} a correct determination of the meaning of the various words. The form of exegesis adopted is frequently one of simple lexicography, and is remarkably brief.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} opened through open {{countryside}} on 1 October 1868 (goods) and 3 August 1875 (passengers) as the Midland and South Western Junction Railway, {{as part of}} the Midland Railway's extension to London. It connected the Midland Main Line, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become its large Cricklewood goods yard, to the North and South Western Junction Railway, now part of the North London Line, at Acton Wells (an area now called North Acton). It had stations at Dudding Hill and Harlesden (the latter also called Harrow Road and Stonebridge Park).|$|E
25|$|By 1906, Abdulaziz {{had driven}} the Al Rashid out of Najd and the Ottomans {{recognized}} him as their client in Najd. His next major acquisition was Al-Hasa, {{which he took}} from the Ottomans in 1913, bringing him control of the Persian Gulf coast <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become Saudi Arabia's vast oil reserves. He avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt, having acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty in 1914, and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid in northern Arabia. In 1920, the Ikhwan's attention turned to the south-west, when they seized Asir, the region between the Hejaz and Yemen. In the following year, Abdul-Aziz finally defeated the Al Rashid and annexed all northern Arabia.|$|E

25|$|Chromatography {{technique}} developed substantially as {{a result}} of the work of Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s and 1950s, for which they won the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography, and their work encouraged the rapid development of several chromatographic methods: paper chromatography, gas chromatography, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become known as high-performance liquid chromatography. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} debate {{regarding}} {{the future of}} Ground Zero following {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center. Disagreement and controversy regarding who owned the property <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be built there hindered construction at the site for several years. Many wanted the Twin Towers to be rebuilt, but stronger and taller. The project for new Twin Towers was called Twin Towers II which was led by the informal organization, Twin Towers Alliance. Others did not want anything built there at all or wanted the entire site to become a memorial. Finally, a master plan was agreed upon, which would feature a memorial and museum where the original Twin Towers stood and six new skyscrapers surrounding it.|$|E
25|$|In 1979/80, at the {{dramatic}} conclusion to the First Test against Clive Lloyd's West Indians at Carisbrook, Dunedin, Boock joined Gary Troup at the crease with New Zealand 100 for 9 and needing four more runs {{to win this}} historic match. The two tailenders took the Black Caps to their first test win over the West Indies, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> ultimately become their first series win over the Caribbean giants, when they scrambled through for a leg bye as scores were level. In a controversial tour, marred by umpiring disputes and some ugly onfield behaviour by the tourists, New Zealand won the series 1-0 after drawing the next two tests in Christchurch and Auckland.|$|E
