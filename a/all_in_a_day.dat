And even these {{perishable}} things must presently go.

60|$|Jean grew {{furious with}} {{himself for the}} {{spreading}} of a new sensation in his breast that seemed now to ache. Had he become infatuated, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> with this Ellen Jorth? Was he jealous {{of the men who}} had the privilege of her kisses? No! But his reply was hot with shame, with uncertainty. The thing that seemed wrong was outside of himself. A blunder was no crime. To be attracted by a pretty girl in the woods--to yield to an impulse was no disgrace, nor wrong. He had been foolish over a girl before, though not to such a rash extent. Ellen Jorth had stuck in his consciousness, and with her a sense of regret.|$|E

60|$|Belding {{enjoyed a}} laugh at his good wife's expense, for Thorne {{could not be}} kept in bed, and <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> it seemed, he grew so well and so hungry that his friends were delighted, and Mercedes was radiant. In a few days his {{weakness}} disappeared {{and he was going}} the round of the fields and looking over the ground marked out in Gale's plan of water development. Thorne was highly enthusiastic, and at once staked out his claim for one hundred and sixty acres of land adjoining that of Belding and the rangers. These five tracts took in all the ground necessary for their operations, but in case {{of the success of the}} irrigation project the idea was to increase their squatter holdings by purchase of more land down the valley. A hundred families had lately moved to Forlorn River; more were coming all the time; and Belding vowed he could see a vision of the whole Altar Valley green with farms.|$|E
60|$|Lambing-time came late in May, and Mescal, Wolf, Piute and Jack knew no rest. Night-time was {{safer for}} the sheep than the day, though the howling of a {{thousand}} coyotes made it hideous for the shepherds. <b>All</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> seemingly, the little fleecy lambs came, as if by magic, and filled the forest with piping bleats. Then they were tottering after their mothers, gamboling at a day's growth, wilful as youth--and the carnage began. Boldly the coyotes darted out of thicket and bush, and many lambs never returned to their mothers. Gaunt shadows hovered always near; the great timber-wolves waited in covert for prey. Piute slept not at all, and the dog's jaws were flecked with blood morning and night. Jack hung up fifty-four coyotes the second day; the third he let them lie, seventy in number. Many times the rifle-barrel burned his hands. His aim grew unerring, so that running brutes in range dropped in their tracks. Many a gray coyote fell with a lamb in his teeth.|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} have been better {{provided}} for. His books were at hand, and even notes of the lectures he was missing were brought to him. The college papers and magazines interested him, and finally he was much amused by an account of his mysterious disappearance. <b>All</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> he found himself famous. Then Dale and his room-mates were so friendly and jolly that if his captivity had not meant the disgrace of the freshman class, Ken would have rejoiced in it. He began to thaw out, though he did not lose his backwardness. The life of the great university began to be real to him. Almost the whole sophomore class, in squads of twos and threes and sixes, visited Dale's rooms during that week. No Soph wanted to miss a sight of a captive bowl-man. Ken felt so callow and fresh in their presence that he scarcely responded to their jokes. Worry Arthur's nickname of [...] "Kid" [...] vied with another the coach conferred on Ken, and that was [...] "Peg." [...] It was significant slang expressing the little baseball man's baseball notion of Ken's throwing power.|$|E

60|$|When Mr. Prywell {{had heard}} this story, he did quickly {{believe it was}} true: {{wherefore}} he went forthwith to my Lord Mayor's house, and acquainted him therewith; who, sending for the subordinate preacher, brake the business to him; and he as soon gave the alarm to the town; for he was now the chief preacher in Mansoul, because, as yet, my Lord Secretary was ill at ease. And {{this was the way}} that the subordinate preacher did take to alarm the town therewith. The same hour he caused the lecture bell to be rung; so the people came together: he gave them then a short exhortation to watchfulness, and made Mr. Prywell's news the argument thereof. 'For,' said he, 'an horrible plot is contrived against Mansoul, even to massacre us <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> nor is this story to be slighted; for Mr. Prywell is the author thereof. Mr. Prywell was always a lover of Mansoul, a sober and judicious man, a man that is no tattler, nor raiser of false reports, but one that loves to look into the very bottom of matters, and talks nothing of news, but by very solid arguments.|$|E

As hope quasheth and quieteth sinful passions, so it putteth into order some graces that {{cannot be}} put into order without it: as patience, meekness, silence, and long-suffering, and the like. These are <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> of trial out of place, order, and exercise, where hope forbeareth to work. I never saw a distrusting man, a patient man, a quiet man, a silent man, and a meek man, under the hand of God, except he was 'dead in sin' at the time. But we are not now talking of such. But now let a man hope in the Lord, and he {{presently}} concludes this affliction is for my good, a sign God loves me, and that which will work out for me a far more and exceeding and eternal weight of glory; and so it puts the graces of the soul into order (Luke 21:19). Wherefore patience, by which a man is bid to possess or keep his soul under the cross, is called 'the patience of hope' (1 Thess 1:3). So in another place, when {{he would have the}} church patient in tribulation, and continue instant in prayer, he bids them 'rejoice in hope,' knowing that the other could not be done without it (Rom 12:12).|$|E
