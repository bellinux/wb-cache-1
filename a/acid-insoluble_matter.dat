The purified samples exhibited higher mannose/galactose ratios and lower amounts of ash, protein and <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>matter</b> than the crude gum. The purified LBG from different regions had 3. 43 - 6. 99 % moisture, 0. 87 - 2. 06 % ash, 0. 61 - 2. 46 % protein, 0. 00 - 1. 20 % <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>matter</b> and 3. 55 - 4. 32 mannose/galactose ratios. Statistical analysis revealed that purification significantly affected (P < 0. 05) moisture, ash, protein, insoluble matter contents and mannose/galactose ratios of the crude LBG and purified LBG for all samples from different areas. The rheological properties of the different carob gum samples were determined, the best rheological properties are those of spontaneous carob trees of Bargou, Bouarada and Kessra areas. The climatic and geographic origin of carob and the cultivation mode influence the chemical and rheological properties. The purification of crude galactomannan samples by precipitation with isopropanol gave a clear and more stable solution, due to the elimination of impurities and endogenous enzymes.

Bacteriol. 85 : 1365 – 1370. 1963. —Washed suspensions of Bacillus megaterium oxidized to CO 2 about 39 % of the U-C 14 -glucose supplied {{and incorporated}} about 37 % {{of the label}} {{by the time a}} marked break in the rate of O 2 consumption was noted. Almost one-half of the label was lost from the cells on acidification of the suspension. The remainder of the C 14 was present in the supernatant fluid, primarily in forms as yet unidentified, but other than carbohydrate. Both the Embden-Meyerhof and hexose monophosphate pathways of oxidation were involved. Endogenous respiration appeared to be inhibited only to a slight extent in the presence of an exogenous substrate. C 14 appeared in all fractions of the cells; the highest percentage of firmly bound C 14 was present in hot 5 % trichloroacetic <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>matter.</b> A decrease in C 14 content of the various fractions was noted during endogenous respiration of cells labeled during growth. Pyruvate and acetate were oxidized very slowly by B. megaterium. The results indicate the complexity of oxidative assimilation and the dynamic state of cellular metabolism...|$|E

Correctcd radiocarbon dates on the <b>acid-insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> fraction, supplemented by AMS datcs on in situ bivalves, indicate that all cores cxtcnd into thc early Holocene, and three extend into the latest Plcistoccnc.

40|$|Composting {{has become}} a widely used method of {{recycling}} yardwastes such as leaves and grass. However, very little information {{is available on the}} chemical changes that occur during the composting of different mixtures of leaves and grass. In this study, three different mixes of leaves and grass were composted at approximately 60 % moisture in a temperature controlled laboratory scale system. The mixes, which consisted of all leaves (Mix 1); 2 / 3 leaves + 1 / 3 grass (Mix 2); and 1 / 3 leaves + 2 / 3 grass (Mix 3), had initial C. N ratios of 48, 30 and 22, respectively. The compost process was monitored by measuring the rate of CO 2 evolution, pH, stability, the degree of humification and changes in polysaccharide, carbon, nitrogen and organic matter content. Results showed that the greater the grass content of the mix, the higher the initial pH and the faster the rate of CO 2 evolution, organic matter loss and nitrogen loss. After 43 days of composting, Mixes 1, 2 and 3, lost, respectively 61 %, 74 % and 78 % of the cellulose, 57 %, 79 % and 82 % of the hemicellulose and 40 %, 49 % and 42 % of the <b>acid-insoluble</b> organic <b>matter.</b> Humification indices and stability tests indicated that composts produced from the three mixes were well humified and stable...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{data and}} in-situ {{measurements}} show that today considerable mass loss is occurring from the Amundsen Sea {{sector of the}} West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The observational record only spans the past four decades, and until recently the long-term context of the current deglaciation was poorly constrained. This information is, however, crucial for understanding WAIS dynamics, evaluating the role of forcing mechanisms for ice-sheet melting, and testing and calibrating ice-sheet models that attempt to predict future WAIS behavior {{and its impact on}} global sea level. Over the past decade several multinational marine expeditions and terrestrial fieldwork campaigns have targeted the Amundsen Sea shelf and its hinterland to reconstruct the WAIS configuration during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and its subsequent deglacial history. The resulting studies succeeded in shedding light on the maximum WAIS extent at the LGM and the style, pattern and speed of its retreat and thinning thereafter. Despite this progress, however, significant uncertainties and discrepancies between marine and terrestrial reconstructions remain, which may arise from difficulties in dating sediment cores from the Antarctic shelf, especially their deglacial sections. Resolving these issues is crucial for understanding the WAIS’ contribution to post-LGM sea-level rise, its sensitivity to different forcing mechanisms and its future evolution. Here we present chronological constraints on WAIS advance in the Amundsen Sea and its retreat from 20 ka BP into the Holocene that were obtained by various techniques, such as 14 C dating of large (10 mg) and small (<< 1 mg) sample aliquots of calcareous microfossils, 14 C dating of <b>acid-insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> combusted at low (300 °C) and high (800 °C) temperatures and dating of sediment cores by using geomagnetic paleointensity. We will compare the different age constraints and discuss their reliability, applicability and implications for WAIS history...|$|R

Humic acids extracted from a collection of mountain calcimorphic soils from Sierra María-Los Vélez Natural Park (Southeastern Spain) under different use and management practices were studied in detail by visible and infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies and analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS). The HAs display a more or less marked lignin pattern defined by characteristic methoxyphenol assemblages released after pyrolysis that are associated to a typical infrared pattern including absorption frequencies bands at 1510, 1460, 1420, 1270, 1230 and 1030 cm− 1. This variability in the HA spectroscopic and pyrolytic patterns was used as a source of molecular-level surrogates to establish the balance between complementary mechanisms of soil C sequestration i. e., a selective preservation of lignin associated to raw organic matter and other plant-inherited macromolecules, or alternative mechanisms involving microbial breakdown or plant precursors and its condensation with microbial metabolites. We found that HAs in which the lignin signature was comparatively less marked also show high optical density values suggesting unsubstituted, condensed aromatic units and a chaotic organic structure, pointing to the presence of highly resilient carbon forms. Upon analytical pyrolysis, one group of HAs produced major yields of methoxyl-lacking aromatics (alkylbenzenes and alkylphenols), and poor yields of alkyl compounds, which suggest efficient cleavage of biomacromolecules and the occurrence of active microbial synthesis and condensation processes. In fact, these HAs also displayed broadband IR spectra, and visible spectra showing high optical density and polynuclear quinoid chromophors considered of fungal origin. Other group of HAs yielded upon pyrolysis conspicuous series of methoxyphenols and well-defined alkyl series (alkanes, alkenes and fatty acids). The IR spectra also displayed clear lignin and amide bands, as well as intense 2920 cm− 1 band and a low optical density, indicative of a marked aliphatic character. This latter is interpreted as the result of recent diagenetic alteration processes of young organic matter and suggests that C sequestration mechanisms in these soils are mainly based on the stabilization of HAs from plant biomacromolecules and aliphatic structures. These differential lignin alteration patterns indicate that HAs are responsive to soil C sequestration mechanisms, which in the studied soils seem to relay upon microtopographical features rather than to changes in soil use and management. the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation by CTM 2005 - 04739 /CGL 2008 - 04926 /CARBORAR CGL 2011 - 27493 /GEOFIRE CGL 2012 - 38655 -C 04 - 01 research projects.
