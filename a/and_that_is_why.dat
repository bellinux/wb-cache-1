5|$|It will {{be quite}} an {{undertaking}} to carry on all the work in America. Essentially, I am a great man, a rarity, as it were. I can't quite believe it myself, however, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> I struggle against {{playing the role of}} a great man.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} seen Swift as hopeless {{in regards to}} actual change for Ireland. The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord mentality that has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> Swift spends {{the majority of his}} sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
2500|$|Zimmermann told Schoen <b>that</b> a {{powerful}} <b>and</b> successful move against Serbia would save Austria-Hungary from internal disintegration, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> Germany had given Austria [...] "a blank power of full authority, {{even at the}} risk of a war with Russia".|$|R
2500|$|Historian Tony Joseph wrote: [...] "It was {{the largest}} single exodus of {{performers}} in D'Oyly Carte history, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the sense of sadness that hovered over the season was so marked.... August 1951 {{was the end of}} an era." ...|$|R
50|$|Aspects of {{the film}} were criticised in New South Wales Parliament. There <b>were</b> {{allegations}} <b>that</b> the Deputy Premier of New South Wales had shares in Expeditionary Films Ltd, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the government <b>were</b> supporting an introduction of a quota.|$|R
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|According to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist {{understanding}} of nirvana are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> it {{is described as}} brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).|$|E
2500|$|God {{set apart}} the Levites {{to carry the}} Ark of the Covenant, to stand in {{attendance}} upon the Tabernacle, and to bless in God's Name, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the Levites <b>were</b> to receive no portion of the land, as God was their portion.

50|$|As {{noted in}} a Gloucester Daily Times Article, Aarons wanted his sculptures to honor the struggles and nobility of people and rail against the evil done against them. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why,</b> even as his work grew more and more abstract, stylized and simplified, he never left behind {{the form of the}} human figure <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> his focus from his {{earliest}} works.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} day, November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party {{executive council}} voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. “The {{general sense of}} the council <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he wasn’t a serious candidate <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he wasn’t selected {{to be on the}} ballot," [...] stated John Werner, the party's director. [...] Colbert has announced that he will not continue his campaign.|$|R
25|$|Despite Sweden's grievances over {{failing to}} gain control of the islands in 1921, all {{difficulties}} between Sweden and Finland were resolved by the mid-1930s. The fear of the Åland islands falling under the influence of Germany or Soviet Union was very real, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> Sandler proposed defending the status of the islands.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people think}} that—excuse my {{expression}} here—that {{in order to}} be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood. This is clear <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> in the Church there are marriage groups, there are experts in this matter, there are pastors, one can search; and I know so many ways that are licit and that have helped this.|$|E
25|$|The Terrorists of Iraq {{discusses}} the Obama Administration Iranian nuclear development limitations agreement, and {{calls it a}} worthwhile endeavor. Nance argues that the deal {{is in the best}} interests of Iran, for its people desire Western culture and capitalist products including fashion, automobiles and U.S. manufacturing products. He points out the nuclear deal would yield such benefits for Iran <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> it is in the interests of its citizens to succeed.|$|E
50|$|He was {{initially}} {{cast as a}} player for Saturday Night Live for the 1986 season. However, right before the season started, casting changes were made and he was left off the show. It <b>was</b> said <b>that</b> many of the producers felt he was too similar in humor style to Dana Carvey, who was also joining the show in 1986, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the change <b>was</b> made.|$|R
50|$|He {{appealed to}} the general public in Kerala by expressing his {{grievance}} in a pamphlet distributed to the public. The Home Minister who was a candidate in the recent elections addressed several public meetings in Mala, Kalpetta and other constituencies of the State and in some of the meetings he made mention of the fact <b>that</b> Rajan <b>was</b> involved as an accused in a murder case <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he <b>was</b> kept in detention. Rajan was never produced before a Magistrate.|$|R
40|$|I {{could imagine}} him coming in quietly, {{scarcely}} taking {{the effort to}} close the door securely. Yet, he might come in hurredly, slam the door, run through the house, throw his coat and books on the dining room table, and be up in our room almost before the echo of the noise had died away. He <b>was</b> moody <b>and</b> changeable; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> I <b>was</b> leaving; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> what I disliked about him; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> I did not know how he would enter the house. In fact, I never knew {{how he was going to}} act under any condition. During his exhilarated moods, he was almost too kind and generous to everyone: his friends, acquaintances, and animals alike. But some of his moods were unbearable. He seemed always above or below everything on earth. I don 2 ̆ 7 t believe he ever felt in conjunction with a living person or thing...|$|R
25|$|Three months later, Elliot and Alma have {{adjusted}} {{to their new}} life with Jess as their adopted daughter. On television, an expert, comparing the event to a red tide, warns that the epidemic may have only been a warning. He states that humans have become {{a threat to the}} planet <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> the plants have responded aggressively. Alma discovers she is pregnant and embraces Elliot with the news.|$|E
25|$|Bondage and {{discipline}} are {{two aspects of}} BDSM that {{do not seem to}} relate to each other because of the type of activities involved, but they have conceptual similarities, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> they appear jointly. Contrary to the other two types, B does not define the tops and bottoms itself, and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in September 2003, an SVR RF agent in London was making preparations to assassinate Boris Berezovsky with a binary weapon, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> Berezovsky had been speedily granted asylum in Britain. GRU officers who killed Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar in 2004 reportedly claimed that supporting SVR agents let them down by not evacuating them in time, so they have been arrested by Qatar authorities.|$|E
40|$|It <b>was</b> {{assessed}} <b>that</b> {{the number}} of HIV infected children due to vertical transmission increases every day <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> the early diagnosis in the HIV+ pregnat women and the administration of antivirals in the prenatal stage to reduce the transmission is so important. Taking these factors into account, from 1997 on, it was decided in Cuba to administer AZT to all HIV+ pregnant women and to the newborn infant, as it is established in the protocol 076, which considerably reduced {{the number of}} infected children...|$|R
2500|$|On 26 January 2009, Russian junior {{sergeant}} Alexander Glukhov {{appeared in}} Tbilisi. He gave press interviews at McDonald's {{in the presence}} of Georgian Interior Ministry officials. The 21-year-old claimed that bad living conditions and problems with his superior forced him to desert: [...] "I had very bad relations with my commander. He didn't like anything I did <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> I left." [...] According to Georgian interior ministry sources, he appealed for permission to remain in Georgia. On 28 January the soldier announced on Georgian TV that he asked for political asylum in Georgia.|$|R
50|$|Blue: Kai Samezu (Samezu Kai), the Surging Shark (Dotō no Same), was a freeter {{before he}} was chosen by Gao Shark to become Gao Blue. He is the most {{immature}} of the team. His other Power Animal is Gao Giraffe which was actually a tractor before. Gao Giraffe appeared in Gao Blue's dream and the dream actually comes true <b>that</b> Gao King <b>was</b> about to lose the evil tribe <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> they need Gao Giraffe to help them win the evil tribe. Gao Giraffe will take Gao Shark and Gao Bear's place when it was chosen to fight.|$|R
25|$|The basic case made by Ern's {{defenders}} {{was that}} his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can't be argued {{on behalf of all}} the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> he continues to haunt our culture.|$|E
25|$|It (Independence) {{belongs to}} all of us <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> we {{celebrate}} it. Do you think, however, that our nation from the outset needs only men to serve it? Women should also take their part as women did {{in the early years of}} our nation and Islam. From their examples we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Reeves was kidnapped, Don {{pushed his}} ethics {{to the limit}} to get her back. While he did not {{personally}} beat a suspect, he had Special Agent Ian Edgerton interrogate the teenager for information on where Megan was being held. It is never shown or said what Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being willing to go that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that it is good to have someone to come home to, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> he comes around the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E
50|$|Bhagaiya is {{a village}} {{panchayat}} in Godda district, Jharkhand state, India. Ranchi {{is the state}} capital for Bhagaiya village. Bhagaiya is known for traditional handloom silk manufacturing <b>and</b> weaving: <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> it <b>is</b> known as Resham Nagar.|$|R
30|$|Cyber {{incidents}} have evolved, for citizens, {{public and}} private institutions and to the States; {{from the perspective of}} data protection, to an approach of risks <b>and</b> threats. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> cyber securitization should be permanent, because the threats are permanent.|$|R
50|$|Emma {{comes to}} live with her aunt Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn) after attacking her stepfather, Barry. She {{immediately}} clashes with Ailsa's husband Alf (Ray Meagher). Emma attempts to buy alcohol from the local store but Alf's sister Celia (Fiona Spence) refuses her the sale as she is underage, which causes Emma to insult Celia. Emma tells Ailsa she thought would be more fun because she had <b>been</b> in jail <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> she'd asked to stay with her. Ailsa refussd to admit what she had been jailed for but reminds Emma <b>that</b> the experience <b>was</b> unpleasant. They both agree to stay out of each other's way.|$|R
25|$|Outdoors, {{house centipedes}} prefer {{to live in}} cool, damp places. Centipede {{respiratory}} systems do not provide any mechanism for shutting the spiracles, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> they need an environment that protects them from dehydration and excessive cold. Most live outside, primarily under large rocks, piles of wood, and especially in compost piles. Within the home, these centipedes are found in almost {{any part of the}} house. Most commonly they are encountered in basements, bathrooms, and lavatories, which tend to be humid, but they can also be found in drier places like offices, bedrooms and dining rooms. The greatest likelihood of encountering them is in spring, when they come out because the weather gets warmer, and in autumn/fall, when the cooling weather forces them to find shelter in human habitats.|$|E
25|$|Abraham settled between Kadesh and Shur in {{the land}} of the Philistines. While he was living in Gerar, Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon {{discovering}} this news, King Abimelech had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man's wife. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.|$|E
25|$|The next week, Stacey and T.J. take an {{examination}} and T.J. creates cheat sheets that he gives to Stacey {{when he sees}} Mrs. Logan approaching. She finds the notes, accuses Stacey of cheating on the test and whips {{him in front of}} the class before failing him. After school, T.J. runs to the Wallace store, which the Logans forbid their children from visiting due to the Wallaces causing much of the black people's troubles. Stacey follows T.J. and the others follow Stacey. Mr. Morrison finds them fighting and separates them, much to the Wallace's anger. Instead of telling their mother, Morrison leaves Stacey to do it himself. Stacey tells her and she takes the children to visit the Berrys. Mr. Berry is badly burned, gruesomely disfigured and mute. Mama explains that the Wallaces are responsible for this <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> they are never to go near Wallace's store again.|$|E
50|$|A {{coincidental}} {{drought in}} the region a year later helped the legend along; the church convinced the peasants that the drought represented God's punishment for the killing of Jan Nepomucký. Building on that success, they attempted to paint the king as even blacker, with certain clerical circles spreading reports of John's courage, saying that as confessor to the Queen he had refused to reveal her secrets, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he had <b>been</b> murdered. Belief in John's supernatural powers culminated {{with the discovery of}} the saint's supposed tongue when three centuries later his tomb was opened and a piece of reddened tissue fell out of his skull.|$|R
50|$|During {{medieval times}} {{literacy}} was not common, <b>and</b> due to <b>that</b> many scholars would spell {{the last name}} Tilghman how they thought it may <b>be</b> <b>and</b> therefor <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> you have the many variations of the spelling such as; Tilghman, Tylghman, Tilmon, Tillmon, Tilman, Tillman, etc.|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Catheter-related {{bloodstream}} infection (CRBSI) {{is one of}} the most frequent nosocomial infections in critically ill patients, resulting in a significant increase of morbidity <b>and</b> mortality. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> it <b>is</b> essential to detect CRBSI precociously so that optimal treatment can be initiated as soon as possible.|$|R
