2500|$|An {{emission}} intensity (or [...] "carbon intensity" [...] - C.I.) is {{the emission}} rate {{of a given}} pollutant relative to the intensity of a specific activity, or an industrial production process; for example grams of carbon dioxide released per megajoule of energy produced, or the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions produced to gross domestic product (GDP). Emission intensities are used to derive estimates of air pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions based {{on the amount of}} fuel combusted, the number of animals in animal husbandry, on industrial production levels, distances traveled or similar <b>activity</b> <b>data.</b> Emission intensities may also be used to compare the environmental impact of different fuels or activities. In some case the related terms emission factor and carbon intensity are used interchangeably. The jargon used can be different, for different fields/industrial sectors; normally the term [...] "carbon" [...] excludes other pollutants, such as particulate emissions. One commonly used figure is carbon intensity per kilowatt-hour (also 'CIPK'), which is used to compare emissions from different sources of electrical power.|$|E
2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2013 that {{networks}} are challenging traditional hierarchies. Value chains {{may also be}} breaking up ("deconstructing") where information aspects can be separated from functional <b>activity.</b> <b>Data</b> that is readily available for free or very low cost {{makes it harder for}} information-based, vertically integrated businesses to remain intact. Evans said: [...] "The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate." [...] He used Wikipedia {{as an example of a}} network that has challenged the traditional encyclopedia business model. Evans predicts the emergence of a new form of industrial organization called a [...] "stack", analogous to a technology stack, in which competitors rely on a common platform of inputs (services or information), essentially layering the remaining competing parts of their value chains on top of this common platform.|$|E
2500|$|Multivariate pattern {{analysis}} using EEG {{has suggested that}} an evidence based perceptual decision model may be applicable to free will decisions. It was found that decisions could be predicted by neural activity immediately after stimulus perception. Furthermore, when the participant was unable to determine {{the nature of the}} stimulus the recent decision history predicted the neural activity (decision). The starting point of evidence accumulation was in effect shifted towards a previous choice (suggesting a priming bias). Another study has found that subliminally priming a participant for a particular decision outcome (showing a cue for 13ms) could be used to influence free decision outcomes. Likewise, it has been found that decision history alone can be used to predict future decisions. The prediction capacities of the Soon et al. (2008) experiment were successfully replicated using a linear SVM model based on participant decision history alone (without any brain <b>activity</b> <b>data).</b> Despite this, a recent study has sought to confirm the applicability of a perceptual decision model to free will decisions. When shown a masked and therefore invisible stimulus, participants were asked to either guess between a category or make a free decision for a particular category. Multivariate {{pattern analysis}} using fMRI could be trained on [...] "free decision" [...] data to successfully predict [...] "guess decisions", and trained on [...] "guess data" [...] in order to predict [...] "free decisions" [...] (in the precuneus and cuneus region).|$|E
