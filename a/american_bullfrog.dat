5|$|Originally, {{they were}} {{supplied}} from local wild populations, but overexploitation {{led to a}} diminution in the supply. This resulted {{in the development of}} frog farming and a global trade in frogs. The main importing countries are France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United States, while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China. The annual global trade in the <b>American</b> <b>bullfrog</b> (Rana catesbeiana), mostly farmed in China, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the <b>American</b> <b>bullfrog</b> (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the <b>American</b> <b>bullfrog</b> (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E

30|$|From 1940 – 1990, <b>American</b> <b>bullfrogs</b> were {{introduced}} {{as a food}} source worldwide and populations now exist throughout western North America, Oceania (Pacific Ocean islands), Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, and South America (Staples and Cowie 2001; Witmer and Lewis 2001; Lever 2003; Govindarajulu 2004; Boersma et al. 2006; Palen 2006). Since their introduction, many populations have expanded their range. <b>American</b> <b>bullfrogs</b> are responsible for negative ecological effects, including declines in native biota from intense predation and competition (Kats and Ferrer 2003; Snow and Witmer 2010). <b>American</b> <b>bullfrogs</b> {{have been difficult to}} control because of their high mobility, generalized eating habits, and high reproductive capacity (Moyle 1973; Adams and Pearl 2007). Both tadpoles and adult bullfrogs are voracious feeders and can consume benthic algae and the eggs and young of native invertebrates and vertebrates (Bury and Whelan 1984). Once established, invasive <b>American</b> <b>bullfrogs</b> directly compete with native birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes for resources (Bury and Whelan 1984; D’Amore 2012).

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2013 Lithobates catesbeianus (<b>American</b> <b>bullfrogs)</b> are not {{native to}} states {{west of the}} Rocky Mountains. Since their {{introduction}} to California, they have been implicated in the decline of amphibian species. On California???s north coast, bullfrogs may be causing local declines of native amphibians through predation, competition, or disease. Knowledge of the diet of introduced bullfrogs can help determine if bullfrogs are directly predating these amphibians and therefore directly causing decline. Moreover, Humboldt County???s coastal areas have a climate that is cooler on average than the <b>American</b> <b>bullfrogs???</b> native climate. Cool, yet stable year-round temperatures may affect larval phenology, knowledge of which is important for timing the larval culling used to manage the species. Bullfrogs and their larvae were captured from five coastal sites in Humboldt County, CA. Sites varied from 2 m to 1400 m in elevation, and from 0. 18 km to 27. 25 km in straight-line distance from the coast. Frogs were measured for snout-vent length, gender was determined and stomach contents were categorized. For larvae, total length and stage of development (Gosner stage) were recorded.
