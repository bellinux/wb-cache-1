5|$|According to Graham Spinardi in {{his book}} From Polaris to Trident (1994), STRAT-X was a {{response}} by the U.S. Department of Defense's Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd Wilson, to the U.S. Air Force; the service was demanding a large ICBM called the WS-120A. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile.

5|$|StarCraft: Ghost is an {{unreleased}} military {{science fiction}} stealth-action video game previously under development by Blizzard Entertainment. Part of Blizzard's StarCraft series, {{the game was}} announced on September 20, 2002, and was to be developed by Nihilistic Software for the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 video game consoles. Several delays in development caused Blizzard to move back the release date and the game has not yet materialized.

5|$|By late 1962 a {{decision}} {{on whether or not}} to deploy Zeus was looming. Bell began considering a replacement for the Zeus missile that would operate at much shorter ranges, and in October, sent out study contracts to three contractors to be returned in February. Even before these were returned, in January 1963 McNamara announced that the construction funds allocated for Zeus would not be released, and the funding would instead be used for development of a new system using the latest technologies. The name Nike-X was apparently an ad hoc suggestion by Jack Ruina, the director of ARPA, who was tasked with presenting the options to the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). With the ending of Zeus, the ZMAR radar effort was renamed MAR, <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> an even more powerful version, MAR-II, became {{the central part of the}} Nike-X concept.|$|E

5|$|Invasion of the Vorticons was {{the only}} game {{developed}} by Ideas from the Deep, and was based on programmer John Carmack's creation of adaptive tile refresh, a technique that allowed IBM-compatible general-purpose computers to replicate the smooth scrolling of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game's success caused designer Tom Hall, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, and artist Adrian Carmack to found id Software. Their obligations to Softdisk, where they had worked during development of the game, {{led to the creation}} of Keen Dreams as a prototype for the second trilogy of episodes. The final episode was split off during development into a stand-alone retail title, <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> a third trilogy were cancelled after the success of Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and development focus on 3D first-person shooters such as Doom (1993). The final Keen game ten years later had oversight but little development work from id.|$|E
5|$|More {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 2007. Replacing the bridge would cost $7â8 million and take two years to complete. Rehabilitation would require bringing the bridge up to code so it could carry loads of up to 40 tons (36 tonnes). A preservation group formed to oppose a replacement. Its founder compared the bridge to the Dingmans Ferry Bridge on the PennsylvaniaâNew Jersey border, which carries similar traffic loads. One possibility is to replace the bridge, and move the antique structure elsewhere in Sullivan County, since it is a popular tourist attraction. In June 2008, a compromise was made defining {{the possibility of a}} $12 million bridge to replace the 104-year-old deteriorating structure. PennDOT has suggested that they will let anyone preserve the bridge by taking it somewhere else. However, there has been no response, <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> the new bridge were initially scheduled to begin by 2010.|$|E
5|$|Moses {{announced}} {{during the}} opening of the Bethpage State Parkway in November 1936 that the land for extending the Meadowbrook from the Southern State Parkway to the Northern State Parkway had been acquired by Nassau County <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> the road were being designed by the State Division of Highways. Moses stated that the funds would be requested at the next session of the New York State Legislature, with a completion date of 1939 to coincide with {{the opening of the}} 1939 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens. This would make it plausible for motorists to go from Flushing to Jones Beach State Park directly. The new extension would also alleviate congestion along several northâsouth highways in Nassau County and provide quicker access to Jones Beach. However, construction on the $10million (1956USD) highway was delayed until December 1953.|$|E

Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> restoration were made.

5|$|Originally, {{the prince}} wanted a {{strictly}} Classical design, <b>and</b> <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> such a design were executed, in Chester by architect Thomas Harrison and modified, on site, by Odessa architect Francesco Boffo.

On the garden front, facing the sea, the plans show a large double height classical exedra; Vorontsov must have approved of this concept as it was the only feature (albeit transformed to an Islamic style), to be incorporated from Harrison's plans into the new plans.|$|E
