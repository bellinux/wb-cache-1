60|$|A {{similar case}} was {{recorded}} by Mr. F.A. Lucas in the American periodical Science of 8th April 1887. He states that in 1870 {{he met with}} numerous moths of many species while at sea in the South <b>Atlantic</b> (<b>Lat.</b> 25° S., Long. 24° W.), about 1000 miles from the coast of Brazil. As this position is just beyond the south-east trades, the insects may have been brought from the land by a westerly gale. In the Zoologist (1864, p. 8920) is the record of a small longicorn beetle which flew on board a ship 500 miles off {{the west coast of}} Africa. Numerous other cases are recorded of insects at less distances from land, and, taken in connection with those already given, they are sufficient to show that great numbers must be continually carried out to sea, and that occasionally they are able to reach enormous distances. But the reproductive powers of insects are so great that all we require, in order to stock a remote island, is that some few specimens shall reach it even once in a century, or once in a thousand years.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 92 sets (132, 268 hooks) {{targeting}} swordfish between years 2010 - 2014 in the South <b>Atlantic</b> (<b>Lat</b> ≥ 25 ºS) were analyzed. Various baits {{were used for}} night setting with monofilament longlines. No interaction with seabirds was detected and the interaction was therefore nil. The night setting, low levels of lighting during fishing operations {{and the type of}} fishing conducted were identified as the most important factors to explain the lack of interaction with seabirds. Observations of seabirds were also made during the study. Most sightings occurred during daytime sailing. During some operations when vessels were setting or hauling there were sporadic sightings of the spectacled petrel (Procellaria conspicillata) and the occasional albatross, although no interaction with fishing operations occurred. The species most often seen was the spectacled petrel (Procellaria conspicillata), with groups at over 150 individuals. Other species observed were Calonectris diomedea, various types of storm petrels, and other species such as Hydrobates leucorhous, Thalassarche chlororhynchos, Diomedea exulans and very rarely Thalassarche melanophrys...|$|E
40|$|The Chubut is {{a medium-size}} (45, 000 km 2) river basin that drains the arid-to-semiarid Patagonian scaboard and pours its waters into the southwestern <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean (ca. <b>lat</b> 43 ° 20 'S, lond 65 ° 04 'W). The {{materials}} croded from {{the continent and}} deposited in the sea arc scarcely affected by chemical weathering (the chemical index of alteration of rierbed sediments is - 55) and bear a typical chemical and mineralogical signature characteristic of volcanic arcs Cleary, Flowing toward a passive margin, tyhe river carries the mineralogical and chemical signature of an active margin. Physically weathered andesites and basalts occupy only about 25 % of the drainage area, and therefore most exported material must be supplied by outcropping sedimentary beds of variable age. The Chubut River headwaters are placed in a tectonically active region, soil formation is incipent ("weathering-limited regime"), {{and the rate of}} denudation (24, 6 t km 2 yr 1) is much lower than the rates exhibited by similar rivers {{in other parts of the}} world. The depleted dissolved and particulate load is determined by scare atmospheric precipitations (i. e., the drainage basin is in the Andean rain shadow) and by the protective effect of Cenozoic lava flows that often shield sedimentary formations from denudation. Although the index of chemical variability suggests that materials exported are products of the first denudational cycle, the geological history supports the view that most materials may have passed two or even three times though the exogenous cycle without acquiring a chemical or mineralogical signature indicative of repeated weathering. This is probably also true for other basins in temperate Andean climate...|$|R
60|$|General Remarks.--It {{will have}} been seen how much subject to {{variation}} the valves of this species are. When I first examined the Cineras chelonophilus of Leach, from 36° N. <b>lat.,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, and found in many specimens, both old and young, that the terga were very small, flat, acuminated at both ends, with a projecting shoulder on the carinal margin, and situated at about their own length from {{the apex of the}} carina, and at twice their own length from the scuta; and when I found the carina acuminated at both ends, and the scuta very imperfectly calcified, with the lateral lobe broad, flat, and standing out at right angles; and lastly, when I found the whole capitulum bluntly pointed, instead of being square on the summit, I had not the least doubt, that it was a quite distinct species. Afterwards, I found in the Cineras Olfersii of Leach, from the South Atlantic, the same form of terga; but within slightly more concave or furrowed, and not nearly so small, and therefore not placed at above half so great a distance from the other valves; and here, the carina had its usual outline, as had nearly the scutum on one side, whereas, on the other side, it presented a new and peculiar form, having five ridges or points, and was imperfectly calcified; seeing this, it was impossible to place much weight in the precise form or size (and therefore, relative separation,) of the calcified valves; and on close examination, I found every part of the mouth and cirri identical in Leach's Cineras chelonophilus and C. Olfersii, and in the common form. Therefore, I conclude, that C. chelonophilus, and still more C. Olfersii, are only varieties; the terga presenting the greatest, yet variable, amount of difference, namely, in their acumination and flatness. We know, also, that in the species of the closely allied genus of Lepas, the terga are very variable in shape, and this is the case, even in a still more marked degree, in Conchoderma aurita. Professor Macgillivray, I may add, has come to a similar conclusion regarding the extreme variability of the valves of this species.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{analyses}} of benthic foraminiferal assemblages {{were carried out}} on the late Pleistocene - Holocene succession of the core S 13 - 33 (PRIMAR project, Leg 13, eastern equatorial <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>Lat.</b> : 0 ° 51 'S, Long. : 12 ° 45 'W, water depth: 3500 m). The 503 cm thick succession is constituted by a “Globigerina ooze”, which changes in colour at 356 cm from the top from dark grey in the lower part to light grey in the upper part. Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages occurring from the base {{to the top of}} the succession correlate with those of the five Ericson & Wollin (1968) climatic zones, going from V zone-upper part (late Pleisto¬cene) to Z zone (Holocene) included. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages are mainly represented from the base to the top by Epistominella exigua, Eponides pusillus and Globocassidulina subglobosa, and subordinately by Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi, Cibicidoides spp., Gyroidina spp., Melonis barleeanum, Oridorsalis umbonatus and Uvigerina auberiana. The predominance of E. exigua, E. pusillus and G. subglobosa, opportunistic species adapted to seasonal pulses of food supply (phytodetritus) in a food-limited environment, indicates that the bottom water masses were characterized by a relatively low organic matter content mainly constituted by phytodetritus, which originates in the euphotic zone and settles rapidly to the seafloor following the spring bloom. The abundance curve of C. wuellerstorfi shows a slightly increasing trend from the base to the top suggesting a correspondent slight intensification of the bottom water circulation. This hypothesis is also supported by the patterns of Cibicidoides spp., oxic species, and of Gyroidina spp. and M. barleeanum, suboxic species. U. auberiana trend suggests a clearly subordinate influence of upwelling on the composition of benthic foraminiferal assemblages with respect to that of spring bloom. The curve of the total number of benthic specimens per gram (BN) shows average values mainly ranging from 371 to 1088, and it is characterized by some significant positive peaks occurring in the lower part of the succession, at about 200 cm and at 59. 5 cm. The benthic foraminiferal assemblages trends point out that during the late Pleistocene - Holocene in the investigated area the bottom paleoecological conditions were mostly influenced by the spring bloom and subordinately by upwelling phenomena, and were characterized by a generally low organic matter content mainly constituted by phytodetritus. Moreover the changes observed in the abundance curves of E. exigua, G. subglobosa and U. auberiana and in the BN pattern testify that such conditions slightly differentiate in the dark grey coloured lower part (core bottom to 356 cm), where a relative decrease of phytodetritus and a moderate increase of surface productivity occur, with respect to the light grey coloured middle and upper parts of the succession (356 cm to core top), where the surface productivity is even more subordinated. Nevertheless in this last interval two episodes of relative increase of surface productivity, due to discontinuous intensified upwelling phenomena, may be inferred by two concomitant peaks of U. auberiana and of BN...|$|E
