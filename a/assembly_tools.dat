40|$|Metrology and Tooling are {{considered}} as discrete disciplines within Manufacturing Engineering, however, <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> often {{acts as a}} checking mechanism. <b>Assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> has the primary function of controlling part location during assembly; with a secondary requirement as a quality gate. In-tool checks are manual mechanical checks of the assembly, these gauging checks assume the tooling has the correct, nominal geometry. Tooling conformance is certified periodically; however these intervals can be up to three years. Further examination of the metrology requirements within the aerospace industry with respect to large scale <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> identify a requirement to: reduce manual metrology checks, reduce tooling recertification time, and enable greater automation. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of integration between metrology and Wing-box <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling.</b> This research investigates how to increase manufacturing confidence with respect to tooling conformance; and, ultimately improve the manufacturing process for aero-structures, through the increased and enhanced use of metrology in the <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> environment. The Metrology Enhanced Tooling for Aerospace (META) framework has been created to provide a robust framework for deploying metrology in the tooling environment. The major elements of the framework are subsequently detailed and demonstrated in three chapters: i) large volume metrology networks, for the measurement of tooling structures; testing instrument performance, quantifying and improving the uncertainty estimation, and ultimately, establishing a rapid measurement process for assembly tooling; ii) embedded metrology systems demonstrates how local measurement systems can be utilised to replace and improve on, traditional in-tool checks; and iii) metrology feedback presents an example of an automated tooling pick-up that manipulates the assembly to achieve the design intent. The contributions can be summarised as: firstly, the creation of the META framework for the deployment of metrology in <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> environment, accommodating and facilitating a number of the future <b>tooling</b> and <b>assembly</b> requirements. Secondly, the establishment of a generic commissioning methodology and measurement strategy for the rapid measurement of <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> to increase tooling confidence. The research output was demonstrated in a case study, through a combination of physical measurement and digital automation simulation to prove the process time was greatly decreased from current methods...|$|R
40|$|Assembly {{automation}} is {{well established}} as hard automation in the manufacturing industry with proven economic advantages in mass production. Modern industries are adopting mass customization as a new strategy to handle the increasing diversity in customer demands. The main challenge is to produce an increasing variety of products with mass production efficiency. Conventional <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> is not flexible enough to handle the product variations. Also the existing flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> usually operates at lower throughput rates. Hence new type of <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> is needed to impart flexibility, while retaining the capability of high throughput rates. This research is aimed to redesign the existing part-feeders and feed tracks into modular, parametric tooling. An approach for developing the modular, parametric part-feeders is presented. Using this approach, some parametric nonvibratory feeders are designed and developed. Conceptual designs for modular, parametric gravity feed tracks are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Magnets for {{the beam}} {{transfer}} {{line between the}} Fermilab Booster and Main Injector and the Recycler antiproton storage ring are constructed using permanent magnet ferrite bricks surrounding a steel pole and housed inside a steel flux return shell. The transfer line consists of 51 dipoles, 67 gradient magnets, and 8 quadrupoles. The Recycler ring consists of approximately 350 gradient magnets and 60 quadrupoles. Positioning and handling large steel plates lined with magnetized ferrite bricks pose several challenges {{to the design of}} <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling.</b> Large attractive forces between mating magnet sub-assemblies must be controlled in order to minimize personnel hazards. Positioning of subassemblies must be precise to allow insertion of mechanical fasteners and to maintain consistent magnetic performance in all similar magnets and provisions must be made for magnet disassembly in the event that repairs or adjustments are indicated by magnetic measurements. This paper describes and illustrates the <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> designed and fabricated to facilitate construction of all of the nearly 500 dipole and gradient magnet assemblies in the 8 GeV beam transfer line and Recycler ring. ...|$|R

40|$|Achieving {{arcsecond}} {{angular resolution}} in a grazing-incidence foil-optic x-ray telescope (such as the segmented mirror approach {{being considered for}} the NASA Constellation-X mission) requires accurate placement of thousands of individual foils. We have developed a method for assembling large numbers of nested, segmented foil optics with sub-micron accuracy using lithographically defined and etched silicon alignment microstructures, called microcombs [1] (see Fig. 1). A system of <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> incorporating the silicon microstructures, called an assembly truss, is used to position the foils that are then bonded to an engineered flight structure. The advantage of this procedure is that the flight structure has relaxed tolerance requirements while the high accuracy <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling</b> can be reused. We have built and tested an experimental assembly truss to demonstrate this alignment and mounting technique [2]. This system has demonstrated ~ 0. 5 micron assembly accuracy, corresponding to ~ 1 arcsecond angular tolerance.

40|$|RNA-sequencing {{is a high}} {{throughput}} {{sequencing technology}} that sequences cDNA to obtain information from a particular sample of RNA. RNA-seq has already been proven {{to be an important}} factor to research numerous incurable diseases like cancers. Like other high throughput technologies, it also produces a huge number of accurate but relatively short reads. So it remains a concerning issue for De Novo <b>assembly</b> <b>tools</b> to assemble this massive amount of short reads. Existing De Novo <b>assembly</b> <b>tools</b> to assemble RNA-seq data are developed mainly based on three different algorithms; Greedy, OLC, and Euler-path. Recent research has revealed that Euler-path approach works best for RNA-seq data. A few De Novo <b>assembly</b> <b>tools</b> are available nowadays that were developed using Euler-path approach. Most of these tools based on Euler-path can be used free of cost for non commercial purposes. However, the performance of these non-commercial usable tools varies under different criteria. Again, their performance has not been measured in all possible conditions. So, it is always a matter of concern, which tool should be used for a particular data. Main objective of this thesis work is to consider four Euler-path De Novo <b>assembly</b> <b>tools</b> available for non commercial use and find out their performance for EST data of eukaryote. Criteria of their performance would be assembly accuracy and integrity.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{robotics}} and automatic <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling,</b> it is often necessary to provide some compliance when fitting two parts together or when engaging a tool with a complementarily shaped aperture. This need arises because of the tolerances in gripping and positioning capability of a robot arm and the dimensional tolerances of the members being positioned. The use of excessive force to engage two imperfectly aligned members can lead to damage to the members or <b>assembly</b> <b>tooling.</b> A remote centre compliance (RCC) is a device that can provide a compliance center projected outward from the device. Remote compliance centers decouple lateral and angular motion. A RCC device {{can be used in}} assembly to ease the insertion force. When a project compliance center is near the insertion point of a peg-in-hole type assembly, the peg translates into the hole when it strikes the outside lead-in chamfer without rotating. This translation without rotation prevents the jamming and galling seen from compliance devices that have a compliance center far away from the insertion point. The proposed work aims at designing and developing an intelligent RCC device which helps the parts assemble even if there are misalignments of known limits and is capable of capturing useful information for the assembly process...|$|R
