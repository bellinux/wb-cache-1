5|$|In July 1910 {{racial tension}} flared towards the African-American {{community}} after a tremendous upset victory by African-American boxer Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada. Mobs of whites roamed throughout Omaha rioting, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> {{cities across the}} U.S. The mobs wounded several black men in the city, killing one.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that {{determined by the}} optics in the collimator, mostly by {{the diameter of the}} collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E

5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves. They {{also use the}} cowpea paste as a {{supplement}} in infant formula when weaning babies off milk. Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|After {{experimenting with}} poison fails {{to kill the}} larvae in Charlie's body, Walter {{believes}} that mixing the chimera's blood with Charlie's will stop the larvae from attacking and bursting out of his body, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the other victims' corpses. Olivia learns one of the victims, Jonathan Swift, {{was the son of}} a scientist who tests on animals, and was killed while breaking into his father's lab. They also realize the chimera was created based on work by one of Walter's peers, not Walter himself.|$|E
5|$|All {{records of}} an early {{existence}} of Christians in South Canara were lost {{at the time of}} their deportation by Tipu Sultan in 1784. Hence, it is not known exactly when Christianity was introduced in South Canara, although it is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara, just <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Kerala, a state south of Canara. The Italian traveller Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast in the 13th century. It can be surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce; it is possible some Christian priests might have accompanied them for evangelistic work.|$|E

The channel began airing the second season on June 8, 2006, airing one episode per week rather than showing one every night <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the first season. Despite low ratings in the second season, Living decided to air the series' third season. It was syndicated through the Living TV Group platform, airing on the now defunct channel Trouble just before its closure. Free-to-air channel E4 began broadcasting the series from July 16, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders oldest rivalry is {{with the}} Blues. At the start of Super Rugby the teams {{originally}} represented 'old foes' Canterbury and Auckland. The two teams have meet twice in the Grand Final, with the Crusaders winning the first meeting in 1998, 20-13. This victory denied the Blues a three-peat. However, the Blues exacted revenge in 2003, winning the rematch 21-17. However, in recent times the rivalry has cooled, with the Blues no longer threatening title challenges, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> their glory days.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges {{became one}} of the many new client-tribes of Rome during the reign of Tiberius. Roman client states were treated {{according}} to the Roman tradition of patronship, exchanging rewards for service. However, during this time, the Iazyges still conducted raids across their border with Rome, such <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 6AD and again in 16AD. In 20AD the Iazyges moved west along the Carpathians into the Pannonian Steppe, and settled in the steppes between the Danube and the Tisza river, taking absolute control of it from the Dacians. In 50AD, an Iazyges cavalry detachment fought alongside the Suevian King Vannius, a Roman client king of the Quadi.|$|E

5|$|Industry {{appeared}} {{very early}} in Sélestat. The town had already several factories {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
5|$|Washington and {{the army}} were {{surrounded}} on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs. As the day went on, the British began to dig trenches, slowly coming closer to the American defenses. By doing this, the British {{would not have to}} cross over open ground to assault the American defenses <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Boston the year before. Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28. The men that came over were two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover's regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts. In command of the Pennsylvanian troops was Thomas Mifflin who, after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington. In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, it began to rain and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night.|$|E
5|$|Enchanted is {{the first}} feature-length Disney live-action/traditional {{animation}} hybrid since Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Roger Rabbit; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, {{who is in a}} cooking pot. The film uses two aspect ratios; it begins in 2.35:1 when the Walt Disney Pictures logo and Enchanted storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even {{for the remainder of the}} cartoon sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the pillarboxed 4:3 aspect ration; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time. Enchanted took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of settlement, {{planters}} brought enslaved African-Americans with them from Kentucky and Virginia.

East Tennessee had more subsistence farmers and few slaveholders.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until this}} time, {{matrices}} were seldom used by physicists; {{they were considered}} {{to belong to the}} realm of pure mathematics.

While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.|$|E
