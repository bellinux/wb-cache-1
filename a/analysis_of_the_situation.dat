5|$|The NAACP later {{blamed the}} PTC {{management}} for intentionally dragging its {{feet on the}} contract that the TWU approved in late June. The NAACP claimed that the PTC management had hoped to undermine the TWU's position with the workers and to possibly oust TWU {{in favor of the}} more pliable PRTEU. The PTC was aware that the SmithConnally Act forbade strikes harming war production and that if, with a contract impasse, TWU itself had initiated a contract strike, the union might have been tossed out. This <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was shared later by several historians, particularly by James Wolfinger. Another historian, Alan M. Winkler, also had a largely negative view of the company's role in the conflict and concluded that PTC management, while not overtly conspiring with the strikers, reacted feebly to the strike and tried to opportunistically exploit the situation and the racist attitudes of many white workers for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|The {{captaincy}} {{was given}} to Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain. Cricket author Chris Harte's <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> is that a prior (unspecified) commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Harte attributed an ulterior motive to his relocation: the off-field behaviour of Richardson and other South Australian players had displeased the South Australia Cricket Association (SACA), which was looking for new leadership. To help improve discipline, Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to its first Sheffield Shield title for 10years, Bradman weighing in with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria. He finished the season with 369 (in 233minutes), a South Australian record, made against Tasmania. The bowler who dismissed him, Reginald Townley, would later become leader of the Tasmanian Liberal Party.|$|E

25|$|Chris Harte has {{thoroughly}} {{researched the}} files of the SACA, and written histories of both the SACA and Australian cricket. His <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> is that an (unspecified) prior commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Moreover, Harte attributes an ulterior motive to the SACA's recruitment of Bradman. The issue of the off-field behaviour of Vic Richardson, and some other regular SA players, had festered {{over a number of}} years and the SACA was desperate for a solution. Therefore, they wanted Bradman to provide new leadership and improve discipline, as well as score runs. Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the SA and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to the Sheffield Shield for the first time in ten years and set a string of SA records along the way.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s the IRA {{once more}} {{came under the}} {{influence}} of left-wing thinkers, especially those such as C. Desmond Greaves and Roy Johnston active in the Connolly Association. This move to a class-based political outlook and the consequent rejection of any stance that could be seen as sectarian—including the use of IRA arms to defend one side, that side being the beleaguered Catholic communities of Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969—was {{to be one of the}} factors in the 1969 split that led to the Provisional IRA wing of the republican movement, with the latter subscribing to a traditional Catholic/nationalist <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> while the Officials subscribed to the Marxist view that internal strife among the working classes served only the interest of capital.

25|$|In October 2007, on the {{congress}} {{meeting of the}} International Canoe Federation in Guatemala City the organization rights of the World Championships were given to Vichy, beating the bids of Athens and Szeged. The regatta course in Vichy is on a natural river, which quality is highly influenced by the weather conditions. On the 2010 World Cup events a heavy water flow was experienced on the Allier River making the racing unequal. A number of competitors, including Olympic medalists Josefa Idem and Ken Wallace expressed their concerns and dissatisfaction with the track, following that the International Canoe Federation had to reconsider its decision. In early July, after a deep <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> being aware of the possible inequity and unfairness on a major Olympic qualification event, the French Canoe Federation {{with the consent of}} the International Canoe Federation desisted from organizing the event.

500|$|According to Sadat, it {{was only}} when the Israelis cut off the Egyptian {{garrison}} at Sharm el-Sheikh that Nasser became aware of the situation's gravity. After hearing of the attack, he rushed to army headquarters to inquire about the military situation. The simmering conflict between Nasser and Amer subsequently came to the fore, and officers present reported the pair burst into [...] "a nonstop shouting match". The Supreme Executive Committee, set up by Nasser to oversee the conduct of the war, attributed the repeated Egyptian defeats to the Nasser–Amer rivalry and Amer's overall incompetence. According to Egyptian diplomat Ismail Fahmi, who became foreign minister during Sadat's presidency, the Israeli invasion and Egypt's consequent defeat was a result of Nasser's dismissal of all rational <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and his undertaking of a series of irrational decisions.|$|E
