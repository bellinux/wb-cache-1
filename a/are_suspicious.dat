5|$|Three years later, Hasan's {{relationship}} with Kartini is souring; both <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> {{that the other}} is unfaithful. Eventually, Hasan sees Kartini and Anwar leaving a hotel near the train station and incorrectly assumes {{that she had been}} cheating on him. He immediately divorces her and moves out, but soon contracts tuberculosis. After several weeks, Hasan returns to Panyeredan after hearing that his father is ill to work out their issues. However, his father rejects him as a temptation from the devil. Dejected, Hasan returns to Bandung.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> that Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) {{new boyfriend}} Paul (Will Forte) is using her. Pete and Liz follow Paul {{to a bar}} and find out {{that he is a}} Jenna Maroney impersonator, {{performing}} as her in a drag show. The next day, Liz asks Jenna if she knows what Paul does, but Jenna is aware of his work, having met Paul at a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest in which he won and Jenna herself placed fourth. Liz does not approve of the relationship and confronts Paul, asking what his intentions are with Jenna. Paul tells her that he is not using Jenna to further his career, but that he is with her because she accepts him for who he is. Liz is convinced by their touching (although weird) display of care for each other, ultimately approving of their relationship.|$|E

5|$|While the Enterprise is {{en route}} to Pacifica on a {{scientific}} mission, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives a highly confidential message from an old friend, Captain Walker Keel (Jonathan Farwell) of the USS Horatio. Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using {{is supposed to be}} a secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Commander Data (Brent Spiner) review all orders issued by Starfleet Command in the past six months. While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space. Upon investigating this, the Enterprise discovers a mass of debris that surely must be the shattered remains of the Horatio. Data completes his study and finds several strange orders from the senior levels of Starfleet. Picard informs his senior staff of the conspiracy theory, and orders the Enterprise to Earth.|$|E

25|$|Land {{ownership}} in the region rests with the native authority, which must obtain community consent for land transfers. The local people, with reason, <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> of government promises that they will receive long-term economic assistance in exchange for giving up their land, and instead demand exorbitant cash payment. This has frustrated efforts to incorporate the Afi River Forest Reserve and the Mbe Mountains Community Forest into the park, preventing more effective conservation efforts.|$|E

25|$|Journalist George Monbiot {{has argued}} for a 5-year freeze on {{biofuels}} while their impact on poor communities and the environment is assessed. It {{has been suggested that}} a problem with Monbiot's approach is that economic drivers may be required in order to push through the development of more sustainable second-generation biofuel processes: it is possible that these could be stalled if biofuel production decreases. Some environmentalists <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> that second-generation biofuels may not solve the problem of a potential clash with food as they also use significant agricultural resources such as water.|$|E
25|$|As this is {{a sacred}} ceremony, people are {{typically}} reluctant to discuss it in any great detail. Given {{a long history of}} cultural misappropriation, indigenous people <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> that non-Natives may abuse or misuse the traditional ways. Elders and medicine men are concerned that the ceremony should only be passed along in the right ways. The words used at a sun dance are often in the native language and are not translated for outsiders. Not talking about this ceremony is part of the respect the people display for it. In addition, the detailed way in which a respected elder speaks, teaches, and explains a sun dance to younger members of the tribe is unique and not easily quoted, nor is it intended for publication.|$|E
25|$|The French army {{arrives at}} the {{barricade}} and demands that the students surrender ("At the Barricade—Upon These Stones"). Though Javert tells the students {{that the government will}} not attack that night ("Javert's Arrival"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert ("Little People"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. Éponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms ("A Little Fall of Rain"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over Éponine's death. Valjean {{arrives at the}} barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier ("Night of Anguish"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras {{to be the one to}} execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty. ("The First Attack").|$|E

500|$|Coyotes were {{probably}} semidomesticated by various pre-Columbian cultures. Some 19th-century writers wrote of coyotes being kept in native {{villages in the}} Great Plains.

500|$|However other Islanders <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> {{of these}} moves as an {{opportunity}} for the more powerful families to gain more power through land ownership or even worse a way of taking land off the Palm Islanders, who in desperation may sell to the highest bidding developer even if that bid significantly undervalues the land in question. [...] Professor Mick Dodson, director of the Centre for Indigenous Studies at the ANU, argues that the people on Palm Island do not have the financial capacity to compete in the housing market on a commercial basis: He asserts that the only {{solution to the problem of}} overcrowding lies in increasing the level of public housing, there are not the jobs to build capacity among locals to become home owners.|$|E

He explains that the diamond was originally split into two pieces and hidden at different points of the world, but Streisand had managed to find the first of the two.

Although Maddy again breaks the rules and the law to help them, Sunny dies while being treated from an exacerbated pre-existing cardiac problem.

500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, the United States and the Soviet Union are {{competing}} {{to launch the}} first spacecraft into orbit, for military purposes. When vast alien spaceships suddenly position themselves above Earth's principal cities, the space race ceases.

In general, they let humans go on conducting their affairs in their own way. They overtly interfere only twice: in South Africa, where sometime before their arrival Apartheid had collapsed and was replaced with savage persecution of the white minority; and in Spain, where they put an end to bull fighting. Some humans <b>are</b> <b>suspicious</b> of the Overlords' benign intent, as they never visibly appear. The Overlord Karellen, the [...] "Supervisor for Earth," [...] who speaks directly only to Rikki Stormgren, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, tells Stormgren that the Overlords will reveal themselves in 50 years, when humanity will have become used to their presence. Stormgren smuggles a device onto Karellen's ship in an attempt to see Karellen's true form. He succeeds, is shocked, and chooses to keep silent.|$|E
