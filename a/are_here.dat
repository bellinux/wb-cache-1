5|$|Fellow Workers, {{this is the}} Continental Congress of the working-class. We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to confederate {{the workers}} of this country into a working-class {{movement}} that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working-class from the slave bondage of capitalism. The aims and objects of this organization shall be to put the working-class in possession of the economic power, the means of life, {{in control of the}} machinery of production and distribution, without regard to capitalist masters.|$|E

5|$|The family Columbidae {{previously}} {{also contained}} the family Raphidae, {{consisting of the}} extinct Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo. These species are in all likelihood part of the Indo-Australian radiation that produced the three small subfamilies mentioned above, with the fruit doves and pigeons (including the Nicobar pigeon). Therefore, they <b>are</b> <b>here</b> included as a subfamily Raphinae, pending better material evidence of their exact relationships.|$|E

The noise in it is like that of bees, a strange humming or buzz mixed of walking tongues and feet: {{it is a kind}} of still roar or loud whisper... It is the great exchange of all discourse, and no business whatsoever but is here stirring and a-foot... It is the general mint of all famous lies, which <b>are</b> <b>here</b> like the legends of popery, first coined and stamped in the church.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully later {{learn of}} reports of rebel aliens burning doctors {{who were working}} on Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), an alien abductee and mother of Jeffrey Spender. Skinner takes Spender to the scene, where Cassandra asks for Mulder. She informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to destroy all life on Earth. She claims that a rebel force of aliens are mutilating their faces to prevent {{infection}} by the black oil. Cigarette Smoking Man reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Cassandra later escapes from a hospital and arrives at Mulder's apartment, demanding that he shoot her because she is the embodiment of fifty years of work by the Syndicate—an alien-human hybrid that will trigger colonization if the aliens learn of her existence.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the forest in the Wind River Range is the primary destination for mountain climbers. Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming <b>are</b> <b>here,</b> and the mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest peaks in the Wind River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility {{of the region and}} complexity of the climbing effort.|$|E

5|$|These revelations {{make the}} {{painting}} difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its {{strong emphasis on}} colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy. If this is the case, then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form {{can be seen to}} mark the beginning of the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work <b>are</b> <b>here</b> replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, Las Meninas.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} Mt. Battle, people inform Wes and Rui that Cipher {{has already}} taken over {{the first section of}} the mountain. After battling nine other Trainers, Wes battles the Cipher administrator Dakim. Dakim owns a Shadow Entei, {{who is one of the}} trio of legendary beasts. After defeating Dakim, Wes heads to The Under, which is an underground city located underneath Pyrite Town, and under the control of Cipher. More members of the Kids Grid <b>are</b> <b>here.</b> They tell the player of Venus, another Cipher administrator, who has influence over The Under. After Wes confronts Venus, the owner of the second legendary beast Suicune, she flees. Next, Wes and Rui head to the Shadow Pokémon Lab, where Pokémon are transformed into Shadow Pokémon. After defeating numerous Cipher peons, Wes faces Ein, the final Cipher administrator and the owner of the final legendary beast Raikou.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica, but is later denied reassignment to the X-Files division: Mulder and Scully {{have been replaced by}} Spender and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals. Mulder and Scully later learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra. After finding her, she informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien-human hybrid. The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Fowley forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a Centers for Disease Control facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a check point, preparing to be taken away by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra—save The Smoking Man and Fowley, who escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E

5|$|The mobile {{version of}} the game, {{entitled}} Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ, shares multiple gameplay features with its browser counterpart: the main exception is that this version is tailored for a touch screen. The ability to travel freely between different Disney worlds is also replaced with a stage system. These stages, called quests, are confined to specific areas of specific worlds. Instead of spending AP on individual actions, AP is paid to start a quest, and the player can attack as many enemies, collect as many materials, and open as many chests {{as he or she}} can find before defeating a target Heartless. If the player's HP is fully depleted, a choice is offered between forfeiting all progress in the quest or continuing to fight by spending Jewels, a new general-purpose in-game currency. Lux is considered another name for character-leveling experience points. Clothing, hair, and accessories are obtained through Avatar Boards, which each contain an array of nodes on branching pathways. These nodes are unlocked, in set sequences, with Avatar Coins, and may also yield such benefits as increased limits for AP and HP. Cards from the browser version <b>are</b> <b>here</b> replaced by Medals, which are no longer drawn randomly in battle. Instead, each equipped Medal is presented one at a time, and the player is given the choice of attacking one enemy, attacking all enemies (dealing less damage), or using the special attack granted by the Medal (provided the Keyblade's special attack gauges are sufficiently filled). Medals can be combined with matching Medals to improve their special attacks.|$|E
