To calculate the confinement loss a circular perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary condition has been imposed in the outer cladding. About 58, 546 triangular elements and 6, 124 edge elements have been used to represent the complete mesh. The average element quality has used about 0.96.

40|$|Different {{experimental}} and simulation techniques aiming {{at a better}} understanding <b>of</b> lateral mode <b>absorption</b> in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are presented in this paper. A measurement of transmitted power versus propagation distance allows us to derive the <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> LED layer structures at their emission wavelength. Two models for the observed intensity distribution are presented: one is based on scattering, whereas the other relies on selective absorption. Both models were applied to InGaN-on-sapphire-based LED structures. Material <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> 7 cm - 1 for the scattering model and 4 cm - 1 for the absorbing-layer model were obtained. Furthermore, these values are independent of the emission wavelength of the layer structure in the 403 - 433 -nm range. The losses are most likely caused by a thin highly absorbing layer at the interface to the substrate. In a second step, interference of the modal field profile with the absorbing layer {{can be used to}} determine its thickness (d = 75 nm) and its absorption coefficient (α ≈ 3900 cm - 1). This method has also been tested and applied on AlGaInP-based layer structures emitting at 650 nm. In this case, the intensity decay of α = 30 cm - 1 includes a contribution from the absorbing substrate...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{thin films}} from oxides for the VIS-NIR with scatter {{losses in the}} range of 10 "-" 6 can be {{produced}} by Ion Beam Sputtering. When this project started the <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the films were much higher. The aim of this work was the reduction <b>of</b> these <b>absorption</b> <b>losses.</b> The impurities in the films and the absorption caused by them could be reduced building a new- 2 -chamber-system for ion beam sputtering using ECR ion sources. Damage by a too high energy transfer to the films during deposition could be reduced by sputtering from partially oxygenized targets. The build up measuring systems for scatter and absorption losses reach a resolution limit of 10 "-" 6. For SiO_ 2 films an absorption value at 514 nm of 1 cm"-" 1 and for TiO_ 2 a value of 5 cm"-" 1 was achieved. A laser mirror made from these films has <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> 30. 10 "-" 6. An AR-coating for 1064 nm is not damaged by 2 ms laser pulses with an intensity of 1 MW/cm" 2.
