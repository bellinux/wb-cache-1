25|$|The album also {{provided}} another first in both Motown and R music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album {{in a song}} cycle, segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R albums that traditionally included filler tracks to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept.

500|$|Marlo Campbell, {{a writer}} for Uptown, said that the play critiques {{masculine}} egotism and Western heroism through the character of Jason. Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate disagreed, stating that Jason never lapses into self-importance. Aaron Krogman, who portrayed Jason and the pimp in the play's premiere, said, [...] "there is a thin line between Jason and the pimp...both characters are struggling with power and how they use it." [...] Waldschmidt stated that the doubling of this role is intended to remind audiences that there are Canadians who are perpetrators of human trafficking and that it [...] "is not just somebody else's problem over there...but that it's us, and it's in our country <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> backyard <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> suburbs". Jason has in this way been considered an everyman. Chris Quandt, who portrayed Jason at the United States premiere, {{said that he and}} his fellow cast members greatly appreciated the fact that Kooman incorporated into the play the facts that taking down one brothel often leaves space for another brothel to be established soon afterwards, and that child sex tourism exists because there is a demand for it.|$|E

500|$|Pavement had {{attained}} {{a degree of}} success within the underground music scene with its 1989 debut EP Slay Tracks (1933-1969). While Malkmus was traveling to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Kannberg managed Slay Tracks release on the band's self-owned label, Treble Kicker. Slay Tracks {{caught the attention of}} Dan Koretzky, an avid record collector working at Reckless Records in Chicago. Koretzky ordered 200 copies of the EP for the record store, and asked Kannberg to sign to his newly started independent label, Drag City. At the time the members of Pavement anticipated no further releases beyond Slay Tracks, and Kannberg initially expressed reluctance to sign to any label. Kannberg later said [...] "I started talking to [...] <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> conversations he said 'I'm starting this label. Do {{you want to do something}} for us?'

[...] The Cascade AIDS Project, where Forkner was the Pivot Center Coordinator at the time, launched a Facebook campaign following the attack called [...] "Holding Hands, In Solidarity", encouraging people to post pictures of hand-holding. The Q Center also condemned the attack. The assault once again prompted Q Center volunteers to form Q Patrols as a means of monitoring the streets and reporting hate crimes to police. Plans were made to have Q Patrols available between 11pm and 3am until the weekend of Halloween.|$|E
500|$|In Our Time {{was ignored}} and {{forgotten}} by literary critics for decades. Benson attributes the neglect to various factors. The Sun Also Rises, published the next year, {{is considered the}} more important book followed fairly rapidly by the popular A Farewell to Arms two years after in 1928; critics' general assumption {{seemed to be that}} Hemingway's talent lay in writing prose rather than [...] "sophisticated, complex design"; <b>and</b> <b>In</b> <b>Our</b> Time stories were combined with subsequent collections in the publication of The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories in 1938, drawing the critics' attention away from the book as an entity, toward the individual stories. In 1962, when Scribner's released the paperback edition of In Our Time, it began to be taught in American universities, {{and by the end of}} the decade, the first critical study of the collection appeared.

500|$|Instead {{of being}} sobered by the Vietnamese show of force, the Kampuchean Government boasted that the Vietnamese {{withdrawal}} {{was a major}} victory for Democratic Kampuchea, comparing it to the “defeat of U.S. imperialism” on 17 April 1975. The Kampucheans went on further to proclaim that [...] "our 6 January victory over the annexationist, Vietnamese aggressor enemy has given all of us greater confidence in the forces of our people and nation, in our Kampuchean Communist Party and our Kampuchean Revolutionary Army, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> Party’s line of people’s war". The Kampuchean leadership claimed that one Kampuchean soldier was equal to 30 Vietnamese soldiers, so if Kampuchea could raise two million soldiers from a population of eight million, it could wipe out Vietnam’s population of 50 million and still have six million people left. In reality, Kampuchean leaders simply ignored {{the condition of the}} population in their own country and Vietnam; the Vietnamese, though poor, were in good physical condition, while Kampuchea's population was physically and mentally exhausted from years of hard labour, starvation and disease.|$|E
500|$|Observers {{agree that}} Pandey's ordeal {{has brought a}} change to public conversations about women's issues, with men joining in the discussions as well. A young woman who had taken part in the protests {{at the time of}} the rape said a year later, [...] "A welcome change is that the taboo on {{discussing}} rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes." [...] She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant." [...] She added, [...] "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it is not out of a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure".|$|E
500|$|For Satisfied, DecembeRadio made {{a concerted}} effort to write lyrics that were more {{uplifting}} than those featured on their previous album.

[...] We like to have fun onstage <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives, so we didn't want this album to be as dark as the last one." [...] To that end, the band wrote and included on Satisfied songs like [...] "Better Man", which Reedy says imparts that [...] "if we learn from our mistakes and follow Jesus Christ it will make us a better man", and the [...] "vertical worship song" [...] "For Your Glory". [...] The band was inspired to write [...] "Find You Waiting" [...] following the death of a friend of producer Scotty Wilbanks. [...] At the funeral, the man's widow stood over the casket praising God with arms raised amidst her sorrow. [...] "It struck a chord in our hearts to write a song about how, no matter what current problem we might be facing, God's love and mercy is always waiting there for us", said Reedy.|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, Brunner {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} would allow counties to recruit poll workers by mail, who would then undertake two paid training days, and work a paid eight-hour shift at the polls on Election Day. Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> state. One of the quickest ways to repair that {{is to make sure that}} we have adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We would be looking to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only be asking for three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of our poll workers at 72, that's a tough day for anyone, no matter what their age is. ... It's an option, and we can even include a trigger, so that a county has to be deficient by a certain percentage of poll workers to even be able to use this." [...] In the initial proposal it was not yet decided what wages would be paid, and whether refusing recruitment would result in penalties. The proposal will be decided by the Ohio General Assembly.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. <b>And</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
