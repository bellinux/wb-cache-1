5000|$|<b>Aldicarb</b> is a {{carbamate}} insecticide {{which is}} the active substance in the pesticide Temik. It is effective against thrips, aphids, spider mites, lygus, fleahoppers, and leafminers, but is primarily used as a nematicide. <b>Aldicarb</b> is a cholinesterase inhibitor which prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse. In case of severe poisoning, the victim dies of respiratory failure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aldicarb</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{pesticides}} internationally, and is also one of the most environmentally toxic. <b>Aldicarb</b> poisoning from agricultural water runoff has led to the destruction of healthy ecosystems and the irreversible poisoning of fertile agricultural land. Poisoning from this pesticide is also believed to be linked to high cancer rates in communities located around the Aral Sea.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, <b>aldicarb</b> was {{approved}} by the USEPA for use by professional pesticide applicators on a variety of crops, including cotton, beans, and others. It is not approved for household use. [...] EPA started limiting the main <b>aldicarb</b> pesticide, Temik 15G, in 2010, requiring an end to distribution by 2017. Discontinuation of the use on citrus and potatoes began in 2012, with a complete phase out of the product expected by 2018. A new <b>aldicarb</b> pesticide named AgLogic 15G, {{was approved}} by the EPA in December 2011 and is said to be entering the market in 2015. It will be registered for use on cotton, dry beans, peanuts, soybeans, sugar beets, and sweet potatoes.|$|E

50|$|A {{nematicide}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} pesticide used to kill plant-parasitic nematodes. Nematicides have tended to be broad-spectrum toxicants possessing high volatility or other properties promoting migration through the soil. <b>Aldicarb</b> (Temik), a carbamate insecticide marketed by Bayer CropScience, {{is an example of a}} commonly used commercial nematicide. It is important in potato production, where it has been used for control of soil-borne nematodes. <b>Aldicarb</b> is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse. In case of severe poisoning, the victim dies of respiratory failure. It is no longer authorised for use in the EU and, in August, 2010, Bayer CropScience announced that it plans to discontinue <b>aldicarb</b> by 2014. Human health safety and environmental concerns have resulted in the widespread deregistration of several other agronomically important nematicides. Prior to 1985, the persistent halocarbon DBCP was a widely used nematicide and soil fumigant. However, it was banned from use after being linked to sterility among male workers; the Dow Chemical company was subsequently found liable for more than $600 million in damages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aldicarb</b> is {{manufactured}} by Bayer CropScience, but was formerly owned and produced by Union Carbide. Union Carbide's agricultural chemicals division {{was sold to}} Rhône-Poulenc.

50|$|The {{so-called}} {{carbamate insecticides}} feature the carbamate ester functional group. Included {{in this group}} are <b>aldicarb</b> (Temik), carbofuran (Furadan), carbaryl (Sevin), ethienocarb, fenobucarb, oxamyl, and methomyl. These insecticides kill insects by reversibly inactivating the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The organophosphate pesticides also inhibit this enzyme, although irreversibly, and cause a more severe form of cholinergic poisoning.|$|E
50|$|A carbamoyl {{chloride}} is {{the functional}} {{group with the}} formula R2NC(O)Cl. The parent carbamoyl chloride, H2NCOCl is unstable, but many N-substituted analogues are known. Most examples are moisture sensitive, colourless, and soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. An example is dimethylcarbamoyl chloride (m.p. −90 °C and b.p. 93 °C). Carbamoyl chlorides are used to prepare a number of pesticides, e.g. carbofuran and <b>aldicarb.</b>|$|E

50|$|In July 2012 {{consumer}} action groups demanded four unlisted toxic pesticides {{found on}} common vegetables at levels 100 times the EU guidelines (which are banned in developed countries) be banned. Chemical companies are requesting to {{add them to}} the Thai Dangerous Substances Act so {{they can continue to}} be used, including on exported mangoes to developed countries which have banned their use. In 2014, Khon Kaen University concluded after a study, that Thailand should ban 155 types of pesticides, with 14 listed as urgent: Carbofuran, Methyl Bromide, Dichlorvos, Lambda-cyhalothrin, Methidathion-methyl, Omethoate, Zeta Cypermethrin, Endosulfan sulfate, <b>Aldicarb,</b> Azinphos-methyl, Chlorpyrifos-ethyl, Methoxychlor and Paraquat.|$|E
50|$|Despite Mr. Karawan's vote of {{confidence}} {{for the safety of}} the MIC operations at his plant, Union Carbide elected to shut down production of the deadly chemical until it could make $500 million worth of safety improvements. On May 4, 1985, Union Carbide resumed production of MIC. On August 11, 1985, on the heels of the completion of the safety improvement program just a few months before, 500 gallons of <b>aldicarb</b> oxime and highly toxic MIC leaked from the Institute plant. Although no one was killed, 134 people living around the plant were treated at local hospitals.|$|E
50|$|Carbofuran {{has one of}} {{the highest}} acute toxicities to humans of any {{insecticide}} widely used on field crops (only <b>aldicarb</b> and parathion are more toxic). Most carbofuran is applied by commercial applicators using closed systems with engineered controls so there is no exposure to it in preparation. Since its toxic effects are due to its activity as a cholinesterase inhibitor it is considered a neurotoxic pesticide. A recent study reports that carbofuran is a structural mimic of the neurohormone melatonin and could directly bind to MT2 melatonin receptor (Ki = 1.7 uM). Disruption of melatonin signaling could impact the circadian rhythm balance and linked to elevated risk of developing diabetes.|$|E
5000|$|Since organic cotton {{is grown}} {{without the use}} of {{synthetic}} pesticides, it should contain fewer synthetic pesticides than conventional cotton. Pesticides used in the production of conventional cotton include orthophosphates such as phorate and methamidophos, endosulfan (highly toxic to farmers, but not very environmentally persistent) and <b>aldicarb.</b> Other pesticides persisting in cotton fields in the United States include Trifluralin, Toxaphene and DDT. Although the last two chemicals are no longer used in the United States [...] their long breakdown period and difficulty in removal ensures their persistence. Thus even organic cotton fields may contain them since conventional cotton fields can be transitioned to organic fields in 2-3 years. [...] Instead, organic production allows the use of poisons extracted from plants or animals.|$|E

Instead, by 2014 the number of active ingredients in imported pesticides increased from 210 to 253. Herbicides were by far the most significant of the imported chemicals, accounting for 80 percent of the total volume, followed by insecticides at nine percent and fungicides at eight percent.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{carbamate}} acetylcholinesterase inhibitors {{are commonly}} referred to as [...] "carbamate insecticides" [...] due to their generally high selectivity for insect acetylcholinesterase enzymes over the mammalian versions, the most potent compounds such as <b>aldicarb</b> and carbofuran are still capable of inhibiting mammalian acetylcholinesterase enzymes at low enough concentrations that they pose a significant risk of poisoning to humans, especially when used in large amounts for agricultural applications. Other carbamate based acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are known with even higher toxicity to humans, and some such as T-1123 and EA-3990 were investigated for potential military use as nerve agents. However, since all compounds of this type have a quaternary ammonium group with a permanent positive charge, they have poor blood-brain barrier penetration, and also are only stable as crystalline salts or aqueous solutions, and so were not considered to have suitable properties for weaponisation.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{different}} methods to control nematodes {{have been tried}} over the years. Some have proven more successful and others have not. Some of these methods include nematicides, cover crops, crop rotation, genetically modified plants and seed treatments. In soybeans, Essex is a tolerant cultivar whereas Forrest is sensitive. Essex has a higher yield in fields that are infested with the nematode. The plots in this study by Koenning were treated with <b>aldicarb,</b> carbofuran, and fenamiphos and had less nematodes 40 days post planting then the areas that were not treated. The plots that were planted with Forrest which is the sensitive cultivar and treated with carbofuran had a higher yield than untreated control plots. Damage threshold levels have not been well established but using fumigated plots has shown significant increases in yield. [...] In Brazil, many crops are planted under the no tillage planting system. This typically causes of buildup of polyphagous species of nematodes like P. brachyurus. [...] If a no till system is being used, planting cover crops that would decrease {{the density of the}} nematodes may be needed. The problem with that is there is contradictory information regarding P. brachyurus and which plants are poor or good hosts. Due to this very same reason, farmers would {{have to be very careful}} in choosing a crop rotation schedule as well. [...] In 1992 Vast demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi could enhanced the plant’s resistance to nematodes by being a physical barrier. [...] This would be something that could be used as a seed treatment to protect the newly emerging seedlings from being infested.|$|E
50|$|Tobacco Rattle Virus can {{be managed}} {{through a variety of}} methods {{designed}} to make the environment unsuitable for transmission and viral propagation. Tubers or seeds of any susceptible plants should be purchased only from sellers certified as clean, and never planted in fields with a history of corky ringspot or Tobacco Rattle Virus-related disease. Many US states and several other countries run seed certification programs, for potatoes in particular. While its use requires a permit from many state or local governments, the nematicide 1,3-dichloropropene may be employed against fields overrun by stubby root nematodes, a common vector of the virus. Soil fumigants generally fail to penetrate the 40 inches necessary to ensure nematode eradication, and carmabates such as <b>aldicarb</b> and oxamyl are recommended as a last resort. Tobacco Rattle Virus is only found in nature in association with stubby root nematodes of genera Trichodorus and Paratrichodorus. Although otherwise considered harmless, they spread the infection during feedings. Nematodes may live and multiply within weeds in the field in between crop rotations, and it is advisable to employ non-host plants, such as alfalfa, to compete against weeds that may otherwise harbor the viral vector. In contrast, nightshade is a very problematic weed as it is an ideal host for the virus and the nematode. Growers can reduce symptom development by planting early and harvesting early. While the Russet Burbank cultivar proves to be highly susceptible to Tobacco Rattle Virus corky ringspot, Merrimack and several old European varieties exhibit resistance. Too much soil moisture can encourage nematode overpopulation, but tightly packed fine soil, clay, or sand can drastically inhibit the vector movement responsible for widespread and erratic field decimations. Once a plant is infected it cannot be treated and should be burned or disposed of as biohazard waste.|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of <b>aldicarb,</b> and the metabolites <b>aldicarb</b> sulfoxide and <b>aldicarb</b> sulfone, was evaluated in cotton field soils previously exposed to <b>aldicarb.</b> A loss of efficacy had {{been observed in}} two (LM and MS) of the three (CL) field soils as measured by R. reniformis population development {{and a lack of}} cotton yield response. Two soils were compared for the first test—one where <b>aldicarb</b> had been effective (CL) and the second where <b>aldicarb</b> had lost its efficacy (LM). The second test included all three soils: autoclaved, non-autoclaved and treated with <b>aldicarb</b> at 0. 59 kg a. i. /ha, or not treated with <b>aldicarb.</b> The {{degradation of}} <b>aldicarb</b> to <b>aldicarb</b> sulfoxide and then to <b>aldicarb</b> sulfone was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in both tests.
