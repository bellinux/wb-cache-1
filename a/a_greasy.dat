5|$|The Mersea Week is {{a week-long}} August festival of boat racing {{organised}} by the West Mersea Yacht Club and Dabchicks Sailing Club, established in 1973. During the week, starting on Monday, there are races for many boat {{classes in the}} Blackwater Estuary, from Optimist dinghies to large yachts. The most celebrated event is the Round-the-Island race, where dinghies attempt to sail round the island in either direction, helped over the Strood by volunteers. On Saturday, there is a regatta at West Mersea, followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk. One of the popular events on Saturday is walking <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> pole rigged {{over the side of}} the hosting Thames sailing barge.|$|E

25|$|Diesel is less {{flammable}} than gasoline/petroleum spirit. However, {{because it}} evaporates slowly, spills on a roadway can pose slip hazard to vehicles. After the light fractions have evaporated, <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> slick is {{left on the}} road which reduces tire grip and traction, and can cause vehicles to skid. The loss of traction {{is similar to that}} encountered on black ice, resulting in especially dangerous situations for two-wheeled vehicles, such as motorcycles and bicycles, in roundabouts.|$|E

25|$|Noble often mimes actions on-stage to {{help the}} {{audience}} visualise his surreal ideas, for example, telling the audience to never put a blanket over an owl, and exactly what an owl neck detection device is ("just a stick with a pointy bit on it") or showing the audience how to serve double header ice creams properly after considering his own made-up plot of 24 in which Jack Bauer escapes a cell using <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> goose.|$|E
25|$|Persons with ONJ {{may have}} either {{necrotic}} bone or bone marrow {{that has been}} slowly strangulated or nutrient-starved. Bone with chronically poor blood flow develops either a fibrous marrow since fibres can more easily live in nutrient starved areas, <b>a</b> <b>greasy,</b> dead fatty marrow (wet rot), a very dry, sometimes leathery marrow (dry rot), or a completely hollow marrow space (osteocavitation), also typical of ONJ. The blood flow impairment occurs following a bone infarct, a blood clot forming inside the smaller blood vessels of cancellous bone tissue.|$|E
25|$|Lithography was {{discovered}} in 1797, at first used in printing paper images. An image is drawn with <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> crayon on a smooth stone or zinc surface, which is then wetted. The water remains on the stone but is repelled by the grease. Ink is spread on and is repelled by the water but remains on the grease. Paper is than pressed onto the slab. It picks up the ink from the grease, thus reproducing the drawing. The process can be repeated to make many copies.|$|E
50|$|While Minced pork rice is {{referred}} to as one important icon in typical Taiwanese folk cuisine, the variety of methods to customize flavors is so wide that it creates considerable differences between regions. In southern Taiwan, where people name it by the sauce “bah-sò-pn̄g (肉燥飯)” instead of the meat, Minced pork rice is preferably served with pork with less fat. People in the north of Taiwan favor <b>a</b> <b>greasier</b> version of meat sauce with rice, sometimes even with glutinous rice mixed in.|$|R

25|$|A {{common cause}} of cradle cap {{appears to be a}} common manifestation of biotin insufficiency. This may be due, in part, to the {{influence}} of biotin on fatty acid biosynthesis. Possibly {{it has to do with}} overactive sebaceous glands in the skin of newborn babies, due to the mother's hormones still in the baby's circulation. The glands release <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> substance that makes old skin cells attach to the scalp instead of falling off as they dry. There may be a relationship with skin yeasts (Pityrosporum ovale, newly renamed Malassezia furfur). Seborrheic dermatitis is the adult version of cradle cap.|$|E
25|$|At 3:30p.m. on February 13, 1966, a fire {{broke out}} in <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> flue {{in the kitchen of}} the {{terminal}} building's second-floor restaurant, The Sky Room. Fanned by gusty winds, the fire spread through the terminal and control tower. Controllers in the tower were able to escape on an aerial ladder and air traffic was diverted to nearby Van Nuys Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for several hours. A controller communicated with aircraft using the radio in a light airplane belonging to Sky Roamers Air Travel, a flying club whose hangar was just east of the control tower. The fire, contained by about 6:30p.m., caused an estimated $2 million in damages to the terminal, tower and equipment in the tower. No injuries were reported.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{in crystal}} {{structure}} and chemistry greatly influence other physical {{properties of the}} mineral. The carbon allotropes diamond and graphite have vastly different properties; diamond is the hardest natural substance, has an adamantine lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas as graphite is very soft, has <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp3 hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp2 hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker van der Waals forces, and this discrepancy translates to big macroscopic differences.|$|E

500|$|Jabba the Hutt's {{physical}} appearance reinforces his personality {{as a criminal}} deviant: in Return of the Jedi, Han Solo entitles Jabba a [...] "slimy piece of worm-ridden filth"; and film critic Roger Ebert describes him as [...] "a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat"; and astrophysicist and science fiction writer Jeanne Cavelos gives Jabba the [...] "award for most disgusting alien". Science fiction authors Tom and Martha Veitch write that Jabba's body is a [...] "miasmic mass", and that [...] "The Hutt's lardaceous body seemed to periodically release <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> discharge, sending fresh waves of rotten stench" [...] into the air. Jabba's appetite is insatiable, and some authors portray him threatening to eat his subordinates.|$|E
500|$|Tricholoma pardinum {{lies within}} the {{subgenus}} Pardinicutis of Tricholoma, a grouping of similar species characterised by greyish, brownish, or pallid caps that are woolly or covered in small scales, spores with a length between 8 and 11micrometres, and abundant clamp {{connections in the}} hyphae. Molecular analyses suggest that T.pardinum {{is closely related to}} T.huronense, T.mutabile, and T.venenatum. Tricholoma pardinum var. filamentosum is an uncommon variety, described in 1983 by Carlo Luciano Alessio, which produces mushrooms with more [...] caps and stalks than the typical variety. It is found in southern Europe, where it associates with chestnut and spruce trees. Another variety has been described as T.pardinum var. unguentatum, characterised by daintier mushrooms that have <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> coating on their caps.|$|E
2500|$|TV Guide {{included}} [...] "Made in America" [...] {{in their}} [...] "TV's Best Finales Ever" [...] feature, writing: [...] "What's {{there to say}} about this finale that hasn't already been said? The much-anticipated closer had everyone waiting to see if Tony was finally going to go from whacker to whackee. Instead, they got Journey, <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> plate of onion rings and a black screen. But, the fact that we're still talking about it proves—for better or worse—that the episode did its job." ...|$|E
50|$|The word ričet {{is typical}} of central Slovenia, {{including}} Ljubljana, and derives from Styrian German ritschet or ritschert. Etymologists suggest that ričet is a derivation from two German expressions: rutschen 'to slip, slide' and rutschig 'slippery'. In fact, ričet is <b>a</b> fairly <b>greasy</b> dish.|$|R

2500|$|However, The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} Xbox 360 version three-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} and called it [...] "a game that would have benefitted from being streamlined, with {{additional}} FPS levels replacing the awkward driving. It should have been an id game. Instead it occupies this weird halfway-house between Borderlands, MotorStorm and Doom, not quite an RPG, not quite a racer and not quite an FPS." [...] The A.V. Club gave the same console version a C+ and said that its [...] "huge swaths... are lifted wholesale from Fallout 3, Borderlands, and BioShock, making Rage forever veer between loving homage and blatant plagiarism. In the end, Rage is an insecure, overly busy game that tries too hard to be too many things, and winds up with <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> sheen of flop-sweat on its brow." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hemipepsis cocoon is a brown silk structure. It is {{slightly}} wider {{at the end}} from which the wasp will emerge. The inner wall is varnished, {{but there is no}} inner cocoon. [...] It takes several hours to complete, {{and at the end of}} it, the grub evacuates its alimentary canal; this meconium, or first stool, becomes a hardened mass at the end of the cocoon. The grub is much smaller than it was at the end of feeding because it has expended so much body content on spinning the cocoon and voiding its alimentary canal. The cocoon turns <b>a</b> <b>greasy</b> amber yellow from the original silky gray. The time of hatching is dependent on the season. A cocoon formed early in the summer may hatch the same summer, however a late summer or autumn brood may remain in cocoon form until the following spring or summer. Once the grub reaches pupa stage, the grub lies extended and quiet. The head capsule splits along the midline and a glassy, whitish pupa forces its way out of the discarded, shriveling larval skin. The pupa turns creamy yellow, with gray-blue large compound eyes showing through the thin integument. One can also see the antenna, stubby wing pads, and back spines.|$|E

These include: Rice pudding (risengrynsgraut), Pork belly (ribbe), pinnekjøtt, medisterpølse, lutefisk, Codfish (Christmas Codfish). It is usually served along with surkål (sour cabbage) and raspberry sauce. As it is <b>a</b> rather <b>greasy</b> meal, it is customary to drink Akevitt {{in order to}} wash it down.|$|R
