50|$|First mined in the 1990s, Burnakura {{was later}} owned by Extract Resources Limited, which brought in Tectonic Resources NL as an {{operating}} partner. In 2005, underground production commenced {{by creating a}} portal and decline <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>ore</b> and milling began late 2005. In April 2007, milling ceased again and in October 2007, ATW purchased the mine for C$8.4 million.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} locating a line or a line segment in three- dimensional space, such that the sum of distances from the linear facility to a given set of points is minimized. An example is planning the drilling of a mine shaft, with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>ore</b> deposits through horizontal tunnels connecting the deposits and the shaft. Various models of the problem are developed and analyzed, and effcient solution methods are given...|$|R
50|$|Originally the Blue Bag Mine {{operated}} as an open-cut, however when operations became {{dangerous as}} {{the removal of}} overburden increased {{the depth of the}} open-cut, shafts and tunnels were excavated {{from the base of the}} open-cut <b>to</b> afford <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ore.</b>|$|R
50|$|Abnormally heavy {{rainfall}} limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> high-grade <b>ore</b> {{in the pit}} early in 2004. As a result, mining moved into the higher-grade Watu section of the orebody, with production increasing by 15% to 410,000 ounces. First gold produced from the underground mine was {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2004.|$|R
50|$|The Lackawanna Steel Company built a large {{integrated}} {{steel works}} near Buffalo, which began producing steel from Lake Superior ore in 1903. The company had made steel in Scranton, Pennsylvania since 1840, but moved <b>to</b> provide easier <b>access</b> <b>to</b> iron <b>ore,</b> {{and in an}} unsuccessful attempt to avoid labor troubles.|$|R
50|$|Dioro {{suffered}} {{a number of}} set-backs at its South Kal mine, when, on two occasions, major pit wall collapses interrupted mining. These events, in October 2008 at the Mt Marion pit and in January 2009 at the HBJ pit, made <b>access</b> <b>to</b> high-grade <b>ore</b> temporarily impossible and affected operational cash flow {{for more than six}} months.|$|R
50|$|Pickands Mather {{became one}} of the four major iron ore {{companies}} in the United States through the operation of extensive mines in the Lake Superior region. By providing ample <b>access</b> <b>to</b> iron <b>ore,</b> steel, and shipping, Mather became increasingly wealthy through the profits reaped by the company and through the inheritance left to him from his father.|$|R
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{turbulent}} {{nature of the}} global financial environment, project drivers have been challenged with the emphasis being placed on methods <b>to</b> gain early <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>ore</b> bodies, rapid development techniques, lower capital costs and reduced labour requirements to name a few. Recently work commenced on a project that is challenging the norm and implementing an alternative excavation method into the Australian coal mining industry {{by the use of}} a tunnel boring machine. The tunnel boring machine will mechanically excavate both the Conveyor Drift and Transport Drift at Anglo American’s Grosvenor Mine in Moranbah, Queensland. This paper will review this project and provide technical and operational insight into some of the challenges faced in implementing this and other alternative excavation methods in the Australian underground coal industry...|$|R
50|$|The {{plan was}} to get Norwegian and Swedish {{permission}} to send an expeditionary force to Finland across Sápmi, ostensibly to help the Finns. Once in place they were to proceed {{to take control of}} Swedish harbours and mines, occupying cities such as Gävle and Luleå and shutting down German <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Swedish <b>ore,</b> presenting Norway and Sweden with a fait accompli.|$|R
50|$|Levels are {{excavated}} horizontally off {{the decline}} or shaft <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the <b>ore</b> body. Stopes are then excavated perpendicular (or near perpendicular) {{to the level}} into the ore.|$|R
40|$|CUBIN is an {{affiliated}} {{program of}} National ICT Australia. The dominant working structure of an underground mine {{is a set}} of interconnected tunnels which provides <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>ore</b> zones and haulage of ore from the designated <b>ore</b> zones <b>to</b> the mill. This set of interconnected tunnels forms a network. We describe a mathematical network model and the modelling features of our two software tools for designing underground mine layouts that minimise associated costs. The application of these techniques is illustrated in two industry case studies. In the first, we apply the Underground Network Optimisation tool (UNOTM) to design an extension to an Australian gold mine where 15 new distinct ore bodies are located in a 3 km long region, several hundred metres underground. In a second case study, we design a single decline for accessing a large orebody where a turning circle constraint is a significant factor. An efficient decline is found using the Decline Optimisation Tool (DOTTM). ...|$|R
25|$|Once the {{analysis}} determines a given ore body is worth recovering, development begins <b>to</b> create <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ore</b> body. The mine buildings and processing plants are built, and any necessary equipment is obtained. The {{operation of the}} mine <b>to</b> recover the <b>ore</b> begins and continues {{as long as the}} company operating the mine finds it economical to do so. Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered, reclamation begins to make the land used by the mine suitable for future use.|$|R
50|$|In 1896 {{the mine}} was {{operating}} at full capacity and by 1897 three shafts gave <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ore</b> {{at a depth}} of 60m. By 1900 the main shaft was 160 m deep and selective mining methods were being used and two Wilfley Concentrators were in operation. Two additional concentrators were installed in 1901. In 1902 another shaft was sunk which became known as the Boston Richardson Shaft, and which is still in existence to the present day.|$|R
50|$|Robert Lawlor {{held the}} 2.5ha Crystal Lease at Top Camp {{on the new}} Mount Isa field when the {{government}} geologist, EC Saint-Smith, inspected the area in September 1923. This lease was consolidated into Mount Isa Mines holdings {{by the end of}} 1924 but Lawlor's Shaft remained as the major <b>access</b> point <b>to</b> <b>ores</b> in the Rio Grande lode during the exploration and ore proving phase (1925-9). The headframe and ancillary buildings were featured in a photograph in the Queensland Government Mining Journal, 15 August 1929.|$|R
50|$|Rio Grande Glaze Ware was {{no longer}} made after 1700, because the Spanish cut off Pueblo <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the lead <b>ore</b> used in making the glaze paint (Wilson 1995:10). The Pueblos {{continued}} to make polychrome pottery but used all matte paints (Harlow 1973), as they do today.|$|R
50|$|The {{open field}} of the River Loop trail system sloping down to the North River valley is managed as a hayfield, as it was during prior centuries. This {{ecological}} management plan is keeping this cultural grassland, a vanishing habitat in the east, open in Massachusetts. The red maple swamp off the main field shows signs of use during the North River’s shipbuilding heyday (1690-1870), specifically multiple mature shoots sprouting from a single ancient tree trunk. Early shipbuilders found the combination of easy <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the sea, thick virgin forests and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> iron <b>ore</b> in bogs upriver as advantageous for their needs.|$|R
50|$|Ironically, {{although}} Operation Wilfred {{was essentially}} a failure in {{that it did not}} prevent the Germans from having <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the iron <b>ore,</b> once Norway's administration became pro-German it was no longer neutral, and thereafter British ships and aircraft were free to enter her territorial waters to attack German ships at will.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dramatic}} {{conflicts between}} the various crews included gunfire. The Guggenheims and J.P. Morgan, via the Alaska Syndicate, sought <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the copper <b>ore</b> deposits at Kennecott, Alaska. When an alternate route starting at the Katalla, Alaska, port was [...] "wiped out in a winter storm", the syndicate acquired the Close Brothers-Heney interest." ...|$|R
25|$|Conventional open-pit mining {{techniques}} {{are used to}} mine natural zeolites. The overburden is removed <b>to</b> allow <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ore.</b> The ore may be blasted or stripped for processing by using tractors equipped with ripper blades and front-end loaders. In processing, the ore is crushed, dried, and milled. The milled ore may be air-classified as to particle size and shipped in bags or bulk. The crushed product may be screened to remove fine material when a granular product is required, and some pelletized products are produced from fine material.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1870s {{feeder lines}} {{such as the}} Mont Alto Railroad were added in the Cumberland Valley <b>to</b> gain <b>access</b> <b>to</b> iron <b>ore</b> deposits. In 1873 the {{railroad}} extended south from Hagerstown to the Potomac River. The Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania Railroad Station was built about 1875. [...] In 1889, it reached Martinsburg, West Virginia and Winchester, Virginia, {{at the head of}} the Shenandoah Valley. The Cumberland Valley was to have a junction with the South Pennsylvania Railroad in Newville, but the ambitious South Penn ran into financial difficulties during its construction and was never completed.|$|R

50|$|Mining in the Pomona area {{started in}} the 1860s. After the {{discovery}} of guano deposits, the British annexed a number of islands {{off the coast of}} south-western Africa. This action led adventurers and traders into the area. Two of these, Aaron de Pass and Captain John Spence, obtained mining rights from Chief David Christian along the coast between the shore and 15°50’ longitude. Together they established the Pomona Mining Company and unsuccessfully tried to extract copper, lead and silver. It later appeared they must have shoveled the diamonds away <b>to</b> get <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ore</b> deposits.|$|R
50|$|By late winter, LC&NC {{was seeking}} {{suitable}} real estate, with water power and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> iron <b>ores.</b> Suitable acres were available {{a few miles}} below the Lehigh Gap in Northampton County. The company put its first furnace into blast in 1840, and quickly gained a reputation for efficiency and ironmaking prowess among the many furnaces that now sprang up in the Lehigh Valley. Over the next several decades, Crane Iron developed an extensive portfolio of assets, buying mines in the Lehigh Valley and in northern New Jersey, and taking over many of the smaller iron furnaces in the region. Crane Iron also financed the building of railroads {{in the area to}} haul limestone and iron <b>ore</b> <b>to</b> its furnaces.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, a fifth line {{is under}} {{construction}} by the Fortescue Metals Group.

50|$|The ore in {{the mine}} had a high {{quantity}} of manganese and was suitable for bessemer iron that was produced in the new blast furnace in Klosterverken (järnbruket in Långshyttan) from 1861 (with an interruption 1864-1868). <b>To</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> its own <b>ore</b> reduced {{the cost of the}} company at Kloster consideably, partly compensating for the lack of own charcoal.|$|R
50|$|The {{strategic}} {{goals of}} Germany's campaign in Norway were both offensive and defensive.

50|$|The {{establishment}} of the Solombala yard by Peter the Great in 1693 signed the beginning of Russian shipbuilding on a sustained basis. Despite its remoteness and harsh climate, the Arkhangelsk region provided a number of advantages for the shipbuilding industry, such as cheap and abundant timber and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the iron <b>ore</b> deposits of the Urals. Between 1702 and 1855, the Solombala shipyard completed 247 vessels.|$|R

2500|$|The first mine shaft at Greenside was sunk in 185152 <b>to</b> give <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>ore</b> {{beneath the}} Low Level. This {{was known as}} the Engine Shaft (or Willie Shaft) and was sunk from a point [...] north of where the level had first reached the vein. Initially the shaft was sunk [...] and a new 36Fathom Level was driven from the bottom. Two {{hydraulic}} engines were installed {{at the top of the}} shaft, one for winding and one for pumping out water. The water power for running these engines came from a reservoir created in the High Horse Level. That level had been driven northwards in an unsuccessful search for ore, and its forehead was not far from the southern end of the Glencoyne Level, though about [...] lower. The two levels were connected, the floor of the Glencoyne Level was regraded so water would run in, not out, and a small stream diverted into the mouth of the level. A dam was built across the High Horse Level, and pipes ran down to the hydraulic engines. The shaft was extended to the 48Fathom Level in 186566, though that level had been started in 1858 from a sump, sunk on the vein from the 36Fathom Level. Eventually, in 1880, the shaft was sunk a further [...] to connect with the Lucy Level.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000 Inco {{authorized}} US$48 million [...] {{to deepen}} the mine to 4100 ft, expanding production to 3,800 tons per day.

50|$|The Paulson Mine is {{a former}} iron ore mine located in Cook County, Minnesota, 53 {{kilometres}} north-west of Grand Marais, Minnesota {{near the end of}} the historic Gunflint Trail. The Port Arthur, Duluth and Western Railway was built to the mine in 1892 <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the <b>ore,</b> but both the mine and railway failed.|$|R
5|$|This growth would {{continue}} due to transportation {{improvements in the}} 1820s. Troy's businessmen had already built a turnpike to Schenectady, the path followed today by Route 2 from Troy to Colonie. These trade routes were enhanced by the Erie and Champlain canals, which opened new markets {{to the north and}} west, while the Troy Steamboat Company's debut did likewise for the south. The <b>access</b> <b>to</b> iron <b>ore</b> mines in the Adirondack Mountains also got some local businessmen into iron refining. In 1835 the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad brought that technology to the city, and in 1842 the completion of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad linked Troy to the vast network that reached as far west as Buffalo.|$|R
