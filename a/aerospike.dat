25|$|The launch {{from the}} {{submarine}} occurs below the sea surface. The missiles are ejected from their tubes by igniting an explosive charge {{in a separate}} container which is separated by seventeen titanium alloy pinnacles activated by a double alloy steam system. The energy from the blast is directed to a water tank, where the water is flash-vaporized to steam. The subsequent pressure spike {{is strong enough to}} eject the missile out of the tube and give it enough momentum to reach and clear the surface of the water. The missile is pressurized with nitrogen to prevent the intrusion of water into any internal spaces, which could damage the missile or add weight, destabilizing the missile. Should the missile fail to breach the surface of the water, there are several safety mechanisms that can either deactivate the missile before launch or guide the missile through an additional phase of launch. Inertial motion sensors are activated upon launch, and when the sensors detect downward acceleration after being blown out of the water, the first-stage motor ignites. The <b>aerospike,</b> a telescoping outward extension that halves aerodynamic drag, is then deployed, and the boost phase begins. When the third-stage motor fires, within two minutes of launch, the missile is traveling faster than 20,000ft/s (6,000m/s), or 13,600mph (21,600km/h).|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of <b>aerospikes</b> {{seem to be}} extra weight for the spike, and increased cooling requirements due to the extra heated area. Furthermore, the larger cooled area can reduce performance below theoretical levels by reducing the pressure against the nozzle. <b>Aerospikes</b> work relatively poorly between Mach 1-3, where the airflow around the vehicle has reduced the pressure, thus reducing the thrust.|$|R

40|$|Wave {{drag and}} shock induced {{boundary}} layer separation are important issues of flows around transonic wings. At transonic speeds the supersonic flow regime that is formed locally above wings, is terminated by a shock wave. This happens especially under offdesign flight conditions {{and results in}} a wave drag. In addition, the shock-boundary layer interaction can cause a separation of the boundary layer and can thus lead to further losses and, eventually, to buffeting. These phenomena limit the maximum economic cruise speed of airplanes. The negative effect of the transonic flow regime can be mitigated by controlling the shock terminating the supersonic region above the wing. In the past many different concepts based, for example, on passive ventilation (perforated plates, slots, grooves), active suction, contour bumps or adaptive walls have been persued [1 - 3]. Mostly, these control methods {{are based on a}} two-dimensional approach, i. e., control devices are applied unifomly along the whole span. More recently, also three-dimensional control devices have been shown to positively affect lift and drag [4 - 7]. All these approaches have in common that measures for controlling the shock are applied directly at the surface of the wing. However, a control of the shock wave is also possible by placing external devices above the surface of the wing into the supersonic flow regime. The latter concept that is related to the one of <b>aerospikes</b> on blunt bodies, is studied in the present paper. As in the case of flow control measures that are applied directly at the surface of a wing the basic idea of <b>aerospikes</b> is achieving the pressure rise across a system of oblique and normal shocks instead of across a single normal shock thus reducing wave losses. In the present investigation oblique shocks were produced by disturbing the supersonic flow above the wing. In a test series the effectiveness of a variety of different spikeshaped bodies placed above a transonic wing was tested in the DNW-TWG, G¨ottingen. In addition to pressure measurements a colour schlieren system was set up for providing information about the influence of spikes on the flow field.

However, a control of the shock wave is also possible by external devices placed above the surface of the wing in the supersonic flow regime. Experiments related to the latter concept that is related to the one of <b>aerospikes</b> on blunt bodies, will be presented in the present contribution. In a test series the effectiveness of a variety of different spike-shaped bodies placed above a transonic wing was tested in the transonic wind tunnel DNW-TWG, Göttingen. In addition to pressure measurements a colour schlieren system was set up for providing information about the influence of spikes on the flow field. The drag reduction mechanism of spike-shaped bodies that are placed in the supersonic flow above a transonic wing is based on the generation of wake flows and oblique shock waves interfering with the normal shock terminating the supersonic region. In this manner the pressure increases more gradually thus limiting losses. Since the spike is located above the surface of the wing the boundary layer on the wing is not directly disturbed. In the streamwise direction the exact position of the spike is of less importance than in the case of measures applied at the surface of the wing. The height at which the spike is arranged above the surface is chosen so that the shock is especially weakened in its lower part where the shock strength is greatest. Typical dimensions depend on the chord length and the Mach angle. Similarly, in order to weaken the shock over the whole span width several spikes are placed next to each other in spanwise direction. Bodies of various geometries that are acting as wake and shock inducing spikes, have been studied. Results are reported that were obtained with a cylindrical body having a needle-like tip, a punctured pipe that was open at its leading edge and a cone. A 400 mm-chord model of the transonic airfoil VC-opt was mounted in the 1 m x 1 m adaptive walls test section of the TWG. Initially, a single spike was placed on the suction side of the VC-Opt model, the tip of the spike being located about {{in the middle of the}} chord. A colour schlieren system was set up for observing the flow field. A comparison of colour schlieren pictures of the flow about a clean airfoil and the flow about an airfoil with a conical spike shows only little differences. This is due to the span width (1 m) being much greater than the size of the spike (diameter about 12 mm). However, a shock wave and Mach lines originating from the tip and the surface of the spike, respectively, can well be seen. Lift and drag were determined by pressure measurements. On the wing the static pressure was obtained via pressure taps that were arranged in a slightly diagonal manner thus avoiding interferences between the taps. The drag was calculated from total pressure data obtained by wake-rake measurements one and a half chord lengths behind the trailing edge. Initially, the rake was laterally displaced with respect to the spike by ten percent of the chord length. Tests were performed at a Reynolds number of Re ≈ 5 ⋅ 106 and at two Mach numbers, M = 0. 775 and M = 0. 795, respectively. Lift and drag polars were obtained for different configurations such as a clean airfoil and for an airfoil with shock inducing bodies. At certain angles of attack a gain in lift is observed and the drag is clearly reduced. This effect is most pronounced for a conical spike, i. e., for a body which produces a notable displacement in the flow. Hence, the concept of using <b>aerospikes</b> on transonic wings clearly shows a potential for reducing wave drag...|$|R

40|$|A {{body in a}} {{hypersonic}} flow field will experience very high heating especially during re-entry. Conventionally this problem is tackled to some extent {{by the use of}} large angle blunt cones. At the cost of increased drag, the heat transfer rate is lower over most parts of the blunt body, except in a region around the stagnation point. Thus even with blunt cones, management of heat transfer rates and drag on bodies at hypersonic speeds continues to be an interesting research area. Various thermal protection systems have been proposed in the past, like heat sink cooling, ablation cooling and <b>aerospikes.</b> The ablative cooling system becomes extremely costly when reusability is the major concern. Also the shape change due to ablation can lead to issues with the vehicle control. The <b>aerospikes</b> themselves may become hot and ablate at hypersonic speeds. Hence an alternate form of cooling system is necessary for {{hypersonic flow}}s, which is more feasible, cost effective and efficient than the conventional cooling systems. Injection of a mass of cold fluid into the boundary layer through the surface is one of the potential cooling techniques in the hypersonic flight corridors. These kinds of thermal protection systems are called mass transfer cooling systems. The injection of the mass may be through discrete slots or through a porous media. When the coolant is injected through a porous media over the entire surface, the coolant comes out as a continuous mass. Such a cooling system is also referred as “transpiration cooling system”. When the fluid is injected through discrete slots, the system is called as “film cooling system”. In either case, the coolant absorbs the incoming heat through its rise in enthalpy and thus modifies the boundary layer characteristics {{in such a way that}} the heat flow rate to the surface is less. Injection of a forward facing jet (opposite to the freestream direction) from the stagnation point of a blunt body can be used for mitigating both the aerodynamic drag and heat transfer rates at hypersonic Mach numbers. If the jet has enough momentum it can push the bow shock forward, resulting in reduced drag. This will also reduce heat transfer rate over most part of the body except around the jet re-attachment region. A reattachment shock impinging on the blunt body invariably increases the local heat flux. At lower momentum fluxes the forward facing jet cannot push the bow shock ahead of the blunt body and spreads easily over the boundary layer, resulting in reduced heat transfer rates. While the film cooling performance improves with mass flow rate of the jet, higher momentum flow rates can lead to a stronger reattachment leading to higher heat transfer rate at the reattachment zone. If we are able to reduce the momentum flux of the coolant for the same mass flow rate, the gas coming out can easily spread over the boundary layer and it is possible to improve the film cooling performance. In all the reported literature, the mass flow rate and the momentum flux are not varied independently. This means, if the mass flow rate is increased, there is a corresponding increase in the momentum flux. This is because the injection (from a particular orifice and for a particular coolant gas) is controlled only by the total pressure of injection and free stream conditions. The present investigation is mainly aimed at demonstrating the effect of reduction in momentum of the coolant (injected opposing a hypersonic freestream from the stagnation point of a blunt cone), keeping the mass flow rate the same, on the film cooling performance. This is achieved by splitting a single jet into a number of smaller jets of same injection area (for same injection total pressure and same free stream conditions). To the best of our knowledge there is no report on the use of forward facing micro-jet array for film cooling at hypersonic Mach numbers. In this backdrop the main objectives of the present study are: • To experimentally demonstrate the effect of splitting a single jet into an array of closely spaced smaller micro-jets of same effective area of injection (injected opposite to a hypersonic freestream from the stagnation zone), on the reduction in surface heat transfer rates on a large angle blunt cone. · Identifying various parameters that affect the flow phenomenon and doing a systematic investigation of the effect of the different parameters on the surface heat transfer rates and drag. Experimental investigations are carried out in the IISc hypersonic shock tunnel on the film cooling effectiveness. Coolant gas (nitrogen and helium) is injected opposing hypersonic freestream as a single jet (diameter 2 mm and 0. 9 mm), and as an array of iv micro jets (diameter 300 micron each) of same effective area (corresponding to the respective single jet). The coolant gas is injected from the stagnation zone of a blunt cone model (58 o apex angle and nose radius of 35 mm). Experiments are performed at a flow freestream Mach number of 5. 9 at 0 o angle of attack, with a stagnation enthalpy of 1. 84 MJ/Kg, with and without injections. The ratios of the jet stagnation pressure to the pitot pressure (stagnation pressure ratio) used in the present study are 1. 2 and 1. 45. Surface convective heat transfer measurements using platinum thin film sensors, time resolved schlieren flow visualization and aerodynamic drag measurements using accelerometer force balance are used as flow diagnostics in the present study. The theoretical stagnation point heat transfer rate without injection for the given freestream conditions for the test model is 79 W/cm 2 and the corresponding aerodynamic drag from Newtonian theory is 143 N. The measured drag value without injection (125 N) shows a reasonable match with theory. As the injection is from stagnation zone it is not possible to measure the surface heat transfer rates at the stagnation point. The sensors thus are placed from the nearest possible location from the stagnation point (from 16 mm from stagnation point on the surface). The sensors near the stagnation point measures a heat transfer rate of 65 W/cm 2 on an average without any injection. Some of the important conclusions from the study are: • Up to 40 % reduction in surface heat transfer rate has been measured near the stagnation point with the array of micro jets, nitrogen being the coolant, while the corresponding reduction was up to 30 % for helium injection. Considering the single jet injection, near the stagnation point there is either no reduction in heat transfer rate or a slight increase up to 10 %. · Far away from stagnation point the reduction in heat transfer with array of micro-jets is only slightly higher than corresponding single jet for the same pressure ratio. Thus the cooling performance of the array of closely spaced micro jets is better than the corresponding single jet almost over the entire surface. • The time resolved flow visualization studies show no major change in the shock standoff distance with the low momentum gas injection, indicating no major changes in other aerodynamic aspects such as drag. · The drag measurements also indicate that there is virtually no change in the overall aerodynamic drag with gas injection from the micro-orifice array. · The spreading of the jets injected from the closely spaced micro-orifice array over the surface is also seen in the visualization, indicating the absence of a region of strong reattachment. · The reduction in momentum flux of the injected mass due to the interaction between individual jets in the case of closely spaced micro-jet array appears to be the main reason for better performance when compared to a single jet. The thesis is organized in six chapters. The importance of film cooling at hypersonic speeds and the objectives of the investigation are concisely presented in Chapter 1. From the knowledge of the flow field with counter-flow injection obtained from the literature, the important variables governing the flow phenomena are organized as non-dimensional parameters using dimensional analysis in Chapter 2. The description of the shock tunnel facility, diagnostics and the test model used in the present study is given in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the results of drag measurements and flow visualization studies. The heat transfer measurements and the observed trends in heat transfer rates with and without coolant injection are then discussed in detail in Chapter 5. Based on the obtained results the possible physical picture of the flow field is discussed in Chapter 6, followed by the important conclusions of the investigation...|$|R
40|$|Shock wave {{boundary}} layer interactions (SWBLI) {{are a common}} phenomenon in transonic and supersonic flows. The presence of shock waves, induced by specific geometrical configurations, causes a rapid increase of the pressure, {{which can lead to}} flow separation. Examples of such interactions are found in amongst others rocket engine nozzles and on <b>aerospikes,</b> on re-entry vehicles, in supersonic and hypersonic engine intakes, and at the tips of compressor and turbine blades in jet engines. The interactions are important factors in vehicle development. Both the separated flow and the induced shock {{have been shown to be}} highly unsteady, causing pressure fluctuations and thermal loading. This generally leads to a degraded performance and possibly structural failure. The current work therefore aims to improve the physical understanding of the mechanisms that govern the interaction, with a special attention for the flow organisation and for the sources of the unsteadiness of the induced shock. In particular, the case of a reflecting incident shock is investigated, but the results find their application more generally in other configurations. Additionally, it is verified whether the interaction can be controlled by means of upstream fluid injection. To attain these aims, experiments were performed, comparing systematically several interactions for a range of shock intensities (producing incipiently separated and well separated flows) and under a number of flow conditions (Mach numbers of 1. 7 and 2. 3 and Reynolds numbers of 5, 000 (‘low’) and 50, 000 (‘high’)). This was done using the latest developments in the field of measurement techniques. A large amount of data was obtained for multiple interactions by means of a range of flow diagnostic techniques, yielding highly consistent results. A full field determination of the characteristic time scales by means of dual plane particle image velocimetry (Dual-PIV) has shown that the unsteadiness frequencies in the high Reynolds number incipient interaction span almost three orders of magnitude, demonstrating additionally the existence of low frequency dynamics of the reflected shock. The effect of control by means of air jet vortex generators (AJVGs) was thoroughly characterised, putting in evidence the generation of pairs of counter-rotating vortices of unequal strength that induce streaks of low and high speed fluid. These in their turn modify the separation bubble size without suppressing it. There is an inversely proportional relation between the reflected shock frequency and the bubble size. A scaling analysis was made, aimed at reconciling the observed discrepancies between interactions documented in literature. As part of this analysis, a separation criterion has been formulated that depends on the free-stream Mach number and the flow deflection angle only. In addition, a scaling approach has been derived for the interaction length based on the mass and momentum conservation. A conditional analysis has been performed based on the instantaneous separation bubble size. The generation and successive shedding of large coherent structures was found to be present also in absence of instantaneous flow separation. For the incipient cases, a link has been put into evidence between the separation region and the state of the upstream {{boundary layer}}. For the separated interactions, this link was absent and the shock unsteadiness seems to be mainly related to the separation bubble pulsation. The separation criterion in combination with the normalised interaction length represents a single trend line onto which all data for a large scope of documented interactions fall together with only a moderate scatter. This trend line predicts that the only way to effectively eliminate a separation bubble (without massive separation) by means of upstream control is by decreasing the displacement thickness of the incoming boundary layer. A scaling for the wall normal coordinate has been defined based on the interaction length with a correction for Mach number effects, producing a large resemblance in the geometric organisation of the mean and turbulent flow fields within the considered interactions. It can be concluded that multiple unsteadiness mechanisms are at work within the interaction, irrespective of the Mach number and the Reynolds number. It is proposed that the relative importance of the different mechanisms shifts with the imposed shock intensity. It seems that weak interactions without instantaneous flow separation should be governed by upstream effects only, with rather high shock frequencies. For incipient interactions, downstream effects start to occur; the region of high turbulence intensities displays mainly a lifting motion, producing a shock foot of varying strength and a shock unsteadiness that involves a time scales which can differ by at least one decade. Interactions with significant flow separation show mainly a translating motion, producing a low frequency unsteadiness and a shock foot of constant strength, which is in accordance with a free interaction behaviour. Concerning the Reynolds number and Mach number effects, it is concluded that for turbulent boundary layers, the onset of separation is Reynolds number independent. The interaction length is however governed by both the Reynolds number and the Mach number. Aerospace Design, Integration & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
