5|$|The family's {{problems}} are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only {{pair of shoes}} after taking them to be repaired. The children conduct a frantic search but find nothing; a karung guni man had claimed the shoes as unwanted rubbish. The Chew siblings <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> and rendered helpless by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share his shoes with his sister, trading off between classes so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised for wearing oversized shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.|$|E

25|$|In Dune, the Bene Gesserit {{breeding}} scheme is, in theory, to {{have come}} to full fruition from the union of an Atreides daughter (planned to be born of the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and the Duke Leto Atreides) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, nephew of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (himself secretly the natural father of the Lady Jessica). This plan is disrupted when Jessica chooses to conceive an Atreides son rather than the daughter she had been ordered to produce. This son, Paul Atreides, later proves to be the Kwisatz Haderach, born a generation early. Political intrigue results in Paul's rise to power as Emperor of the Known Universe, secured by his stranglehold on the melange supply. A decade later, in Dune Messiah, the Bene Gesserit <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> {{to be at the}} mercy of their own creation, but a conspiracy to remove Paul from power fails. He realizes, however, that while prescience grants knowledge, absolute control of outcomes is not possible due to interference patterns caused by their own actions. Despising the religion that has risen up around him and seeing where it will lead, Paul walks into the desert seeking death in hopes that he can change the course of the future. Paul's son Leto II is also a Kwisatz Haderach; seeing the same future, Leto decides to do what his father could not. He takes control of both the empire and the Bene Gesserit breeding program in Children of Dune, and begins his own transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid to give himself the time he needs for his Golden Path to be fully realized. Thirty-five hundred years later, his breeding plan produces Siona Atreides, the first in a line of humans who are able to disappear from prescient sight, and Leto allows himself to be assassinated. After 1,500 more years (as chronicled in Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune), the Bene Gesserit have restored their breeding program. However, they are too terrified of the consequences of producing another Kwisatz Haderach, so instead breed for special individuals of great talent and usefulness in order to amplify certain human characteristics and preserve them. Now aware of Leto's Golden Path, the Bene Gesserit widen their goals of advancing humanity and saving it from extinction.|$|E
500|$|Anderson's second {{published}} novel, The Last Man's Head, {{published in}} 1970, centres on the appropriately named detective, Alec Probyn, and his struggle {{to resolve a}} murder, of which he suspects his brother-in-law, Robbie Maciver, to be guilty. Probyn's efforts <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> by the complex structure of the dominant Maciver family, which seeks to deal with Robbie internally. Detective novel becomes a psychological thriller when a tormented Probyn kills Robbie. Like An Ordinary Lunacy, The Last Man's Head features a number of female characters who test {{the limits of their}} social roles, if not outright rebelling against them. [...] Although Macmillan Publishers in London immediately accepted the novel for publication, it was inappropriately typecast as a simple crime novel, a decision with which Anderson and critics disagreed.|$|E

Meredith Grey's best friend is Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh); Yang becomes jealous of the friendship between Meredith Grey and Harris. Having joined Seattle Grace Hospital as a surgical intern, Harris begins a friendship with fellow intern Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith Grey's sister.

500|$|Mr. Connors sneaks {{into the}} event and unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to destroy the wrestling ring with a rocket launcher, killing Kenny instead. He runs into the ring and chastises the crowd with an impassioned monologue about how professional wrestling has ruined real wrestling, and the downward spiral his life has taken since it cost him his job (as well as everything else). The crowd begins to sympathize with him, angrily chanting, [...] "They took his job!" [...] McMahon is impressed with the speech and decides to sign Mr. Connors to the WWE—much to his delight. The boys <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> at losing their latest shot at stardom and began brawling amongst themselves, blaming {{each other for the}} lost opportunity. They then start wrestling each other to the ground. Unimpressed by the genuine wrestling and real conflicted drama, the crowd deems it [...] "fake" [...] and begins to leave.|$|E
500|$|The Fabulous Baker Boys {{essentially}} {{tells the}} story of how Susie's induction into the eponymous musical duo changes the dynamic of both the act and the brothers' relationship with each other. As The Fabulous Baker Boys' business manager, Frank decides that they should hire a female singer to help revive their struggling, fifteen-year-old piano duo. 37 aspiring singers audition to become the group's third member, none of whom are promising candidates until Susie, a call girl previously employed by the Triple A Dating Service, arrives. Despite being {{an hour and a half}} late – by which time the brothers <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> – and dressed unprofessionally, Susie impresses them with her performance of [...] "More Than You Know"; Jack in particular, being more forgiving of the character's unprofessionalism than Frank, believes that the combination of Susie's voice and attractiveness could help bolster their career. Susie is also much less accommodating than the other candidates Frank and Jack interview.|$|E
500|$|Marge {{believes}} she has higher morals {{than most other}} characters, once leading a family values crusade against the violent The Itchy & Scratchy Show and being a prominent member of the [...] "Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene." [...] She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, {{but many of the}} townspeople <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> or contemptuous of her frequent failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms. Marge is {{the only member of the}} family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] (season four, 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him [...] "don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win.". Yet, in some episodes, Marge's stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with her daughter, Lisa, who is a feminist. For example, in [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] (season one, 1990) When she was waiting for Ms. Botz, the babysitter, Bart, Lisa and Maggie asked Marge for some grub, but she quickly refused and they ran away.|$|E

500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a {{nice day}} outside with the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Success {{or failure}} of {{democracy}} are interpreted as different equilibria of a dynamic political game. Democracy <b>is</b> <b>frustrated</b> and fails when voters do not replace corrupt leaders, given some transition cost of changing leadership, and any new leader {{would be likely to}} govern corruptly. Even when new politicians have a small probability of being virtuous, democracy can <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> in a unitary political system. But in a federal system, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> at both national and provincial levels, because provincial leaders who govern responsibly could build reputations to become contenders for higher national office. Similarly, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> in a democratization process that begins with decentralized provincial democracy and only later introduces nationally elected leadership...|$|R
50|$|Where a law {{subsequent}} to contracting is passed, which renders the fundamental principle of contracting illegal, the contract {{will be found}} to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> There <b>are</b> several situations in which this may occur.

If the law changes prohibit performance after the contract was made, the contract may <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> Changes in the law may render building work illegal, or the use of certain materials illegal. A contract for the construction of a reservoir was held to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> following wartime building regulations.|$|R

2500|$|The concept [...] "sanction of the victim" [...] {{is defined}} by Leonard Peikoff as [...] "the {{willingness}} of the good to suffer {{at the hands of}} the evil, to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the 'sin' of creating values". Accordingly, throughout Atlas Shrugged, numerous characters <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> by this sanction, as when Hank Rearden appears duty-bound to support his family, despite their hostility toward him; later, the principle is stated by Dan Conway: [...] "I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed. If it turned out to be me, I have no right to complain". John Galt further explains the principle: [...] "Evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us", and, [...] "I saw that evil was impotent... and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it".|$|E
2500|$|Chapter {{nineteen}} also {{describes how}} Abbot Eadred [...] purchased the vills of Monk Hesleden, Horden Hall, Yoden, Castle Eden, Hulam, Hutton Henry and [...] Twilingatun from King Guthred {{and made a}} gift of them to St Cuthbert. Following on from this, in chapter twenty Abbot Eadred and Bishop Eardulf travel with the body of St Cuthbert from Lindisfarne {{to the mouth of}} the river Derwent, where they attempt to sail to Ireland but <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> by a sea-storm created by the saint. Instead, they head to Crayke, and finally to Chester-le-Street where, after a seven-year journey, they settle. Newly settled in chapter twenty-one, Edward the Elder becomes king, and Cuthheard becomes bishop. Bishop Cuthheard buys Sedgefield and—excepting the lands held by Aculf, Æthelbriht and Frithlaf (over which the bishop has sake and soke)—all its dependent lands. The new bishop also buys Bedlington with its dependent lands between the rivers Wansbeck and Blyth. Meanwhile, Tilred abbot of Heversham gives half of Castle Eden to Cuthbert (and half to Norham in order to become abbot there) and Bernard the priest gives Twilingatun.|$|E

2500|$|Possible Irish antecedents to the Tristan legend have {{received}} much scholarly attention. An [...] ill-fated triantán an ghrá or love triangle features {{into a number}} of Irish works, most notably in the text called Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne or The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne. In the story, the aging Fionn mac Cumhaill takes the young princess, Gráinne, to be his wife. At the betrothal ceremony, however, she falls in love with Diarmuid, one of Fionn's most trusted warriors. Gráinne gives a sleeping potion to all present but him, eventually convincing him to elope with her. The fugitive lovers are then pursued all over Ireland by the Fianna. Another Irish analogue is Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin, preserved in the 14th century Yellow Book of Lecan. In this tale, Cano is an exiled Scottish king who accepts the hospitality of King Marcan of Ui Maile. His young wife, Credd, drugs all present, and then convinces Cano to be her lover. They try to keep a tryst while at Marcan's court, but <b>are</b> <b>frustrated</b> by courtiers. Eventually Credd kills herself and Cano dies of grief. In the Ulster Cycle there is the text Clann Uisnigh or Deirdre of the Sorrows in which Naoise mac Usnech falls for Deirdre, who was imprisoned by King Conchobar mac Nessa due to a prophecy that Ulster would plunge into civil war due to men fighting for her beauty. Conchobar had pledged to marry Deirdre himself in time to avert war, and takes his revenge on Clann Uisnigh. The death of Naoise and his kin leads many Ulstermen to defect to Connacht, including Conchobar's stepfather and trusted ally Fergus mac Róich, eventually precipitating the Táin Bó Cúailnge.|$|E
