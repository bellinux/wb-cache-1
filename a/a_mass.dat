This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with <b>a</b> <b>mass</b> of just 42kg/m2.|$|E

The Satanist would only employ the use of <b>a</b> Black <b>Mass</b> as <b>a</b> form of psychodrama. Furthermore, <b>a</b> Black <b>Mass</b> does not necessarily imply that the performers of such are Satanists. <b>A</b> Black <b>Mass</b> is essentially <b>a</b> parody on the religious service of the Roman Catholic Church, but can be loosely applied to a satire on any religious ceremony.
