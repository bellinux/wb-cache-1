[...] These are based on high productivity, quality of the bean, consumer acceptability and resistance to pests and diseases. Soil requirements include good soil structure, which is deep and well-drained, but with sufficient water-holding capacity. Clay loam soil with an aggregate of sand, silt and clay work best due to its large pore spaces which [...] "promote <b>aeration,</b> <b>drainage,</b> and moisture retention". Organic matter in the surface layer or soil {{is also important to}} cacao growth so the soil must be well-shaded to preserve the organic layer. [...] Ideal rainfall and climate on the other hand is between 1,250 to 3,000 mm per annum, 1,500 to 2,000 mm in the dry season of not more than 3 months, and a temperature from 18 degrees to 32 degrees Celsius. This suitable temperature can be found in altitudes up to 700 meters or in areas between 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level. Because Cacao prefers a moisture-laden atmosphere, a climate of evenly distributed rainfall and few winds are ideal.|$|E
30|$|Vermicomposts (VC) are finely divided, peat-like {{materials}} with high porosity, <b>aeration,</b> <b>drainage,</b> water-holding capacity, and microbial activity (Edwards 2004; Pandya et al. 2014).

A wide range of organic residues, including sewage sludge, animal wastes, crop residues, and industrial refuse are increasingly being converted by earthworms to form VC (Edwards 2004; Roberts et al. 2007; Pascal et al. 2010). The earthworms breakdown the organic residues, which stimulate greater microbial activity, increase nutrient mineralization rates, and rapidly convert the wastes into a humus-like substance that has a finer structure than ordinary composts while possessing greater and more diverse microbial populations (Atiyeh et al. 2000; Yadav and Garg 2011).|$|E

30|$|Growing {{media or}} {{components}} for potting soil mixes have gained popularity {{for several decades}} and have been successfully used in the cut flower industry with aim to intensify the commercial production (Maloupa et al. 1992). An ideal growing mix used to produce greenhouse floricultural crops should have four basic functions, deliver aeration and water, provide suitable anchorage for maximum root growth, physically support the plant and create a reservoir of adequate nutrient uptake (Tariq et al. 2012). Now various organic ingredients like peat moss, green compost, animal manures, coco peat and inorganic/mineral potting substrates such as sand, gravel, perlite and silt are being utilized for domestic and commercial purposes. Several studies advocated that {{it is much easier}} to handle soilless growing media and it is also good for growth and development of plants as compared to soil environment (Yasmeen et al. 2012).

30|$|Soil {{fertility}} {{depends on}} physical, {{chemical and biological}} soil attributes. Vermicompost is a nutrient rich, microbiologically active organic amendment which results from the interactions between earthworms and microorganisms in the breakdown of organic matter (Lazcano and Dominguez 2010). In fact, vermicomposts are finely divided peat-like materials with high porosity, <b>aeration,</b> <b>drainage,</b> water holding capacity and large surface area, providing strong capacity to hold and retain plant available nutrients such as nitrates, exchangeable phosphorus, soluble potassium, calcium, magnesium etc. (Edwards and Burrows 1988; Orozco et al. 1996; Chaudhuri et al. 2000). Compared to their parent materials, vermicomposts have less soluble salts, greater cation exchange capacity, increased total humic acid, available nutrients and biologically active substances such as plant growth regulators (Kale 2014). Based on physical, chemical and biological characteristics, vermicomposts have considerable potential for growing vegetables, fruit bedding plants, green house crops, etc. (Edwards et al. 2011). Interestingly, presence of certain plant hormones such as indole acetic acid adsorbed into the low-weight humic substances extracted from earthworm feces have recently been reported by Canellas et al.

40|$|Soils {{in urban}} areas have not {{received}} adequate attention in relation to landscape planting. Recent urban tree surveys in Hong Kong identified many arboricultural problems related to stressful habitat conditions including edaphic ones. Soil constraints in the crowded city are acute and yet relevant data are lacking. This project evaluated {{in the field and}} laboratory 100 soil samples obtained from sites of varied natural and disturbance history at difficult roadside tree-pit sites in urban Hong Kong. An extensive range of physical and chemical properties were assessed to establish baseline information on soil limitations to amenity-vegetation growth. Most soils have lost natural soil horizons with morphological features of fill materials such as poor structure and artificial layering. They are excessively stony and coarse-textured, with abundance of building rubble and other foreign substances. The extensive soil compaction, associated with structural degradation and loss of porosity, is inimical to <b>aeration,</b> <b>drainage,</b> storage of plant-available moisture, and root growth. Release of carbonate from the calcareous construction waste has induced alkaline pH, with consequences on micronutrient and phosphorus deficiency. Organic matter contents, and the related supply of essential nitrogen and phosphorus, are all meager. The capacity to hold nutrient bases and the amount held in available forms are both inadequate for vigorous plant performance. There are signs of pollution by heavy metals, especially lead, which are derived from air-borne sources related to vehicular traffic. The results help to ascertain the need for soil tests in landscaping endeavors, to reinforce a weak link in landscaping programs, to establish a package of recommendations to improve urban soil management, to enhance the cost-effectiveness of greening programs, and to augment urban-tree performance so as to reduce recurrent management liability and burden. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|There is {{a growing}} concern to {{decrease}} the application of chemical fertilizer to soils using soil nutrients more efficiently and by more application of organic matter. Excessive applications of agro-chemicals in crops have adversely affected the soil flora, fauna and enzymes which help to maintain the natural fertility of soil. Higher usage of fertilizers and pesticides has also desired more irrigation causing additional stress on water sources (Yadav and Garg 2011). Ground water pollution due to leaching of agrochemical is other ill-effects on environment. Organic fraction of solid wastes contains significant quantities of plant nutrients. But these wastes cannot be directly applied to the agricultural fields since these can destroy the natural fertility of the soil and may lead to phytotoxicity. The availability of nutrients to plants from organic manure is closely related to its maturity. Matured organic manure is well balanced in nutrients (NPK) with low C:N and C:P ratio, which indicates slow rate of nutrients release. While in case of unstabilized and fresh organic waste materials, higher nutrient release rates may limit the microbial growth which may retard or even stop decomposition and mineralization of wastes (Senesi 1989). So prior to land application of the solid wastes their biostabilization is essential. Among various methods of organic matter, vermicomposting is known to produce highly stabilized and non-thermophilic product, which has a great potential as soil amendment (Arancon et al. 2003 a, b). Vermicompost is finely divided peat-like material with high porosity, <b>aeration,</b> <b>drainage</b> and water-holding capacity (Edwards and Burrows 1988). It contains nutrients in such forms that are readily available to the plants, such as nitrates, exchangeable phosphorus, soluble potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc. (Edwards and Burrows 1988; Orozco et al. 1996). Tomati et al. (1990) reported that vermicomposts contain biologically active substances such as plant growth regulators, and have great potential in maintaining the soil fertility. If vermicomposts are integrated in nutrient management in agricultural fields, the costs of crop production may be reduced significantly (Sangwan et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Land use {{changes in}} the Amazon region {{strongly}} impact soil macroinvertebrate communities, which are recognized as major drivers of soil functions (Lavelle et aL, 2006). To explore these relations, we tested the hypotheses that (i) soil macrofauna communities respond to landscape changes and (ii) soil macrofauna and ecosystem services are linked. We conducted a survey of macrofauna communities and indicators of ecosystem services at 270 sites in southern Colombia (department of Caqueta) and northern Brazil (state of Para), two areas of the Amazon where family agriculture dominates. Sites represented a variety of land use types: forests, fallows, annual or perennial crops, and pastures. At each site we assessed soil macroinvertebrate density (18 taxonomic units) and the following ecosystem service indicators: soil and aboveground biomass carbon stock; water infiltration rate; <b>aeration,</b> <b>drainage</b> and water storage capacities based on pore-size distribution; soil chemical fertility; and soil aggregation. Significant covariation was observed between macrofauna communities and landscape metric data (co-inertia analysis: RV = 0. 30, p < 0. 01, Monte Carlo test) and between macrofauna communities and ecosystem service indicators (co-inertia analysis: RV= 0. 35, p< 0. 01, Monte Carlo test). Points located in pastures within 100 m of forest had greater macrofauna density and diversity than those located in pastures with no forest within 100 m (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p< 0. 01). Total macroinvertebrate density was significantly correlated with macroporosity (r(2) = 0. 42, p< 0. 01), as was the density of specific taxonomic groups: Chilopoda (r(2) = 0. 43, p < 0. 01), Isoptera (r(2) = 0. 30, p< 0. 01), Diplopoda (r(2) = 0. 31, p < 0. 01), and Formicidae (r(2) = 0. 13, p< 0. 01). Total macroinvertebrate density was also significantly correlated with available soil water (r(2) = 0. 38, p< 0. 01) {{as well as other}} soil-service indicators (but with r(2) < 0. 10).

30|$|Vermicomposting is {{the process}} of {{producing}} compost by utilizing earthworms to turn the organic waste into high-quality compost that consists mainly of worm cast in addition to decayed organic matter (Ismail 2005; Devi and Prakash 2015). Vermicomposting helps to convert the organic wastes (agro-wastes, animal manure and domestic refuse) into highly nutrient fertilizers for plant and soil (Gajalakshmi and Abassi 2004). Vermicompost is a finely divided peat-like material with excellent structure, porosity, <b>aeration,</b> <b>drainage</b> and moisture-holding capacity (Ismail 2005; Edwards et al. 2011). Vermicompost, an organic fertilizer rich in NPK, micronutrients and beneficial soil microbes (nitrogen fixing and phosphate solubilizing bacteria and actinomycetes), is a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers, which is an excellent growth promoter and protector for crop plants (Sinha et al. 2011; Chauhan and Singh 2015). Today vermicompost is an important component of organic farming systems, because it is easy to prepare, has excellent properties and is harmless to plants. Vermicompost improves the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil as well contributes to organic enrichment (Ansari and Jaikishun 2011; Chauhan and Singh 2013). In 1996 the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries (LVV) in Suriname made an attempt to investigate vermicomposting, but did not achieve significant results (Nanden and Dipotaroeno 1996). Since then, no research has been conducted in this area in Suriname. Investigations on vermicomposting and its impact on vegetable production are necessary, especially as it {{can be used as a}} bio-fertilizer. Research on vermicomposting will provide farmers with an environment-friendly fertilizer and assist in promoting the agriculture sector towards a greener future. The use of such technology will help in cost management in agriculture which is increased in the recent years and has added to the burden of farmers in terms of chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides. Consequently, the cost of production has increased many folds. Use of organic source of fertilizers like vermicompost could be an effective solution to the problem where it could substitute the chemical inputs in crop productivity and reduce the economic cost and on the other hand may also lead to organic produce which fetches higher price in the market. The increase in living standards around the world has created a growing demand for such organic produce, or cultivation using only natural pesticides and fertilizers, which are perceived to be healthier for consumers and environment friendly (Kaplan 2016).|$|E
30|$|Vermicomposting is a non-thermophilic {{biological}} oxidation {{process in which}} organic material are converted into vermicompost which is a peat like material, exhibiting high porosity, <b>aeration,</b> <b>drainage,</b> water holding capacity and rich microbial activities (Edwards 1998; Atiyeh et al. 2000 b; Arancon et al. 2004 a), through the interactions between earthworms and associated microbes. Vermiculture is a cost-effective tool for environmentally sound waste management (Banu et al. 2001; Asha et al. 2008). Earthworms are the crucial drivers of the process, as they aerate, condition and fragment the substrate and thereby drastically alter the microbial activity and their biodegradation potential (Fracchia et al. 2006; Lazcano et al. 2008). Several enzymes, intestinal mucus and antibiotics in earthworm’s intestinal tract {{play an important role}} in the breakdown of organic macromolecules. Biodegradable organic wastes such as crop residues, municipal, hospital and industrial wastes pose major problems in disposal and treatment. Release of unprocessed animal manures into agricultural fields contaminates ground water causing public health risk. Vermicomposting is the best alternative to conventional composting and differs from it in several ways (Gandhi et al. 1997). Vermicomposting hastens the decomposition process by 2 – 5 times, thereby quickens the conversion of wastes into valuable biofertilizer and produces much more homogenous materials compared to thermophilic composting (Bhatnagar and Palta 1996; Atiyeh et al. 2000 a). Distinct differences exist between the microbial communities found in vermicomposts and composts and hence the nature of the microbial processes is quite different in vermicomposting and composting (Subler et al. 1998). The active phase of composting is the thermophilic stage characterized by thermophilic bacterial community where intensive decomposition takes place followed by a mesophilic maturation phase (Lazcano et al. 2008; Vivas et al. 2009). Vermicomposting is a mesophilic process characterized by mesophilic bacteria and fungi (Benitez et al. 1999). Vermicomposting comprises of an active stage during which earthworms and associated microbes jointly process the substrate and the maturation phase that involves the action of associated microbes and occurs once the worm’s moves to the fresher layers of undigested waste or when the product is removed from the vermireacter. The duration of the active phase depends on the species and density of the earthworms involved (Ndegwa et al. 2000; Lazcano et al. 2008; Aira et al. 2011). A wide range of oganic wastes viz., horticultural residues from processed potatoes (Edwards 1988); mushroom wastes (Edwards 1988; Tajbakhsh et al. 2008); horse wastes (Hartenstein et al. 1979; Edwards et al. 1998); pig wastes (Chan and Griffiths 1988; Reeh 1992); brewery wastes (Butt 1993); sericulture wastes (Gunathilagraj and Ravignanam 1996); municipal sewage sludge (Mitchell et al. 1980; Dominguez et al. 2000); agricultural residues (Bansal and Kapoor 2000); weeds (Gajalakshmi et al. 2001); cattle dung (Gunadi et al. 2002); industrial refuse such as paper wastes (Butt 1993; Elvira et al. 1995; Gajalakshmi et al. 2002); sludge from paper mills and dairy plants (Elvira et al. 1997; Banu et al. 2001); domestic kitchen wastes (Sinha et al. 2002); urban residues and animal wastes (Edwards et al. 1985; Edwards 1988) can be vermicomposted (Sharma et al. 2005).|$|E

Vegetative and tuber growth {{and production of}} the plants grown in the clay and the clay loam soil were significantly restricted and therefore {{they have to be}} avoided. On the contrary, well drained light sandy soils seem ideal for marama growth and establishment. This study revealed the beneficial effect of good <b>aeration</b> and <b>drainage</b> on growth and dry matter production of marama. The careful selection of such a soil texture is crucial for a sufficient tuber growth and further establishment of T. esculentum, in order to ensure plant survival under extensive drought conditions, as long as the tubers clearly act as water reservoirs (tuber water content about 85 - 90 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Swamp {{and forest}} {{vegetation}} on the Delegate River near Bendoc, at about 900 m {{above sea level}} in the highlands of eastern Victoria, was analysed by two different computer strategies-one agglomerative polythetic (MULTBET) and the other divisive monothetic (DIVINF). Classification of the species with respect to sites by DIVINF (inverse) produced 10 meaningful species groups and a residue of relatively rare species. MULTBET (normal) produced the more satisfactory classification of swamp and forest sites with respect to species, enabling 10 communities to be recognized: these are mapped and described. In general, the communities are characterized {{by a number of}} species groups and some groups are confined to particular parts of the study area. The main environmental features affecting the distribution of communities appear to be altitude above the valley floor and aspect for the forest and, for the swamp, <b>aeration</b> and <b>drainage</b> of the soil, flooding (degree and duration) and low temperature...|$|R
