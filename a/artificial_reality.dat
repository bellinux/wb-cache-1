The persons I have mentioned have not that vagueness of identity which is the misfortune of historical characters; they are real, supremely real, thanks to their affiliation to the great Balzac, who had invented an <b>artificial</b> <b>reality</b> which was as much better than the vulgar article as mock-turtle soup is than the liquid it emulates. The first time I read [...] "Les Illusions Perdues" [...] I should have refused to believe that I was capable of passing the old capital of Anjou without alighting to visit the Houmeau. But we never know what we are capable of till we are tested, as I reflected when I found myself looking back at Angoulême from the window of the train just after we had emerged from the long tunnel that passes under the town. This tunnel perforates the hill on which, like Poitiers, Angoulême rears itself, and which gives it an elevation still greater than that of Poitiers. You may have a tolerable look at the cathedral without leaving the railway carriage, for it stands just above the tunnel and is exposed, much foreshortened, to the spectator below. There is evidently a charming walk round the plateau of the town commanding those pretty views of which Balzac gives an account. But the train whirled me away, and these are my only impressions. The truth is that I had no need, just at that moment, of putting myself into communication with Balzac, for opposite to me in the compartment were a couple of figures almost as vivid as the actors in the [...] "Comédie Humaine." [...] One of these was a very genial and dirty old priest, and the other was a reserved and concentrated young monk--the latter (by which I mean a monk of any kind) being a rare sight to-day in France. This young man indeed was mitigatedly monastic. He had a big brown frock and cowl, but he had also a shirt and a pair of shoes; he had, instead of a hempen scourge round his waist, a stout leather thong, and he carried with him a very profane little valise. He also read, from beginning to end, the Figaro which the old priest, who had done the same, presented to him; and he looked altogether as if, had he not been a monk, he would have made a distinguished officer of engineers.|$|E

When he was not reading the [...] "Figaro" [...] he was conning his breviary or answering, with rapid precision and with a deferential but dis- couraging dryness, the frequent questions of his com- panion, who was of quite another type. This worthy had a bored, good-natured, unbuttoned, expansive look; was talkative, restless, almost disreputably human. He was surrounded by a great deal of small luggage, and had scattered over the carriage his books, his papers, the fragments of his lunch, and the contents of an extraordinary bag, which he kept beside him - a kind of secular reliquary - and which appeared to contain the odds and ends of a lifetime, as he took from it successively a pair of slippers, an old padlock (which evidently didn't belong to it), an opera-glass, a collection of almanacs, and a large sea-shell, which he very carefully examined. I think that if he had not been afraid of the young monk, who was so much more serious than he, he would have held the shell to his ear, like a child. Indeed, he was a very childish and delightful old priest, and his companion evidently thought him most frivolous. But I liked him the better of the two. He was not a country cure, but an eccle- siastic of some rank, who had seen a good deal both of the church and of the world; and if I too had not been afraid of his colleague, who read the [...] "Figaro" [...] as seriously as if it had been an encyclical, I should have entered into conversation with him.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1970s, Myron Krueger {{established}} an <b>artificial</b> <b>reality</b> laboratory called the Videoplace.

The work done in the lab would form the basis of his much cited 1983 book <b>Artificial</b> <b>Reality.</b> The Videoplace (or VIDEOPLACE as Krueger would have it), was the culmination of several iterations of <b>artificial</b> <b>reality</b> systems: GLOWFLOW, METAPLAY, and PSYCHIC SPACE; each offering improvements over the previous installation until VIDEOPLACE was a full blown <b>artificial</b> <b>reality</b> lab at the University of Connecticut.|$|E

30|$|The chiliastic thought (compare [12, pp 157 – 167] in its {{original}} form in early Christianity, {{in the middle ages}} and in the early modern period presupposes the anthropological premise that the evolutionary impulse for self-preservation is “sublimated” by a socio-cultural context, which appears to be only marginally impregnated by scientific-technological structures. Analogously, the creation is directly related to a spiritual transcendence. The stabilisation of man {{is a result of the}} conviction that man is redeemed from his sins and the doors of God’s kingdom are open to him. In this respect, the chiliastic practice rejects, in some of its variants, state laws as well as the institutions of private property and family. Presupposing a certain distance from the scientific-technological civilisation, chiliasm exists not only in monotheist religions, but also in the nature deities of the Indians, like those of the Guarini in the primeval forests of Brazil. In the chiliastic thought, the evolutionary impulse is also modified by the <b>artificial</b> <b>realities</b> of the second nature of man. But this is hardly characterised by the dynamics of the scientific-technological development.|$|R
40|$|Among the {{philosophers}} who undertook {{the task of}} thinking about the status of culture and the key advents of the twentieth century, the Czech-Brazilian Vilém Flusser deserves prominent recognition. A multifaceted thinker, Flusser produced sophisticated theories about a reality in which man advances towards the game, endorsed by the emergence of a kind of technical device that is dedicated, mainly, to the calculation of possibilities and to the projection of these possibilities on reality, generating a veil that conceals the natural reality and creates layers of cultural and <b>artificial</b> <b>realities.</b> This technical device, designated by Flusser as “apparatus”, being the index of a civilisatory stage where societies are characterised {{by the fact that they}} are programmed from discourses that point to a highly abstract shared language exposed through “technical images” which, just like Indian screens, are calculated and projected on the natural reality of the world, hiding and recreating it. This text explores the convergence between the main principles exposed by Flusser and that of the field which studies the theories concerned with video games, including the concept of gamification...|$|R
