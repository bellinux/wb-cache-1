Herd size ranged from 82 to 43 9 head. Of the 1501 heifers, 86. 1 % were detected in estrus. First service conception rates of those 1292 heifers averaged 58. 4 % (40. 3 to 68. 8 %). In three herds, ultrasonography was used to diagnose 525 heifers as pregnant at 30 days after AI. At 60 to 90 days after the breeding season, palpation of the uterus confirmed that embryonic death had occurred in 4. 2 % (4. 0 to 4. 8 %). First service conception rates varied widely among ranches.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the factors that affect the success of artificial insemination (A. I) services under field conditions. The data from a total of 459 inseminations were analyzed. The effects of farm, animal, semen/bull and <b>A.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>technician</b> on conception rate were studied. Milk progesterone concentration was used as an indicator of conception. Milk samples were collected from animals at day 0, 11 and 22 post-insemination and analysed for progesterone (P 4) concentrations using radioimmunoassay (RIA) kits. Results indicated that the overall conception rate through A. I. under field condition was 29 %. Among the farm-related factors, only region had a significant effect on conception rate (P 0. 05). Animals inseminated within 24 hours after the onset of estrus had a higher, though statistically insignificant, conception rate than those inseminated after 24 hours. Among the animal-related factors, species, milk production, body condition score (BCS), lactation state, heat signs and uterine tone had a significant effect on conception rate. The conception rate in buffaloes was higher than in cattle (P< 0. 05). Animals with the higher BCS had a better conception rate than those having lower condition. Conception rate in the milking animals was more than the dry ones (P< 0. 05). Animals showing the passage of mucus from external genitalia (P< 0. 05) and marked uterine tone (P< 0. 01) showed better conception rate. Among the semen/bull related factors, bull breed, semen type, quality and source had a marked effect on conception rate. The conception rate was higher with the semen of cross bred and buffalo bulls (P< 0. 05). The conception rate with liquid semen was high and low with frozen semen (P< 0. 01). Good quality semen yielded higher conception rate than poor quality semen (P< 0. 01). The conception rate varied significantly due to <b>A.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>technician</b> (P< 0. 01). In conclusion, there is a tremendous scope to improve the existing A. I. technology in field through improved management of both animal and farm, supply of high quality frozen semen and enhancement in insemination skill of A. I. technicians...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe sweetpotato weevil, Cylas formicarius (F.) (Coleoptera: Brentidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of sweet potatoes in the world. With free trade between the United States and the U. S. -controlled Mariana Islands, C. formicarius has spread along with this commodity. Because of the cryptic nature of the larvae and nocturnal activity of the adults, and the cancellation of long-residual pesticides, this pest has become increasingly difficult to control. Therefore, the present study sought to explore and to compare the effectiveness of Metarhizium brunneum F 52 (90 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), Beauveria bassiana GHA (40 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), spinosad (90 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), azadirachtin (1484 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+M. brunneum (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+azadirachtin (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 742 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+spinosad (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), M. brunneum+azadirachtin (45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 742 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) and M. brunneum+spinosad (45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 grams <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) in controlling this pest in both the laboratory and the field.

40|$|A {{bioassay}} {{technique was}} developed to test the efficacy of insecticides against potato moth (Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller)) on tomatoes. The technique tested efficacy against both larvae in mines and neonate larvae {{that had not yet}} penetrated the leaf, and explained the failure of some insecticides to control P. operculella infestations in commercial tomato crops. Neonate larvae placed on leaves of potted plants several days before treatment provided larvae for testing of insecticides against larvae in mines; other neonates were placed on leaves after treatment to test efficacy against larvae yet to penetrate the leaf. The plants were sprayed with the candidate insecticides, held for 5 - 7 days, and larval mortality assessed. Chlorfenapyr (100, 200 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> ha- 1) and abamectin (8. 1 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae and larvae in mines.

The treatments in the experiment 3, in the first and second application were respectively: 1) control; 2) thiodicarb and triflumurom (240 and 28. 8 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin and lufenuron (7. 5 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) alphacypermethrin and teflubenzuron (15 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) metomil and novaluron (151 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron (12. 7 + 12. 7 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 7) profenofos + lufenuron (150 + 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1). The chemical groups Benzoylureas and Carbamates are more used in region, acting respectively, 34 and 31 % in the harvest 2004 / 2005 and 30 and 46 % in the harvest 2005 / 2006. In the results of the experiments with insecticides, it was observed that the use of Benzoylureas (triflumuron and lufenuron) presents efficiency only starting from the seventh day after the application. The Carbamates (thiodicarb and metomil) present efficiency of 90 % in the third day after the application. The insecticides alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron and spinosad, in the tested dosages present efficiency of 80 and 84 % respectively in the third day after the application...|$|R
