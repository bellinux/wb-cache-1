5|$|Chapter 53 {{begins with}} Gangleri asking {{if any of}} the gods will survive, and if there will be {{anything}} left of the earth or the sky. High responds that the earth will appear once more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, untouched by Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir once owned. Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the church has been recently restored. It has some beautiful frescoes painted by Luca Giordano, Francisco Carreño, and Francisco Rizi. The frescoes represent some kings of Spain, Hungary, France, Germany, and Bohemia. They <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> looking at the paintings in the vault, which represent the life of Saint Anthony of Padua.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 57 glaciers {{have been}} {{identified}} within Westland National Park. These <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> among the Southern Alps. Both the Franz Josef and Fox glaciers extend below the tree line, reaching areas as low as 300 meters above sea level. Glaciation in the area has carved out several moraines. The last major glacial advance in this region happened approximately 17,000-20,000 years ago. Many glaciers in this area have not advanced or retreated recently, though {{there has been much}} thinning.|$|E

25|$|Future {{growth is}} {{hampered}} by the airport's location, which is constrained by the M8 motorway to the south, the town of Renfrew {{to the east and}} the River Clyde to the north. At present the areas of Drumchapel, Clydebank, Bearsden, Foxbar, Faifley and Linwood <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> directly underneath the approach paths into the airport, meaning that further increases in traffic may be politically sensitive. The airport is challenged by Edinburgh Airport, which now serves a wider range of European destinations, growing to overtake Glasgow as Scotland's busiest airport, although Glasgow retains the edge on transatlantic and long haul routes.|$|E
500|$|In the Poetic Edda poem Fjölsvinnsmál, the {{watchman}} Fjölsviðr {{presents a}} list of the maidens that attend the lady of the keep—Menglöð—that includes Eir, and states that they <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> on the hill Lyfjaberg (Old Norse [...] "hill of healing" [...] or [...] "healing mountain"). The exchange between the hero Svipdagr and Fjölsviðr mentioning Eir is as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Geoff Johns {{confirmed}} on his Twitter {{account that}} the film had ended principal photography on August 6, 2010 and entered post-production. In an interview with MTV News, director Martin Campbell {{was asked about the}} film's effects-heavy epic scale and commented [...] "It's daunting, just the process, (there are) something like 1,300 visual shots, it's mind-blowing, quite honestly". When asked about the constructs created from the power rings, Campbell stated [...] "One of the nice things is, we'll <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> down and say, 'Well, {{what are we going to}} do here?' Really, it's as much as your imagination can go to make the constructs". The studio also confirmed to MTV News {{that the film}} would have a 3-D release.|$|E
5000|$|The map {{collection}} The Lands of Ice and Fire also shows the north {{tip of a}} landmass named [...] "Ulthos" [...] {{to the south of}} Essos and east of Sothoryos. Asked whether this was another continent, Martin replied, [...] "Well, it's a large landmass. I am a little unclear on the formal definition of 'continent' as opposed to 'big island.' Also on the size of Ulthos, which after <b>all</b> <b>sits</b> {{at the edge of the}} known world. Terra incognita and all that." ...|$|R

500|$|Doherty {{said that}} she decided to work on more family-friendly films for [...] " [...] goddaughter and for [...] brother's seven kids", adding that: [...] " [...] get joy out of their {{watching}} something [...] brother approves of. They can <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> around {{and talk about it}} and call [...] afterward." [...] She found the role and the film to be [...] "lighter and fluffier" [...] compared with her earlier work. The actress connected with Silver through their shared dedication to their careers and their decisions to re-prioritize their lives. When approaching her character, Doherty felt that Silver's story arc was about [...] "honoring her grandfather and finding good friends, a sense of community and love"; she connected with this story line because of her close connections to her own family.|$|E
2500|$|The {{major river}} {{systems of the}} {{province}} include the St. Croix River, Saint John River, Kennebecasis River, Petitcodiac River, Magaguadavic River, Miramichi River, Nepisiguit River, and the Restigouche River. Although smaller, the Bouctouche River, Richibucto River and Kouchibouguac River are also important. The settlement patterns and the economy of New Brunswick are based more on the province's river systems than its seacoasts. [...] Because of this, New Brunswick's population centres {{tend to be less}} 'centralized' than in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. [...] Fredericton, Saint John, and Moncton <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> on rivers that have {{played a significant role in}} their economic history.|$|E
2500|$|This {{relation}} between Diff and PL requires choices, however, {{and is more}} naturally shown and understood by including both categories in a larger category, and then showing that the inclusion of PL is an equivalence: every smooth manifold and every PL manifold is a PDiff manifold. Thus, going from Diff to PDiff and PL to PDiff are natural – they are just inclusion. The map PL to PDiff, while not an equality – not every piecewise smooth function is piecewise linear – is an equivalence: one can go backwards by linearize pieces. Thus it can for some purposes be inverted, or considered an isomorphism, which gives a map [...] These categories <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> inside TOP, the category of topological manifold and continuous maps between them.|$|E

60|$|Such is the {{orthodox}} view. Soul, {{when it is}} allowed an existence at <b>all,</b> <b>sits</b> somewhat vaguely within the machine, never defined. If anything goes wrong with the machine, why, the soul is forgotten instantly. We summon the arch-mechanic of our day, the medicine-man. And a marvelous earnest fraud he is, doing his best. He is really wonderful as a mechanic of the human system. But the life within us fails more and more, while we marvelously tinker at the engines. Doctors are not to blame.|$|R

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of books (including both of Guralnick's books) on Presley contain details of his many romances and alleged affairs including many while {{he was married to}} Priscilla. It has also been reported that Presley [...] "adored to fondle and suck women's toes, and those in his entourage who were given the job of choosing companions for him would often be asked to check the girls' feet." [...] However, according to Alan Fortas, an all-Memphis football halfback who became a bodyguard and part of the Presley entourage, [...] "Elvis needed someone to baby more than he needed a sex partner. He craved the attention of someone who adored him without the threat of sexual pressure, much as a mother would." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Elvis befriended some of the young girls who used to cluster adoringly in his driveway, or outside the fence ... Some of the girls were as young as fourteen. Fortas said they were frequent houseguests who attended his concerts as part of 'Elvis's personal traveling show.' Out in the backyard, they romped with Elvis in the Doughboy pool and challenged him to watermelon-seed spitting contests. They also slipped into his bedroom ... for rambunctious pillow fights. Sometimes they would <b>all</b> <b>sit</b> cross-legged with him on the bed, flipping through his fan magazines or admiring his stuffed-animal collection. Often they would all lie down together and cuddle. But what went on was horseplay, not foreplay." [...] Therefore, Guralnick writes that for [...] "the more experienced girls it wasn't like with other Hollywood stars or even with other more sophisticated boys they knew." [...] Although they offered to do things for Presley, [...] "he wasn't really interested. What he liked to do was to lie in bed and watch television and eat and talk all night..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The celebrant and assistants {{follow the}} acolytes {{into the church}} wearing the biretta. Upon {{arriving}} in the sanctuary the acolytes place their candles on the lowest altar step, after which they are extinguished. [...] The celebrant and assistants kneel on the lowest step and recite the Aperi Domine silently, after which they go to their places and recite the Pater noster and Ave Maria silently. A curious practice which exists from ancient times is the intoning of the antiphons and psalms to the celebrant. The rubrics presuppose that the first assistant or cantors will intone all which the celebrant must sing by singing it to him first {{in a soft voice}} after which the celebrant sings it again aloud. The five antiphons and psalms are sung with the first assistant intoning the antiphons and the cantors intoning the psalms. During the singing of the psalms <b>all</b> <b>sit.</b> After the psalms, the acolytes relight their candles and carry them to each side of the lectern for the chapter. The assistants follow, standing facing each other in front of the lectern. The celebrant then sings the chapter, after which all return to their places. The first assistant intones the hymn to the celebrant, and all stand while the hymn is sung. The first assistant intones the Magnificat to the celebrant, who sings the first line aloud. The celebrant and the first two assistants go to altar, and the altar is then incensed as at Mass while the first two assistants hold the ends of the cope. [...] Other altars in the church may be incensed as well. The first assistant then incenses the celebrant, after which the thurifer incenses the others as at Mass. If there are commemorations, the acolytes and assistants again go to the lectern as described above for the chapter. The choir sings the antiphons, the cantors sing the versicles, and the celebrant sings the collects. After all commemorations, the celebrant sings Dominus vobiscum, the cantor sings Benedicamus Domino, and the celebrant sings Fidelium animae.... The Marian antiphon is said in the low voice. Especially in English-speaking countries, Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament often follows Solemn Vespers.|$|E
