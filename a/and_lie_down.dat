25|$|In 1972, Sullivan {{was working}} inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when another strike occurred. It set his hair on fire; {{he tried to}} smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death. For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would pull over <b>and</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> on the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E
500|$|... "Strange Ones" [...] and [...] "I'd Like To Know" [...] {{are both}} songs about the strange people on Cowley Road, Oxford. Mick Quinn tried to {{describe}} the concept: [...] "There's {{a few people who}} are just really out there. There's {{a lot of people around}} Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go <b>and</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> in Port Meadow, but I'm not really sure about them. I'm not really sure that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing." [...] Danny Goffey added, [...] "They're the sort of people who don't fit in anywhere, who don't link up with everyday life at all." ...|$|E
500|$|On 22 June, Marlborough's forces linked up with Baden's Imperial {{forces at}} Launsheim. A {{distance}} of [...] {{had been covered}} in five weeks. Thanks to a carefully planned time-table, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline – [...] "As we marched through the country of our Allies, commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers {{had nothing to do}} but pitch their tents, boil kettles <b>and</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> to rest." [...] In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at Dillingen on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen {{because of a lack of}} siege guns – he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.|$|E

500|$|Collectively, the/a crest. Long crest {{feathers}} {{are sometimes}} called quill feathers. Also defined herewith: recumbent crests and recursive crests. A type of [...] feather {{with a long}} [...] with [...] on either side, that often presents as a prominent tuft on the [...] and (or through) the neck and upper [...] Birds with crests include Victoria crowned pigeons, northern lapwings, macaroni penguins and others, but the most recognizable are cockatoos and cockatiels, which can raise or lower their crests at will {{and use them to}} communicate with fellow members of their species, or as a form of defence to frighten away other species that approach too closely, making the bird appear larger when the crest is suddenly and unexpectedly raised. In some species the position of the crest is a threat signal {{that can be used to}} predict behaviour. In Steller's jays, for example, a raised crest indicates a likelihood of attack, and a lowered crest indicates a likelihood of retreat. Crests can be recumbent or recursive, depending on the species. The recumbent crest, such as in white cockatoos, has feathers that are straight <b>and</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> essentially flat on the head until fanned out. The recursive crest, such as in sulphur-crested cockatoos and Major Mitchell's cockatoos, is noticeable even when its feathers are not fanned out because they curve upward at the tips even when lying flat, and when standing up, often bend slightly forward toward the front of the head. Some birds, like galahs and rose-breasted cockatoos, have modified crests that have both recumbent and recursive features.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall <b>and</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{difficult}} allegorical poem called The Transformed Metamorphosis (1600) is Tourneur's earliest extant work; an elegy on {{the death}} of Prince Henry, son of James I of England, is the latest (1613). Tourneur's other non-dramatic works include a prose pamphlet, Laugh <b>and</b> <b>Lie</b> <b>Down</b> (1605), some contributions to Sir Thomas Overbury's Book of Characters and an [...] on Sir Francis Vere. This poem conveys the poet's ideal conception of a perfect knight or happy warrior.|$|E

2500|$|The fire flaming up the {{interior}} {{was so bad that}} Thompson and Carter had to leave the lantern area at the top <b>and</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> on the [...] tower platform that ran around the outside of the lantern. Thompson's clothes were burning, and both he and Carter had been wounded by the Seminoles' rifle shots. The lighthouse lens and the glass panes of the lantern shattered from the heat. Sure {{that he was going to}} die and wanting a quick end, Thompson threw the gunpowder keg down the inside of the tower. The keg exploded, but did not topple the tower. It dampened the fire briefly, but the flames soon returned as fierce as ever before dying down. Thompson found that Carter had died from his wounds and the fire.|$|E
2500|$|Lamon {{took this}} so seriously that his friend Leonard Swett recounted {{that in the}} three months he stayed with Lamon in the Fall of 1864, he saw Lamon leave every night to go to the White House where he patrolled the grounds. Presidential {{secretary}} John Hay adds to this portrait of devotion by noting in his diary that one night he observed Lamon wrap himself up in his cloak <b>and</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> to sleep in front of Lincoln's bedroom door. [...] Lamon was not in Washington on the night of Lincoln's assassination, being on assignment in Richmond. [...] In his Recollections of Abraham Lincoln Lamon reveals that before he left for Richmond, he implored the president not to [...] "go out at night after [...] was gone, particularly to the theatre." [...] After the assassination, Lamon accompanied the funeral procession to Springfield, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{discussed}} {{instance of}} a pillow shot in any Ozu film—indeed, {{the most famous}} crux in the director's work—is the scene that takes place at an inn in Kyoto, in which a vase figures prominently. During the father and daughter's last trip together, after a day sightseeing [...] with Professor Onodera {{and his wife and}} daughter, they decide to go to sleep, <b>and</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> on their separate futons {{on the floor of the}} inn. Noriko talks about what a nice person Onodera's new wife is, and how embarrassed she feels for having called Onodera's remarriage [...] "filthy." [...] Shukichi assures her that she should not worry about it, because Onodera never took her words seriously. After Noriko confesses to her father that she found the thought of his own remarriage [...] "distasteful," [...] she looks over to discover that he is already asleep, or seems to be. She looks up towards the ceiling and appears to smile.|$|E

50|$|Certain {{behaviors}} such as eating, rumination, <b>and</b> <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> {{can be related to}} the health of the cow and cow comfort. These behaviors can also be related to the productivity of the cows. Likewise, stress, disease, and discomfort will have a negative effect on the productivity of the dairy cows. Therefore, it can be said that it is in the best interest of the farmer to increase eating, rumination, <b>and</b> <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> decrease stress, disease, and discomfort to achieve the maximum productivity possible. Also, estrous {{behaviors such}} as mounting can be a sign of cow comfort, since if a cow is lame, nutritionally deficient, or are housed in an over crowded barn, the performance of estrous behaviors will be altered.|$|R
