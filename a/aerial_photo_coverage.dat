Here, the authors investigated the spatial variations of green space among different land-use categories within the city of Shanghai at the city, inner-outer ring road, and district scales. Land-use patches were delineated from <b>aerial</b> <b>photos,</b> and green <b>coverage</b> was derived from advanced land observation satellite (ALOS) imagery. Green space composition and configuration were then calculated for each land-use polygon. New residential, old residential, villa residential, industrial, and institutional were the five dominant land-use types. At the city level, green space coverage and configuration varied significantly among different land-use types. Villa residential had the highest green space coverage (67. 63 %), followed by institutional (38. 81 %), new residential (27. 64 %), industrial (27. 54 %), and old residential (16. 79 %). At the inner-outer ring and district levels, green space variation was consistent with the spatially changed anthropogenic activities.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Areas of post 1970 and 1972 land use changes were identified solely from the Skylab imagery from comparisons with 1970 land use maps. Most land use changes identified involved transition from agriculture to single family residential land use. The second most prominent changes identified from the Skylab imagery were areas presently under construction. Post 1970 changes from Skylab {{were compared with}} the 1972 changes noted from the high altitude photographs. A good correlation existed between the change polygons mapped from Skylab and those mapped from the 1972 high altitude <b>aerial</b> <b>photos.</b> In addition, {{there were a number}} of instances where additional built-up land use not noted in the 1972 <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> as being developed were identified on the Skylab imagery. While these cases have not been documented by field observation, by correlating these areas with the appearance of similar land use areas whose identity has been determined, we can safely say that we have been able to map further occurrences of land use change beyond existing high altitude <b>photo</b> <b>coverage</b> from the Skylab imagery. It was concluded that Skylab data can be used to detect areas of land use change within an urban setting...|$|R
40|$|With rapid new {{technological}} development {{during the past}} 50 years, <b>aerial</b> <b>photos</b> have been increasingly and commonly used not only in geographic information systems but also in various spatially related applications. Many municipalities and government agencies have constructed <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> databases all over the world. Keeping these databases up to date {{is the most important}} part of making them effective so that <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> databases are expected to be updated as frequently as possible. However, in practice, some of them are barely updated because of high cost. In case of detecting where changes occur, <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> databases could be frequently and partially updated only in the changed areas. In this study, medium spatial resolution imagery is proposed to detect changes. Instead of using <b>aerial</b> <b>photos,</b> medium spatial resolution imagery could be a good alternative because of its wider coverage and lower price than <b>aerial</b> <b>photos.</b> Free accessible Landsat ETM+ and orthophotomaps are used for change detection. In order to compare with 15 m pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+, 1 m orthophotomaps are decomposed, segmented, and classified through wavelet transform and object-oriented classification. Although the detected changes are rough, the result shows that the method is quite costeffective and practical. Moreover, it could support decision making for updating <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> databases. 1.

40|$|Two {{exciting}} {{areas of}} research are highlighted in this summary of recent publications {{in the field of}} geochronology. These lie at opposite ends of the timescale that is normally of interest to geomorphologists, but both have a common interest since they make it possible to quantify rates of landscape evolution in ways which have been difficult, if not impossible, previously. The first area concerns the developments that have occurred in the use of cosmogenic isotopes, and particularly their use over periods from 104 to 107 years, while the second looks at two absolute dating techniques that are now available for quantifying geomorphological processes within the last 103 years. This is a time interval for which absolute dating control has proved problematic for many years, since it lies beyond the range of many historical data sources and <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> <b>coverage,</b> and beyond the limit of 210 Pb or 137 Cs measurements.

Technically, the requirement is to store raster arrays of multi-Terabyte sizes and to offer flexible, efficient support for extracting rectangular cutouts and performing raster operations such as zooming, overlaying, channel extraction, and derivation of value-added information like vegetation index. Usually such image servers today are implemented file based, because standard DBMSs currently do not give adequate query support for the functionality sketched above.

40|$|Landslide {{is one of}} {{the most}} costly and {{damaging}} natural hazards of the world, and has direct and indirect influence on a number of human activities. The term landslide includes a wide range of mass movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows. Aerial imagery is a very powerful tool for landslide monitoring because it offers a synoptic view of landslide that can be repeated at different time intervals. This study focuses on the application of landslide activity maps created by digital photogrammetric techniques for evaluating the mass movement hazard in selected areas of the Northern East Turkey: Rize and surrounding. The availability of multi-year <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> <b>coverage</b> helped to assess the morphological changes, which occurred in the last seven years. This information, integrated with historical data on slope instability and field checks, was used to produce landslide activity maps. The morphological changes have been revealed from aerial images that are belonging to 1996 and 2002 years. For the evaluation of the aerial images, stereo photogrammetric software by Z/I Imaging was used. From the images that are belonging to 1996 and 2002 years, digital terrain models and vector map, which are containing the landslides area, were determined by using mentioned software. The landslides have been occurred very wide areas in the study area at 2001 year. In this study, the parameters that landslides occurring have been determined and environmental impacts of the landslides have been fixed. In addition, threatening areas of landslides have been resolved with separately.

Historical {{sites on}} the Queensland Heritage Register can be searched online at: [URL] Indigenous {{sites on the}} Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Heritage Database or Register can be searched by lodging a search request form {{available}} at: [URL] • Artifacts. The Queensland Museum* is the State repository but lack of space is affecting its ability to fulfil this legislative requirement. The new Acts allow Indigenous owners to keep skeletal material and secret/sacred items, while all other material remains {{the property of the}} State. • Human skeletal material. Must be reported to the police in the first instance. • Climate. The Far North has a tropical wet/dry climate, hot and dry but comfortable from May to September and hot, dry but humid until December. Inland areas can experience extreme heat during the day in summer and extreme cold at night in winter. The southeast has cool, dry winters, and hot, wet summers,while autumn and spring are perfect. Queensland has Australia's most variable climate, so do not rely on the weather being consistent from one year to the next. • Access. Most of the State is accessible by road and air, or, in the Torres Strait and other island regions, boat and air. Rain can restrict access in the inland and the north owing to flooding or, especially in black soil areas, impassable boggy conditions. In the Torres Strait, rain can close grass airstrips (though most have been sealed recently) and bad weather (including wind) can stop boat and air travel altogether. Entry to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities requires permission from local Indigenous councils. Entry to private land requires the landowner's permission as well as permission from the traditional/customary owner if a different person. • Distance. Rural and especially remote areas are called "rural and remote" for good reason. Make sure you have tested communications and recovery gear and procedures, and adequate water and first-aid supplies, and ensure that you are trained in map-reading and first-aid, as well as 4 WD driving, recovery and basic repairs. • Maps. There are 1 : 250, 000 and 1 : 100, 000 topographic maps available for the whole state and maps at 1 : 50,(X) 0 and better for selected areas.

40|$|Progress {{has been}} made in {{defining}} the level of work that needs to be accomplished in the Hangman Watershed in order to restore a viable riparian system and hydrology. The end goal is to use wildlife habitat to protect streams and provide water for instream fish habitats. In order to define the most expedient means of attaining that goal an Instream Flow/Watershed Hydrology Study was initiated. The study is intended to be comprehensive {{in order to determine the}} potential of increasing base flow with Hangman Watershed Streams and predict available fish habitats for the range of flow level possibilities. The Study Plan and work for the first field season was contracted and the Plan and end of field season reports are included with this Annual Report. The initial draft of the wildlife portion of the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan was completed and presented to the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Authority Wildlife Committee. The Committee felt that the Basin Hydrology Study needed to be closer to completion before the bulk of wildlife monitoring should be implemented. The extent of the landscape that must be restored in order to facilitate the needed stream flows may not be large enough to affect the population levels of the Plan's target species. The main result of the Committee review of the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan however, was that since the Hangman Restoration Project is not a HU driven wildlife mitigation project than the Wildlife Committee does not have a role to play since their focus is wildlife HU crediting projects. Further work on the wildlife portion of the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan is suspended until the crediting issues surrounding the Hangman Restoration Project are settled. Certain aspects of the Plan, such as the land bird, amphibian, reptile and beaver monitoring can be implemented in the spring of the coming year because monitoring these species and groups needs to be accomplished regardless of crediting status and baseline data is needed for these. Data from the Hangman Creek Watershed from portions upstream and east of the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation were included in the Second Iteration of the Habitat Prioritization Plan. These data were gathered both by the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and Idaho's Department of Environmental Quality. The addition of this portion of the Watershed in the Prioritization Plan fills a gap that the lack of data left in the first draft of the Plan. The streams in these upper headwaters support remnant salmonid populations and are close enough to be integrated with the streams and trout populations on the Reservation. The addition of this area strengthens the base from which the Hangman Restoration Project can work to secure and expand resident fish populations. An extensive 2 -year search for historic photos of the upper portion of the Hangman Watershed was completed during this annual funding cycle. The disappointing result is that few photographs were acquired. One excellent panoramic view of the Upper Hangman Watershed from Tekoa Mountain was recovered and photos of this view were taken for comparison. The task of finding historic photos has been removed from future Scopes of Work, however search for photos will continue as part of the Project's public outreach. The notable exception to the lack of historic photos is the purchase, digitizing and GIS registry of 1947 <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> <b>coverage</b> of the entire Hangman Creek Watershed east of the Washington/Idaho State Boarder. In addition, 1933 <b>aerial</b> <b>photo</b> <b>coverage</b> of most of this same area is being registered to our GIS system. These 1933 photos were available to the Tribe prior to the initiation of this Project; however these photos are being registered partly as a result of requests made from this Project. The process of developing a map of potential vegetation types for the Hangman Watershed has benefited from establishment of an Interagency Agreement with the U. S. Geologic Survey to hire a Scientific Advisor. The Scientific Advisor has assisted with the design of a scheme to sample remnant native vegetation within and close to the Hangman Watershed and will assist in using the acquired data to develop and test a multivariate model that predicts potential vegetation for any given site within the Hangman Watershed. This information is essential in modeling the potential stream flows within the watershed and for identifying the appropriate vegetation types to manage for in any restoration project. In spite of the progress made during this last year, this Project was not able to accomplish the primary tasks of acquiring management rights to properties that offer the greatest potential to protect and restore the streams and fisheries within the Hangman Watershed. Appraisals, hazardous materials surveys, and cultural resource inventories were completed on 3 properties that have been identified as priority parcels to acquire and restore to their biotic potential...|$|E

Plate 1 contains 1 map and 2 structural cross-sections of areas within the map. The first structural cross-section is titled: Sierra Abandonada; the second is titled: Cierro La TurquesaTwo stratigraphic sections, spatially separated by normal faults, are recognized in outcrops of metasedimentary rocks in the San Felipe area. Outcrops of orthoquartzite, marble, meta-argillite, and interbedded sequences of pelitic schist and micaceous quartzite, are subdivided into eight field units, combined into a composite section at least 3, 800 meters thick. The thick clastic-carbonate sequence represents rapid deposition of blanket sands and sublittoral sheet sands in a shallow marine environment. Geochemical data and petrographic analysis indicate that the clastic rocks have graywacke, arkose, and quartz arenite protoliths, and the carbonate rocks were originally laminated, silty limestone and dolomite of possible algal origin. The composite section displays lithologic and stratigraphic similarities to terrigenous detrital sequences of Upper Precambrian (Late Proterozoic) and Lower Cambrian age in the Caborca region of central Sonora, Mexico. In particular, Unit G and units 0 through F exhibit affinities to the Proveedora Quartzite and Puerto Blanco Formation, respectively. The correlations indicate that the pre-batholithic rocks of San Felipe {{are part of the}} 100 initial miogeoclinal deposits of the Cordilleran geosyncline, and indicate at least 500 meters of originally southward-thickening strata between the two areas. Positioned 100 to 150 kilometers south of the recognized exposures of the Caborca terrane, the thickening trend implies a southward direction of transport for upper Precambrian to Lower Cambrian strata in northwestern Mexico. The orientation of this trend is approximately 1200 to the northwestward depositional direction of the geosyncline in the western United States, suggesting that the craton margin possessed a corner in southwesternmost United States or northwestern Mexico...|$|E

Three folded plates in pocketBibliography: leaves 83 - 91 The boundary between the western Jurassic to Cretaceous volcanic arc terrane and the eastern, pre-Cretaceous cratonally derived metasedimentary rocks (Peninsular Terrane), extends along the axis of the Peninsular Ranges. In the southern Sierra Calamajue (29 ?? 25 ' N lat.), where this boundary is exposed, detailed stratigraphic and structural analyses of lower greenschist grade rocks indicate that the western and eastern terranes are structurally interleaved in a 5 - to 7 - km-wide zone. Five northwest-trending tectonostratigraphic units are mapped in this area. The structurally lowest (southwesternmost) unit consists of 1300 m of Late Mississippian chert and fine-grained clastic rocks, and minor limestone. These rocks are structurally(?) overlain by 2600 m of Upper Jurassic basaltic to andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks and Lower Cretaceous (Alisitos Group) volcaniclastic and epiclastic rocks. Quartz sandstones in {{the upper part of}} the Jurassic sequence appear to be redeposited in the overlying Alisitos Group suggesting a depositional contact between these rocks. Two of the three structurally highest units consist of variably tectonized limestone and fine- to medium-grained clastic rocks of unknown (Cretaceous?) age. These units are in sharp fault contact with, and are separated by, Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic and pyroclastic rocks. Three phases of deformation have been identified in these rocks. The oldest deformation, D 1, produced steeply east-dipping reverse faults (which separate the rock units), tight to isoclinal folds, and an associated, northwest-trending axial plane cleavage.
