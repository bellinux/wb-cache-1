5|$|The {{ability to}} study prehistoric <b>art</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent}} on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and {{to a lesser}} extent wood), later pottery and metal, {{are more likely to be}} extant. Whether all these artifacts can be defined as works of <b>art</b> <b>is</b> contested between scholars. Alexander Marshack argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, Paul Mellars suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.|$|E
