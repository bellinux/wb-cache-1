5000|$|Site C is not {{the only}} {{proposed}} water project in the Mackenzie basin. A potential US$1 billion run-of-the-river hydroelectricity station on the Slave River would generate at least 1,350 MW of power. Some tentative proposals have gone as far as to include dams on the main stem of the Mackenzie itself. By far the largest engineering project ever slated for the Mackenzie River was the North American Water and Power Alliance (NAWAPA), a vast series of dams, tunnels and reservoirs designed to move [...] of Arctic meltwater to southern Canada, the western United States and Mexico. The system would involve building massive dams on the Liard, Mackenzie, Peace, Columbia, and Fraser rivers, then pumping water into a 650 km long reservoir in the Rocky Mountain Trench. The water would then flow by gravity to irrigate more than 220000 km2 in the three countries and generate more than 50,000 MW of surplus energy. First proposed in the 1950s, the project's estimated cost has since risen to over $200 billion. Because of its massive cost and environmental impacts, it is considered unlikely ever to be implemented.The extraction of oil and gas in Alberta along the Mackenzie River is detrimental to its ecosystems because it involves the oil companies to remove large amounts of vegetation in order to make way for all of the equipment that they use to extract the oil from the ground. When the vegetation on the banks get and by removing these plants it destabilizes the soil and with the currents causes the river banks to erode, thus causing the accumulation of sediments in the river. In the event of a pipeline being constructed, the risks of pollution of the Mackenzie River are very high due to the destruction of the environment around it and the chance of an <b>accidental</b> <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> that could destroy the ecosystems found inside the river. Not only do oil and gas extractions in the north are damaging to the Mackenzie River, they also have detrimental effects on the people who live on the banks of this river because they rely on the water to supply them with the necessary things that they need in order to survive: food, water, and transportation.|$|E
