The two spend the evening in conversation over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport.

5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience {{and goes on to}} steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|He again {{participated in}} the NBA Summer League for the Nuggets in 2013. Prior to his second season, head coach Brian Shaw {{described}} Miller <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{the potential to be}} comparable to Paul George. Once the season began, Miller's second year salary became fully guaranteed. On December 27, 2013, Miller scored a career-high 9 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. With Wilson Chandler suffering from a groin injury, Miller made his first NBA career start on January 9, 2014 against the Oklahoma City Thunder with Kevin Durant as his defensive assignment. The game was nationally televised. Miller matched his career high with 9 points, while Durant scored 30, but Denver won 10188. In his second start in the following game against Orlando on January 11, Miller achieved his first NBA double double with career highs of 16 points and 11 rebounds. Miller again served in the starting lineup on February 10 but this time in the backcourt when point guard Ty Lawson was injured and starting shooting guard Randy Foye shifted over to replace him. In late March, when Wilson Chandler missed several games, Miller moved into the starting lineup. On April 6, Miller, who was still starting in place of Chandler, scored a career-high 19 points in an overtime contest against Houston.|$|E

25|$|Calvin is {{the third}} oldest of Paddy and Branwen O'Keefe's eleven children, a tall, thin, red-haired 14-year-old high school junior who {{is not the best}} in math but has to study to play on the school {{basketball}} team, {{and is one of the}} popular boys in high school. His mother is a very cranky, tired woman with too many children. Neglected by his own family, Calvin joyfully enters the lives of the Murry family, starting in Chapter Two. He also loves Meg Murry. He shows some signs of being able to communicate telepathically, the same power Charles Wallace seems to have, a technique referred to in later books as kything. He also feels <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been hiding his true self all his life, and likes the Murry family much more than his own, which is characterized by abuse and dysfunctional dynamics. Calvin also supported Meg through the adventure.|$|E

When asked if he was a [...] "believer," [...] he responded [...] "In God? I don't know. Yes. To a certain extent. It's a complicated question". In 2015, Franco had an official Bar Mitzvah ceremony, presided over by a rabbi.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Krabs has a {{distinct}} manner of walking; when he moves, he moves his feet very quickly and he is drawn <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> more than two legs. When directing animation for early episodes, one of Stephen Hillenburg's goals was for each character to have a separate walk cycle that showed their personalities; storyboard artist Erik Wiese designed Krabs' walk cycle {{with the intention of}} making it cartoonish. Wiese recalled in 2012, [...] "I animated Mr. Krabs' little feet on a four-frame multi-blur cycle—I think it was the best solution to making him walk like a crab." [...] Steven Hillenburg approved of the walk after Wiese demonstrated it on a pencil test machine.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut's {{difficulties}} materialized {{in numerous}} ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress {{he was making}} on his next novel, the darkly comical Breakfast of Champions. In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether. When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book American Literature on Stage and Screen, Breakfast of Champions was called [...] "funny and outlandish", but reviewers noted that it [...] "lacks substance {{and seems to be}} an exercise in literary playfulness." [...] Vonnegut's 1976 novel Slapstick, which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In The New York Timess review of Slapstick, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said Vonnegut [...] "seems to be putting less effort into [...] than ever before", and that [...] "it still seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> given up storytelling after all." [...] At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Baradwaj Rangan {{finds the}} {{sequence}} where Haasan's character, Cheenu, narrates {{the story of}} The Blue Jackal to Sridevi's character, Bhagyalakshmi, to be a distant echo of the arc negotiated by Cheenu: [...] "He is, after all, a nobody [...] who, through a salubrious twist of fate, becomes the ruler of a woman's life, until he is restored, at the end, to the nobody he was, a fraudulent claimant to her emotions." [...] In his book Dispatches from the wall corner: A journey through Indian cinema, Rangan says that although Haasan is inspired by Marlon Brando, the scene where Haasan burns himself while cooking and vents his anger on Sridevi, {{is reminiscent of the}} acting style of Marcel Marceau. In another book of Rangan, Conversations with Mani Ratnam, he states that in the scene where Cheenu enters Bhagyalakshmi's room in the brothel, there was fumbling and embarrassment, whereas in another Haasan film Nayakan (1987), Haasan's character, Velu Nayakar, behaves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> visited a brothel before. Nayakans director Mani Ratnam replied by saying that the two scenes are very different from one another and that it [...] "can't be played the same way".|$|E

500|$|The Sages of the Talmud {{stated that}} anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, [...] "it is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is {{situated}} there and it is open to hear prayer." [...] Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger writes [...] "since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall, {{it is understandable that}} all Israel's prayers ascend on high there... {{as one of the great}} ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall." [...] A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher.|$|E
500|$|Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer {{throughout}} pre-production of {{the action}} thriller Reindeer Games (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having [...] "a very winning, likable quality about him. I've {{been doing this for}} a long time and he's really one of the nicest." [...] He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times enjoying the unexpected casting choice: [...] "Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games." [...] He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck had [...] "traced over" [...] Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross, while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he [...] "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated [...] In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama Bounce. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "understated intensity and exquisite detail" [...] of his performance: [...] "His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{national}} Muslim {{organizations and}} individual imams, such as Council on American–Islamic Relations, Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), and Islamic Circle of North America issued statements condemning {{the attack and}} offering sympathy for the victims.

2500|$|According to the {{historian}} Chen Shou, who wrote Cui Yan's biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), Cui's true intention in writing those remarks was to mock Yang Xun's critics {{for being too}} eager to disparage Yang without making any careful consideration. However, Cui Yan was accused of displaying arrogance and defaming Cao Cao in his letter. Cao Cao angrily said, [...] "There is a saying, 'I {{gave birth to a}} daughter, that is all.' 'That is all' is not a complimentary phrase. He meant disrespect when he wrote, 'There will be changes as time passes.'" [...] Cao Cao then had Cui Yan stripped off his post, thrown into prison, and ordered to perform hard labour. Later, he sent agents to observe Cui Yan in prison and they reported that Cui continued to remain defiant. Cao Cao issued an official statement, [...] "Even though Cui Yan is serving a sentence, he still receives high numbers of visitors in prison. He glares at them straight in the eye <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> grievances." [...] He then forced Cui Yan to commit suicide.|$|E
2500|$|A {{similar case}} {{involved}} Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, {{so he has}} little memory of what happened before the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new declarative knowledge after the virus struck him either. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly [...] "wakes up" [...] every day usually in 30-second intervals. [...] He {{has a history of}} repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013 I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real. [...] His episodic memory is nonfunctional (so he does not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior). [...] Clive is often elated to see his wife, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not seen her for a while. [...] Despite this, however, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and procedural memory are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and also preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), he has little trouble in retaining his musical abilities (procedural memory), though he has no conscious memory of having learned music.|$|E

Dani tells Sam to let her out but Sam refuses, saying she'll be safer in the cell since she doesn't have her powers anymore. Sam and Roberto go off to fight Legion leaving Dani behind.

60|$|A Japanese {{painting}} is a poem {{rather than a}} picture. It portrays an emotion called up by a scene, and not the scene itself in all its elaborate complexity. It undertakes to give only {{so much of it}} as is vital to that particular feeling, and intentionally omits all irrelevant details. It is the expression caught from a glimpse of the soul of nature by the soul of man; the mirror of a mood, passing, perhaps, in fact, but perpetuated thus to fancy. Being an emotion, its intensity is directly proportional to the singleness with which it possesses the thoughts. The Far Oriental fully realizes the power of simplicity. This principle is his fundamental canon of pictorial art. To understand his paintings, it is from this standpoint they must be regarded; not as soulless photographs of scenery, but as poetic presentations of the spirit of the scenes. The very charter of painting depends upon its not giving us charts. And if with us a long poem be a contradiction in terms, a full picture is with them as self-condemnatory a production. From the contemplation of such works of art as we call finished, one is apt, after he has once appreciated Far Eastern taste, to rise with an unpleasant feeling of satiety, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> eaten too much at the feast.|$|E
