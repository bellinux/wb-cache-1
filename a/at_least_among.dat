25|$|In 2003 {{the press}} widely {{reported}} suggestions by Alec Knight and Joanna Mountain of Stanford University {{that the original}} human language may have had clicks.

In other words, the three primary genetic divisions of humanity are the Hadza, the Juǀʼhoan and relatives, and everyone else.

25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>among</b> the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E

500|$|This building, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>among</b> schoolhouses {{from the}} time period (1880s), is architecturally unique in two ways. One feature that sets this {{structure}} apart from most rural schoolhouses {{of the day is}} the building's design. Chana School started off as a simple, run-of-the-mill, one-room schoolhouse. Ten years later, however, an addition to the building attached a second, smaller classroom, perpendicular to the original. The bell tower was then constructed to connect the two rooms. The result was a unique layout resembling an [...] "L" [...] with its corner shaved off. Inside the building is another unique feature for schoolhouses of the time—the coat rooms are surrounded by two semi-circular front walls in the original wing of the [...] building.|$|E
500|$|During the Permian period synapsids, {{including}} {{the ancestors of}} mammals, may have dominated land environments, but the Permian–Triassic extinction event [...] {{came very close to}} wiping out complex life. The extinctions were apparently fairly sudden, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>among</b> vertebrates. During the slow recovery from this catastrophe a previously obscure group, archosaurs, became the most abundant and diverse terrestrial vertebrates. One archosaur group, the dinosaurs, were the dominant land vertebrates {{for the rest of the}} Mesozoic, and birds evolved from one group of dinosaurs. During this time mammals' ancestors survived only as small, mainly nocturnal insectivores, but this apparent set-back may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair. After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event [...] killed off the non-avian dinosaurs– birds are the only surviving dinosaurs– mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity, and some took to the air and the sea.|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{starting point for}} the Middle Ages is 476, first used by Bruni. For Europe as a whole, 1500 is often considered {{to be the end of}} the Middle Ages, but there is no universally agreed upon end date. Depending on the context, events such as Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the Americas in 1492, the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453, or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used. English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period. For Spain, dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516, the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504, or the conquest of Granada in 1492. Historians from Romance-speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts: an earlier [...] "High" [...] and later [...] "Low" [...] period. English-speaking historians, following their German counterparts, generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals: [...] "Early", [...] "High", and [...] "Late". In the 19th century, the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the [...] "Dark Ages", but with the adoption of these subdivisions, use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>among</b> historians.|$|E

2500|$|At {{some point}} in 1976, a new and {{powerful}} radio signal was detected simultaneously worldwide, and quickly dubbed 'the Woodpecker' by amateur radio operators. Transmission power on some Woodpecker transmitters {{was estimated to be}} as high as 10MW equivalent isotropically radiated power. Even prior to 1976, a similar 'woodpecker' interference is remembered by radio amateurs occurring in the high frequencies. As early as 1963, or before, radio amateurs were calling this [...] "the Russian Woodpecker". Little is apparently known about the power levels or Russian designation but is probably a forerunner of the Duga radar systems.

2500|$|The schools project also {{explains}} Sharp's bowdlerisation {{of some of}} the song texts, which, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>among</b> English folk songs, often contained erotic double entendres, when not outright bawdy or violent. However, Sharp did accurately note such lyrics in his field notebooks, which, given the prudery of the Victorian era could never have been openly published (especially in a school textbook context), thus preserving them for posterity. An example of the transformation of a formerly erotic song into one suitable for all audiences is the well-known [...] "The Keeper." [...] The immediate goal of Sharp's project – disseminating the distinctive, and hitherto little known melodies of these songs through music education – {{also explains}} why he considered the song texts relatively less important.|$|E
