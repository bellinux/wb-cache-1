25|$|The sweep {{method is}} quick {{and works in}} most cases, as the DV usually just drops down on the diver's right side. In this method the diver is usually face down to upright, and sweeps the right hand across the waist from left to right, <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> {{in contact with the}} body or scuba set, and round as far back as {{possible}} against the cylinder, the straightens the arm backwards and swings it around outwards and forwards in an arc until it is pointing forwards. This will normally capture the hose {{to the front of the}} arm, where the left hand can find it by sweeping along the arm from the right hand to the neck. This method will fail if the DV has been swept over to the left side of the cylinder.|$|E

50|$|The {{houses that}} {{became the center of}} the Wilson Block were {{constructed}} in 1899-1902, the first being the Wilson home at 2922 Swiss Ave., a -story residence. The construction of the additional 6 rental houses followed, 3 of which still remain at 2902, 2906 and 2910 Swiss Ave. Each house is unique in layout and character, but all share some of the common characteristics of the revival styles of the late 1800s, including irregularly shaped roofs that are steeply pitched and dominant front-facing gables. The homes are -story single-family dwellings constructed of wood with milled details. The siding comprises textured shingles and clapboard. Some were built with front porches, while others wrap <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sides. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> of some of the houses had rear screened porches on both levels. Upstairs porches were commonly used for sleeping, while the porches downstairs provided an open space to conduct household chores. The Wilson Block houses all had cisterns on each porch.|$|R

50|$|It a {{perennial}} herb or subshrub which grows {{up to half}} a meter tall from a woody taproot, sometimes reaching one meter. The slender, purplish, slightly waxy-textured stems have leaves alternately arranged. Each leaf has three elongated oblong or lance-shaped, bristle-tipped green leaflets each up to 4.5 centimeters in length. The inflorescences occur in leaf axils, each bearing one or two fragrant blooms. The flower may be up to 5 cm long and is mostly pale pinkish purple with darker rose-pink streaks at the center and a white spot below. The flower is resupinated, with the reproductive parts curving <b>around</b> <b>to</b> point toward <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> corolla; this forces a visiting insect to rub against them and thereby transfer pollen. A second type of flower often occurs which is cleistogamous: self-pollinating, and not actually opening into a corolla. The cleistogamous flower {{is more common in}} general, but the type with the showy open corolla may be more common in the seasons after a wildfire. Both types bear fruit, a legume pod up to 5 cm long containing up to 9 reddish seeds a few millimeters in length. The seeds are sticky in texture and are dispersed when they adhere to animals.|$|R

40|$|Dual {{junction}} {{amorphous silicon}} (a-Si) solar cells produced on polyimide substrate {{have been selected}} as <b>the</b> best candidate <b>to</b> produce a lightweight solar array for the PowerSphere program. The PowerSphere concept features a space-inflatable, geodetic solar array approximately 0. 6 meters in diameter and capable of generating about 20 W of electrical power. Trade studies of various wiring concepts and connection methods led to an interconnect design with a copper contact that wraps <b>around</b> <b>the</b> edge, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> solar cell. Applying Plasma Vapor Deposited (PVD) copper film to both sides and {{the edge of the}} solar cell produces the wrap around contact. This procedure results in a contact pad on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> solar cell, which is then laser welded to a flex circuit material. The flex circuit is constructed of copper in a custom designed routing pattern, and then sandwiched in a Kapton insulation layer. The flex circuit then serves as the primary power distribution system between the solar cells and the spacecraft. Flex circuit material is the best candidate for the wiring harness because it allows for low force deployment of the solar cells by the inflatable hinges on the PowerSphere. An additional frame structure, fabricated and assembled by ILC Dover, will reinforce the wrap around contact-flex blanket connection, thus providing a mechanically robust solar cell interconnect for the PowerSphere multifunctional program. The PowerSphere team will use the wraparound contact design approach as the primary solution for solar cell integration and the flex blanket for power distribution...|$|R
500|$|The {{skull of}} the holotype, which {{measures}} [...] long, {{is long and}} narrow, with a tapered snout that slopes downwards at an angle of 15°. The eye sockets were roughly {{the same size as}} the temporal openings immediately behind them. A narrow, rounded ridge along the middle of the top surface of the skull extends from near the front of <b>the</b> premaxilla <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> eye sockets. The frontal bones form a rectangular bar that separates the eye sockets down the middle. A ridge running across the bar intersects with <b>the</b> forward-extending ridge <b>to</b> produce a dagger-shaped protrusion. The jugal bone, which extends from the bottom of <b>the</b> eye socket <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of the temporal openings, is entirely bordered on its bottom by the maxilla. The squamosal bones arch <b>around</b> <b>to</b> form <b>the</b> curved <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> skull, and bear a ridge on top for attachment of neck muscles. There is also a ridge at the point where the two bones fuse. A cast of the braincase shows impressions of the semicircular canals and membranous inner ear, as well as canals of the hypoglossal, accessory, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves, which can also be observed on the bony exoccipital-opisthotic of the braincase. On the imperfectly-preserved lower jaw, the coronoid eminence seems to be relatively low, judging by the narrow and slightly curved top edge of the surangular bone. While the teeth have been lost, they were initially described as long, slender, and awl-shaped, with rough ridges on the outer surfaces. Although it has been suggested that Brancasaurus had very reduced tooth sockets in the premaxilla, as in Leptocleidus, this is impossible to verify because of damage to this portion of the skull.|$|R

He was hoping to find LaGrone's 1930 sculpture, [...] "Black", carved from pinyon wood. Sixty-five years after first seeing the sculpture, he wrote, [...] "I was shocked and speechless at the grandeur of the figure; then I walked <b>around</b> <b>to</b> look at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of it and immediately started crying.

[...] The work had been long since purchased and later was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Detroit chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, but its image remained potent over 75 years later. [...] "Black" [...] may well have been the same displayed sculpture that several years later led to LaGrone's return to college.|$|R
5000|$|Lolich and Gibson matched {{scoreless}} innings for six innings, but, {{in the top}} of the seventh, Gibson surrendered two-out hits to Norm Cash and Willie Horton.

Flood has been criticized by some who believe he would have caught the ball had his first steps been back instead of in. [...] Jim Northrup said the hit was [...] "40 feet over Flood's head. He never had a chance to catch it." [...] However, his teammate Denny McLain claimed in his 1975 book that [...] "Flood blew it." [...] Orlando Cepeda, in his book [...] "Baby Bull", asserts that Flood would have caught the ball, had he not misjudged it. In the October 29, 1968, issue of The Sporting News, both Flood and manager Red Schoendienst indicated they would have expected the normally sure-handed outfielder to catch such a ball. By starting in, Flood had to attempt to both reverse direction and then regain his acceleration. He then slipped on the wet grass before recovering his speed, and by that time the ball was well beyond him. Bill Freehan then doubled in Northrup, and {{in the top of}} the ninth, Don Wert would add an RBI single.|$|R
5000|$|The 1941 {{study by}} Gagné {{attempted}} <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> effect {{of two different}} external stimuli (buzzer, and scratching on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> starting box) on rats, while applied during acquisition and extinction, <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> effect {{on the strength of}} the conditioned operant response. Five groups of rats were used, however the differences in the latent period were hypothesized to be observed in the following conditions if it existed in comparison to a control group that did not introduce any external stimuli, 1) buzzer on the first trial of acquisition, 2) scratch on the first trial of acquisition, 3) buzzer on the fourth trial of acquisition, 4) scratch on the fourth trial of acquisition, 5) buzzer on the fifth trial of extinction, and 6) scratch on the fifth trial of extinction. For each experimental procedure, the buzzer was sounded for four seconds and stopped for two seconds before the beginning of the next trial; the scratching continued until <b>the</b> rat turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> face <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> starting box. The buzzer can be interpreted to explain Pavlov's observations on external inhibition and disinhibition in a conditioned operant response and support B. F. Skinner's hypothesis of an [...] "emotional effect". Skinner describes that an emotional effect is observed when a response fails to be reinforced, possibly leading to operant extinction, and also an emotional [...] "reaction commonly spoken of as frustration or rage". [...] Regarding the extra stimulus used, the buzzer has a [...] "depressing effect" [...] on all trials which decreased the response magnitude during extinction. An observed increase of response magnitude following the depression would be considered a [...] "compensatory {{increase in the number of}} available responses". On the other hand, the buzzer can also be interpreted as an external stimulus that decreases the response magnitude (external inhibition), and produce an increased response magnitude on the next trial (disinhibition) after the effect of inhibition declines. This suggests that the buzzer weakens the conditioned response, but if it is repeatedly encountered, it serves <b>to</b> strengthen <b>the</b> conditioned response, thereby decreasing the latent period.The external scratching stimulus portrays external inhibition during acquisition (fourth trial of acquisition), and disinhibition during extinction (fifth trial of extinction). There was a significant increase in the recorded latent period (i.e., the time it took for <b>the</b> rat <b>to</b> move out of the starting box and pass a four-inch mark while walking towards the food box), and decline in the magnitude of the conditioned response since the rat took longer <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> four inch point. The additional learned response of <b>the</b> rat turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of the box in reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scratching is an effect of external inhibition, which may have added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latent time, but the results do not indicate what portion of the rat’s turn-around response made up the latent time. Shortened latent period on the fifth trial of extinction indicates an increased magnitude of response, and represents disinhibition, where the rat is not responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extra stimulus as much and increases the magnitude of the conditioned response (faster latent time).|$|R
