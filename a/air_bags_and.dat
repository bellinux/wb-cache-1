40|$|To {{understand}} the nonlinear dynamic mechanism of a rotor-bearing system coupled with <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> floating-raft, the dynamic {{characteristics of the}} system are investigated. This work has two key objectives. First, the vibration mechanism of rotor-bearing system coupled with <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> floating-raft is investigated by developing a numerical model. Then, the nonlinear dynamics {{of the system and}} the effect of several parameters are studied, which includes the steady-state response and its spectrum, the orbit and its Poincaré map, the bifurcation diagram, and largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). The results show that at low speed the dynamic behavior appears in a single periodic motion, and, with the increase of the speed, the motion becomes quasi-periodic and chaotic. These performances indicate that the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> <b>and</b> floating-raft introduce some dynamic effects of marine rotor-bearing system...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the methodology and {{results of a}} program conducted to develop two underseat energy absorber (E/A) concepts for application to nonadjustable crashworthy passenger seats for general aviation aircraft. One concept utilizes an inflated <b>air</b> <b>bag,</b> <b>and</b> the other, a convoluted sheet metal bellows. Prototypes of both were designed, built, and tested. Both concepts demonstrated the necessary features of an energy absorber (load-limiter); however, the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> concept is particularly encouraging because of its light weight. Several seat frame concepts also were investigated {{as a means of}} resisting longitudinal and lateral loads and of guiding the primary vertical stroke of the underseat energy absorber. Further development of a seat system design using the underseat energy absorbers is recommended because they provide greatly enhanced crash survivability as compared with existing general aviation aircraft seats...|$|R
5000|$|Their [...] "Chemox" [...] {{chemical}} rebreather, {{primarily designed}} for use in mines, has been modified for use on Mt. Everest in 1952 and 1986.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the concern for the growing number of air-bag-induced {{injuries}} and fatalities, the administrators of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a cooperative effort that "leverages NHTSA's expertise in motor vehicle safety restraint systems and biomechanics with NASAs position as one of the leaders in advanced technology development [...] . to enable the state of <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> safety technology to advance at a faster pace [...] . " They signed a NASA/NHTSA memorandum of understanding for NASA to "evaluate <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> to assess advanced <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> performance, establish the technological potential for improved technology (smart) <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> systems, <b>and</b> identify key expertise and technology within the agency (i. e., NASA) that can potentially contribute significantly to the improved effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> " NASA is committed to contributing to NHTSAs effort to: (1) understand and define critical parameters affecting <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> performance; (2) systematically assess <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> technology state of the art and its future potential; and (3) identify new concepts for <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> systems. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was selected by NASA to respond to the memorandum of understanding by conducting an advanced <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> technology assessment. JPL analyzed the nature of the need for occupant restraint, how <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> operate alone <b>and</b> with safety belts to provide restraint, and the potential hazards introduced by the technology. This analysis yielded a set of critical parameters for restraint systems. The researchers examined data on the performance of current <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> technology, <b>and</b> searched for and assessed how new technologies could reduce the hazards introduced by <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> while providing the restraint protection that is their primary purpose. The critical parameters which were derived are: (1) the crash severity; (2) the use of seat belts; (3) the physical characteristics of the occupants; (4) the proximity of the occupants to the airbag module; (5) the deployment time, which includes the time to sense the need for deployment, the inflator response parameters, the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> response, <b>and</b> the reliability of the <b>air</b> <b>bag.</b> The requirements for an advanced <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> technology is discussed. These requirements includes that the system use information related to: (1) the crash severity; (2) the status of belt usage; (3) the occupant category; and (4) the proximity to the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> to adjust <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment. The parameters for the response of the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> are: (1) deployment time; (2) inflator parameters; <b>and</b> (3) <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> response <b>and</b> reliability. The state of occupant protection advanced technology is reviewed. This review includes: the current safety restraint systems, and advanced technology characteristics. These characteristics are summarized in a table, which has information regarding the technology item, the potential, and an date of expected utilization. The use of technology and expertise at NASA centers is discussed. NASA expertise relating to sensors, computing, simulation, propellants, propulsion, inflatable systems, systems analysis and engineering is considered most useful. Specific NASA technology developments, which were included in the study are: (1) a capacitive detector; (2) stereoscopic vision system; (3) improved crash sensors; (4) the use of the acoustic signature of the crash to determine crash severity; and (5) the use of radar antenna for pre-crash sensing. Information relating to injury risk assessment is included, as is a summary of the areas of the technology which requires further development...|$|R

In one instance, the second launch of Georgy Prokofiev's ill-fated USSR-3, it took two hopper balloons to untie the tangled nets on top of the giant balloon: the first jumper fell off his bench but managed {{to hold on to the}} balloon's cables and survived.|$|R
