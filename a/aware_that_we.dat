25|$|At Cabinet on {{the morning}} of 30 October Lloyd {{reported}} that the USA was ready to move a motion at the UN condemning Israel, which had attacked Egypt in the Sinai the previous day, as an aggressor. Macleod and Heathcoat Amory approved of Lloyd's suggestion of postponing the attack by 24 hours (in breach, as it happens, of the secret agreement between Britain, France and Israel) in order to bring the Americans on board, although they thought it unlikely to work, but it was not adopted. Macleod was telling others of his dismay that ministers had not been fully informed of the agreement with France and Israel. Either now or at some subsequent meeting Eden apologised to the Cabinet for his reticence “in time of war”, causing Macleod to snap “I was not <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were at war, Prime Minister!” The Anglo-French ultimatum was on the afternoon of 30 October.|$|E

[...] For the best of these modern writers of scientifiction have the knack of imparting knowledge and even inspiration without once making us <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are being taught". It was difficult for Gernsback to find high-quality new material that was both entertaining and met his declared goal of providing scientific information, and the early issues of Amazing contained a high proportion of reprints. [...] He discovered that his readers preferred the fantastical romances of Burroughs and Merritt to the more scientific stories of Verne and Wells, and perhaps in response published Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool" [...] in the May 1927 issue of Amazing. [...] The story was completely unscientific; Gernsback's introduction to the story claimed that Merritt was introducing a new science, but Ashley comments that Gernsback was simply [...] "looking for an excuse for including such fantastic fiction in the magazine when it did not fit in with his basic creed".|$|E

50|$|The film {{follows a}} {{non-linear}} convoluted journey through (4) different settings: One which represents today; one which represents protagonist Wes' dreamworld; {{and the remaining}} two representing the good times shared with Alison who is Wes' dearest and closest platonic friend. The movie has been made {{the same way as}} the memoirs it is trying to portray. Non-existence of time is one aspect of the protagonist that is loved by his friend. The film captures this time anomaly in their relationship with scenes of past memories in a non-linear sequence. It gives you a sense of the loneliness and lack of deep connection Alison is going through while trying to maintain her relationship with her beau in Tokyo, all while making you <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>Wes</b> is only carrying on with his life by holding onto the best memories between them. (This is depicted in the opening scene when Alison is watching the shining window drapes which represent the same kind of drapes at a hotel where she stayed with Wes during a road trip through the Utah deserts).|$|R
2500|$|In May 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Supergirl would air its second season on The CW instead of CBS, Pedowitz revealed that all four series—Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl—would crossover in the upcoming 2016–17 television season. In September 2016, Greg Berlanti, creator and executive producer on all four series, clarified that the crossover event would only officially involve The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow, though the event starts {{at the very end of}} the Supergirl episode [...] "Medusa", with Barry and Cisco Ramon arriving on Supergirl's Earth to recruit her. Andrew Kreisberg, executive producer on Arrow, The Flash and Supergirl, spoke more on why the crossover did not include Supergirl, saying that since [...] "Medusa" [...] also served as the mid-season finale for Supergirl, and the other three series have theirs in a subsequent episode after the crossover, [...] "We wanted to make sure that [...] spoke to what had been happening on the first seven episodes of Supergirl and not just as a tie in." [...] He added that, logistically, it would have been very difficult to incorporate the four series, also noting that finding the time for Melissa Benoist to shoot material for the other three series had its own complications, noting, [...] "Hopefully people didn't realize it, but Kara was not in a lot of episode 7 of Supergirl... specifically to free her up for five days so that she could appear in all these other episodes." [...] He expanded on these difficulties stating, [...] "The thing that we didn’t really plan on — because we weren’t <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going to switch Supergirl from CBS to CW and it was really going to be part of it — that was the one show that didn't have built-in shut-down days, so all the other ones did...

While this reality is often a concern to us in our work with preservice teachers, it struck us as especially important because we had been asked to teach an off-campus, whole language inservice course. Teaching whole language demanded that our methodology complement the course content. Because of this, we organized the class in concert with characteristics of a whole language environment: time, ownership, process, conferences, and resources (Butler and Turbill, 1984). Implementing these elements provided many challenges both for the students in the course and for us. The story that follows is our view of how these characteristics affected our students 2 ̆ 7 experiences and our own...|$|R

In this special issue, diverse research topics regarding the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake are covered, such as rupture process, rupture simulations, hypocenter distribution, seismic velocity structure, stress field, seismic magnitude differentials, variability of megathrust earthquakes, induced earthquakes such as outer-rise or inland events, earthquake triggering, rheology of the crust, tsunami inundation, site response change, soil liquefaction, vibration of a tall building, and ionospheric disturbances. We believe these papers contribute significantly for deeper understanding of generation mechanism of great interplate earthquakes such as the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake andof many related phenomena.|$|R

Murphy's career at Liverpool included a unique cup treble in 2001 (where Liverpool won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup), a Premier League second-place finish in 2002 and a second League Cup in 2003.

Although the 2002-03 season was overall a disappointing one for Liverpool, with the club slumping to fifth in the table after a lengthy winless run in mid-winter, Murphy had a fine individual campaign which saw him score 12 goals and be voted the supporters' player of the season.|$|R

In the EAU system, both superficial high-grade and deep-low grade tumors would be classified as intermediate risk tumors (Solsona et al. 2004).
