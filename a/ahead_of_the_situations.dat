5000|$|In England, where {{practice}} ran <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> theory, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> {{was quite}} different. In the sixteenth century, [...] "tragicomedy" [...] meant <b>the</b> native sort <b>of</b> romantic play that violated <b>the</b> unities <b>of</b> time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions. These were the features Philip Sidney deplored in his complaint against the [...] "mungrell Tragy-comedie" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1580s, and <b>of</b> which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: [...] "The best {{actors in the}} world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> writ and <b>the</b> liberty, these are the only men." [...] Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> more sophisticated playwrights: Shakespeare's last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.|$|R

40|$|Summary: More {{than one}} hundred {{developing}} and transitional {{countries in the world}} are still not free from foot and mouth disease (FMD), in spite of intensive global, regional and national efforts to get <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease.
