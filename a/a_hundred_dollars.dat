5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E

25|$|The growing fame of Cayce {{along with}} the {{popularity}} he received from newspapers attracted several eager commercially minded men who wanted to seek a fortune by using his clairvoyant abilities. Even though Cayce was reluctant to help them, he was persuaded to give his readings, which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful. A cotton merchant offered him <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market; however, despite his poor finances, Cayce refused the merchant's offer. Some {{wanted to know where}} to hunt for treasures while others wanted to know the outcome of horse races. Several times he was persuaded to give such readings as an experiment. However, when he used his ability for such purposes, he did no better than chance alone would dictate. These experiments allegedly left him depleted of energy, distraught, and unsatisfied with himself. Finally, he decided to use his gift only to help the distressed and sick.|$|E

500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Tubman became heavily {{involved}} with the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Auburn. In 1903, she donated a parcel of real estate she owned to the church, under the instruction that it be made into a home for [...] "aged and indigent colored people". The home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100 entrance fee. She said: [...] "hey make a rule that nobody should come in without they have <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> Now I wanted to make a rule that nobody should come in unless they didn't have no money at all." [...] She was frustrated by the new rule but was the guest of honor nonetheless when the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged celebrated its opening on June 23, 1908.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after its}} release, Slay Tracks became a collector's item. According to an April 1990 Drag City press release, copies were {{typically}} sold for $500–$600.

When I needed money I'd go in and sell a couple {{to the store and}} they'd sell for <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> each. I rarely meet anyone who bought it when it originally came out." [...] Malkmus also said that the pair [...] "probably gave away about one-hundred to friends and bands we later toured with." [...] The songs on Slay Tracks found airplay on several college radio stations, including University of Virginia's WTJU and University of California, Berkeley's KALX. Kannberg commented on the EP's unanticipated popularity, saying [...] "It was very surprising to find that people were into [...]" ...|$|E

[...] {{as they waited for}} the group to perform. Bruce told his stage crew that he would pay $2,000 to each person who ran around the stage naked, and two people took up his offer. Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage. Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to [...] "give something back." [...] According to Bruce, [...] "We brought along these big beach balls. We announced to the crowd that they each had <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> taped to them, and then we proceeded to kick about thirty of them into the crowd. Then we rolled out these bigger giant-ass beach balls and announced, 'These ones have five hundred bucks taped to them!' We booted a gang of them into the human sea." [...] Bruce also recounts that their set had multiple technical problems, and the audience was not allowed to get close to the stage, which made the duo feel less connected with them.|$|E

500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. And you had no income tax." ...|$|E
500|$|Popular was {{uncertain}} {{of the sales}} potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. Astonishings first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with Super Science Stories. [...] Pohl's budget for an issue was $405: in Pohl's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger, {{one of the company}} owners, breaking down the budget for him: [...] "Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. [...] <b>A</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover." [...] Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. [...] At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper {{than any of the other}} sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. [...] It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. [...] Pohl later commented that he {{was uncertain}} whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. [...] Some of the additional money went to long-time writer Ray Cummings, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. [...] Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came on a day when Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford to pay that rate. [...] Pohl comments in his memoirs that [...] "for months he would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} GAR built an {{enclosed}} water slide, {{not unusual for}} that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a complete vertical loop at the end, {{similar to that of}} a roller coaster. The resulting slide, called the Cannonball Loop, was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> to test it.

[...] A producer named Dexx, also from Crown Heights, produced [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] for the group. In early 1991, Hines and Weston heard that EPMD would be hosting a talent show at Club Tropicana in Richmond, Virginia and decided to enter. Hines and Weston performed their song [...] "Klap Ya Handz," [...] which they'd recorded as a demo with Dexx (In fact, for the album, Hines and Weston had to rhyme over the demo for [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] because they didn't have an instrumental version of the music.). The group apparently had {{the highest score in}} the contest, which would earn the winner a $100 prize. However, according to Weston, although the duo had the highest score Parrish Smith, one half of the group EPMD, told the club announcer to give the second best group the prize. While the winning group went up to claim their prize, Smith came to Hines and Weston and said, [...] "yo, what would you guys rather have: a record deal or <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars?</b> Meet me {{in the back of the}} club in five minutes." [...] Smith and Erick Sermon, the other member of EPMD, met with Hines and Weston in the back of the club and asked the two to play them the [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] track again. Sermon and Smith were so impressed by the song that they asked Hines and Weston for the tape, with Smith telling them, [...] "if you can get us nine more songs like the one you just performed, we can get you a deal."
