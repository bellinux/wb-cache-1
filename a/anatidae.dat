5|$|Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, {{are usually}} {{categorized}} as water birds, not seabirds. Although {{there are a}} number of sea ducks in the family <b>Anatidae</b> that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many waders (or shorebirds) and herons are also highly marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Vegavis, a late Cretaceous {{member of the}} <b>Anatidae,</b> proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the Cenozoic. The affinities of an earlier fossil, the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago, are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird diversification.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (<b>Anatidae),</b> shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera). The common buzzard (Buteo buteo) {{can be seen on}} the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and kestrel breed. Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{whistling}} ducks, Dendrocygna, are {{a distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within the duck, goose and swan family <b>Anatidae,</b> which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a superspecies with the wandering whistling duck. It has no recognised subspecies, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US {{have in the past}} been assigned to D. b. helva, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than D. b. bicolor.|$|E
5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family <b>Anatidae</b> (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
25|$|The {{systematics}} of the <b>Anatidae</b> {{are in a}} {{state of}} flux. Previously divided into six subfamilies, a study of anatomical characters by Livezey suggests the <b>Anatidae</b> are better treated in nine subfamilies. This classification was popular in the late 1980s to 1990s. But mtDNA sequence analyses indicate, for example, the dabbling and diving ducks do not belong in the same subfamily.|$|E
25|$|In fact, these {{living species}} are all {{included}} in the <b>Anatidae</b> except for the three screamers and the magpie goose.|$|E
25|$|The family <b>Anatidae</b> was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. While the status of the <b>Anatidae</b> as a family is straightforward, and which species properly belong to it is little debated, the relationships of the different tribes and subfamilies within it are poorly understood. The listing in the box at right should be regarded as simply one of several possible ways of organising the many species within the Anatidae; see discussion in the next section.|$|E
25|$|Anseriformes is {{an order}} of birds that {{comprise}} about 180 living species in three families: Anhimidae (the screamers), Anseranatidae (the magpie goose), and <b>Anatidae,</b> the largest family, which includes over 170 species of waterfowl, among them the ducks, geese, and swans.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, the <b>Anatidae</b> may be {{considered}} to consist of three subfamilies (ducks, geese, and swans, essentially) which contain the groups as presented here as tribes, with the swans separated as subfamily Cygninae, the goose subfamily Anserinae also containing the whistling ducks, and the Anatinae containing all other clades.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Oligocene Limicorallus (from Chelkar-Teniz (Kazakhstan) was {{sometimes}} considered an anserine. It is, however, a primitive cormorant. The middle Eocene Eonessa was formerly thought {{to belong to}} <b>Anatidae,</b> however reexamination of the holotype in 1978 resulted in the genus being placed as Aves incertae sedis.|$|E
25|$|Waterfowl {{males of}} the family Aves: <b>Anatidae</b> have evolved a phallus to aid in coercion. This phallus everts out of the male body (when it’s time to mate) in a {{counter-clockwise}} coil. As a response, females have developed vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils {{to protect themselves from}} forceful intromission. Waterfowl females have evolved these “convoluted vaginal morphologies” to make it harder for males to insert themselves without the female’s consent.|$|E
25|$|The male {{waterfowl}} (Aves: <b>Anatidae)</b> {{evolution of}} a phallus to forcefully copulate with females has led to counteradaptations in females {{in the form of}} vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils. These structures make it harder for males to achieve intromission. The clockwise coils are significant because the male phallus everts out of their body in a counter-clockwise spiral; therefore, a clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation. Studies have shown that the longer a male’s phallus is, the more elaborate the vaginal structures were.|$|E
25|$|Birds of {{the delta}} are both winter {{visitors}} and passage migrants including great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), {{a wide variety of}} <b>Anatidae,</b> Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), about thirty species of migratory shorebirds, the whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida), the Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia), and the brown-headed gull (Larus brunnicephalus), which is very common. One of the most numerous wintering shorebird is the lesser sand plover (Charadrius mongolus), which occurs in flocks of many thousands along the outer coast {{of the delta}}. The wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola) and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) are also abundant.|$|E
25|$|From a {{young age}} on his family estate in Sterrebeek, Derscheid {{developed}} an interest in ornithology and aviculture. He built a research station for bird behavior called Armendy Farm that {{was active in the}} 1930s. In cooperation with colleagues in France, England, Germany, the United States and Australia he succeeded in assembling one of the best captive breeding bird collections in Europe, specializing in <b>Anatidae</b> and Loriinae (ducks, swans, geese; and the group of small parrots consisting of lories and lorikeets). Derscheid also kept the omnivorous alpine parrots from New Zealand known as keas. There, he researched dietary requirements and incubation, sending specimens to zoos throughout Europe, America, and Australia. He was particularly interested in aspergillosis, a bronchial disease caused by mold that decimated flocks of wild sea ducks as he tried to acclimatize them to the freshwater park environment, but which Derscheid succeeded in curing. Derscheid's techniques were widely adopted and applied, most notably at the nature reserve in Zwin (Belgium), known for its collections of salt-resistant plants and an aviary specializing in wading birds. An obituary of Derscheid states: “His collection at Sterrebeek was known throughout Europe, America and Australasia, and his success with the <b>Anatidae,</b> particularly with the sea-duck, placed him in the forefront of waterfowl experts.” Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Derscheid transferred some of his collection of exotic birds to the late John J. Yealland, who carried them in a cardboard box on one of the last boats to leave Belgium before the German invasion. Later the Curator of Birds at the London Zoo, Yealland also published on Derscheid's bird collections from notes prepared during the latter's imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|Bird skin parka (tamacenaq in Yup'ik) {{made from}} skins of birds of the Alcidae, <b>Anatidae,</b> Gaviidae, and Laridae families. Bird skins make {{very good and}} warm parkas. Thick bird skin parkas were ideal winter wear but were also used during cold weather in summer. Yupik (Yup'ik, Siberian Yupik, Sugpiaq ~ Alutiiq) and Inuit (Inupiaq) Eskimo seamstresses had {{regional}} variations in bird skin preparation techniques and bird skin parka styles and bird skin clothing-production techniques. Bird skin parkas are rarely made today and the skill is quickly disappearing among skin sewers in their region. During the 19th century, many Yup'iks along the coast between the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers wore bird skins. Every year, one could afford to make a bird skin parka because birds returned in such abundance. A plump Yup'ik baby trussed up in eider skin smiled from a warm, dry, cushioned world.|$|E
