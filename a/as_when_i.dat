It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message".|$|E

2500|$|Malwarebytes was informally {{established}} in 2004. CEO and founder Marcin Kleczynski, originally from Poland, {{was still a}} teenager attending high school in Bensenville, Illinois at the time, and {{was working as a}} technician in a computer repair shop in Chicago. He noticed that whenever infected computers arrived, they would generally reformat the computer, regardless if the infection was only minor. It was only when his mother's computer became infected that Kleczynski learned more about why the virus wasn't directly attacked, finding that neither McAfee nor Symantec would remove the malware from his system. He later recalled [...] "I've never been as angry <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got my computer infected", and professed that his mother told him to fix it [...] "under penalty of death". It was only after Kleczynski posted on the forum SpywareInfo, popular at the time, {{that he was able to}} learn how to cure it, which took three days. The company was unofficially founded after this, when Kleczynski conversed and became friends with several of the editors of the forum, who tempted him to buy an unused domain from them.|$|E
