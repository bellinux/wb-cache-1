5|$|Homarus gammarus {{is found}} across the {{north-eastern}} Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, {{not including the}} Baltic Sea. It is also present {{in most of the}} Mediterranean Sea, only missing from the section east of Crete, and along only the north-west coast of the Black Sea. The northernmost populations are found in the Norwegian fjords Tysfjorden and Nordfolda, inside the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently.

50|$|Larsen's {{most famous}} work is her {{documentation}} of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle's</b> Sami people, {{which appeared in the}} 2011 issue of National Geographic. She lived and worked with the Sami reindeer herders of Scandinavia for over four years, immersing herself in the culture, working as a housekeeper and studying the Sami language at a local university before shooting a single image. Her studies of the Northern Sami language were supported by a Fulbright fellowship. Larsen’s first book, Sámi, Walking With Reindeer, is a look into her experience living with the Sami.|$|R
5|$|Reaching {{a wartime}} {{strength}} of over 30 units and four assault brigades, the Commandos served in all theatres of war from the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> to Europe {{and from the}} Mediterranean and Middle East to South-East Asia. Their operations ranged from small groups of men landing from the sea or by parachute, to a brigade of assault troops spearheading the Allied invasions of Europe and Asia.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Above the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> {{an extreme}} case is reached {{where there is}} no {{daylight}} at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1980s and 90s Dinosaur Cove yielded hypsilophodontid-like dinosaurs as Leaellynasaura amicagraphica and Atlascopcosaurus loadsi, and a Coelurosaur, {{as well as}} {{fragments}} {{of what may be}} a caenagnathid (relatives of the Oviraptors). One fossil from this diverse taxa, collectively called the [...] "polar dinosaurs of Australia", has been interpreted as showing possible adaptations to vision in low light conditions and possibly were warm-blooded; this has been suggested as an explanation for how some of these dinosaurs foraged for food during the polar winter months. It is worth noting that although these dinosaurs lived at polar latitudes, the Cretaceous climate was significantly milder than today, so temperatures within the Antarctic and <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circles</b> were vastly different from the climate at these latitudes today, because the lopsided arrangements of the continents made sea currents and monsoon winds blow across the polar areas and not round and round them, and so stopped cold pools from developing around the poles.|$|R
5|$|Commando raids {{were made}} by the Western Allies during much of the Second World War against the Atlantic Wall. The raids were {{conducted}} by the armed forces of Britain, the Commonwealth and a small number of men from the occupied territories serving with No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando during the Second World War. All the operations took place between the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> in Norway to the French border with Spain, along what was known as the Atlantic Wall.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies become scarce {{at higher}} latitudes. They are not native to Iceland, but {{individuals}} are occasionally swept in by strong winds, including a Hemianax ephippiger native to North Africa, and an unidentified darter species. In Kamchatka, {{only a few}} species of dragonfly including the treeline emerald Somatochlora arctica and some aeshnids such as Aeshna subarctica are found, possibly because of the low temperature of the lakes there. The treeline emerald {{is also found in}} northern Alaska, within the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> making it the most northerly of all dragonflies.|$|E

25|$|Reproducing 13 {{watercolour}} and graphite drawings, Bluff Life (1990) {{was produced}} in 1982 during a two-month stay in a lighthouse off the southern coast of Iceland in a town called Dyrhólaey. The series totals of thirteen drawings, all made on note cards. The second book, Folds (1991), {{is a collection of}} photographs documenting extent sheepfolds; a unique indigenous structure found throughout the island. To Place: Verne’s Journey (1995), the fifth in the series, refers to the North Atlantic island where the book Journey to Center of The Earth (1864), by Jules Verne, began. Horn’s volume opens with a series of aerial geographic views of Iceland, continues with multiple images of the island’s geological formations, and concludes with images of crashing waves. A photographic essay, the seventh volume <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circles</b> (1998) records the endless horizon of the North Sea, the feathers of an eider nest, and the rotating beacon of a lighthouse, invoking in form the very circumference of Iceland. Doubt Box (Book IX) (2006) is a collection of cards rather than a bound volume. Printed on both sides, the cards show pictures of glacial water, taxidermied birds, and of the same face, a little older.|$|R

5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei {{is found}} in Europe, Asia (Japan), and North America. The European {{distribution}} extends north to the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> and the Lofoten Islands. The species is widely distributed in North America; it was reported from Mexico {{for the first time}} in 1998. The fungus is partial to mixed forest dominated by aspen and conifers in montane and subalpine environments. In The Netherlands, it was a component of one of three communities of saprobic fungi associated with roadside verges (the land between the road edge and the adjacent wall, fence or hedge) planted with common oak (Quercus robur); the verges also supported the growth of the mushroom Russula ochroleuca, a host of C.cookei.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes {{occur on}} all continents except Antarctica, and occupy almost all {{terrestrial}} habitats, ranging {{as far north}} as the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> in Iceland, Norway, and Central Russia, and as far south as Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. Typically forest floor dwellers, they live in leaf litter, dead wood, or soil, with a preference for humid conditions. In temperate zones, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and may reach densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, deserts, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months. A few species occur near the seashore and can survive in somewhat salty conditions.|$|E

5|$|Several {{thousand}} years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by {{a civil war}} between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle</b> and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses.

5|$|Born in Somerset to {{a wealthy}} family, Lethbridge was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, {{during the course}} of which he {{attended}} an expedition to Jan Mayen island, becoming part of the first group to successfully climb the Beerenberg. After a failed second expedition to the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Circle,</b> he became involved in archaeology. In his capacity as Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Lethbridge carried out excavations at various sites around Britain. His claims regarding the existence of Iron Age hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in Cambridgeshire caused significant controversy within the archaeological community, with most archaeologists believing that Lethbridge had erroneously misidentified a natural feature. Lethbridge's methodology and theories were widely deemed unorthodox, and in turn he became increasingly critical of the archaeological profession.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, {{during the}} Cold War, NATO asked the French Army {{to build the}} station {{as part of the}} 82-node {{transmission}} network in Europe known as the ACE High system. In this network, the Pierre-sur-Haute station, or FLYZ, was a relay between the Lachens (FNIZ) station to the south and the Mont-Août (FADZ) station to the north. The NATO radio station was using American-made tropospheric scatter equipment to relay voice and telegraph signals on a network stretching from Turkey to the <b>Arctic</b> Polar <b>Circle</b> in Norway. The French Air Force took control of the station in 1974. In the late 1980s, the system was gradually replaced by a combination of national defense systems and some NATO-owned subsystems. The large parabolic antennas, known locally as Mickey's ears, were replaced with the current two-antenna setup in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Within the Holarctic realm, {{there are}} a variety of {{ecosystem}}s. The type of ecosystem found in an area depends on the latitude and local geography. In the far north, a band of <b>arctic</b> tundra <b>circles</b> the shore of the Arctic Ocean. The ground beneath this land is permafrost, frozen year-round. In these difficult growing conditions, few plants can survive. South of the tundra, the boreal forest stretches across North America and Eurasia. This land is characterized by coniferous trees. South of here, the ecosystems become more diverse. Some areas are covered in temperate grassland, while others are covered in temperate forest, dominated by deciduous trees. The southern extent of the Holarctic typically reaches into the desert, which is dominated by plants and animals adapted to the dry conditions (Schultz 2007).|$|R
5|$|Bottlenose dolphins, {{the genus}} Tursiops, {{are the most}} common members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphin.
