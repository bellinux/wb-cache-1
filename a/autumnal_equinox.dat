5|$|By astronomical convention, {{the four}} seasons can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox</b> is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox</b> dates swapped.|$|E

5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox</b> or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Pitru Paksha is {{considered}} by Hindus to be inauspicious, given the death rite performed during the ceremony, known as Shraddha or tarpan. In southern and western India, it falls in the 2nd paksha (forthnight) Hindu lunar month of Bhadrapada (September) and follows the forthnight immediately after the Ganesh festival. It begins on the Pratipada (first day of the forthnight) ending with the no moon day known as Sarvapitri amavasya, Pitru Amavasya, Peddala Amavasya, Mahalaya amavasya or simply Mahalaya. Most years, the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox</b> falls within this period, i.e. the Sun transitions from the northern to the southern hemisphere during this period. In North India and Nepal, and cultures following the purnimanta calendar or the solar calendar, this period may correspond to the waning fortnight of the luni-solar month Ashvin, instead of Bhadrapada.|$|E
50|$|Many ancient monuments were {{constructed}} {{with the passing}} of the solar year in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes.</b>|$|R

[...] The footpath that led from Sapohanikan inland to the east became the foundation for Gansevoort Street, which by accident or design aligns, within one degree, to the spring and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes.</b> In recognition of this history, petitions were made to call the 14th Street Park [...] "Saphohanikan Park" [...] although it appears no formal recognition was given.|$|R
40|$|The {{geomagnetic}} activity shows the semiannual variation stronger in vernal and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes</b> than {{in summer and}} winter solstices. The semiannual variation has been explained by three main hypotheses such as Axial hypothesis, Equinoctial hypothesis, and Russell-McPherron Effect. Many studies using the various geomagnetic indices have done to support three main hypotheses. In recent, Oh & Yi (2011) examined the solar magnetic polarity dependency of the geomagnetic storm occurrence defined by Dst index. They reported {{that there is no}} dependency of the semiannual variation on the sign of the solar polar fields. This study examines the solar magnetic polarity dependency of quiet time {{geomagnetic activity}}. Using Dxt index (Karinen & Mursula 2005) and Dcx index (Mursula & Karinen 2005) which are recently suggested, in addition to Dst index, we analyze the data of three-year at each solar minimum for eight solar cycles since 1932. As a result, the geomagnetic activity is stronger in the period that the solar magnetic polarity is anti-parallel with the Earth’s magnetic polarity. There exists the difference between vernal and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes</b> regarding the solar magnetic polarity dependency. However, the difference is not statistically significant. Thus, we conclude that there is no solar magnetic polarity dependency of the semiannual variation for quiet time geomagnetic activity...|$|R
25|$|The {{chronology}} {{is sometimes}} called the Ussher-Lightfoot chronology because John Lightfoot published a similar chronology in 1642–1644. This, however, is a misnomer, as the chronology is based on Ussher's work alone and not that of Lightfoot. Ussher deduced that {{the first day of}} creation fell upon, October 23, 4004BC, in the proleptic Julian calendar, near the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox.</b> Lightfoot similarly deduced that Creation began at nightfall near the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox,</b> but in the year 3929 BC.|$|E
25|$|Some Humanists {{celebrate}} official religion-based public holidays, such as Christmas or Easter, but as secular holidays {{rather than}} religious ones. Many Humanists also celebrate {{the winter and}} summer solstice, the former of which (in the northern hemisphere) coincides closely with the religiously-oriented celebration of Christmas, and the equinoxes, of which the vernal equinox is associated with Christianity's Easter and indeed with all other springtime festivals of renewal, and the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox</b> which is related to such celebrations such as Halloween and All Souls' Day. The Society for Humanistic Judaism celebrates most Jewish holidays in a secular manner.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there is}} still-controversial {{evidence}} that Aristarchus of Samos possessed distinct {{values for the}} sidereal and tropical years as early as c. 280 BC, the discovery of precession usually is attributed to Hipparchus (190–120 BC) of Rhodes or Nicaea, a Greek astronomer. According to Ptolemy's Almagest, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis (320–260 BC) and Aristillus (~280 BC), he concluded that Spica had moved 2° relative to the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox.</b> He also compared the lengths of the tropical year (the time it takes the Sun {{to return to a}}n equinox) and the sidereal year (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving ("precessing") through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century, in other words, completing a full cycle in no more than 36000 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of a diurnal variation in meteor activity is well established. The sporadic meteor count rates are higher on the local dawn side and lower on the local dusk side. This phenomenon {{is caused by the}} Earth's orbital motion and rotation. Meteor radar measurements have been compared from Esrange, Kiruna, Sweden, at 68 degrees N, from Juliusruh, Germany, at 55 degrees N, and from Ascension Island, at 8 degrees S, to investigate how the diurnal variation depends on season at different latitudes. Data have been used from vernal and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes</b> and summer and winter solstices to locate the largest seasonal differences...|$|R
50|$|The same {{phenomenon}} {{happens in}} other cities with a uniform street grid and an unobstructed view of the horizon. If the streets on the grid were rigorously north-south and east-west, then both sunrise and sunset would be aligned {{on the days of}} the vernal and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes</b> (which occur around March 20 and September 23 respectively). In Baltimore, for instance, sunrise aligns on March 25 and September 18 and sunset on March 12 and September 29. In Chicago, the setting sun lines up with the grid system on March 20 and September 25, a phenomenon dubbed Chicagohenge.|$|R
500|$|In {{traditional}} Chinese astronomy, {{stars from}} Aries {{were used in}} several constellations. The brightest stars—Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis—formed a constellation called Lou, variously translated as [...] "bond", [...] "lasso", and [...] "sickle", which {{was associated with the}} ritual sacrifice of cattle. This name was shared by the 16th lunar mansion, the location of the full moon closest to the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox.</b> The lunar mansion represented the area where animals were gathered before sacrifice around that time. This constellation has also been associated with harvest-time as it could represent a woman carrying a basket of food on her head. 35, 39, and 41 Arietis were part of a constellation called Wei, which represented a fat abdomen and was the namesake of the 17th lunar mansion, which represented granaries. Delta and Zeta Arietis were a part of the constellation Tianyin, thought to represent the Emperor's hunting partner. Zuogeng (Tso-kang), a constellation depicting a marsh and pond inspector, was composed of Mu, Nu, Omicron, Pi, and Sigma Arietis. He was accompanied by Yeou-kang, a constellation depicting an official in charge of pasture distribution.|$|E
2500|$|Ussher further narrowed {{down the}} date {{by using the}} Jewish {{calendar}} to establish the [...] "first day" [...] of creation as falling on a Sunday near the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox.</b> The {{day of the week}} was a backward calculation from the six days of creation with God resting on the seventh, which in the Jewish tradition is Saturday—hence Creation began on a Sunday. The astronomical tables that Ussher probably used were Kepler's Tabulae Rudolphinae (Rudolphine Tables, 1627). Using them, he would have concluded that the equinox occurred on Tuesday October 25, only one day earlier than the traditional day of its creation, on the fourth day of Creation week, Wednesday, along with the Sun, Moon, and stars (Genesis 1:16). Modern equations place the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox</b> of 4004 BC on Sunday October 23 Julian.|$|E

Libeskind's design called for the Oculus space to be left open, forming a [...] "Wedge of Light" [...] so that sun rays around the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox</b> would hit the World Trade Center footprints each September. In early 2004, the Port Authority, which owns the land, modified the Libeskind plan to include a large transportation station downtown, intended to rival Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal. In a nod to the Libeskind concept, the Oculus was built to maximize the effect of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinox</b> rays (coinciding with the skylight opening on or around September 11 every year).|$|E
25|$|The {{wind turbine}} {{originally}} operated on a wind farm in Denmark, which resold the wind turbine while repowering to newer, larger wind turbines.

The display includes walkways that align {{with the wind}} turbine's shadow at solar noon and two hours, eleven minutes after solar noon, respectively. On the vernal and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes,</b> the wind turbine's shadow also aligns with the walkways by length. Thus the wind turbine functions as a large gnomon in an incomplete sundial. The display includes boxes of light bulbs encased in concrete {{on one side of}} a plaza around the wind turbine's base, representing the amount of electricity consumed by the average American household in a year.|$|R
5|$|The Sun {{has been}} an object of veneration in many {{cultures}} throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the sky, whose presence above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun {{was thought to be}} a solar deity or other supernatural entity. Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Such is {{the theory}} of the [...] "Allgemeine Erdkunde" [...] (Hahn, Hochstetter and Pokorny, Prague, 1872). An {{explanation}} should be added of the reason why the cool wind ceases to blow, at the time when the air, heated and raised by a perpendicular sun, might be expected to cause a greater indraught. We at once, I have said, recognize its correctness at sea. The Gaboon, [...] "in the belt of calms, with rain during the whole year," [...] has two distinctly marked dry seasons, at the vernal and the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes.</b> The former or early rains (Nchangyá?) are expected to begin in February, with violent tornadoes and storms, especially at the full and change, and to end in April. The heavy downfalls are mostly at night, possibly an effect of the Sierra del Crystal. I found March 28th (1862) very like damp weather {{at the end of an}} English May; April 6th was equally exceptional, raining from dawn to evening. During my trip to Sánga-Tánga and back (March 25th to 29th) we had frequent fogs, locally called [...] "smokes," [...] and almost daily tornadoes, sometimes from the south-east, whilst the lightning was dangerous as upon the Western prairies. After an interval of fiery sun, with occasional rain torrents and discharges of electricity, begin the Enomo (Enun?), the [...] "middle" [...] or long dries, which last four months to September. The [...] "Enomo" [...] is the Angolan Cacimbo, meaning cool and cloudy weather, when no umbrella is required, and when the invariably grey sky rarely rains. Travellers are told that June and July are the cream of the year, the healthiest time for seasoned Europeans, and this phantom of a winter renders the climate more supportable to the northern constitution.|$|R
40|$|Earlier, {{the shape}} of histograms {{of the results of}} {{measurements}} obtained in processes of different physical nature had been shown to be determined by cosmophysical factors [1]. Appearance of histograms of a similar shape is repeated periodically: these are the near- a-day, near- 27 -days and annual periods of increased probability of the similar shapes. There are two distinctly distinguished near-a-day periods: the sidereal-day (1, 436 min- utes) and solar-day (1, 440 minutes) ones. The annual periods are represented by three sub-periods: the “calendar” (365 average solar days), “tropical” (365 days 5 hours and 48 minutes) and “sidereal” (365 days 6 hours and 9 minutes) ones. The tropical year period indicates that fact that histogram shape depends on the time elapsed since the spring equinox [2]. The latter dependence is studied in more details in this work. We demonstrate that the appearance of similar histograms is highly probable at the same time count o from the moments of equinoxes, independent from the geographic lo- cation where the measurements had been performed: in Pushchino, Moscow Region (54 NL, 37 EL), and in Novolazarevskaya, Antarctic (70 SL, 11 EL). The sequence of the changed histogram shapes observed at the spring equinoxes was found to be op- posite to that observed at the <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes.</b> As the moments of equinoxes are defined by the cross of the celestial equator by Sun, we also studied that weather {{is not the same as}} observed at the moments when the celestial equator was crossed by other celestial bodies — the Moon, Venus, Mars and Mercury. Let us, for simplicity, refer to these moments as a similar term “planetary equinoxes”. The regularities observed at these “planetary equinoxes” had been found to be the same as in the case of true solar equinoxes.

40|$|Even on a grey {{day with}} an {{overcast}} sky there is normally {{an excess of}} light outdoors in comparison with what is required at most work places indoors. This excess of light can be harvested, concentrated and distributed indoors by fiber optics to replace most of the electrical lighting that is used today. A system suggested in this report, 1 -axial turning troughs, is predicted to have an efficiency of between 33 and 16 % in utilising the collected light. It tracks the sun merely for its altitude {{and not in the}} east-west direction. In doing so it could have an operation period of five hours each day with its peak efficiency at noon, if the system is south oriented. This system is dependent on unblocked sunlight and would have to be combined with an alternative light source to provide continuous lighting. Provided clear weather a collector area of less than 5 m 2 is predicted to be sufficient for an office of 100 m 2 located in Copenhagen. With this location the system could deliver at least 500 lux of illumination five hours a day between the vernal and <b>autumnal</b> <b>equinoxes,</b> when the sun is visible. This level of illumination meets the recommendations for several situations. The system would also include the possibility to produce hot water by utilising the infrared portion of the sunrays. At least three fiber optic daylighting systems exist already. It is the Japanese Himawari, the German SOLUX and the American Hybrid Lighting. They are all 2 -axial tracking systems that depend on sunlight. The first two utilises Fresnel lenses to concentrate the light and the third uses a reflecting parabola. There is also a wide variety of other daylighting systems that are more or less actively light collecting and that utilises either sunlight or diffuse light from the sky. There are several benefits of using daylight for lighting purposes, energy savings being one of them. Not only is electric lighting replaced, but also unwanted heating produced by this lighting is reduced. Correctly designed a daylighting system can both filter away unwanted heat in the light and supply heat to the building depending on the season. Other benefits of daylighting include health advantages and psychological benefits that have been shown in studies. Some concrete examples are less absenteeism at work places and better performance by students in daylighted schools. To design a fiber optic daylighting system several aspects have to be considered. The collected light has to be concentrated to pass through the aperture made up by the fiber end. The fiber will only accept and transmit light within its acceptance angle, which can range from less than 20 ° and up to over 80 °. This makes it desirable to utilise a high power light source supplying light with uniform direction. The sun is such a light source, the sunrays incident on the earth are close to parallel. However, the availability of sunlight is unpredictable in most climates: the sun can disappear behind clouds for a second or for days. These conditions should be the main consideration for the designer of fiber optic daylighting systems. It should also be kept in mind that all optical elements in the system will cause light losses. This includes the optical fiber that will cause a loss ranging from more than 15 % and down to 5 % per metre, depending on the material. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
