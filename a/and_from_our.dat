Their sound has been likened to rock groups Helmet, Rage Against the Machine, and Tool. The moniker [...] "intense" [...] has frequently {{been used as a}} description. Rick Anderson of Allmusic called the music [...] "dense and crunchy", while Albuquerque Journal writer Ron Gonzales declared it a [...] "blisteringly heavy sound." [...] Commenting on their musical style, Schwab said, [...] "Our goal as a band has been to never make the same record twice. The only rule is that there are no rules. If there is a rule, it's that we try not to over-think things, that the music that comes out is honest and real, spontaneous <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{vehicles}} with increased fuel efficiency is usually considered positive {{in the short}} term but criticism of any hydrocarbon-based personal transport remains. [...] The Jevons paradox suggests that energy efficiency programs are often counter-productive, even increasing energy consumption in the long run. Many environmental researchers believe that sustainable transport may require a move away from hydrocarbon fuels <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> present automobile and highway paradigm.|$|E
2500|$|One {{fragment}} (fragment 583) {{appears to}} be a lament by Procne about the status of married women. [...] In the Lloyd-Jones translation, this passage begins [...] "But now I am nothing on my own. [...] But I have often regarded the nature of women in this way, seeing that we amount to nothing." [...] The passage goes on to note that as children living with their father girls [...] "live the happiest life." [...] But then they are [...] "pushed out and sold, away from our paternal gods <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> parents, some to foreign husbands, some to barbarians, some to joyless homes, and some to homes that are opprobrious." [...] But regardless, they must approve and be happy with their lot. [...] Fitzpatrick believes that the tension between husband and wife was one of the themes of the play. [...] The tension between families by marriage and families by birth may also be a theme, as by raping Philomela, Tereus betrays the trust of Procne's and Philomela's father Pandion.|$|E

2500|$|In 1120 Suero {{made several}} deals with his {{relatives}} {{to gain control}} over their shares of the monastery of Cornellana, thus gaining sole proprietorship. That year he made two donations to the [...] monastery (22 January and 8 November). At Lugo on 7 March 1122, {{in the presence of}} the royal court, Suero and Enderquina donated Cornellana to the Abbey of Cluny. Along with Cornellana itself they donated a block of properties [...] "acquired by inheritance or by [...] own efforts" [...] (de parentibus nostris vel de nostris ganantiis, [...] "from our parents <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> purchases"). All the lands Cluny received amounted to [...] "fifty-six different properties scattered across a vast area, as well as four monasteria , six churches and a castle (castellum)." [...] Suero had received one church (ecclesiam) and three or four monasteries (monasteria) from Queen Urraca [...] "by charter" [...] (per incartationes), another three and a half churches plus a portion (portionem) in another he had inherited (called hereditates) or purchased (called gananciales). These were all proprietary churches he owned, but the difference between ecclesiae and monasteria is not clear. Cluny also received estates (villas) and male and female slaves (servos et ancillas). The donation was confirmed by Urraca, Alfonso VII, the queen's daughter Sancha Raimúdez, Diego Gelmírez, Pelayo of Oviedo, Diego of León, Peter III of Lugo, the prior of the monastery of San Zoilo de Carrión, and a [...] "curious mixture of [...] Galicians and Asturians". The charter was drawn up by a canon of the Cathedral of León who had probably followed the royal court to Lugo.|$|E
