5|$|Friedland was {{a central}} battery ironclad with the {{armament}} concentrated <b>amidships.</b> Like most ironclads of her era she was fitted with a plough-shaped ram.|$|E
5|$|The {{hull and}} single funnel <b>amidships</b> were both {{finished}} in black paint, {{with a single}} white stripe running {{the length of the}} hull highlighting a row of false gunports. The hull was flat-bottomed, with no external keel, and with bulges low on each side <b>amidships</b> which continued toward the stern in an unusual implementation of tumblehome—a result of the late decision to install propeller engines, which were wider at the base than the originally planned paddlewheel engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{width of}} the keel was {{increased}} {{to provide a more}} rigid structure <b>amidships</b> to resist stress while docking.|$|E

25|$|Usually otter {{trawlers}} {{have the}} superstructure forward, {{though it can}} be aft or <b>amidship.</b> Gallows are on the stern quarters or there is a stern gantry for operating the otter boards. Pelagic trawlers can use fish pumps to empty the cod end.|$|R
25|$|Replenishment at sea {{can take}} place over the bow, over the stern, or <b>amidship.</b> Liquid and dry goods as well as {{passengers}} weighing up to 250 kilograms can be transferred this way. Vertical replenishment via helicopters {{can take place}} over the helideck and/or the foredeck.|$|R
5|$|Originally {{classified}} as an armored corvette, Kniaz Pozharsky was redesignated as an armored frigate on 20 November 1866. She {{was laid out}} as a central battery ironclad with the armament concentrated <b>amidships.</b> The ship was fitted with a ram and her crew numbered approximately 495 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{was divided into}} three decks, the upper two for passengers and the lower for cargo. The two passenger decks were divided into forward and aft compartments, separated by the engines and boiler <b>amidships.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} three smoke stacks <b>amidships</b> for its boilers, but the forward stack was non-functioning; only added for {{aesthetic}} purposes. The ship began service with the Hudson River Day Line as their flagship steamer from 1913 to 1926.|$|E
50|$|The Lotus 23 was {{designed}} by Colin Chapman as a small-displacement sports racing car. Nominally a two-seater, it was purpose-built for FIA Group 4 racing in 1962-1963. Unlike its predecessors Lotus 15 and 17, the engine was mounted <b>amidship</b> behind the driver in the similar configuration developed on Lotus 19.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pike uttered {{these words}} sharply {{from the bridge}} above. A light and graceful bridge of steel rods and {{planking}} ran {{the full length of}} the Elsinore, starting from the poop, crossing the <b>amidship</b> house and the forecastle, and connecting with the forecastle-head at the very bow of the ship.|$|R
50|$|The Vistafjord {{was built}} {{with a very}} {{traditional}} ocean liner profile, with the funnel placed <b>amidship</b> and a notable sheer on her hull. The superstructure is terraced both at the fore and aft of the ship. In two refits during her Cunard Line career additional structures {{were added to the}} rear and top of the superstructure.|$|R
5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her fore and aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed <b>amidships.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the Portland-class cruisers were {{designed}} with space to be outfitted as fleet flagships, with accommodations for an Admiral {{and his staff}} to operate. The class also featured two aircraft catapult <b>amidships,</b> and she could carry four aircraft which were stored in a hangar. Her total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 848, a wartime complement of 952, and a complement 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship.|$|E

50|$|On 1 October 1941 Sisu, {{together}} with Nuoli, was patrolling east of Gogland {{when it came}} across a large, stationary Soviet minesweeper of the Fugas class. Sisu missed with her first torpedo, having mistaken the foam painted on the minesweepers bow for an indication that it was actually moving. A second torpedo hit the minesweeper <b>amidship</b> and sank her.|$|R
50|$|The ship carries one H/PJ-26 76 mm main gun placed forward. 2 x 2 cell C-802A Anti-ship {{missiles}} are {{installed in the}} ship for anti surface role. Two H/PJ-17 30 mm remote controlled gun turrets at <b>amidship</b> work as CIWS for the ship. For air defence, she carries an eight-cell FL-3000N launcher, which is the Chinese version of RAM.|$|R
60|$|As, at last, {{the boat}} was hooked from the bow along toward the gangway <b>amidship,</b> its keel, while yet some inches {{separated}} from the hull, harshly grated as on a sunken coral reef. It proved a huge bunch of conglobated barnacles adhering below the water to the side like a wen--a token of baffling airs and long calms passed somewhere in those seas.|$|R
5|$|Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts and Chief Engineer Thomas Lloyd {{designed}} the ship. To minimise risk they copied the hull {{design of the}} large wooden frigate , modifying it for iron construction and to accommodate an armoured box, or citadel, <b>amidships</b> along the single gun deck, which protected most of the ship's guns. Ships with this configuration of guns and armour are classified as broadside ironclads.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{armament}} included eighteen 15cm (5.9inch) SK L/40 guns; {{six were}} emplaced in single turrets <b>amidships</b> and twelve were mounted in MPL casemates. These guns fired armor-piercing shells {{at a rate}} of 4–5 per minute. The ships carried 120 shells per gun, for a total of 2,160 rounds total. The guns could depress to −7degrees and elevate to 20degrees, for a maximum range of 13,700m (14,990yd). They were manually elevated and trained.|$|E
5|$|The Audacious-class ironclads {{were laid}} out as central battery ironclads with the {{armament}} concentrated <b>amidships.</b> They were the first British ironclads to have a two-deck battery with the upper deck guns sponsoned out over {{the sides of the}} hull. The ships were fitted with a short, plough-shaped ram and their crew numbered 450 officers and men.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{could see}} {{there was some}} {{confusion}} on board. They hadn't reckoned that we carried such heavy metal, and our luck in getting both shots on board must have surprised them. Then her bow paid off, there was {{a puff of smoke}} <b>amidship,</b> and a ball from the long swivel gun buzzed overhead, passing through our mainsail without touching mast or stay.|$|R
60|$|Burke {{saw that}} he had not yet made the {{impression}} that he desired. He wanted, without actually saying so, to let this somewhat supercilious lady know that if the possession of money was a reason for social position,--and he knew of no other reason for the Buskirks' position,--Mrs. Cliff would be aft, talking to the Captain while the Buskirks would be walking about by themselves <b>amidship.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the reason," [...] said Euphemia. On we {{went and}} on, the yacht seeming {{sometimes}} a little restive and impatient, and sometimes rolling more than I could see any necessity for, but still it proceeded. Euphemia sat {{in the shadow of}} the cabin, serene and thoughtful, and I, holding the tiller steadily <b>amidship,</b> leaned back and gazed up into the clear blue sky.|$|R
5|$|The Océan-class ironclads were {{designed}} by Henri Dupuy de Lôme as an improved version of the s. The ships were central battery ironclads with the armament concentrated <b>amidships.</b> For {{the first time in}} a French ironclad three watertight iron bulkheads were fitted in the hull. Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward section}} lies on its port side, with the <b>amidships</b> section keel up. The stern section {{rises from the}} seabed at an angle. This {{position}} shows the rudder locked into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' {{to bear on the}} German ships.|$|E

25|$|Unusually for {{a cruise}} ship of her time, the Homeric was built with a {{somewhat}} ocean liner-like layout, with her dining room in particular reflecting liner-like design, being located on a lower deck. She was also built with a sizeable promenade deck and a one-deck-high theatre. She was built with two swimming pools, one {{to the rear of}} the ship and another <b>amidship</b> which was covered with a magrodome.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the Enchantment of the Seas was {{overhaul}}ed. Part of overhaul included {{stretching the}} vessel by cutting {{it in two}} <b>amidship</b> and adding a 73 ft long section. Enchantment of the Seas entered dry dock at Keppel Verolme shipyards in Rotterdam on 15 May 2005. The mid-body extension section was built at Aker Finnyards ahead of time, allowing the construction {{to be done in}} just over a month.|$|R

5|$|The ship's main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four BL 9.2-inch Mark X guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Her secondary armament of ten BL 7.5-inch Mark II guns were mounted <b>amidships</b> in single turrets. Anti-torpedo boat defence {{was provided by}} sixteen QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 18-cwt guns. Shannon also mounted five submerged 17.7-inch torpedo tubes, {{one of which was}} mounted in the stern.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun <b>amidships</b> was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E
5|$|Four shipbuilders {{submitted}} bids: the Italian Gio. Ansaldo & C. led a {{group that}} also included the Austro-Hungarian Škoda Works and the French Marrel Freres Forges de La Loire et du Midi; the French Schneider-Creusot firm partnered with Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée and Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde; the Spanish Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval (SECN), which was formed by Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth, and John Brown & Company; {{and a group of}} Spanish industrialists backed by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company and William Beardmore and Company. Only the first three proposals were seriously considered, as the fourth was considered to be too vague. The Junta Superior de la Armada (the Navy Staff) and the Navy Minister were responsible for reviewing the three proposals. Ansaldo prepared two design variants; the first called for four twin gun turrets for the main battery, with one forward, one aft, and two offset <b>amidships.</b> The second proposal had two triple turrets, fore and aft, with a twin turret on the centerline <b>amidships.</b> Artillery experts in the Navy rejected the second variant. The SECN and Schneider designs also featured the same arrangement as the first Ansaldo proposal.|$|E
5000|$|On December 7, 1941, Miller, a crewman aboard West Virginia, awoke at 06:00. After serving breakfast mess, he was {{collecting}} laundry when at 07:57 Lieutenant Commander Shigeharu Murata {{from the}} [...] launched {{the first of}} nine torpedoes that would hit West Virginia. When the [...] "Battle Stations" [...] alarm went off, Miller headed for his battle station, an anti-aircraft battery magazine <b>amidship,</b> {{only to discover that}} a torpedo had destroyed it.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{original}} documentation for the C5 program but a document from 12 May 1939 listed two plans (likely) for competitive evaluation. One plan was to be called A3 for [...] "Aviation 3", with two seaplanes. The second plan was to be called SA1 for [...] "Sans-Aviation 1" [...] that was proposed without naval aviation facilities. Both designs {{would be based on}} the Algérie, such as a flush deck, bridge tower structure and protection. The major innovation of the C5 over the C4 was the adoption of three triple mounted 203 mm/55 guns guns., which was influenced by the De Grasse-class light cruisers. This gave the C5, not only a single gun advantage over most contemporary heavy cruiser designs, which usually had an eight gun 4 × 2 gun configuration, but also reduced the necessary centreline length required by eliminating the <b>amidship</b> turret. This elimination of the <b>amidship</b> turret also allowed for additional anti-aircraft guns (in the case of the SA1 design) or an enlarged seaplane hangar (in the case of the A3 design).|$|R
