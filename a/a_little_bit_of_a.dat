We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wild child.

Criss offered the insight: [...] "Blaine definitely had his moment in the sun. I think it's time to focus back on the characters that fans of the show really know and love. Completely objectively from watching the show, I was like, 'Why does Blaine get all these songs? This is ridiculous. I want to hear other people doing stuff.'

500|$|When writing lyrics for {{previous}} releases, Moore would [...] "start mumbling and I try {{to figure}} out what I'm saying and then try to make it make sense". With Blood, he [...] "really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent. I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables. And if you can write some words and lyrics that match that, sometimes it flows really well." [...] He described all the songs as based on [...] "personal experiences". [...] "I'll start writing a song that has <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." ...|$|E

[...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can {{be a bit of a}} stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me.

500|$|Bennet cut {{her hair}} for the season, {{in order to}} further her character's {{transformation}} to the Daisy Johnson / Quake of the comics, while not cutting her hair as short as her comic counterpart. Bennet stated, [...] "The comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair." [...] Bennet also received a new costume for the season, along with Quake's signature gauntlets. On the costume, Foley said, [...] "It's about strength. She feels very empowered in it....I wanted to stay true to some of the designs I saw in the comics. In the style lines, I wanted to pay <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tribute to [...] tactical ability from last season, but we also incorporated the Quake symbol into her gauntlets and {{on the back of her}} suit." [...] Legacy Effects created the gauntlets and utility belt, [...] "out of flexible materials painted to look like metal" [...] so as not to injure anyone during stunts.|$|E
500|$|The {{two songs}} {{performed}} by Artie and Quinn were not reviewed as enthusiastically. Both Futterman and Slezak {{approved of the}} harmonies in [...] "I'm Still Standing", though Futterman thought the number felt [...] "more subdued than we'd expect", and Slezak wrote that [...] "the song choice was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> groaner" [...] before he appended a [...] "B" [...] grade. Chaney gave the song a [...] "C" [...] and said that [...] "something about this segment wasn’t as dynamic {{as it should have}} been". Votta and Strecker both described the performance as [...] "pleasant", the latter also added a [...] "B−" [...] grade. Strecker gave a [...] "B" [...] to the other song, [...] "Up Up Up", which she said was [...] "mostly background music" [...] and the song itself [...] "not particularly memorable". Chaney's [...] "B" [...] was far more complimentary: she characterized the performance as [...] "the most energetic set piece of the night" [...] which [...] "made nice use of the infectious Givers song". Futterman thought that [...] "the sugary vocals work well for Artie and Quinn", but Votta wrote that [...] "the vocal is so indistinct it could be anyone".|$|E

Moore, the band's vocalist and lyricist, has described {{the process of writing}} lyrics as an [...] "audio Rorschach test". The lyrics on Office of Strategic Influence feature political themes, but the lyrics on later releases are less political, instead being based on Moore's personal experiences. [...] "I'll start writing a song that has <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that."

Of her crazy crush, DeGarmo said: [...] "Ooh, she wants him bad! Angie has her eyes, her heart and her body set on landing Kevin — and it scares him to death." [...] She said that Kevin was too sweet and nervous, and is weakened to Angelina's preying on him. [...] "She loves seeing him squirm" [...] DeGarmo stated. Of working with Rikaart, she said: [...] "Greg and I can't stop laughing during our scenes together." [...] During an interview with MSN, she stated: [...] "I've had the great pleasure sharing the screen with Mr. Greg Rikaart. Angelina gets <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crush on Kevin, and she's not afraid not to show it. It's a blast, because she makes him incredibly nervous [...] The sparks that fly on screen are just hilarious. It's wonderful {{to be a part}} of." [...] Just before Kevin was set to marry his girlfriend Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson), Angelina persuaded him to help her escape town, as she was in danger. They returned home safe.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} October 2003, at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, New York.

Spears stated, [...] "The video is more sensual than I'm used to [...] It was my first time doing a collaboration and I got Madonna. It's really interesting to see the two different styles together." [...] Kevin Tancharoen was the choreographer of the video. The vehicle used in the video, a Mazda RX-8, was autographed by Spears on the hood and auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, [...] "Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So {{it was a challenge}} to kind of bring both of the worlds together. I wanted it to {{be a bit of a}} cat-and-mouse sort of game and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreplay between Britney and Madonna and just sort of tease the audience." ...|$|E
