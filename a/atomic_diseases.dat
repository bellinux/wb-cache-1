40|$|For many years, Nagasaki University, {{particularly}} the <b>Atomic</b> Bomb <b>Disease</b> Institute, has {{been engaged in}} research regarding the late health effects of radiation exposure in Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Since 1991, we have participated in several Chernobyl projects including the Chernobyl Sasakawa Medical Cooperation Project which demonstrated a marked increase {{in the incidence of}} childhood thyroid cancer around Chernobyl, especially in the Gomel region, Belarus. Furthermore, we have performed both fieldwork and research to clarify the late effects of radiation exposure around Semipalatinsk Nuclear Testing Site and participated in bilateral official medical assistance projects between Japan and Kazakhstan to strengthen the medical infrastructure in this area. Through these humanitarian and scientific projects, we have been collaborating closely with our counterparts in the former USSR for the past 15 years.

5000|$|The {{monument}} {{is located}} in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan. Designed by native artists Kazuo Kikuchi and Kiyoshi Ikebe, the monument was built using money derived from a fund-raising campaign by Japanese school children, including Sadako Sasaki's classmates, with the main statue entitled [...] "Atomic Bomb Children". The statue was unveiled on 5 May 1958, the Japanese Children's Day holiday. Sadako Sasaki, who died of an <b>atomic</b> bomb <b>disease</b> radiation poisoning is immortalized {{at the top of}} the statue, where she holds a wire crane above her head. Shortly before she passed, she had a vision to create a thousand cranes. Japanese tradition says that if one creates a thousand cranes, they are granted one wish. Sadako's wish was to have a world without nuclear weapons. Thousands of origami cranes from all over the world are offered around the monument. They serve as a sign that the children who make them and those who visit the statue desire a world without nuclear war, having been tied to the statue by the story that Sadako died from radiation-induced leukemia after folding just under a thousand cranes, wishing for world peace. However, an exhibit which appeared in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum stated that by the end of August 1955, Sadako had achieved her goal and continued to fold more cranes. Unfortunately, her wish was not granted and she died of the leukemia on October 25, 1955. Her main reason of death was from the radiation poisoning from the atomic bomb Little Boy.|$|R
40|$|Amyloids are {{fibrous protein}} {{aggregates}} defined by shared specific structural features. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid in organs leads to amyloidosis, {{which results in}} various neurodegenerative <b>diseases.</b> <b>Atomic</b> force microscopy (AFM) {{has proven to be}} an excellent tool investigating amyloids; it has been extensively utilized to characterize its morphology, assembly process, and mechanical properties. This review summarizes studies which applied AFM to detect the inter- and intramolecular interactions of amyloid fibrils and classified the influencing factors of amyloid’s nanomechanics in detail. The characteristics of amyloid fibrils driven by inter- and intramolecular interactions, including various morphologies of amyloid fibrils, self-assembly process, and the aggregating pathway, are described. Successful examples where AFM provided abundant information about inter- and intramolecular interactions of amyloid fibrils in different environments are presented. Direct force measurement of intra- or intermolecular interactions utilizing an AFM-based tool, single-molecular force spectroscopy (SMFS), is introduced. Some mechanical information such as elasticity, adhesiveness, and strength was obtained by stretching amyloid fibrils.

30|$|We {{report on}} the use of three {{different}} atomic force spectroscopy modalities to determine the nanomechanical properties of amyloid fibrils of the human α-synuclein protein. α-Synuclein forms fibrillar nanostructures of approximately 10 nm diameter and lengths ranging from 100 nm to several microns, which have been associated with Parkinson's <b>disease.</b> <b>Atomic</b> force microscopy (AFM) has been used to image the morphology of these protein fibrils deposited on a flat surface. For nanomechanical measurements, we used single-point nanoindentation, in which the AFM tip as the indenter is moved vertically to the fibril surface and back while the force is being recorded. We also used two recently developed AFM surface property mapping techniques: Harmonic force microscopy (HarmoniX) and Peakforce QNM. These modalities allow extraction of mechanical parameters of the surface with a lateral resolution and speed comparable to tapping-mode AFM imaging. Based on this phenomenological study, the elastic moduli of the α-synuclein fibrils determined using these three different modalities are within the range 1.3 - 2.1 GPa. We discuss the relative merits of these three methods for the determination of the elastic properties of protein fibrils, particularly considering the differences and difficulties of each method.|$|R
40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} trace elements (TE) in human intervertebral disc (IVD) tissue. Trace element presence can have diverse meanings: essential TE show the metabolic modalities of the tissue, while environmentally-related TE indicate pollution and tissue-specific absorption and accumulation. IVD {{is a highly}} specific compartment with impaired communication with adjacent bone. Analysis of TE in IVD provides new insights regarding tissue metabolism and IVD communication with other tissues. Material/Methods: Thirty intervertebral discs were acquired from 22 patients during surgical treatment for degenerative <b>disease.</b> <b>Atomic</b> absorption spectrometry {{was used to evaluate}} the concentrations of Al, Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni, Mo, Mg, and Zn. Results: Al, Pb, Cu, Mg, and Zn were detected in all samples. Pb was significantly positively correlated with age, and Ni concentration was weakly correlated with population count in the patient’s place of residence. Only Cu was ob-served in higher concentrations in IVD compared to in other tissues. Significant positive correlations were ob-served between the following pairs: Mg/Zn, Mg/Al, Mg/Pb, Zn/Al, Zn/Pb, and Al/Pb. Negative correlations were observed between Mg/Cd, Zn/Cd, Mg/Mo, and Mo/Pb. Conclusions: This study is one of few to profile the elements in intervertebral discs in patients with degenerative changes. We report significant differences between trace element concentrations in intervertebral discs compared to i...|$|R
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce various {{extracellular}} signals, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, light, and odorous chemicals, into intracellular signals via G {{protein activation}} during neurological, cardiovascular, sensory and reproductive signaling. Common and unique features of interactions between GPCRs and specific G proteins {{are important for}} structure-based design of drugs in order to treat GPCR-related <b>diseases.</b> <b>Atomic</b> resolution structures of GPCR complexes with G proteins have revealed shared and extensive interactions between the conserved DRY motif and other residues in transmembrane domains 3 (TM 3), 5 and 6, and the target G protein C-terminal region. However, the initial interactions formed between GPCRs and their specific G proteins remain unclear. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the murine olfactory receptor S 6 (mOR-S 6) indicated that the N-terminal acidic residue of helix 8 of mOR-S 6 is responsible for initial transient and specific interactions with chimeric Gα 15 _olf, resulting in a response that is 2. 2 -fold more rapid and 1. 7 -fold more robust than the interaction with Gα 15. Our mutagenesis analysis indicates that the hydrophobic core buried between helix 8 and TM 1 – 2 of mOR-S 6 {{is important for the}} activation of both Gα 15 _olf and Gα 15. This review focuses on the functional role of the C-terminal amphipathic helix 8 based on several recent GPCR studies...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{cooperation}} between <b>Atomic</b> Bomb <b>Disease</b> Institute (ABDI) of Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Institute of Nuclear Medicine of Hiroshima University and Radiation Effect Research Foundation (RERF), the Life Span Study (LSS) on 93, 741 survivors (fixed cohort) and the Open City Study (OCS) on all survivors (unfixed) irrespective {{of whether they}} belonged to LSS or not, have been conducted in parallel over 45 years to ensure reliable case detection. For diagnosis and subtyping of detected leukemias, we adopted the FAB classifcation for acute leukemias and for exposure dose of individual survivors, the new dosimetry system 1986 (DS 86). In LSS, 231 leukemia cases were analysed. There was strong evidence of radiation-induced risks for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but not for adult T-cell leukemia (an endemic disease in Nagasaki area) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. There was also significant difference between three major types {{with respect to the}} effects of age at bombing and sex, and in the temporal pattern of the elevated risks. For AML the dose response function was non-linear, whereas there was no evidence against linearity for ALL and CML. The hypothesis of a 0. 5 Gy threshold could be rejected for three major types of leukemia. Excess Absolute Risk (EAR) estimates in cases per 10, 000 Person Year Sievert (PYSv) were 0. 6, 1. 1, 0. 9 for ALL, AML and CML, respectively. The corresponding relative risk at 1. 0 Sv were 9. 1, 3. 3, 6. 2, respectively. Although childhood exposure < 15 age at bombing apparently induced three major types, the agerelated highest risk was observed for ALL. In OCS, 413 cases with DS 86 estimates were used for analysis. Type specific incidence rates were calculated indirectly by using the over all incidence of leukemia from LSS data and multiplying these values by the corresponding proportions of cases in OCS. In conjunction with LSS data, the effects of radiation were significantly greater on the incidences of ALL and CML than on that of AML. In the high dose group there was a strong evidence for shorter incubation time and faster decline of elevated risk for ALL and CML than for AML. AML risk was apparently persistent through 1980. Thus, the differential effects of atomic bomb irradiation in inducing three major types of leukemia with respect of age-related and temporal patterns provide us insights into human leukemogenesis. Further investigation on radiation leukememogenesis undoubtedly requires molecular approach to detect type-specific genetic abnormlities including oncogenes and anti-oncogenes...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{dissertation}} is to develop noninvasive imaging techniques that allow us not only to detect diseased cells but also to study the molecular mechanisms underlying these <b>diseases.</b> <b>Atomic</b> force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy are applied to measure cellular mechanical properties (e. g. Young’s Modulus, adhesion force) and biochemical composition of living cancerous vs. healthy (A 549 vs. SAEC) human lung epithelial cells. These biomechanical and biochemical properties can be utilized to differentiate between cancerous A 549 and healthy SAEC human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, different cellular responses to anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) treatment are also observed. Using AFM and Raman spectroscopy, we can quantitatively measure biophysical properties of different cells, as complementary parameters to other properties (e. g. gene and protein expression), helping identify the states of diseased cells. Another major task of this dissertation is to develop noninvasive imaging techniques to detect cancer biomarker epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at single cell level using advanced instrumentation. We first synthesized a gold nanorod (AuNR) -based nanoprobe for single-cell imaging of EGFR using surface-enhance Raman spectroscopy (SERS). SERS is able to quantitatively measure the EGFR expression level in different breast cancer cell lines and map the cellular distribution of EGFR in single cells. Moreover, SERS, as a noninvasive imaging technique, is able to monitor the process of nanoparticle uptake by single cell. Due to the diffraction limit of optical microscopy, SERS is unable to provide nanoscale imaging resolution. We then applied an AFM-based simultaneous Topography and RECognition (TREC) imaging technique to image EGFR with nanoscale resolution. TREC is first validated on mica surface and then successfully utilized to map the EGFR distribution in fixed and living breast cancer cells at single molecule level. In addition, we have explored the potential of a gadolinium-gold (Gd-Au) composite nanomaterial as a dual functional (MRI-SERS) imaging probe. Using this previous reported MRI contrast agent, we successfully apply SERS function in the detection of EGFR in three cancer cell lines. The {{last part of the}} dissertation is to study fat-responsive G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR 120), and its interaction with linoleic acid (LA). We have synthesized a dual functional composite nanoparticle for SERS-fluorescence bimodal imaging of GRP 120 in living HEK 293 cells. By SERS-fluorescence imaging, we are able to locate GPR 120 distribution in single cells. Moreover, we have observed a dose-dependent GPR 120 response to LA treatments using SERS. This work demonstrates the potential to use SERS-fluorescence bimodal imaging technique for real-time detection of the interaction between fatty acids and their receptors (e. g. GPR 120, CD 36) ...|$|R
