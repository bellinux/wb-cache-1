30|$|Image quality {{analysis}} anyway confirmed data already reported in literature, supporting {{the efficiency of}} the novel IR methods if compared to standard reconstruction algorithms such as FBP [17, 18]. Regarding noise, it initially increased while mAs values were lowered using FBP reconstruction. The application of iDose constantly reduced it, even at decreasing mAs, and IMR kept it low while tube loading reduced to 50 mAs. Below this value, noise increased with a consequent degradation of the image quality due to IR limits at very low mAs values [19]. It was observed that the uniformity values were within the <b>advised</b> <b>limit</b> (ΔHU[*]≤[*] 4) [20]. iDOSE provided, therefore, a similar image resolution to that obtained with FBP at significantly higher mAs values. Our results represent, therefore, a valuable confirmation that the use of IR algorithms preserves the spatial resolution while reducing mAs [21], except at very low tube load (i.e. <[*] 50 mAs) where a very small decrease in spatial resolution was found [19].|$|E
40|$|Marfan {{syndrome}} (MFS) is a {{connective tissue}} disorder in which aortic rupture {{is the major}} cause of death. MFS patients with an aortic diameter below the <b>advised</b> <b>limit</b> for prophylactic surgery (< 5 [*]cm) may unexpectedly experience an aortic dissection or rupture, despite yearly monitoring. Hence, {{there is a clear}} need for improved prognostic markers to predict such aortic events. We hypothesize that elastin fragments play a causal role in aortic calcification in MFS, and that microcalcification serves as a marker for aortic disease severity. To address this hypothesis, we analysed MFS patient and mouse aortas. MFS patient aortic tissue showed enhanced microcalcification in areas with extensive elastic lamina fragmentation in the media. A causal relationship between medial injury and microcalcification was revealed by studies in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs); elastin peptides were shown to increase the activity of the calcification marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and reduce the expression of the calcification inhibitor matrix GLA protein in human SMCs. In murine Fbn 1 (C 1039 G/+) MFS aortic SMCs, Alpl mRNA and activity were upregulated as compared with wild-type SMCs. The elastin peptide-induced ALP activity was prevented by incubation with lactose or a neuraminidase inhibitor, which inhibit the elastin receptor complex, and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase- 1 / 2 inhibitor, indicating downstream involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinase- 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) phosphorylation. Histological analyses in MFS mice revealed macrocalcification in the aortic root, whereas the ascending aorta contained microcalcification, as identified with the near-infrared fluorescent bisphosphonate probe OsteoSense- 800. Significantly, microcalcification correlated strongly with aortic diameter, distensibility, elastin breaks, and phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2. In conclusion, microcalcification co-localizes with aortic elastin degradation in MFS aortas of humans and mice, where elastin-derived peptides induce a calcification process in SMCs via the elastin receptor complex and ERK 1 / 2 activation. We propose microcalcification as a novel imaging marker to monitor local elastin degradation and thus predict aortic events in MFS patients.

Design: This study was a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis including data from case–control and cohort studies. Methods: An extensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase, with no time and language restrictions. Also, reference lists were searched manually. Two independent reviewers assessed the manuscript quality using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). A two-stage dose–response meta-analysis was applied to assess a potential association between coffee/caffeine consumption and the outcomes: TTP, SAB, clinical pregnancy, and live birth. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochrane Q-test and I 2 statistics. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s regression test. Results: The pooled results showed that coffee/caffeine consumption {{is associated with a}} significantly increased risk of SAB for 300 mg caffeine/day (relative risk [RR]: 1. 37, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]: 1. 19; 1. 57) and for 600 mg caffeine/day (RR: 2. 32, 95 % CI: 1. 62; 3. 31). No association was found between coffee/caffeine consumption and outcomes of fertility treatment (based on two studies). No clear association was found between exposure to coffee/caffeine and natural fertility as measured by fecundability odds ratio (based on three studies) or waiting TTP (based on two studies). Conclusion: Results from this meta-analysis support the growing evidence of an association between coffee/caffeine intake and the risk of SAB. However, viewing the reproductive capacity in a broader perspective, there seems to be little, if any, association between coffee/caffeine consumption and fecundity. In general, results from this study are supportive of a precautionary principle advised by health organizations such as European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and World Health Organization (WHO), although the <b>advised</b> <b>limit</b> of a maximum of two to three cups of coffee/ 200 – 300 mg caffeine per day may be too high.

If, prior to 1925, school manuals referred to working-class households, paid attention to abundant and economical food, recommended meat, hardly cared about breakfast and connected food to health in a general way, the manuals of the late 1920 s and 1930 s discussed the average consumer, <b>advised</b> <b>limited</b> meat consumption, warned against unbalanced diets that could lead to specific diseases and recommended required amounts of calories and vitamins.

40|$|Previously {{reported}} {{models for}} radioiodine in ruminants cannot {{account for the}} effect of variations in stable iodine intake including large countermeasure doses of stable iodine on the transfer of radioiodine to goat milk. A metabolically based model of radioiodine transfer in goats has been parameterised using new experimental data {{on the effect of}} countermeasure doses of stable iodine on radioiodine transfer to milk. To account for the effect of dietary stable iodine levels, the model represents the transfer of iodine from the extracellular fluid to milk with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The model shows good agreement with the experimental data, and the estimated parameters compare favourably with values which can be estimated from the literature. The parameterised model accounts for 95 % of the variation in the observed data for milk, faeces, urine and thyroid (n= 199). The model has been used to predict the effects of variation in stable iodine intake and the extent of consequent chemical contamination of milk by stable iodine. The time taken for radio-iodine to reach peak concentrations in milk following a deposition event is predicted to vary significantly (ca. 2 days) over a range of expected stable iodine intakes. Doses of stable iodine sufficient to reduce the radioiodine transfer to milk will result in stable iodine concentrations in milk greatly in excess of internationally <b>advised</b> <b>limits.</b> Therefore, we recommend that stable iodine supplementation not be used as a countermeasure to reduce radioiodine transfer to milk. Indeed, model predictions suggest that reductions in stable iodine intake would be a more effective countermeasure. However, this is unlikely to be feasible since the short physical half-life of 131 I may not allow adequate time to implement changes in feed manufacture.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Traditional and {{complementary}} healthcare approaches (TCA) {{are widely}} used for children, often because of perceived safety. Honey is a traditional remedy for upper respiratory tract symptoms in infants. Health officials currently <b>advise</b> <b>limiting</b> honey use {{because of the risk}} of botulism. OBJECTIVE: This paper discusses honey as a traditional healthcare approach for children in a multi-ethnic community, and parents' and primary healthcare practitioners' (PHPs) perceptions of its safety. DESIGN: As part of a larger study exploring beliefs about TCA, this paper focuses on perceived safety and use of honey, using data extracted for detailed analysis. Eleven parent focus groups (n= 92) and 30 interviews with PHPs were conducted. Qualitative data analysis used the Framework approach. SETTING: London Boroughs of Brent and Harrow RESULTS: TCA, particularly home remedies, dietary and religious approaches were popular for children. Honey was a particularly common TCA, reportedly used by 27 (29 %) parents for their children. Honey was believed to be traditional, acceptable, accessible, natural and safe. It was most commonly used for respiratory tract symptoms and administered with hot water and lemon juice. PHPs were more concerned about the safety of TCA than parents. Almost half (40 %) of PHPs mentioned the use of honey for children, few perceived it as a 'treatment' or were concerned about botulism. Others were aware of the risks and some reported challenges in communicating risk to parents. CONCLUSION: TCA are commonly used for children, honey in particular for respiratory tract symptoms. Parents and some PHPs appear unaware of the risk of botulism from honey use in infants. Healthcare practitioners should ask routinely about the use of honey and other TCA, and consider different parental belief systems in ethnically diverse populations.
