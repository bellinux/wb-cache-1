5|$|The British <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> been a {{volunteer}} force since national service ended during the 1960s. Since {{the creation of}} the part-time, reserve Territorial Force in 1908 (renamed the Army Reserve in 2014) the full-time British <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> been known as the Regular Army. The size and structure of the army are evolving, and the Ministry of Defence publishes monthly personnel reports.

5|$|In {{addition}} to working dress, the <b>army</b> <b>has</b> {{a number of}} parade uniforms for ceremonial and non-ceremonial occasions. The most-commonly-seen uniforms are No.1 Dress (full ceremonial, seen at formal occasions such as at {{the changing of the}} guard at Buckingham Palace) and No.2 Dress (Service Dress), a brown uniform worn for non-ceremonial parades.|$|E
5|$|The Australian <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> used tanks from {{after the}} First World War, through the interwar period, the Second World War, the Cold War {{and to the}} present day. Throughout this period the <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> {{primarily}} been a light infantry force, with its tanks mainly {{being used in the}} direct support role. The Australian Army's tanks have seen combat during the Second World War and the Vietnam War, where they proved successful despite some of the designs employed being considered obsolete. The first Australian tanks were a small number of British medium and light tanks which were operated mainly for training purposes during the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

Herwig estimated that the five German Armies from Verdun to Paris had 67,700 casualties during the battle and assumed 85,000 casualties for the French. Herwig wrote that there were 1,701 British casualties (the British Official History noted that these losses were incurred from 6-10 September). Herwig estimated 300,000 casualties for all sides at the Marne but questioned whether isolating the battle was justified.|$|R

5|$|The British <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> seen {{action in}} major wars between the world's great powers, {{including}} the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars. Britain's victories in these decisive wars {{allowed it to}} influence world events and establish itself {{as one of the}} world's leading military and economic powers. Since the end of the Cold War the British <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> deployed to a number of conflict zones, often as part of an expeditionary force, a coalition force or part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation.|$|E

5|$|The Leopard 2A6 and its longer L/55 main gun {{have been}} {{exported}} {{for use by}} the Canadian Army, and the Netherlands upgraded part of its original fleet of Leopard 2s with the more powerful armament. The British <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> tested Rheinmetall's longer gun, possibly looking to replace the current L30A1 120mm L/55 rifled main gun on the Challenger 2. Two Challenger 2s were modified to undergo firing trials. Although South Korean K2 Black Panther is equipped with a L/55 main gun and shows similar characteristics as its German counterpart, it is indigenously developed by Agency for Defense Development and World Industries Ace Corporation (WIA), a Korea-based powertrain company affiliated with Hyundai Kia Motors Group.|$|E

5|$|The Salvation <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> {{meeting rooms}} in the town, whilst the local Methodists, who {{previously}} worshipped in their own Chapel in Paul Street (built in 1810; {{it is now a}} community centre), have an agreement to share the parish church with the Anglican congregation. The Baptist Chapel in Commercial Road was built in 1801 as a Congregational Church. There were previously a number of other non-conformist chapels in Shepton, the most notable of which is the Unitarian Chapel on Cowl Street which was built in 1692 and enlarged in 1758; it is now a private dwelling.|$|E
5|$|With few modern tanks at {{the time}} of the Korean War, the Australian Army had to rely on British and US tank support. During the 1950s the Army {{standardised}} on the British Centurion tank, which saw action in Vietnam and remained in service until it was replaced with the German Leopard 1 in the mid-1970s. After an internal debate on whether the Army should continue to operate tanks as part of its force structure, the Australian Government replaced the Leopards with a small fleet of American M1A1 Abrams tanks in 2007, which are now the Army's only tanks. In addition to these types, the <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> operated small numbers of other tank designs for training and evaluation purposes.|$|E

5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to be fit for maritime operations. The <b>Army</b> <b>has</b> {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} 300,000 has been doubted, {{along with many}} of Herodotus' numbers, by many historians; modern {{consensus}} estimates {{the total number of}} troops for the Persian invasion at around 250,000. According to this consensus, Herodotus' 300,000 Persians at Plataea would self-evidently be impossible. One approach to estimating the size of the Persian <b>army</b> <b>has</b> been to estimate how many men might feasibly have been accommodated within the Persian camp; this approach gives figures of between 70,000 and 120,000 men. Lazenby, for instance, by comparison with later Roman military camps, calculates the number of troops at 70,000, including 10,000 cavalry. Meanwhile, Connolly derives a number of 120,000 from the same-sized camp. Indeed, most estimates for the total Persian force are generally in this range. For instance, Delbrück, based on the distance the Persians marched in a day when Athens was attacked, concluded that 75,000 was the upper limit for the size of the Persian army, including the supply personnel and other non-combatants. In his battle account of Plataea, Delbrück estimated the Persian army, including allied Greeks, as amounting to 40,000.|$|E
