5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued as <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> beauty engendering a sensual response, {{rather than for}} the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and {{took on a}} life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made {{the work of art}} a globally recognized icon and <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was definitively identified as the model for the Mona Lisa.|$|E

5|$|Fishermen target many sharks {{for their}} jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, is rarely <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> {{commercial}} fishing, although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens {{for example in}} some tonnare in the Mediterranean), it is misleadingly sold as smooth-hound shark.|$|E
5|$|Henry I's successors did not {{consider}} the royal touch fundamental, reducing its application. The ritual remained a marginal aspect of kingship until the 17th century, when its appeal grew to unprecedented proportions and when it suddenly became <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> scrutiny in literature.|$|E
5|$|In social circles, Aspasia {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser rather than merely <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> {{physical}} beauty. Plutarch writes that despite her immoral life, friends of Socrates brought their wives to hear her converse.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{radiocarbon}} dating techniques date <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> popular interest, {{for example the}} Shroud of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.|$|E
5|$|Some 779 {{plant species}} have been {{identified}} inside the park, being {{the queen of the}} Andes (Puya raimondii) one of the most representative and <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> conservation.

5|$|Stephen's cult emerged {{after the}} long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of his {{immediate}} successors.

Although other items associated with Tipu, including his sword, {{have recently been}} purchased and brought back to India by billionaire Vijay Mallya, Tipu's Tiger has not itself {{been the subject of}} an official repatriation request, presumably due to the ambiguity underlying Tipu's image in the eyes of Indians; his being <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> loathing in the eyes of some Indians while considered a hero by others.|$|E
5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E
5|$|As {{the statue}} became <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> a pagan veneration, missionaries and the Bishop of Vannes Charles de Rosmadec asked Claude de Lannion, Lord of Blavet Quinipily, {{to destroy the}} statue. In 1661, Lannion ordered the statue to be thrown into the Blavet river. Abundant rain {{destroyed}} the harvest soon after, which peasantry and devotees interpreted {{as an act of}} anger by their insulted idol. In 1664, the statue was drawn from the river and restored to its original location.|$|E

5|$|At the Playground, {{the former}} SSR base that {{now serves as}} S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, Director Phil Coulson recognizes the {{importance}} of the Obelisk, noting that it is the first 0-8-4, <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> unknown origin. Hydra double-agent, and S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoner, Grant Ward tells Agent Skye of secret frequencies Hydra uses to communicate, and Agent Billy Koenig intercepts Creel's next directive—to use the family of Brigadier General Glenn Talbot as leverage to find the Obelisk. Agent Melinda May, Skye, Hunter, and Hartley help Talbot fight off Creel, before abducting Talbot and deceiving him into giving them access codes for a U.S. military base near Washington, D.C. that contains numerous confiscated S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.|$|E
5|$|Slavery in Greek antiquity {{has long}} been <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had {{significant impact on the}} debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History of Slavery in Antiquity among his works for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.|$|E
5|$|The Apache was {{a valued}} form of {{close air support}} in the {{conflict}} in Afghanistan, being deployed to the region in 2006. The Apache has been <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> controversy over the fitting of some weapons, such as cluster munitions. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships.|$|E

5|$|The Great Wall of China visible today largely {{dates from}} the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often {{extending}} its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|The Pont du Gard {{has been}} a tourist {{attraction}} for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an obligatory stop for French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), {{many of whom have}} left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> historical importance and French national pride.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the plaque}} {{suggests}} it would have belonged in a shrine, possibly as <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> worship; it was probably set into a mud-brick wall. Such a shrine {{might have been a}} dedicated space in a large private home or other house, but not the main focus of worship in one of the cities' temples, which would have contained representations of gods sculpted in the round. Mesopotamian temples at the time had a rectangular cella often with niches to both sides. According to Thorkild Jacobsen, that shrine could have been located inside a brothel (see below).|$|E
