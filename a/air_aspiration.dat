Cutting height strongly affected the rehydration ability of cut flowers, and the hydraulic conductance {{of the stem}} and its restoration after <b>air</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Within a batch of flowers, rehydration ability is negatively related with the hydraulic conductance. Rehydration ability of the flowering stems of all experimentst was highly correlated with the restoration of hydraulic conductance of stem segments after <b>air</b> <b>aspiration.</b> This was demonstrated for batches from different harvest dates and cutting heights above root-shoot junction as well as cultivars. Greenhouse temperature and irradiance level affected the ability to recover from air emboli only significantly when differences in treatments were rather extreme.

40|$|The inter-related {{effects of}} nozzle clogging, argon injection, tundish bath depth, slide gate opening {{position}} and nozzle bore diameter on the flow rate and pressure in tundish nozzles are quantified using three-dimensional multiphase turbulent numerical fluid flow models. The results are validated with measurements on operating steel continuous slab-casting machines, and presented for practical conditions {{with the aid}} of an inverse model. Initial clogging is predicted to enhance the flow due to a potential streamlining effect before it becomes great enough to restrict the flow channel. The clogging condition can be detected by comparing the measured steel flow rate to the theoretical value predicted under the same conditions by the inverse model presented here. Increasing argon injection may help to reduce <b>air</b> <b>aspiration</b> by increasing the minimum pressure below the slide gate. More argon is needed to do this at intermediate casting speeds and in deeper tundishes. Argon flow should be reduced during shallow tundish and low casting speed conditions (such as encountered during a transition) in order to avoid detrimental effects on flow pattern. It should also be reduced at high casting speed, when the slide gate is open wider and the potential for <b>air</b> <b>aspiration</b> is less. The optimal argon flow rate depends on the casting speed, tundish level, and nozzle bore diameter and is quantified in this work for a typical nozzle and range of conditions...|$|E

40|$|Allegretto Eye-Q laser {{platform}} (Wavelight GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) {{was used}} to study the effect of air-flow speed on the ablation of artificial polymer corneas used for testing refractive surgery patterns. Flat samples of two materials (PMMA and Filofocon A) were ablated at four different air flow conditions. The shape and profile of the ablated surfaces were measured with a precise non-contact optical surface profilometer. Significant asymmetries in the measured profiles were found when the ablation was performed with the clinical <b>air</b> <b>aspiration</b> system, and also without air flow. Increasing air-flow produced deeper ablations, improved symmetry, and increased the repeatability of the ablation pattern. Shielding of the laser pulse by the plume of smoke during the ablation of plastic samples reduced the central ablation depth by more than 40 % with no-air flow, 30 % with clinical <b>air</b> <b>aspiration,</b> and 5 % with 1. 15 m/s air flow. A simple model based on non-inertial dragging of the particles by air flow predicts no central shielding with 2. 3 m/s air flow, and accurately predicts (within 2 μm) the decrease of central ablation depth by shielding. The shielding effects for PMMA and Filofocon A were similar despite {{the differences in the}} ablation properties of the materials and the different full-shielding transmission coefficient, which is related to the number of particles ejected and their associated optical behavior. Air flow is a key factor in the evaluation of ablation patterns in refractive surgery using plastic models, as significant shielding effects are found with typical air-flow levels used under clinical conditions. Shielding effects can be avoided by tuning the air flow to the laser repetition rate. © 2011 Optical Society of America. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic {{conductance}} of cut chrysanthemum stems {{was lowered}} by the aspiration of air {{as well as}} by a wound-induced plant response. By measuring the hydraulic conductance of stem segments in which air could be introduced into and/or removed from the xylem vessels at various times after harvest, we showed that the two processes, <b>air</b> <b>aspiration</b> and wound-induced reactions, occur independently. The pronounced xylem occlusion after a longer period of dry storage is due to the progress of the enzymatic wound-induced reaction in time superimposed on emboli due to aspired air. The wound-induced blockage was also present when air entrance was precluded from harvest. Measurements of enzyme activities in stems at time intervals from harvest showed that the activity of L- phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) increased after wounding in contrast to the activities of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase.

Immediate surgical evacuation of the haemorrhage and placement of an external ventricular drain was performed. Respirator ventilation maintaining a continuous positive airway pressure was required. Following wean-ing and extubation the patient rapidly deteriorated and became coma-tose. A cranial CT scan revealed a dilated ventricular system filled with air, and air in the subarachnoid space.

40|$|The {{quality of}} continuous-cast steel is greatly {{influenced}} by fluid flow in the mold, particularly at the meniscus. Recent examples of computational model applications at the University of Illinois are presented to investigate the formation of several different types of defects related to flow phenomena. The amount of gas injection into the tundish nozzle to avoid <b>air</b> <b>aspiration</b> is quantified by modeling. Computational model calculations of superheat transport and surface level fluctuations are presented. Meniscus defects, such as subsurface hooks and their associated inclusions, may form if the superheat contained in the steel is too low, or if top-surface level fluctuations are too large. A thermal stress model {{has been used to}} compute the distortion of the meniscus during a level fluctuation. Gas bubbles and inclusion particles may enter the mold with the steel flowing through the submerged nozzle. In addition, mold slag may be entrained from the top surface. These particles may be removed safely into the slag layer, or may become entrapped into the solidifying shell, to form sliver or blister defects in the rolled product. Transient, turbulent flow models have been applied to simulate the transport and entrapment of particles from both of these sources. The insights gained by these modeling efforts aid greatly in the development of processing conditions to avoid the formation of these defects...|$|E

It is difficult to directly measure these temperatures using contacting temperature sensors due to high vibration levels. Non-contact infrared (IR) thermography could be an important tool to experimentally determine the tip temperature. However, the low emissivity and polished cylindrical geometry of the tips complicate accurate IR thermography. In this study, we use Cr 2 O 3 high emissivity paint to coat the tip for increased accuracy in IR measurements. Temperature measurements are consistent with heat generation models based on mechanical quality factor of about 5000 for the titanium tip material.

40|$|P>Soil {{respiration}} measurements {{performed with}} closed dynamic chambers {{are very sensitive}} to pressure differences inside and outside the chamber: differences as small as 1 Pa can induce errors that are of the same magnitude as the flux itself. The problem is usually solved by adding a vent to the experimental set-up. However, although this may give acceptable results in most cases, it is not effective at sites that are very exposed to wind. At the CarboEurope-IP agricultural site of Lonzee (Belgium), on bare soil, we used a vent composed of a vertical tube whose upper end was placed between two horizontal plates. Whilst this system worked properly in low-wind conditions, it led to a significant flux over-estimation (up to 300 %) under strong wind conditions. We analysed the causes of this error and attributed it to a dynamic pressure effect at the vent, leading to <b>air</b> <b>aspiration</b> from within the chamber. We suggest that this is because the wind at the vent level was not the same as that experienced in the chamber, because of the large vertical wind speed gradient close to the soil. Another vent geometry was then proposed that positioned the vent at the chamber level. This new design was tested on both manual and automatically operated chambers. It was found to be efficient in windy conditions as most of the artificial correlation between soil respiration measurements and wind speed had disappeared. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{technology}} {{has been used to}} assess the exhaust plume pollutant environment of the RD- 170 engine hot-firing on the F 1 Test Stand at Marshall Space Flight Center. Researchers know that rocket engine hot-firing has the potential for forming thermal nitric oxides (NO(x)), as well as producing carbon monoxide (CO) when hydrocarbon fuels are used. Because of the complicated physics involved, however, little attempt has been made to predict the pollutant emissions from ground-based engine testing, except for simplified methods which can grossly underpredict and/or overpredict the pollutant formations in a test environment. The objective of this work, therefore, has been to develop a technology using CFD to describe the underlying pollutant emission physics from ground-based rocket engine testing. This resultant technology is based on a three-dimensional (3 D), viscous flow, pressure-based CFD formulation, where wet CO and thermal NO finite-rate chemistry mechanisms are solved with a Penalty Function method. A nominal hot-firing of a RD- 170 engine on the F 1 stand has been computed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} possibility of using <b>air</b> <b>aspiration</b> to remove fiber from distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), produced from fuel ethanol and beverage alcohol cereal grain dry–grind processes. The aspirated fraction was called “aspirated DDGS ” and the remaining fraction (original DDGS without the aspirated fraction) was called “residual DDGS. ” Aspirated DDGS fractions were analyzed for individual and total phytosterol composition. Phytosterols are high–valued nutraceutical compounds that can be recovered from grain fiber fractions. The residual DDGS (original DDGS after the removal of fiber) was analyzed for fat, protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and ash content. The study showed limited success in removal of the fiber from the original DDGS fraction. Fiber content was only slightly enriched in the aspirated DDGS fraction compared to the residual DDGS fractions. Slightly better results (in terms of fiber enrichment) were seen with DDGS samples from certain dry–grind plants compared to the DDGS samples from other plants. These differences could be due to the differences in the milling/processing conditions of the plants. Although slight enrichment of fiber was obtained in the aspirated DDGS fraction as compared to the original DDGS, no significant enrichment of the phytosterols was noticed in the aspirated DDGS fraction. Due to aspiration, slight enrichment of oil and protein was observed in the residual DDGS fraction compared to the original DDGS. The increased oil and protein and decreased fiber content of the residual DDGS could result in increased market value of the residual DDGS. Keywords.

Enteroscopy was first established in the mid seventies and advanced into balloon-assisted enteroscopy, which enabled visualizing and treating the whole small intestine in the new millennium. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), developed in the 1980 ’s, has in recent years become tool for diagnosis and therapy of a range of esophageal, gastric, hepatobiliary, pancreatic and rectal disorders. Nowadays these innovative techniques have evolved into a routine investigation of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with gastrointestinal complaints generally undergo an endoscopic examination. In the Netherlands yearly approximately 400, 000 examinations of the gastrointestinal tract are performed. With these endoscopic studies abnormalities in esophagus, stomach, duodenum, colon, small intestines and bile ducts are diagnosed and therapeutic interventions are performed. The findings of these investigations have important implications for patient management, for example for the selection of medical therapy for a gastric ulcer or for the indication for a surgical intervention of a malignant process.

Briefly, chitosan and poloxamer P 407 were dissolved in 1 % v/v acetic acid followed by dispersion of carnosic acid under vigorous stirring.

The mean TME content for 20 samples of DDGS was similar to the NRC (1994) table value. The mean bioavailability coefficient for P in 9 samples of DDGS was 79 % and varied from 62 to 102 %. Bioavailability of P was increased by additional heat processing but protein quality was reduced, particularly lysine digestibility. Particle size had no effect on P bioavailability whereas both phytase enzyme and citric acid increased P bioavailability. Two new processing technologies, modified dry grind and quick germ quick fiber (for removing germ and fiber) increased the protein and reduced the fat and fiber in DDGS and had varying effects on the lysine content.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{optimize}} the process parameters required {{for the production of}} spray-dried oily core nanocapsules (NCs) with targeted size and drug yield using a two-level four-factor fractional factorial experimental design (FFED). The coded process parameters chosen were inlet temperature (X 1), feed flow rate (X 2), atomizing air flow (X 3), and aspiration rate (X 4). The produced NCs were characterized for size, yield, morphology, and powder flowability by dynamic light scattering, electron microscope, Carr’s index, and Hausner ratio measurement, respectively. The mean size of produced NCs ranged from 129. 5 to 444. 8  nm, with yield varying from 14. 1 % to 31. 1 %. The statistical analysis indicated an adequate model fit in predicting the effect of process parameters affecting yield. Predicted condition for maximum yield was: inlet temperature 140 °C, atomizing air flow 600  L/h, feed flow rate 0. 18  L/h, and <b>aspiration</b> <b>air</b> flow set at 100 %, which led to a yield of 30. 8 %. The morphological analysis showed the existence of oily core and spherical nanostructure. The results from powder flowability analysis indicated average Carr’s index and Hausner ratio of 42. 77 % and 1. 76, respectively. Spray-dried oily core NCs with size lower than 200  nm were successfully produced, and the FFED proved to be an effective approach in predicting the production of spray-dried NCs of targeted yield...|$|R
40|$|This barchelor {{thesis is}} about Desig an {{automated}} workplace forchargeable and high-impedant measurements. This automated workplace is realized by tubular aspiration capacitor, which is connected via differential converter U/I to data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A. The data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A is also connected by serial line RS- 232 to Computer (PC), {{on which the}} directed program Agilent VEE Pro 7. 0 is installed. To the right connection data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A and PC is necessary to set the same parameters on data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A, such in I/O config and also in Instrument manager too. In Instrument manager is requisite to set Plug und Play driver for data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A. The programing in Agilent VEE Pro 7. 0 is based on object oriented programming. To start the program press the button “START“ and automatic measuring of concentration air ionts, will start the process (the trend is marked to the graph). The program is indicated if the ventilator blows an <b>air</b> in the <b>aspiration</b> capacitor and draws the trend of voltage on this ventilator to the graph.

[...] School of Pharmacy and Dept. of Chemistry. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 The {{objective of this}} dissertation is to design and optimize nanoformulation for microbicides intended {{for the prevention of}} HIV/AIDS transmission. In chapters 1 and 2, the aims and the scope of this work are introduced, as well as the literature review of its technical background. In chapter 3, the formulation and process variables involved in the production of spray-dried oily-core nanocapsules (NC) are investigated using Box-Behnken Design (BBD) and Fractional Factorial Experimental Design (FFED). Indomethacin (IND) is chosen as a model drug for lipophilic HIV microbicides. Three formulation variables (the amount of polymer, oil, and surfactant) and four process variables (inlet temperature, feed flow rate, atomizing <b>air</b> flow, and <b>aspiration</b> rate) are optimized for NC with smaller mean diameter, higher encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and higher process yield. The spray-dried NC are also characterized for their morphology, density, structure, in vitro drug release, and powder flowability. The optimized production process successfully resulted in NC with mean diameter less than 200 nm, with a drug EE% of 95 % and an overall yield of 30. 8 %. Morphological analysis and density-gradient centrifugation confirmed the existence of an oily core and spherical nanostructure with no detectable drug crystals. The NC have longer sustained drug release profile than nanosphere (NS) control, with a good fit to the Ritger-Peppas model of drug release (R 2 > 0. 930). In chapter 4, we test the hypothesis that actual anti-HIV microbicides such as tenofovir (TNF) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) loaded nanoparticles (NP) prepared with a blend of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and methacrylic acid copolymer (Eudragit® S- 100, or S- 100) are noncytotoxic and exhibit pH-responsive release of anti-HIV microbicides in the presence of human semen fluid simulant (SFS). After the preparation by emulsification diffusion process, their size, EE%, drug release profile, morphology, and cytotoxicity are characterized by dynamic light scattering, spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy, and cellular viability assay/transepithelial electrical resistance measurement, respectively. Cellular uptake is elucidated by fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal microscopy. The NP have an average mean diameter of 250 nm, maximal EE% of 16. 1 % and 37. 2 % for TNF and TDF, respectively. There is a 4 -fold increase in drug release rate from the 75 % S- 100 NP in the presence of SFS over 72 h. At a concentration up to 10 mg/ml, the PLGA/S- 100 NP are noncytotoxic for 48 h to vaginal endocervical/epithelial cells and Lactobacillus crispatus. The particle uptake (∼ 50 % in 24 h) by these vaginal cell lines mostly occurred through caveolin-mediated pathway. In chapter 5, we modify the production process, and develop a dual-functional mucoadesive and pH-responsive microparticles (MS) formulation for TNF. The formulation variables and process parameters are screened and optimized using a 24 - 1 FFED. The MS are characterized for their mean diameter, zeta potential, yield, EE%, Carr's index, drug loading, in vitro release, cytotoxicity, inflammatory responses and mucoadhesion. The optimal MS formulation has an average diameter of 4. 73 μm, zeta potential of - 26. 3 mV, 68. 9 % yield, EE% of 88. 7 %, Carr's index of 28. 3 and drug loading of 2 % (w/w). The MS formulation release 91. 7 % of its payload in the presence of simulated human semen over 4 hours. At a concentration of 1 mg/ml, the MS are noncytotoxic to vaginal/endocervical epithelial cells and Lactobacillus crispatus when compared to control media. There is also no statistically significant level of inflammatory cytokine (IL 1 -α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, and IP- 10) release triggered by these MS. Their percent mucoadhesion is 2 -fold higher than that of 1 % HEC gel formulation. These MS are found to be 3. 8 - 5. 8 fold more potent compared to native drug in HIV- 1 inhibition, as a result of CD 4 -dependent CCR 5 tropic cell-free HIV- 1 entry essay. Overall, the present work demonstrates two nanoformulations that could be used. The oily core NC (300 mg of PLA, 0. 56 ml of oil, and 239. 57 mg of Pluronic F 127) which is suitable for lipophilic microbicides, and a microparticle formulation (mean diameter of 4. 73 μm with drug loading of 2 % w/w) for the more water-soluble TNF. These formulations are promising alternative delivery systems for the purpose of AIDS prevention, offering safe and controlled intravaginal delivery of HIV microbicides.
