25|$|In {{analogy to}} phoneme and (<b>allo)phone</b> in phonology, the graphic units of {{language}} are graphemes, i.e. language-specific characters, and graphs, i.e. language-specific glyphs. Different {{schools of thought}} consider different entities to be graphemes; major points of divergence are the handling of punctuation, diacritic marks, digraphs or other multigraphs and non-alphabetic scripts.|$|E
50|$|The voiced consonants have oral <b>allophones</b> (left) before oral vowels, and nasal <b>allophones</b> (right) before nasal vowels. The oral <b>allophones</b> of the voiced stops are prenasalized.|$|R
5000|$|The vowel phonemes of Misantla Totonac have {{multiple}} <b>allophones.</b> These <b>allophones</b> are as follows.|$|R

25|$|The archaic letter Koppa (Ϙ), {{used for}} the back <b>allophone</b> of /k/ before back vowels , was {{originally}} common to most epichoric alphabets. It began {{to drop out of}} use {{from the middle of the}} 6th century BC. Some of the Doric regions, notably Corinth, Argos, Crete and Rhodes, kept it until the 5th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Francophones {{account for}} 65% {{of the total}} {{population}} of Greater Montreal, anglophones 12.6% and allophones 20.4%. On the island of Montreal, the francophone majority dropped to 46.96% by 2011, a net decline since the 1970s owing to francophone outmigration to more affluent suburbs in Laval and the South Shore (fr. Rive-Sud) and an influx of <b>allophone</b> immigrants. The anglophones account for 16.64% of the population and the allophones 35.24%.|$|E
25|$|A special {{letter for}} a variant {{realization}} of the short /e/ sound, , was briefly used in the Boeotian city of Thespiae in the late 5th century BC. It occurred {{in the place of}} normal epsilon (Ε) whenever the sound stood before another vowel. Since its shape suggests a compromise form between an Ε and an Ι, it is thought that it denoted a raised <b>allophone,</b> approaching /i/. It is attested in only one document, a set of grave stelae from 424 BC.|$|E

5000|$|Proto-Edoid is reconstructed {{as having}} a {{contrast}} between oral and nasal consonants and oral and nasal vowels typical for the region. However, in some Edoid languages nasal vowels have been reanalyzed as <b>allophones</b> of oral vowels after nasal consonants, and in others nasal consonants have been reanalyzed as <b>allophones</b> of oral consonants before nasal vowels, {{reducing the number of}} phonemically nasal consonants. Urhobo retains three nasals, , and has five oral consonants with nasal <b>allophones,</b> in Edo this is reduced to one phonemic nasal, , but eight additional consonants with nasal <b>allophones,</b> and in Ukue there are no indisputably phonemic nasals and only two consonants with nasal <b>allophones,</b> [...]|$|R
5000|$|Tagalog has <b>allophones,</b> {{so it is}} {{important}} here to distinguish phonemes (written in slashes / /) and corresponding <b>allophones</b> (written in brackets [...] ).|$|R
25|$|The rimes, in contrast, are over-specified. There are {{thirteen}} rime sounds, but twenty-six {{letters to}} represent them. One of each pair takes {{four of the}} eight tones, while the other takes the other four tones. Diacritics (none, dot, macron, and trema) distinguish the tones that each rime letter may carry. One of the tones, written -d in RPA, is not phonemic but is a prosodic unit-final <b>allophone</b> of the creaky register -m. It may be written in Pahawh by changing the dot diacritic to a short stroke, {{but it is not}} used by many people.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{census data}} show that goal has not been reached as {{successfully}} as hoped. After almost 30 years of enforcement of the Charter of the French Language, approximately 49% of <b>allophone</b> immigrants – including those who arrived before the Charter's adoption in 1977 – had assimilated to English, down from 71% in 1971, but still considerably more than anglophones' overall share of the province's population. This leads some Quebecers, particularly those who support the continued role of French as the province's common public language, to question whether the policy is being implemented successfully. The phenomenon {{is linked to the}} linguistic environments which cohabit Montreal – Quebec's largest city, Canada's second-largest metropolitan area, and home to a number of communities, neighbourhoods, and even municipalities in which English is the de facto common language. The anglophone minority's capacity to assimilate allophones and even francophones has therefore compensated to a large extent for the outmigration of anglophones to other provinces and even to the United States.|$|E

50|$|These six vowels are {{characterized}} by several different <b>allophones</b> depending on the phonetic environments in which they occur (initial/noninitial, stressed/unstressed, and open/closed syllables). The base phone of the vowels occurs in initial open syllables with stress. The lowest and most central <b>allophones</b> occur in unstressed closed syllables. According to Shipley, (a) and (y) have <b>allophones</b> that almost converge once they have centralized, (i) and (u) have <b>allophones</b> that barely centralize and drop slightly lower, approaching ɪ and ʊ. Meanwhile, (e) and (o) have more change than (i) and (u) but less than (a) and (y).|$|R

500|$|The concept {{goes back}} to the 1930s. The word {{diaphone}} was originally used with the same meaning, but was later repurposed to refer to any of the particular variants, making the relationship between diaphoneme and diaphone analogous to that between phoneme and <b>allophone.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{remaining}} labial fricatives {{are typically}} labiodental , but they {{as well as}} the fricative <b>allophone</b> [...] of [...] have bilabial allophones [...] in many dialects; the distribution depends partly on environment (bilabials {{are more likely to be}} found adjacent to rounded vowels) and partly on the individual speaker.|$|E
500|$|Representations of {{consonant}} sounds {{outside of}} the core set are created by adding diacritics to letters with similar sound values. The Spanish bilabial and dental approximants are commonly written as lowered fricatives, [...] and [...] respectively. Similarly, voiced lateral fricatives would be written as raised lateral approximants, [...] A few languages such as Banda have a bilabial flap as the preferred <b>allophone</b> of what is elsewhere a labiodental flap. It {{has been suggested that}} this be written with the labiodental flap letter and the advanced diacritic, [...]|$|E
5000|$|... e and o are <b>allophones</b> of /i/ and /u/ {{in closed}} final syllables in Malaysian, Singapore and Sumatra and ɪ and ʊ are <b>allophones</b> of /i/ and /u/ in Indonesian.|$|R
5000|$|The voiced stop [...] {{also has}} [...] and [...] as its <b>allophones.</b> Both of these <b>allophones</b> occur {{as the first}} member of a geminate cluster. They are in free variation.|$|R
50|$|Alternations provide {{linguists}} {{with data}} {{that allow them}} to determine the <b>allophones</b> and allomorphs of a language's phonemes and morphemes and to develop analyses determining the distribution of those <b>allophones</b> and allomorphs.|$|R
500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{interest}} in Whorf's ideas experienced a resurgence, {{and a new}} generation of scholars began reading Whorf's works, arguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf's actual ideas, or had attributed to him ideas he had never expressed. The field of linguistic relativity studies remains an active focus of research in psycholinguistics and linguistic anthropology, and continues to generate debate and controversy between proponents of relativism and proponents of universalism. By comparison, Whorf's other work in linguistics, the development of such concepts as the <b>allophone</b> and the cryptotype, and the formulation of [...] "Whorf's law" [...] in Uto-Aztecan historical linguistics, have met with broad acceptance.|$|E
500|$|In Connacht varieties, the allophones {{of short}} [...] are {{consistently}} further front than the allophones of long [...] In Erris, for example, short [...] ranges from a near-open front vowel [...] before slender consonants (e.g. [...] 'earwax') {{to an open}} [...] after slender consonants (e.g. [...] 'bright') to a centralized back [...] between broad consonants (e.g. [...] 'horse'). Long , on the other hand, ranges from a back [...] between broad consonants (e.g. [...] 'boat') to an advanced back [...] before slender consonants (e.g. [...] 'to get') to a centralized back [...] after slender consonants (e.g. [...] 'fine'). In Toormakeady, the back <b>allophone</b> is rounded to [...] after broad labials, e.g. [...] ('white'). In Connemara, the allophones of [...] are lengthened in duration, so that only vowel quality distinguishes the allophones of [...] from those of [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Whorf was {{appointed}} Honorary Research Fellow in Anthropology at Yale, {{and he was}} invited by Franz Boas {{to serve on the}} committee of the Society of American Linguistics (later Linguistic Society of America). In 1937, Yale awarded him the Sterling Fellowship. He was a Lecturer in Anthropology from 1937 through 1938, replacing Sapir, who was gravely ill. Whorf gave graduate level lectures on [...] "Problems of American Indian Linguistics". In 1938 with Trager's assistance he elaborated a report on the progress of linguistic research at the department of anthropology at Yale. The report includes some of Whorf's influential contributions to linguistic theory, such as the concept of the <b>allophone</b> and of covert grammatical categories. [...] has argued, that in this report Whorf's linguistic theories exist in a condensed form, and that it was mainly through this report that Whorf exerted influence on the discipline of descriptive linguistics.|$|E
5000|$|In his system, Lau treats /ɵ/ and /ʊ/ as <b>allophones</b> of one phoneme {{represented}} with [...] "u", {{while they}} are often respectively regarded as <b>allophones</b> of /œ:/ and /u:/ in other systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Allophones</b> of the consonants tend to vary in {{manner of}} {{articulation}} rather than place of articulation- e.g. plosives are usually voiceless word-initially, but voiced intervocalically and following nasals, and some plosives have fricative <b>allophones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Magnavox Odyssey²'s The Voice {{attachment}} {{uses the}} SP0256-019. This variant included the same <b>allophones</b> as the SP0256-AL2 (but an external ROM IC {{is required for}} the <b>allophones),</b> along with some Odyssey²-specific game phrases.|$|R
500|$|Furthermore, Whorf {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the <b>allophone,</b> a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition. Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single phoneme in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even {{to the point that they}} are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: [...] " [...] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [...] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. You always have to keep the observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes like is like, and what it makes unlike is unlike".(Whorf, 1940) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{realization}} of the open vowels varies according {{to the quality of}} the surrounding consonants; there is a significant difference between Munster dialects and Connacht dialects as well. In Munster, long [...] and short [...] have approximately the same range of realization: both vowels are relatively back in contact with broad consonants and relatively front in contact with slender consonants. Specifically, long [...] in word-initial position and after broad consonants is a back , e.g. [...] ('place'), [...] ('beach'). Between a slender and a broad consonant, it is a retracted front , e.g. [...] ('will cut'), while between two slender consonants it is a fully front , e.g. [...] ('John' voc.). In Dingle, the back <b>allophone</b> is rounded to [...] after broad labials, e.g. [...] ('white'), while in Ring, County Waterford, rounded [...] is the usual {{realization of}} [...] in all contexts except between slender consonants, where it is a centralized [...] Short [...] between two slender consonants is a front , as in [...] ('short'). Between a broad and a slender consonant, it is in most cases a retracted , e.g. [...] ('man'), and [...] ('worn'), but after broad labials and [...] it is a centralized front , e.g. [...] ('town'), [...] ('injure'). When it is adjacent only to broad consonants, it is a centralized back , e.g. [...] ('son'), [...] ('say').|$|E

50|$|The Paraujano phoneme {{differs from}} closely related Guajiro, mainly in vowels {{and due to}} the {{incorporation}} of Spanish lexicon. There {{are a number of}} <b>allophones</b> in Paraujano. Among these <b>allophones,</b> there is a tendency toward palatization or nasalization.|$|R
50|$|There are {{in total}} 39 consonantal phonemes (plus 2 <b>allophones)</b> and 9 vowel phonemes (plus two close raised <b>allophones).</b> The consonants include a {{rich set of}} affricates and palatal and postalveolar consonants, as well as three click consonants.|$|R
