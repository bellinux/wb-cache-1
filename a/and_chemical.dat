40|$|Thyroid {{cancer is}} a typical {{endocrine}} malignancy. In the past three decades, the continued growth of its incidence has made it urgent to design effective treatments to treat this disease. To this end, {{it is necessary to}} uncover the mechanism underlying this disease. Identification of thyroid cancer-related genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals</b> is helpful to understand the mechanism of thyroid cancer. In this study, we generalized some previous methods to discover both disease genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The method was based on shortest path algorithm and applied to discover novel thyroid cancer-related genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The analysis of the final obtained genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals</b> suggests that some of them are crucial to the formation and development of thyroid cancer. It is indicated that the proposed method is effective for the discovery of novel disease genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cancer is {{a serious}} disease {{responsible}} for many deaths every year in both developed and developing countries. One {{reason is that the}} mechanisms underlying most types of cancer are still mysterious, creating a great block for the design of effective treatments. In this study, we attempted to clarify the mechanism underlying esophageal cancer by searching for novel genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals.</b> To this end, we constructed a hybrid network containing both proteins <b>and</b> <b>chemicals,</b> <b>and</b> generalized an existing computational method previously used to identify disease genes to identify new candidate genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals</b> simultaneously. Based on jackknife test, our generalized method outperforms or at least performs at the same level as those obtained by a widely used method [...] the Random Walk with Restart (RWR). The analysis results of the final obtained genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals</b> demonstrated that they highly shared gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways with direct and indirect associations with esophageal cancer. In addition, we also discussed the likelihood of selected candidate genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals</b> being novel genes <b>and</b> <b>chemicals</b> related to esophageal cancer...|$|R
