40|$|Recently, several {{theoretical}} and experimental {{studies have been}} completed concerning {{the existence of a}} charged massive particle (CHAMP) as the missing matter of the universe. In particular, if a negatively charged CHAMP, X Γ, is neutralized by a proton, then the neutraCHAMP can remain unobserved, except to the most astute observer. In order to observe better, researchers need a better estimate of the neutraCHAMP energy loss. In the classical approximation, we calculate the polarization energy loss of the neutraCHAMP, X Γ p, in 14 N, as a function of velocity. We can approximate quite well the attractive (14 N;X Γ p) potential, by neglecting electronic and protonic screening of the X Γ from the 14 N nucleus, and retaining only the r Γ 4 term. Therefore, due to the power-law form of the potential, the scattering <b>angle</b> <b>equation</b> can be integrated exactly, giving us analytical results for the variation of scattering angle, `(b), and energy trans [...] ...|$|E

The two non-trivial equations obtained after separating the variables are the polar <b>angle</b> <b>equation</b> and the radial equation. We solve them by transforming each {{one into the}} form of a confluent Heun equation. The transformation depends on a set of parameters, which can be chosen in a such a way, so the resulting equations have simple polynomial solutions for neutrino, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations, provided some additional conditions are satisfied. Remarkably there exists a class of solutions for which these additional conditions are the same for the two different equations for $|s|= 1 / 2 $ and $|s|= 1 $. As a result the additional conditions fix the dependence of the separation constant on the angular frequency but the frequency itself remains unconstrained and belongs to a continuous spectrum.

40|$|We {{propose a}} sharp {{interface}} model for simulating solid-state dewetting where the surface energy is (weakly) anisotropic. The morphology evolution of thin films {{is governed by}} surface diffusion and contact line migration. The mathematical model {{is based on an}} energy variational approach. Anisotropic surface energies lead to multiple solutions of the contact <b>angle</b> <b>equation</b> at contact points. Introduction of a finite contact point mobility is both physically based and leads to robust, unambiguous determination of the contact angles. We implement the mathematical model in an explicit finite difference scheme with cubic spline interpolation for evolving marker points. Following validation of the mathematical and numerical approaches, we simulate the evolution of thin film islands, semi-infinite films, and films with holes as a function of film dimensions, Young's angle θ_i, anisotropy strength and crystal symmetry, and film crystal orientation relative to the substrate normal. We find that the contact point retraction rate can be well described by a power-law, l ∼ t^n. Our results demonstrate that the exponent n is not universal [...] it is sensitive to the Young's angle θ_i (and insensitive to anisotropy). In addition to classical wetting (where holes in a film heal) and dewetting (where holes in a film grow), we observe cases where a hole through the film heals but leave a finite size hole/bubble between the continuous film and substrate or where the hole heals leaving a continuous film that is not bonded to the substrate. Surface energy anisotropy (i) increases the instability that leads to island break-up into multiple islands, (ii) enhances hole healing, and (iii) leads to finite island size even under some conditions where the Young's angle θ_i suggests that the film wets the substrate.

40|$|When {{their growth}} rate becomes too small, the E-region Farley-Buneman and gradient-drift instabilities switch from {{absolute}} to convective. The neutral density gradient {{is what gives}} the instabilities their convective character. At high latitudes, {{the orientation of the}} neutral density gradient is close to the geomagnetic field direction. We show that this causes the wave-vector component along the geomagnetic field to increase with time. This in turn leads to wave stabilization, since the increase goes hand-in-hand with an increase in parallel electric fields that ultimately short-circuits the irregularities. We show that from an equivalent point of view, the increase in the parallel wave vector is accompanied by a large upward group velocity that limits the time during which the perturbations are allowed to grow before escaping the unstable region. The goal of the present work is to develop a systematic formalism to account for the propagation and the growth/decay of high-latitude Farley-Buneman and gradient-drift waves through vertical convective effects. We note that our new formalism shies away from a plane wave decomposition along the magnetic field direction. A study of the solution to the resulting nonlinear aspect <b>angle</b> <b>equation</b> shows that, for a host of initial conditions, jump conditions are often triggered in the parallel wave-vector (defined here as the vertical derivative of the phase). When these jump conditions occur, the waves turn into strongly damped ion-acoustic modes, and their evolution is quickly terminated.

40|$|Solar Energy is a {{renewable}} energy source which is used widely in recent times. Photovoltaic panels collect the sun’s energy and convert it to electricity. Photovoltaic panels are being widely used in both domestic applications, commercial applications, and small-scale power generation applications. Photovoltaic panels are easy to install, they generate most of their power when electrical demands peak, prices of photovoltaic panels are dropping rapidly, photovoltaic panels require low maintenance, their operating costs are minimal, and they are highly suitable for remote applications. The amount of electricity produced by photovoltaic panels depends {{on the amount of}} sunlight the panel captures. The orientation of the panel relative to the sun’s rays is an important consideration in optimizing this energy collection. This thesis deals with developing analytic equations that determine the optimum orientation of solar panels including the effects of a clear-atmosphere. This is done for three types of tracking: two-axis tracking, single, horizontal east-west axis tracking, and single, horizontal north-south axis tracking. While doing a literature search on the development of analytic equations that determine the optimum orientation of solar panels, it was found that Braun and Mitchell were the first to develop the equations that determine the optimum orientation of solar panels using the three types of tracking mentioned above. They developed these equations assuming there is no atmosphere on earth and that there is no reflection of the sun’s rays off the earth’s surface. Thus, the only component of solar radiation that they considered was that coming in a straight path from the sun to the earth, this is called beam radiation. The no-atmosphere optimum solar panel orientation equations have been around for decades and they are in many textbooks on solar energy. At this time, it appears that analytical relationships that account for the effects of the atmosphere on the optimum tilt angle of solar panels do not exist. Including the effects of the atmosphere adds two more components of solar energy to the total solar energy striking the solar panel. The beam radiation component still exists, but now diffuse solar radiation from the sun scattered by the atmosphere and all radiation from the sun reflected by the ground need to be included in any optimum tilt <b>angle</b> <b>equation.</b> Depending on the magnitude of these three types of solar radiation, the optimum panel orientation may be tilted slightly up to the sky to collect more diffuse radiation or tilted slightly down to the ground to collect more ground reflected radiation. This work derives and presents such equations for two-axis tracking, single, horizontal east-west axis tracking, and single, horizontal north-south axis tracking including the effects of a clear atmosphere. A clear-atmosphere is one in which there are no clouds. Including atmospheric effects in an analytical equation make this work unique from all the other optimum tilt angle work that has been performed for solar panels in the past. After the analytical equations for the optimum tilt angles including the effects of a clear-atmosphere have been derived and presented for the three tracking cases mentioned above, a great deal of results are presented using these three equations. Results for a year and for a single day are presented. These results show that the differences in the optimum tilt angles determined by the no-atmosphere equations of Braun and Mitchell and the optimum tilt angles determined by the clear-atmosphere equations developed in this work are close to one another, but not the same. That is, the atmosphere changes the optimum tilt angles by up to 12. 3 degrees. While the differences in the optimum tilt angle for no-atmosphere and clear-atmosphere may not be much, it costs nothing to readjust the solar panel to i [...] ...|$|E
