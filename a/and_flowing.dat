5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E
5|$|Born in glaciers <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> {{through a}} rugged {{landscape}} of mountains and valleys, the river drains an isolated and sparsely populated {{region of the}} Pacific Northwest. From its highest headwaters to its confluence with the Columbia River, the Kootenay falls more than two kilometers in elevation. Although comparable in length, watershed and discharge to the Columbia above the confluence, the Kootenay is of a notably different character; its much steeper gradient results {{in the formation of}} many rapids.|$|E
5|$|Seated at {{an ornate}} wooden table, wearing a pearl tiara <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> silk, is Sigismunda (called Ghismonda in Boccaccio's {{original}} tale), the heroine {{of one of}} the novelle. It is probable that Hogarth modelled her on his wife, Jane. She clasps a golden goblet containing the heart of her murdered husband, Guiscardo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} pressure <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> {{control by}} using nonlinear PI decoupling control {{structure for the}} two-input and two-output pressure tank system at which electro-pneumatic proportional pressure <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> valves are employed as both actuators together with pressure <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> sensor. Experimental results are evaluated in three conditions. First, a fixed pressure value is set <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> value is varied as step. Second, a fixed flow value is set while varying pressure value. Final, both pressure <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> value is simultaneously varied. All results show good control performance by which both pressure <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> rate can reach to set point in all condition.

30|$|In Fig. 6 a, <b>flow</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> 2 can be coded at node 7, while <b>flow</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> 4 can be coded at node 13, {{according}} to MCC. Since <b>flow</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> 3 are both coded <b>flows,</b> <b>and</b> for node 9 {{there are no}} upstream node to extract the intended native packet for node 9, {{there should be no}} coding opportunity at node 9 {{according to}} GCC. However, it is obvious from Fig. 6 a that <b>flow</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> 4 can be coded at node 9 <b>and</b> each <b>flow</b> can obtain its native packet eventually.|$|R
5|$|A Slight Specimen of Moral Songs, such as I wish some {{happy and}} condescending genius would {{undertake}} {{for the use}} of children, and perform much better... The sense and subjects might be borrow'd plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon, from all the common appearances of nature, from all the occurrences in the civil life, both in city and country: (which would also afford matter for other Divine Songs.) Here the language and measures should be easy <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> with chearfulness, and without the solemnities of religion, or the sacred names of God and holy things; that children might find delight and profit together.|$|E
5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour <b>and,</b> <b>flowing</b> from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Aston {{teamed up}} with {{television}} producer Tim Taylor and together they created two shows which focused on bringing archaeology into British popular consciousness. The first was the short-lived Time Signs (1991), although {{this was followed by}} the more successful Time Team, which was produced for Channel 4 from 1994 to 2013. Aston was responsible for identifying sites for excavation and for selecting specialists to appear on the show, and through the programme became well known to the viewing public for his trademark colourful jumpers <b>and</b> <b>flowing,</b> untidy hairstyle. In 1996 he was appointed to the specially-created post of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University, and undertook a ten-year project investigating the manor at Shapwick, Somerset.|$|E

It is about 180 km from Winnipeg, and lies {{on the west side}} of Lake Manitoba, on Hwy 278. The reserve is known as Ebb <b>and</b> <b>Flow</b> 52. It is {{surrounded}} by the Rural Municipality of Alonsa.|$|R
5|$|Nagavarma I, a brahmin {{scholar who}} came from Vengi in modern Andhra Pradesh (late 10th century) was also patronised by Chavundaraya. He wrote Chandombudhi (ocean of prosody) {{addressed}} to his wife. This is considered the earliest available Kannada writing in prosody. He also wrote {{one of the earliest}} available romance classics in Kannada called Karnataka Kadambari in sweet <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> champu (mixed verse and prose) style. It is based on an earlier romantic work in Sanskrit by poet Bana and is popular among critics. Gajashtaka (hundred verses on elephants), a rare Kannada work on elephant management was written by King Shivamara II around 800 CE but this work is now considered extinct. Other writers such as Manasiga and Chandrabhatta were known to be popular in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Scotch Run {{begins in}} a lake in a valley in eastern Beaver Township. It flows west and {{slightly}} south for several miles between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain. The stream eventually passes through the unincorporated community of Mifflin Cross Roads. Near this community, it turns south briefly before turning west-southwest again <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> between Nescopeck Mountain and Dry Ridge. A short distance later, the stream exits Beaver Township and enters Main Township. In Main Township, it flows between Nescopeck Mountain and Full Mill Hill for {{slightly more than half}} a mile. It then reaches its confluence with Catawissa Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of Wells Cathedral presents a relatively tidy and harmonious appearance since {{the greater part}} of the building was executed in a single style, Early English Gothic. This is uncommon among English cathedrals where the exterior usually exhibits a plethora of styles. At Wells, later changes in the Perpendicular style were universally applied, such as filling the Early English lancet windows with simple tracery, the construction of a parapet that encircles the roof, and the addition of pinnacles framing each gable, similar to those around the chapter house and on the west front. At the eastern end there is a proliferation of tracery with repeated motifs in the Reticulated style, a stage between Geometric <b>and</b> <b>Flowing</b> Decorated tracery.|$|E

5|$|The garden design, asserts the text, {{should include}} rocks and raised mounds of summits, manicured with plants and trees of diverse varieties, {{artificial}} ponds <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> brooks. It describes the arrangement, the soils, the seeds, {{the distance between}} types of plants and trees, the methods of preparing manure, proper fertilizing and maintaining the garden, which plants and trees are best planted first, when to plant others, watering, signs of overwatering and underwatering, weeds, means of protecting the garden and other details. Both public parks and woodland gardens are described, with about 40 types of trees recommended for the park in the Vana-krida chapter.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E

50|$|The Priest River {{originates}} in Upper Priest Lake <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> south into Priest Lake. It exits {{the south end}} of Priest Lake <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> south to the Pend Oreille River near the city of Priest River. The Upper Priest River, which is sometimes considered part of the Priest River proper, originates near the US-Canada border <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> south into Upper Priest Lake.|$|R

25|$|The Pequonnock River is {{the only}} major {{waterway}} in Trumbull, beginning northwest of Old Mine Park at the Monroe border <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> southeasterly through the Pequonnock River Valley State Park, Trumbull Center and Twin Brooks Park. The river leaves Trumbull and continues into Beardsley Park in Bridgeport.|$|E
25|$|The River Worfe {{joins the}} Severn, just above Bridgnorth. The River Stour rising on the Clent Hills <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> through Halesowen, Stourbridge, and Kidderminster, joins the Severn at Stourport. On the {{opposite}} bank, the tributaries are only brooks, Borle Brook, Dowles Brook draining the Wyre Forest, Dick Brook and Shrawley Brook.|$|E
40|$|Spiritual {{well-being}} <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> {{are important}} religious constructs, one reflecting Christian {{and the other}} Buddhist perspectives. Moberg (1971) theorized that spiritual well-being involves a vertical dimension with God and a horizontal dimension with other humans and the physical world. Csikszentmihalyi (1990) developed the concept of flow as a state of optimal human functioning and hypothesized a relationship between <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> spirituality. Following Csikszentmihalyi (2005), we suspected <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> spiritual well-being are somewhat related constructs despite their disparate origins. While research has explored the relationship between spirituality <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> within particular experiences (Phillips, 2007; Purdey & Dupey, 2005), our study examined how experiences of flow may become generalized into a global sense of spiritual well-being. Our study investigated: (a) the relationship between spiritual well-being <b>and</b> <b>flow,</b> (b) convergent <b>and</b> divergent validity for measures of spiritual well-being <b>and</b> <b>flow,</b> (c) possible predictors of spiritual well-being <b>and</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R

40|$|Based on {{preceding}} researches on {{the plan}} of reducing urban heat island through introduction of wind path, this study analyzed the effects that the change of land cover, which is resulted from urbanization, brought about on the cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow.</b> Dalseo-gu district in Daegu {{was selected as the}} subject and research was carried out about the urban micro-climate change in 1987, 1997 and 2007. Research showed that increased artificial land cover was unfavorable to the cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> the quantity and height of cold air downtown remarkably lowered. This implied that cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> is influenced by land cover. Simulation in main zones of cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> showed that the cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> became positive after the areas are turned into natural land cover. To secure continuous cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow,</b> it is judged that the spatial characteristics of {{the outskirts of the city}} should be analyzed to carry out urban development or urban restoration, and through the process, to formulate a pleasant and healthy town...|$|R
25|$|In 1946 Richard Neutra {{designed}} the Edgar and Liliane Kaufmann House. A modernist classic, this mostly glass residence incorporated the latest technological advances in building materials, using natural lighting and floating planes <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> space for proportion and detail. In recent years an energetic preservation program has protected and enhanced many classic buildings.|$|E
25|$|The Nastaʿlīq calligraphic writing style {{began as}} a Persian mixture of scripts Naskh and Ta'liq. After the Mughal conquest, Nasta'liq became the {{preferred}} writing style for Urdu. It is the dominant style in Pakistan, and many Urdu writers {{elsewhere in the world}} use it. Nastaʿlīq is more cursive <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> than its Naskh counterpart.|$|E
25|$|From {{here the}} river goes north through several sets of small lakes (requiring a lift-over or short portage between each), before looping back <b>and</b> <b>flowing</b> {{into the north}} end of Lake Talon.
