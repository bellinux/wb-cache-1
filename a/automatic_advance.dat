50|$|Royal Enfield {{introduced}} their all new 736 cc {{twin cylinder}} engine in 1962 on the 750 Interceptor. Bore and stroke was 71 x 93 mm. The new engine {{was similar to}} the 692 cc engine; but there was hardly any part that was not modified or improved. The engine cases were beefed up to withstand the increased torque. What sets this engine apart from other contemporary British twins is that the crankshaft was dynamically balanced from the factory which made these bikes one of the smoothest British twin engines ever. The Series 1 bikes had an <b>automatic</b> <b>advance</b> magneto, coil ignition and a new seat. There was a rare single carburettor model as well. It was manufactured until 1966.|$|E

A sample of 807 participants (mean age of 53; 64 % women, 83 % non-Hispanic white; 81 % some college or college graduates) from the YouGov Polimetrix panel was administered 56 items assessing performance of social/role activities and 56 items measuring satisfaction with social/role activities. Participants were randomly assigned to either (1) <b>automatic</b> <b>advance</b> to the next question with no opportunity to go back (auto/no back); (2) <b>automatic</b> <b>advance</b> to the next questions with an opportunity to go back (auto/back); (3) next button to go to the next question with no opportunity to go back (next/no back); or (4) next button to go to the next question with an opportunity to go back (next/back). We found no difference in missing data, internal consistency reliability, and domain scores by group. Time to complete the survey was about 50 % longer when respondents were required to use a next button to go on. Given the similarity in missing data, reliability and mean scale scores with or without use of the next button, we recommend automatic advancement to the next item with the option {{to go back to the}} previous item...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDiesel {{engines are}} very well known for their high torque and high thermal efficiency. But, the {{increase}} in demand of energy, rapid depletion of fossil fuels and meeting the stringent emission regulations, the researchers take interest to derive the alternative fuels from renewable resources. Among from all the different alternative fuels, vegetable oil has potential to substitute the traditional diesel fuels. The well-established transesterification process is generally used {{for the production of}} biodiesel from vegetable oil. In transesterification process the tri-glycerides are converted into mono glycerides with the help of alcohol and catalyst under certain temperature. In the present research work cottonseed vegetable oil is used to produce biodiesel by transesterification process using methanol and KOH as catalyst. As diesel engine combustion is heterogeneous spray combustion, it is very complex phenomenon. The physico-chemical properties of biodiesel are slightly different from diesel fuel. It is very interesting to study the combustion characteristics of a cottonseed based biodiesel fuelled diesel engine. This was the main motivation to take up this study to understand and analyze the combustion characteristics of a cottonseed biodiesel fuelled diesel engine. The experiment was carried out on a single cylinder diesel engine for base diesel and cottonseed biodiesel blends (B 5, B 10, B 15, and B 20) as a fuel. The combustion characteristics such as ignition delay, start of combustion, premixed, diffusion and after burning combustion phases, end of combustion and combustion duration were analyzed and compared with base diesel. It was observed that ignition delay and maximum rate of pressure rise decreased with biodiesel as compared to base diesel due to higher cetane number of biodiesel blends which confirms the smooth running of the engine. Ignition delay decreased from 11 °CA with base diesel to 6. 5 °CA with B 20 biodiesel. The start of combustion was advanced with all biodiesel blends due to higher bulk modulus results in <b>automatic</b> <b>advance</b> in dynamic injection timing and lesser ignition delay. The combustion duration was longer with all biodiesel blends as compared to base diesel due to longer injection duration results in poor performance of the engine with biodiesel blends...|$|E

40|$|During the National Expert Panel on Field Triage meetings, members {{discussed}} {{the potential for}} vehicle telematics to more accurately guide trauma triage decisions. Telematics {{is defined as the}} combination of telecommunications and computing. Vehicle telematics systems combine and integrate directly into the vehicle's electrical architecture, cellular communications technology, Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite location capability, and sophisticated voice recognition. While vehicle telematics provide a wide array of services, <b>Advanced</b> <b>Automatic</b> Collision Notification (AACN) was the telematics service that was of particular interest to the National Expert Panel members. AACN is the successor to Automatic Crash Notification (ACN) and is found on a number of motor vehicles. (AACN is now installed in approximately 5 million vehicles in the United States and Canada.) AACN alerts emergency services that a vehicle crash has occurred and automatically summons assistance. In follow up to the need to explore further how AACN could improve triage, CDC selected and convened an expert panel. The purpose of the panel was to develop a medical protocol for utilization of AACN data from crashes to better predict severity of injury and use this information to improve the ability to respond to crashes and appropriately triage crash victims..
