5|$|The {{arguments}} {{that led to}} the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to <b>attack</b> <b>point</b> targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E
500|$|The {{regiment}} and {{a battalion}} from the Imperial Camel Corps would <b>attack</b> <b>point</b> [...] "A". The Canterbury Mounted Rifles {{would support the}} attack on the regiment's left. At 01:45 the regiment moved forward, dismounted and managed to get close enough to the first objective to charge home without being seen, capturing the first trench, five machine-guns and twenty-three prisoners. The regiment continued on, capturing the position. At daybreak Turkish troops were able to bring enfilade fire from point [...] "B" [...] against the regiment's positions. So 4th Squadron, with 3rd Squadron providing covering fire, mounted an attack and captured that position. At 09:30 Turkish troops were seen gathered on the north-east side of the hill. McCarroll asked for artillery support to break up their troops, but there was none available. The mountain battery, at the time, only had four rounds left. The Turkish forces attacked and managed to close on the regiment's defences before they were stopped by rifle and machine-gun fire.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June, the {{battalion}} {{carried out a}} detailed reconnaissance of Point 5140. It disclosed that the enemy had put in place seven sangars on the peak; two {{on the top and}} five towards the east. Joshi, decided to <b>attack</b> <b>Point</b> 5140 with Bravo Company, under the command of Lieutenant Sanjeev Singh Jamwal, and Delta Company, under the command of Lieutenant Vikram Batra, from two sides; East and South. At the Hump Complex, the two officers, Jamwal and Batra, received their briefing about the mission from Joshi. During the briefing, Jamwal chose the words [...] "Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!" [...] to be the success signal for his company whilst Batra chose the words [...] "Yeh Dil Mange More!" [...] (This heart wants more! — from a popular advertising slogan of Pepsi [...] ) as his success signal for his company. D-Day was set for 19 June, and H-Hour (the time at which an assault begins) at 2030.|$|E

50|$|Dungeon {{exploration}} {{is done in}} a 2D side scrolling platform manner. Characters {{traverse the}} environment ín different ways. Alicia is the only character that can jump, swing a sword, and shoot photons. Photons can bounce {{off the ground and}} walls, temporarily freeze enemies and objects in crystal,and switch places with crystallized enemies; they are used to solve many puzzles. Alicia can also engage an enemy in battle by attacking them or by coming into contact with them. When attacking enemies, Alicia receives the first move in combat with a full <b>attack</b> <b>point</b> gauge. By coming into contact with an enemy, there is a chance that the player will be at a disadvantage and start with an empty <b>attack</b> <b>point</b> gauge.|$|E

50|$|During the Cold War {{the weapon}} of choice was a nuclear one, and {{accuracy}} needs were limited. Development of tactical bombing systems, notably the ability to <b>attack</b> <b>point</b> targets with conventional weapons {{that had been the}} original goal of the Norden, was not considered seriously. Thus when the US entered the Vietnam War, their {{weapon of choice}} was the Douglas A-26 Invader equipped with the Norden. Such a solution was inadequate.|$|E

5000|$|Once a line {{of cards}} is complete, the total of its <b>Attack</b> <b>Points</b> are calculated, then it may 'attack' an {{incomplete}} battle-line of the opponent - the success of which is determined by rolling the [...] "Cube of Devastation" [...] - a six sided dice with 5 sides emblazoned with an orcish eye, and one, with the Mark of Chaos. If the dreaded Mark of Chaos is rolled, the attacker's line routs, and the defender wins all their booty (cards with Victory <b>Points</b> but no <b>Attack</b> <b>Points)</b> and they lose all their troop cards. If an orcish eye is rolled, the opposite occurs.|$|R
5000|$|The Sextet is scored for flute, bass clarinet, {{percussion}} (tubular {{bells and}} vibraphone), viola, violoncello, and piano, {{and may be}} described as a synthesis of closed and open formal development [...] The work consists of 26 periodic phases, each lasting eight seconds, for a total duration of 3 minutes and 36 seconds [...] Its formal process sets out from an eight-note cluster chord in the middle register, from A3 up to E4, first struck very loudly, then repeated eight seconds later at a very soft dynamic. At subsequent eight-second intervals, the instruments gradually gain independence of <b>attack</b> <b>points</b> {{while at the same time}} add more notes, both higher and lower, until a maximum dispersal of <b>attack</b> <b>points</b> is reached in the middle of the piece. From there to the end, the <b>attack</b> <b>points</b> reverse the process until chordal unity is reached again at the end, but the pitches continue to expand until reaching their widest at six octaves in the last three phases, then suddenly collapsing to a seven-note chord at the very end ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|R
50|$|In the pre-World War II era {{there had}} been a long debate about the {{relative}} merits of daylight versus night-time bombing. At night the bomber is virtually invulnerable (until the introduction of radar) but finding its target was a major problem. In practice, only large targets such as cities could be attacked. During the day the bomber could use its bombsights to <b>attack</b> <b>point</b> targets, but only at the risk of being attacked by enemy fighters and anti-aircraft artillery.|$|E
50|$|Controls {{should be}} {{moderately}} difficult. Navigation {{should not be}} primarily along paths. A compass is necessary. Course choice is actively encouraged. However, every control should be within 100m of an <b>attack</b> <b>point,</b> or obvious feature, and beyond the control should be a linear catch feature, so that the runner knows when s/he has gone too far. On {{no more than two}} legs should navigation rely solely on compass and counting paces. Orange course are often perceived as much more difficult than yellow. Once you can reliably complete orange courses, you have learned the basic skill.|$|E
50|$|On the French side, {{planning}} {{after the}} disaster at Wissembourg had become essential. General Le Bœuf, flushed with anger, was intent upon {{going on the}} offensive over the Saar and countering their loss. However, planning for the next encounter was more based upon the reality of unfolding events rather than emotion or pride, as Intendant General Charles Joseph François Wolff told him and his staff that supply beyond the Saar would be impossible. Therefore, the armies of France would take up a defensive position that would protect against every possible <b>attack</b> <b>point,</b> but also left the armies unable to support each other.|$|E

50|$|The He 111 {{also served}} as a torpedo bomber in the Battle of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. In the Atlantic {{campaign}} the Luftwaffe created Fliegerführer Atlantik for this purpose. In the spring 1941, the Luftwaffe had been using conventional bombs to attack shipping more often than not. Such a method resulted in heavy losses to He 111 units in aircraft and crew as the 111s <b>attack</b> <b>point</b> was too close. III./Kampfgeschwader 40 had only eight of 32 crews remaining by April 1941 and had to be withdrawn. Most He 111 units were replaced by the faster Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 217 which also suffered losses, but not to the extent of the He 111.|$|E
