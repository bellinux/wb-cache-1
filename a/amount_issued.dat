Any shortfalls may have to be replenished by the guardian, usually a bookkeeper, of the petty cash float from their own personal resources.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the transmission mechanism of different shocks we need to know whether the supply of CDs (certificates of deposits) available to any bank is perfectly elastic at the current rate, i. e. whether a bank can issue as many CDs as it wants without paying any premium. In this paper we use data on the French CDs market in order to study the sensibility of the CD's rate to the <b>amount</b> <b>issued.</b> We use data on the CDs issued by 400 banks during 38 months. The estimation of the elasticity of the CD's rate to the <b>amount</b> <b>issued</b> is then based on Panel data. It has {{to take into account the}} endogeneity of the regressor and possible selection biases (some banks do not issue CDs every month). So the model is estimated in first differences by using instrumental variables and GMM (generalized method of moments). The estimation reveals a significant elasticity of the rate to the issued amount, but this elasticity is economically relatively weak. ...|$|E

The compounded trade credit adjustments are at least as great, if not greater than corresponding adjustments in cash holdings, suggesting that trade credit positions are economically important sources of reserve liquidity.

We examine both the sign and significance of the coefficient of each option (i.e., issuing debt, capital, or hybrid instruments) with respect to the decision of not issuing and the cross-differences between the different options. We consider this first approach to account for the possibility that the decisions to issue different types of securities is affected by the different theories. Second, we estimate a Tobit model to explore the determinants of the <b>amount</b> <b>issued</b> by banks in each type of financial instrument (i.e., intensive margin) and analyze whether they are different from the determinants that govern the decision to issue each type of instrument.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{properties}} of nonparametric decision tree models {{in the analysis of}} financial leverage decisions. This approach presents two appealing features: the relationship between leverage ratios and the explanatory variables is not predetermined but is derived according to information provided by the data, and the models respect the bounded and fractional nature of leverage ratios. The analysis shows that tree models suggest relationships between explanatory variables and the relative <b>amount</b> of <b>issued</b> debt that parametric models fail to capture. Furthermore, the significant relationships found by tree models are in most cases in accordance with the effects predicted by the pecking-order theory. The results also show that two-part tree models can accommodate better the distinct effects of explanatory variables on the decision to issue debt and on the <b>amount</b> of debt <b>issued</b> by firms that do resort to debt.

40|$|We {{test whether}} bond ratings contain pricing-relevant {{information}} by examining security price reactions to Moody's refinement of its rating system, {{which was not}} accompanied by any fundamental change in issuers' risks, was not preceded by any announcement, and was carried simultaneously for all bonds. We find that rating information does not affect firm value but that debt value increases (decreases) and equity value falls (rises) when Moody's announces better- (worse-) than-expected ratings. We also find that when Moody's announces better- (worse-) than-expected ratings, the volatilities implied by prices of options on the fine-rated issuers' shares decline (rise). 2 Virtually all large corporate bond issues are rated {{by at least one}} rating agency.

We do not find a significant time variable that can provide proof of changes in the direct cost level in the period. We do however find support for variations in the cost level, caused by changes in the financial market in Norway. Our findings indicate that the average direct costs falls with 0, 00861 percentage points per 100 points the OSEBX increases. Finally we find that the relative cost level decrease with size of the issue. The data indicates a reduction of 0, 366 percentage points per billion NOK raised in the issue. We also find evidence that foreign financial institutions are significantly more expensive managers than the Norwegian ones, in the period 2006 - 2011.

40|$|With {{escalating}} {{demand for}} improvement of construction project performance, alternative project delivery methods and innovative project contracting methods are implemented depending on various work types and project sizes. Contingency generally refers to initial contingency amount estimated before bidding and {{will be included in}} original contract. Premium cost also will be issued to pay non-value additional works. As a result, additional works, which also refers to change orders, are paid mainly by initial contingency, supplemental agreements and premium cost. This paper mainly aims to compare initial amount of contingency to later investment paid for change orders by means of supplemental agreements or premium cost. If estimation of initial contingency is rather precise, even the initial contingency is high and will increases the original contract amount, it might still be beneficial to projects because it eliminates the cost-related influence caused by unforeseen additional works paid by fund prepared as contingency in advance. This paper is designed to testify correlation between initial contingency and cost overrun, moreover, to compare this correlation to the ones between supplemental agreement amount, premium cost and cost overrun, with which it could demonstrates whether initial contingency is less costly than <b>amount</b> <b>issued</b> by supplemental agreements or premium cost. Based on the results of correlation analysis, initial contingency is proved to be less expensive than paying change orders by supplemental agreements and premium cost...|$|E
