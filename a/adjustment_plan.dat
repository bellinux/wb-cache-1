25|$|A {{series of}} {{alternating}} {{military and civilian}} governments, often affected by economic instabilities, from 1966 to 1981 ended with the ascension to power of Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings of the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) in 1981. These changes resulted in the suspension of the Constitution of Ghana in 1981, and the banning of political parties in Ghana. The economy soon declined, so Rawlings negotiated a structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>plan</b> changing many old economic policies, and economic growth soon recovered from the mid–2000s. A new Constitution of Ghana restoring multi-party system politics was promulgated in Ghanaian presidential election, 1992; Rawlings was elected as president of Ghana then, and again in Ghanaian general election, 1996.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} design and {{implementation}} of large fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>plans</b> using a novel approach. Previous {{studies have focused on}} successful fiscal adjustments identified on the basis of outcomes. Instead, we analyze large fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>plans</b> and compares them with outcomes, thereby capturing lessons not only from successes but also failures, and avoiding sample selection/survivorship bias. In this paper, we analyze all large fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>plans</b> put forward by European Union countries in 1991 – 2008. On design, we find that large <b>planned</b> <b>adjustments</b> envisaged a greater role for expenditure cuts. Only a third of the plans provided for revenue increases, but most of these were not anchored in tangible tax policy measures. Plans were generally based on assumptions of improving macroeconomic conditions, but growth projections were not systematically optimistic relative to independent forecasts available at the time. On implementation, we find that three-fourths of the <b>planned</b> <b>adjustment</b> was realized on average, with sizable expenditure over-runs partly offset by revenue over-performance. Economic growth surprises are found to be key: one percentage point higher-than-planned growth improves the overall balance by percentage point of GDP. There is some evidence that policymakers use growth and other surprises (such as revisions to initial-year deficits) opportunistically: partially “spending ” favorable surprises, but permitting unfavorable ones to result in deviations from targets. 1 Abbas, Hasanov, and Mauro are in the International Monetary Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a {{critical}} analysis {{of the theory of}} the expansionary austerity (EAT). Our attention is on the theoretical weaknesses of the EAT, say the extreme circumstances and fragile assumptions under which expansionary consolidations might actually take place. We present a simple theoretical model that takes inspiration from both the post-Keynesian and evolutionary/institutionalist traditions. We first show that well-designed austerity measures hardly trigger off short-run economic expansions in the context of expected long-lasting consolidation plans (i. e. when <b>adjustment</b> <b>plans</b> deal with remarkably high debt-to-GDP ratios); when the so-called ‘financial channel’ is not operative (i. e. in the context of monetarily sovereign economies); when the degree of export responsiveness to internal devaluation is low. Even in the context of non-monetarily sovereign countries (see Eurozone countries), austerity’s effectiveness crucially depends on its highly disputable capacity to immediately stabilize fiscal variables. We then analyse some possible long-run economic dynamics. We emphasize the high degree of instability that characterizes austerity-based <b>adjustments</b> <b>plans.</b> Path-dependency and cumulativeness make the short-run impulse effects of fiscal consolidation of paramount importance to (hopefully) obtain any appreciable medium-to-long-run benefit. Should these effects be contractionary on the onset, the short-run costs of austerity measures can breed an endless spiral of recession and ballooning debt in the long run. If so, in the case of non-monetarily sovereign countries debt forgiveness may emerge as the ultimate solution to restore economic soundness. Alternatively, institutional innovations like those adopted since mid- 2012 by the ECB are required to stabilize the economy, although not to prompt sustained recovery...|$|R

50|$|Following the Abdallah regime's {{rapprochement}} with France in 1978, the Comoran economy {{became increasingly}} dependent on infusions of French aid, along with assistance from other governments and international organizations. By 1990, {{the year the}} Comoros concluded negotiations with the IMF for an economic restructuring program, the republic's total external public debt was US$162.4 million, an amount equal to about three-quarters of GNP. The government delayed implementing the structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>plan</b> and was directed by the World Bank and the IMF {{to do so by}} September 1992. The plan recommendations entailed discharging about 2,800 of 9,000 civil servants, among other unpopular measures. The IMF granted the Comoros a new credit for US$1.9 million in March 1994 under the Structural Adjustment Facility. For the period 1994-96, the Comoros sought an economic growth rate of 4 percent as well as an inflation rate of 4 percent for 1995-96. The growth rate for 1994, however, was estimated only at 0.7 percent and the inflation rate at 15 percent. Meanwhile, in a move designed to encourage private enterprise and reduce unemployment, in May 1993 the UN Development Programme had given the Comoros a credit of US$2 million for programs in these areas. In January 1994, the European Development Fund (EDF) granted 1.3 million European Currency Units (ECUs; for value, see Glossary) to the Comoros to develop small businesses. The Comoros also received 5.7 million French francs from the French Aid and Cooperation Fund for agriculture and rural development.|$|E
