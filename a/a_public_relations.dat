5|$|Government {{officials}} {{stood on}} trucks, using loudspeakers {{to call out}} above the noise, urging the Buddhists — primarily high school and university students who had arrived on bicycles — to disperse.

40|$|This essay clarifies {{the concept}} of {{dialogue}} in <b>public</b> <b>relations.</b> <b>As</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> theory and re-search move toward a two-way relational communication model, many scholars and practitioners are increasingly using the terms “dialogic ” and “dialogue ” to describe ethical and practical approaches to <b>public</b> <b>relations.</b> The concept of dialogue is deeply rooted in philosophy and relational communication theory. Its inclusion in the <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> vocabulary is <b>an</b> important step toward understanding how organizations can build relationships that serve both organizational and public interests. This essay traces the roots of dialogue, identifies several over-arching tenets, and provides three ways that organizations can incorporate dialogue into their communication with publics. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved. Given the increasing ubiquity of dialogue as <b>a</b> concept in <b>public</b> <b>relations,</b> {{it is important to}} have some shared understanding of what the term means. Many scholars have used the term dialogue when discussing effective <b>public</b> <b>relations.</b> Pearson’s work on dialogue as <b>a</b> practical <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> strategy is the earliest substantive treatment of the concept. In his 1989 doctoral dissertation on dialogue as <b>a</b> tool of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> ethics, Pearson wrote: “It is morally right t...|$|R

Candidates were brought to a training day at a Manchester hotel in February 1997, where they were presented with several hours of speeches and given a handbook.

5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology mounted <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> {{campaign}} {{to address issues}} in the piece.

Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E
