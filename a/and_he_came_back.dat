Therefore, he sent a synopsis of Luisa Miller (which he called Eloisa Miller) to Verdi on 14 May 1849.|$|E

He also won the May tournament. In July, he took part in an historic play-off with Chiyonofuji – the first time ever that two yokozuna from the same stable had met in the ring (the rules of sumo state that wrestlers from the same stable can only fight each other in a play-off).|$|E

500|$|Grossman {{remained}} the team's back-up quarterback until week nine against the winless Detroit Lions {{when he was}} called to replace Orton who left the game due an ankle injury. Grossman completed nine of nineteen passes for 58 yards, including a touchdown and interception. He also scored the game's winning touchdown on a quarterback sneak. [...] During {{the course of the}} game, Grossman was repeatedly jeered by Bears fans. [...] After the game, Brian Urlacher defended Grossman, commenting, [...] "We've got a quarterback who comes in off the bench and leads us to a victory, and they boo him right out of the gate. [...] Poor guy. Lucky for him he's resilient <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> and led us to two scoring drives. [...] But man, it's tough." [...] Lovie Smith named Grossman the team's starting quarterback for the Bears next contest against the Tennessee Titans. Grossman threw one touchdown and interception, and also scored a one-yard rushing touchdown, en route to a 21–14 loss. [...] Grossman received his final snaps of the season in the following week, when he was called to relieve Orton in a 37–3 loss to the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

It {{was the first of}} 11 {{straight}} victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the Philadelphia Eagles. Near {{the end of the season}} in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from Art Michalik that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask. Despite an 11–1 record, Cleveland lost in the championship game for the third year in a row, falling to the Detroit Lions 17–16. Two of Graham's passes were intercepted. He said after the game that he wanted to [...] "jump off a building" [...] for letting his teammates down. [...] "I was the main factor in losing", he said. [...] "If I had played my usual game, we would have won." [...] Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL's leading passer and again won the Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

500|$|Hutchings {{introduced}} Drake to the 25-year-old American producer Joe Boyd, {{owner of}} the production and management company Witchseason Productions. The company was, at the time, licensed to Island Records, and Boyd, {{the man who had}} discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. A four-track demo, recorded in Drake's college room in the spring of 1968, led Boyd to offer a management, publishing, and production contract to the 20-year-old, and to initiate work on a debut album. According to Boyd:In those days you didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [...] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> in, and we talked, and I just said, [...] "I'd like to make a record." [...] He stammered, [...] "Oh, well, yeah. Okay." [...] Nick was a man of few words.In a 2004 interview, Drake's friend Paul Wheeler remembered the excitement caused by his seeming big break, and recalled that the singer had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge.|$|E

2500|$|Hamilton {{had set up}} his {{headquarters}} in Paris' The George V Hotel, representing companies like Hamilton Standard, Sikorsky Aviation, Chance Vought Aircraft, and Pratt & Whitney. [...] During the time from 1936–1940, Hamilton was successful in getting licensing rights for foreign countries to build Pratt & Whitney engines and Hamilton Standard variable-pitch propellers. [...] According to Wilson, it was a fight for survival as an American company. [...] He also mentioned {{there was a kind}} of naivete when it came to dealing with countries like Germany, Japan and Russia. [...] For example, a deal was set up with BMW (Bavarian Motor Works) to license them to build a number of Pratt & Whitney engines, which was approved by the United States Congress. [...] This was granted because neither the US businessmen nor governmental officials expected any war in Europe. [...] As Wilson stated, “thanks to Mr. Thomas F. Hamilton moving around through these different ministries, could appraise this situation more clearly than most people. [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from one trip and in a meeting of the executive committee of our company he said, ‘Don't discount this fellow Hitler.’ ‘To you, he's got a Charlie Chaplin mustache, but whatever he may look on the outside, either he or somebody behind him has a strategic insight and a political foresight that is not available anywhere else in the world that I know of’ ”. [...] It has also been suggested that Hamilton also tried to convince the United States Congress of the seriousness of doing business with countries like Germany, Japan and Russia. However, at the time business interests came first and Hamilton was asked to continue in his position until the fall of France in 1940, after which Hamilton and his staff had to make an unorthodox exit out of Europe through Spain.|$|E
