Feraios' execution in 1798 at the hands of the Ottomans gave an <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E

While the civil wars and the Viking attacks on the Continent had spelled the end of unity of the Carolingian empire, which had already disintegrated into separate kingdoms, military success had enabled Æthelstan to triumph at home and to attempt {{to go beyond the}} reputation of a great heroic dynasty of warrior kings, in order to develop a Carolingian ideology of kingship.|$|E
5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E

It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground {{and purpose}} : Medial {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) {{is the most}} frequent form of surgical temporal lobe epilepsy. In this study, it was aimed to determine whether different types <b>of</b> <b>aura</b> represent a cardinal and characteristic feature of MTLE-HS and might provide a diagnostic complement to help identify patients who will be seizure-free after surgery. Methods : All types <b>of</b> <b>auras</b> and associations <b>of</b> <b>auras</b> reported by 400 MTLE-HS patients referred for surgery were retrospectively collected and their statistical correlation with the postoperative outcome was examined in a subgroup of 305 patients who underwent surgery. Results : A total <b>of</b> 876 <b>auras</b> were collected, classified into 12 categories. Globally, MTLE-HS patients reported widely variable <b>auras</b> and groupings <b>of</b> <b>auras.</b> Most common were autonomic and abdominal visceral auras, followed by psychoaffective and experiential auras; less common, but seen in 10 %– 15 % of patients, were non-specific auras, somatosensory auras and visual auras, and least common, reported by less than 10 % of patients, were auditory, gustatory, vestibular, olfactory and intellectual auras. No auras were reported in 10 % of patients. 65 % of patients experienced more than one type <b>of</b> <b>aura</b> (two to seven). No specific groupings <b>of</b> <b>aura</b> type were apparent. No evidence was found for correlation between postoperative outcome and (i) any category <b>of</b> <b>aura,</b> (ii) the number <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>aura</b> per patient and (iii) any association <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>auras.</b> Conclusion : <b>Auras</b> and association <b>of</b> <b>auras</b> vary widely in MTLE-HS and provide no useful insight into surgical outcome...|$|R

5|$|Ba Cụt {{was born}} circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.|$|E
5|$|Most {{religious}} traditions in the Greco-Roman world {{centered on a}} particular city or ethnic group and did not require personal devotion, only public ritual. In contrast, the cult of Isis, like Christianity and some other mystery cults, {{was made up of}} people who joined voluntarily, out of their personal commitment to a deity that many of them regarded as superior to all others. Christianity has its own initiation ritual, baptism, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians began to refer to their sacraments, like baptism, with the word mysterion, the Greek term that was also used for a mystery rite. In this case, the word meant that Christians did not discuss their most important rites with non-Christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them. Their rites thus acquired some of the <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> secrecy that surrounded the mystery cults. Furthermore, if Isiac initiates were thought to benefit in the afterlife from Osiris's death and resurrection, this belief would parallel the Christian belief that the death and resurrection of Jesus make salvation available to those who become Christians.|$|E

As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed {{from the rest of the}} Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a good family. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAurora A (AurA) {{is a major}} mitotic {{protein kinase}} {{involved}} in centrosome maturation and spindle assembly. Nucleophosmin/B 23 (NPM) is a pleiotropic nucleolar protein involved {{in a variety of}} cellular processes including centrosome maturation. In the present study, we report that NPM is a strong activator <b>of</b> <b>AurA</b> kinase activity. NPM and AurA coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize to centrosomes in G 2 phase, where AurA becomes active. In contrast with previously characterized AurA activators, NPM does not trigger autophosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>AurA</b> on threonine 288. NPM induces phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>AurA</b> on serine 89, and this phosphorylation is necessary for activation <b>of</b> <b>AurA.</b> These data were confirmed in vivo, as depletion of NPM by ribonucleic acid interference eliminated phosphorylation of CDC 25 B on S 353 at the centrosome, indicating a local loss <b>of</b> <b>AurA</b> activity. Our data demonstrate that NPM is a strong activator <b>of</b> <b>AurA</b> kinase activity at the centrosome and support a novel mechanism <b>of</b> activation for <b>AurA...</b>|$|R
