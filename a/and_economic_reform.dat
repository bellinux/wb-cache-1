5|$|Other {{factors may}} include Enlightenment {{thinking}} and {{the examples of}} the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.|$|E
5|$|After Yugoslavia's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic {{nationalism}} revived and {{the individual}} republics began to assert their authority more strongly {{as the federal government}} weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform,</b> but Serbia's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the communist Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|E

25|$|As Hungary's {{new prime}} minister, Imre Nagy {{slightly}} relaxed state {{control over the}} economy and the mass media and encouraged public discussion on political <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform.</b> In order to improve general living standards, he increased the production and distribution of consumer goods and reduced the tax and quota burdens of the peasants. Nagy also closed forced-labor camps, released most of the political prisoners – the Communists were allowed back into party ranks – and reined in the secret police, whose hated head, Gábor Péter, was convicted and imprisoned in 1954. All these rather moderate reforms earned him widespread popularity in the country, especially among the peasantry and the left-wing intellectuals.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} preceding the depression, negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers. The 1920s brought a dramatic drop in Puerto Rico’s two primary exports, raw sugar and coffee, due to a devastating hurricane in 1928 and the plummeting demand from global markets {{in the latter half}} of the decade. 1930 unemployment on the island was roughly 36% and by 1933 Puerto Rico’s per capita income dropped 30% (by comparison, unemployment in the United States in 1930 was approximately 8% reaching a height of 25% in 1933). To provide relief <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform,</b> the United States government and Puerto Rican politicians such as Carlos Chardon and Luis Munoz Marin created and administered first the Puerto Rico Emergency Relief Administration (PRERA) 1933 and then in 1935, the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA).|$|E
25|$|During {{her time}} at the family camp, Lillian Smith soon formed a lifelong {{relationship}} {{with one of the}} camp's school counselors, Paula Snelling, of Pinehurst, Georgia. The two remained closeted as a same-sex couple {{for the rest of their}} lives, as their correspondence has shown. In the South, gender roles were binarily distinct and Smith never addressed her sexuality openly. However, some of her literature's characters were lesbian. At that time, homosexuality was more of a taboo in Southern Society than desegregation. Lillian and Paula began publishing a small, quarterly literary magazine, Pseudopodia, in 1936. The magazine encouraged writers, black or white, to offer honest assessments of modern southern life, to challenge for social <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform,</b> and it criticized those who ignored the Old South's poverty and injustices. It quickly gained regional fame as a forum for liberal thought, undergoing two name changes to reflect its expanding scope. In 1937 it became the North Georgia Review, and in 1942 finally settling with South Today.|$|E

500|$|After {{a dip in}} the 1890s, {{emigration}} rose again, causing national alarm in Sweden. At this time, Sweden's {{economy had}} developed substantially, but the higher wages prevailing in the United States retained their attractiveness. A broad-based parliamentary emigration commission was instituted in 1907. It recommended social <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform</b> in order to reduce emigration by [...] "bringing the best sides of America to Sweden". The commission's major proposals were rapidly implemented: universal male suffrage, better housing, general economic development, and broader popular education, measures which also can be attributed to numerous other factors. The effect of these measures on migration is hard to assess, as World War I (1914–1918) broke out the year after the commission published its last volume, reducing emigration to a mere trickle. From the mid-1920s, there was no longer a Swedish mass emigration.|$|E
500|$|Emigration {{rose again}} {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, {{reaching}} a new peak of about 35,000 Swedes in 1903. Figures remained high until World War I, alarming both conservative Swedes, who saw emigration as a challenge to national solidarity, and liberals, who feared the disappearance of the labor force necessary for economic development. One-fourth of all Swedes had made the United States their home, and a broad national consensus mandated that a Parliamentary Emigration Commission study the problem in 1907. Approaching the task with what Barton calls [...] "characteristic Swedish thoroughness", the Commission published its findings and proposals in 21 large volumes. The Commission rejected conservative proposals for legal restrictions on emigration and in the end supported the liberal line of [...] "bringing the best sides of America to Sweden" [...] through social <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform.</b> Topping the list of urgent reforms were universal male suffrage, better housing, and general economic development. The Commission especially hoped that broader popular education would counteract [...] "class and caste differences" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the Soviet Union was embarking on {{political}} <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform.</b> [...] It began demanding payment from North Korea for past and current aid – amounts North Korea could not repay. On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, ending all aid and trade concessions, such as cheap oil. Without Soviet aid, {{the flow of}} imports to the North Korean agricultural sector ended, and the government proved too inflexible to respond. In 1991, energy imports fell by 75%. The economy went into a downward spiral, with imports and exports falling in tandem. Flooded coal mines required electricity to operate pumps, and the shortage of coal worsened the shortage of electricity. Agriculture relied on electrically powered irrigation systems and artificial fertilizers and pesticides, {{and it was hard}} hit by the economic collapse.|$|E

The protesters called for Mongolia to adopt perestroika and glasnost. Dissident leaders demanded free elections <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reform,</b> but {{within the context of a}} [...] "human democratic socialism". The protesters injected a nationalist element into the protests by using traditional Mongolian scriptwhich most Mongolians could not readas a symbolic repudiation of the political system which had imposed the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet. In late December 1989, demonstrations increased when news came of Garry Kasparov's interview to Playboy, suggesting that the Soviet Union could improve its economic health by selling Mongolia to China.|$|E
