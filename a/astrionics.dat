40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the analyses and design studies performed for the Solar Electric Propulsion Stage (SEPS). Mission analysis results {{were used to}} establish general design requirements. A performance sensitivity analysis was then used to define an operational power level of 21 kW for accomplishing {{a broad range of}} interplanetary and earth-orbital missions. With this base, propulsion system and stage subsystem design analyses were performed to support concept and configuration studies. Design study areas include solar array, thrust subsystem, thermal control, structures, and <b>astrionics.</b> Results are presented primarily for areas not covered by more specific technical papers (i. e., thrust subsystem, solar array, design requirements and configuration studies) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} adds {{a new dimension to}} the knowledge that can be obtained from a failed microcircuit. When used with conventional techniques, SEM assists and clarifies the analysis, but it does not replace light microscopy. The most advantageous features for microcircuit analysis are long working distances and great depth of field. Manufacturer related failure modes of microcircuits are metallization defects, poor bonding, surface and particle contamination, and design and fabrication faults. User related failure modes are caused by abuse, such as overstress. The Physics of Failure Procedure followed by the <b>Astrionics</b> Laboratory in failure analysis is described, which is designed to obtain maximum information available from each step...|$|E
40|$|Trade-off {{studies and}} a {{preliminary}} design were accomplished {{to investigate the}} Versatile Upper Stage (VUS) concept. This concept entails the development by one contractor {{of a family of}} stages {{with a great deal of}} commonality to perform a spectrum of potential unmanned automated missions planned through 1990. The trade studies and analyses revealed areas where the penalty for commonality between stages was excessive in weight and performance loss. This occurred in the selection of the vehicle structural shell. In many of the expensive subsystems, especially <b>astrionics,</b> it was found that establishing the requirements for all family members and the application of commonality in subsystem selection could result in significant savings...|$|E

40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center {{has long}} {{been one of the}} leaders in {{development}} of propulsion systems. Due to current launch vehicle costs, Marshall Space Flight Centers (MSFC) Advanced Space Transportation Program (ASTP) office has emphasized the development of low cost launch vehicles. The Bantam launch vehicle is one of the primary programs that has low cost as a requirement. One of the driving factors for a low cost launch vehicle is a low cost avionics system. This paper will summarize MSFC's <b>Astrionics</b> Laboratories efforts in designing a low cost avionics system. MSFC has done Phase A avionics system design and has been working with various contractors on a Phase B preliminary avionics design. Deriving the major requirements, trade studies and cost drivers are some of the topics to be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Diversity, {{a concept}} suggestive of a {{composition}} of distinct or unlike elements or qualities, has served to mitigate error in modern computer systems for decades, going {{back at least}} as far as the 1971 JPL STAR (self testing and repairing) system, designed and built in the Spacecraft Computers Section of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory <b>Astrionics</b> Division [2]. In that context the concept of diversity was termed redundancy. In computer security, diversity is being contemplated as an approach toward mitigating security breaches, or what might be regarded as errors in security. The panel contemplates various issues regarding diversity and security, and this panelist in particular raises a number of questions whose answers may prove valuable at such time as they become available. Until then, perhaps these questions will serve to provoke thoughtful research directions...|$|E
40|$|An {{effort was}} {{initiated}} {{last year in}} the <b>Astrionics</b> Laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center to examine and incorporate, if necessary, the effects of relativity in the design of space-based lidar systems. A space-based lidar system, named AEOLUS, is under development at Marshall Space Flight Center and it will be used to accurately measure atmospheric wind profiles. Effects of relativity were also observed in the performance of space-based systems, for example in case of global positioning systems, and corrections were incorporated into the design of instruments. During the last summer, the effects of special relativity on the design of space-based lidar systems were studied in detail, by analyzing the problem of laser scattering off a fixed target when the source and a co-located receiver are moving on a spacecraft. Since the proposed lidar system uses a coherent detection system, errors even in the order of a few microradians must be corrected to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio. Previous analysis assumed that the ground is flat and the spacecraft is moving parallel to the ground, and developed analytical expressions for the location, direction and Doppler shift of the returning radiation. Because of the assumptions used in that analysis, only special relativity effects were involved. In this report, that analysis is extended to include general relativity and calculate its effects on the design...|$|E
40|$|The European module Columbus of the International Space Station (ISS) {{includes}} {{a number of}} systems that makes it {{to a certain extent}} a stand-alone spacecraft, though all of them are interfaced with the ISS systems and exchange telemetry and data with the station and the ground segments. In particular, the Columbus {{includes a}} Command and Data Handling System (C&DHS) a Communication and Tracking System (C&TS), an Electrical Power System (EPS), an Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), a Thermal Control System (TCS). The only functions that are not carried out by Columbus systems are Attitude Determination and Control (ADC) and Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC). The C&DHS in Columbus is called Data Management System (DMS) and the C&TS is simply called Communication System (COMMS). This paper describes in detail these two strictly <b>astrionics</b> systems on-board the Columbus. The DMS {{is one of the most}} important systems in Columbus module because it interfaces with every other system in the module as well as the ISS. As the "brain" of the module, the DMS monitors all aspects of its operations and distributes payload and systems data to the crew and to personnel on Earth via Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). The architectures of the two systems and of their hardware interfaces are also presented. The DMS hardware includes data processors, control and monitoring processors, crew interface computers, data acquisition and distribution networks and interfaces to systems and payloads. The DMS architecture is structured in two layers: a vital layer and a nominal layer. Safety critical functions are carried out by the vital layer, which features a caution and warning system. An overview of software functions is finally presente...|$|E
40|$|When data is {{transmitted}} through a noisy channel, errors are produced within the data rendering it indecipherable. Through {{the use of}} error control coding techniques, the bit error rate {{can be reduced to}} any desired level without sacrificing the transmission data rate. The <b>Astrionics</b> Laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center has decided to use a modular, end-to-end telemetry data simulator to simulate the transmission of data from flight to ground and various methods of error control. The simulator includes modules for random data generation, data compression, Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) transfer frame formation, error correction/detection, error generation and error statistics. The simulator utilizes a concatenated coding scheme which includes CCSDS standard (255, 223) Reed-Solomon (RS) code over GF(2 (exp 8)) with interleave depth of 5 as the outermost code, (7, 1 / 2) convolutional code as an inner code and CCSDS recommended (n, n- 16) cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code as the innermost code, where n is the number of information bits plus 16 parity bits. The received signal-to-noise for a desired bit error rate is greatly reduced through the use of forward error correction techniques. Even greater coding gain is provided {{through the use of a}} concatenated coding scheme. Interleaving/deinterleaving is necessary to randomize burst errors which may appear at the input of the RS decoder. The burst correction capability length is increased in proportion to the interleave depth. The modular nature of the simulator allows for inclusion or exclusion of modules as needed. This paper describes the development and operation of the simulator, the verification of a C-language Reed-Solomon code, and the possibility of using Comdisco SPW(tm) as a tool for determining optimal error control schemes...|$|E
