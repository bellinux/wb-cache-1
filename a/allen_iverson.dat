5|$|Arcidiacono {{was born}} on March 26, 1994 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He has three older siblings, Sabrina, Nicole, Michael; and younger twin siblings, Christopher and Courtney. His parents, Joe and Patti Arcidiacono, met at Villanova University, where Joe was an {{offensive}} lineman on the football team.

Arcidiacono would often practice shooting jump shots and hitting layups on the small hoop before progressing to an actual basketball court. At one AAU game, Arcidiacono scored 50 points. At another, he hit eight three-pointers in a row. When he was in 7th grade at a basketball camp, Villanova coach Jay Wright said he would one day play for the Wildcats.

5|$|From 2000 to 2002, the Lakers, led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, {{won three}} {{straight}} NBA Championships. O'Neal won the finals MVP all three times. Their first championship {{came at the}} expense of the Indiana Pacers, whom the Lakers defeated in 6 games. During their 2001 postseason run, the Lakers swept their first 3 series and won the Finals in 5 games, finishing with an unprecedented 15–1 record, the best postseason record in NBA history. Their opponent in the Finals that year were the Philadelphia 76ers, led by <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson.</b> In the 2002 NBA Finals, the Lakers swept the New Jersey Nets, leading almost the entire time in each game; only for a short while after the beginning of Game 4 did the New Jersey Nets gain any significant lead in any game.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jordan has won {{the most}} scoring titles, with ten. Jordan and Chamberlain are the only players to have won seven {{consecutive}} scoring titles (this was also Chamberlain's career total). George Gervin, <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson</b> and Durant have won four scoring titles in their career, and George Mikan, Neil Johnston and Bob McAdoo have achieved it three times. Paul Arizin, Bob Pettit, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant, and Russell Westbrook have each won the scoring title twice. Since the 1946–47 season, five players have won both the scoring title and the NBA championship in the same season: Fulks in 1947 with the Philadelphia Warriors, Mikan from 1949 to 1950 with the Minneapolis Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar (then Alcindor) in 1971 with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jordan from 1991 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1998 with the Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal in 2000 with the Los Angeles Lakers. Since {{the introduction of the}} three-point field goal, O'Neal is the only scoring leader to have made no three-point field goals in his winning season.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} by analysts, the team easily secured a {{berth in the}} 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals {{for the first time}} in franchise history. Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson</b> and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim. Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting, after a 39-point performance in Game 6. Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.|$|E

He averaged 2.4 ppg 1.6 rpg and 6.8 minutes of playing time while playing in 7 of the team's 8 games.|$|E
25|$|In Game 1, <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson</b> scored 48 {{points in}} his first ever Finals game as the 76ers made a {{dramatic}} stop to the Lakers' 11-game playoff winning streak (19 overall) and ended the Lakers' perfect run, but his greatest season didn't end {{the way it was}} supposed to as the Lakers would still win their second straight title {{for the first time since}} 1988.|$|E
25|$|O'Neal {{was also}} voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of {{becoming}} the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson,</b> then of the Philadelphia 76ers who {{would go on to}} win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry was dormant {{during the}} rest of the 1980s and the entire 1990s with the 76ers going through tough {{rebuilding}} times. However, the rivalry made a comeback in the 2001 NBA Finals, when the <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson</b> and Dikembe Mutombo-led Sixers met the Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal-led Lakers. The Sixers shocked the world by beating the seemingly unbeatable Lakers in Game 1 at Los Angeles. The Lakers, however, would take the next four games to win the series. The rivalry has cooled since then with both the Sixers and Lakers going through rebuilding periods.|$|E
25|$|Anthony {{was also}} a member of Team USA during the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. The team went undefeated, going 10–0. Anthony ended up as the team's leading scorer and tournament's second-leading scorer with a 21.2 ppg average (191 points in 9 games), which was behind Leandro Barbosa of Brazil. Anthony also added 5.2 rpg, 1.4 apg, 0.7 spg and 0.3 bpg. He equalled the {{previous}} record of 28 points set by <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson</b> in a qualifying tournament, which was later broken by James, who scored 31 points in the title-clinching win against Argentina.|$|E
25|$|Four players {{missed the}} game: Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul and Brandon Roy due to injury; <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson</b> due to {{personal}} reasons. As a result, four more were {{named to the}} roster as replacements: Chauncey Billups for Paul, Chris Kaman for Roy, Jason Kidd for Bryant and David Lee for Iverson.

Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|W+K's {{strategy}} for Nike had consistently been to eschew targeting specific target markets, favouring advertisements and sponsorships of athletes with wide general appeal. The approach was successful; by 2001, Nike's U.S. sales were {{three times that}} of their nearest competitor, Reebok. However, Reebok had just launched an aggressive new campaign for their new RBK line of shoes, backed by celebrities such as <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson,</b> Jadakiss, R. Kelly, and Missy Elliott. They also had just signed a 10-year deal to provide equipment and uniforms to the NBA, a contract previously held by Nike. Other companies, such as Adidas and New Balance were also eating away at Nike's market share.|$|E
25|$|The 76ers {{have had}} a rich history, {{with many of the}} {{greatest}} players in NBA history having played for the organization, including Wilt Chamberlain, Hal Greer, Billy Cunningham, Julius Erving, Moses Malone, Charles Barkley, and <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson.</b> They have won three NBA championships, with their first coming as the Syracuse Nationals in 1955. The second title came in 1967, a team which was led by Chamberlain. The third title came in 1983, won by a team led by Erving and Malone. The 76ers have only been back to the NBA Finals once since then: in 2001, when they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 1.|$|E
25|$|The Nuggets duo of Carmelo Anthony and <b>Allen</b> <b>Iverson</b> got Denver {{off to a}} fast start, winning Game 1 {{and taking}} home-court {{advantage}} away from Tim Duncan and the Spurs. Despite the early letdown, the Spurs showed their championship mettle and bounced back for a 97-88 win in Game 2. In the pivotal Game 3, the Nuggets built an eight-point first-quarter lead before Manu Ginóbili's eight second-quarter points put San Antonio up 43-40 at halftime. A back-and-forth contest turned in the final 2:24 of the third quarter: Michael Finley hit two 3-pointers, and Robert Horry later hit a 3 that gave the Spurs a 75-67 lead {{at the end of}} the quarter.
