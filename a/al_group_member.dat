30|$|The role of {{multicasting}} as a scalable {{solution for}} group communication in MANETs has {{ushered in the}} development of many group key management approaches. While those schemes normally focus on improving security and reducing the size of group keys, forward and backward confidential information should also be provided for multicast applications whenever a user joins or leaves the system. Kim et al. [7] developed a tree-based group key agreement scheme by using a binary tree infrastructure to compute and update a group key efficiently. That study also completed secure and distributed protocols by exploiting the group Diffie-Hellman (GDH) key exchange. Vasudevan and Sukumar [10] developed a scalable secure multicast algorithm by using a multiserver approach when the data encryption key (DEK) had to be changed. To minimize the rekeying cost, their schemes utilize the dynamic split and merge with a low overhead cost, where a physical server splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups, with each group served by a dedicated server. Wang et al. [11] developed a hybrid group key management scheme with a two-level structure where the group users are subdivided into clusters, subsequently reducing the rekeying cost as key updating. While developing a scheme that ensures key and data authenticity among <b>group</b> <b>members,</b> Chiang and Huang [12] demonstrated the data confidentiality of group messages with the properties of forward and backward confidential information. The group key is established collaboratively by combining the keys of all authenticated members, which assists in maintaining the communication and computation transparency among <b>group</b> <b>members.</b> Chaddoud et <b>al.</b> [13] divided <b>group</b> <b>members</b> into several operation units to perform microkey management. Compared with the logical key hierarchy (LKH), the above schemes can more significantly reduce the overload of the key server and provide more efficient key management for a secure wireless multicast. However, the above schemes lack efficient key management mechanisms for members to participate in or leave MANETs dynamically.|$|R

30|$|Self-organizing {{groups have}} been {{recognized}} and studied in various forms, such as autonomous groups in socio-technical systems, enablers of organizational theories, agents of knowledge management, and as examples of complex-adaptive systems (Hoda et al. 2013). In the self-organized groups, group membership is decided by the <b>group</b> <b>members</b> (Li et <b>al.</b> 2014). Additionally, <b>group</b> <b>members</b> must have a common focus, mutual trust, respect, {{and the ability to}} reorganize repeatedly to meet new challenges (Jim and Alistair 2001). Minimum critical specification, requisite variety, redundancy of functions and learning to learn are regarded as the four principles of self-organization in a holographic organization (Morgan 1998). Furthermore, Conradt et al. (2009) indicated that individual <b>members</b> of self-organizing <b>groups</b> can increase their influence on group dynamics by changing their behavior, and group movements are led according to the needs of self-organizing <b>groups</b> (Conradt et <b>al.</b> 2009). Petruzzi et al. (2013) proposed self-organizing flexible demand in smart grids, where consumers can cooperate with each other by using their own social capital to get a certain amount of electricity for {{a certain period of time}} (Petruzzi et al. 2013). Briscoe and De Wilde (2009) extended physical complexity to provide a greater understanding of multi-agent systems with evolutionary dynamics and investigated the self-organizing aspects of digital ecosystems (Briscoe and De Wilde 2009). Self-organization can be generated in multi-agent systems in several ways: direct interactions between agents using basic principles such as localization, indirect interactions between agents, reinforcement of agent behaviors, cooperation between individual agents, and generic architectures or meta-models (Ye et al. 2012). Obidallah et al. (2014) proposed a multilayered procedural framework for the virtual organizations in order to meet the internal and external requirements of the competitive and rapidly changing environment in which they operate (Obidallah et al. 2014).|$|R
