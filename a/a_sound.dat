5000|$|A {{problem with}} {{teaching}} {{the reading of}} English with this analytical approach is that English words {{do not have a}} one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship. If they did have a one-to-one relationship, reading would be easier. In general, with a few common exceptions, the consonants do have a one-to-one speech-sound to symbol relationship but the vowels do not. For instance the letter [...] "a" [...] represents one sound in the word [...] "say", <b>a</b> second <b>sound</b> in [...] "at", <b>a</b> third <b>sound</b> in [...] "any", <b>a</b> fourth <b>sound</b> in [...] "are", <b>a</b> fifth <b>sound</b> in [...] "all", <b>a</b> sixth <b>sound</b> in [...] "about", <b>a</b> seventh <b>sound</b> in [...] "father", <b>an</b> eighth <b>sound</b> in [...] "orange", and <b>a</b> ninth <b>sound</b> (silence) in [...] "bread". The speech-sounds are sometimes influenced by (a) the letters surrounding the target vowel, (b) by the sentence containing the word and (c) the stress, or lack thereof, given to the syllable containing the letter.|$|R

There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
