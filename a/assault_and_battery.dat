5|$|Triple H {{returned}} on the April 30 {{episode of}} Raw, {{when he refused}} {{to give in to}} Brock Lesnar's unreasonable contract demands, resulting in Lesnar attacking him and storyline breaking his arm. Upon his return two weeks later, Triple H was confronted by Lesnar's legal representative, Paul Heyman, who announced Lesnar was filing a lawsuit against WWE for breach of contract. After he accosted Heyman, Heyman threatened another lawsuit against Triple H for <b>assault</b> <b>and</b> <b>battery.</b> At the No Way Out in June, Triple H challenged Lesnar, who was not present, to a match at SummerSlam, which Heyman refused on Lesnar's behalf the following night on Raw. At Raw 1000, Stephanie McMahon goaded Heyman into Triple H's challenge against Lesnar. To anger Triple H, Lesnar broke Michaels's arm on the August 13 episode of Raw.

5|$|The widowed Vernal {{remarried}} to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, {{remained with}} Margaret. With {{most of his}} time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand gleanings from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl {{to the point where he}} feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was rough handling of one of the children. Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After she eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed <b>assault</b> <b>and</b> <b>battery</b> charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, {{as part of}} {{the ongoing}} storyline with Bryan, McMahon {{threatened}} to fire his wife Brie Bella if Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which forced Brie to quit before slapping McMahon in the face. On the June 16 episode of Raw, Roman Reigns spiked the coffee Vickie Guerrero gave to McMahon, causing Stephanie to throw up on Vickie and leave with Triple H to the hospital. Vickie later gave Reigns a chance in the battle royal, which he would win. On the June 23 episode of Raw, Vickie lost in a pudding match against McMahon with her job on the line, after interference by Alicia Fox, Layla and Rosa Mendes. Vickie ultimately lost the match and was fired, however she got her retribution over McMahon by throwing her into the mud pool. After Brie quit, McMahon put Brie's sister Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment. Brie returned to television on the July 21 episode of Raw, appearing in the crowd leading to confrontation between the two. McMahon was (kayfabe) arrested and charged with <b>assault</b> <b>and</b> <b>battery,</b> because she slapped Brie, who was not a (kayfabe) WWE employee The following week, McMahon granted Brie her job back and a match at SummerSlam against her in order to get Brie to drop the lawsuit. On the August 4 episode of Raw, after their contract signing, Stephanie pedigreed both twins. At SummerSlam, Nikki turned on Brie, allowing Stephanie to hit a pedigree on Brie having Stephanie win her first pay per view match in over 10 years.|$|E

60|$|Lest {{the reader}} should get an exaggerated opinion of Hurry's demerits from this boastful and indiscreet revelation, {{it may be}} well to say that his {{offences}} were confined to <b>assaults</b> <b>and</b> <b>batteries,</b> for several {{of which he had}} been imprisoned, when, as he has just said, he often escaped by demonstrating the flimsiness of the constructions in which he was confined, by opening for himself doors in spots where the architects had neglected to place them. But Hetty had no knowledge of gaols, and little of the nature of crimes, beyond what her unadulterated and almost instinctive perceptions of right and wrong taught her, and this sally of the rude being who had spoken was lost upon her.

5000|$|In a {{study of}} more than 30 major U.S. cities during the Prohibition years of 1920 and 1921, the number of crimes {{increased}} by 24%. Additionally, theft and burglaries increased by 9%, homicides by 12.7%, <b>assaults</b> <b>and</b> <b>battery</b> rose by 13%, drug addiction by 44.6%, and police department costs rose by 11.4%. This was largely the result of [...] "black-market violence" [...] and the diversion of law enforcement resources elsewhere. Despite the Prohibition movement's hope that outlawing alcohol would reduce crime, the reality was that the Volstead Act led to higher crime rates than were experienced prior to Prohibition and the establishment of a black market dominated by criminal organizations. The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre produced seven deaths, considered one of the deadliest days of mob history. A 2016 NBER paper showed that South Carolina counties that enacted and enforced prohibition had homicide rates increase by about 30 to 60 percent relative to counties that did not enforce prohibition.|$|R

40|$|Extract: Epidemics of flu, gastro {{and head}} lice aside, the school {{environment}} is generally a safe one. School authorities take care to select appropriate teaching staff. They establish procedures for the supervision of playgrounds, fire and emergency evacuation, and the conduct of sporting and other outdoor events. These procedures ensure that many potential accidents are prevented: science experiments are conducted with care; fights are broken up before anyone gets hurt; classrooms are emptied before fumes or smoke can overwhelm; swimming pools are protected by shade cloth. Occasionally, however, injuries do occur. Many of these injuries {{are the result of}} nothing more than unfortunate and unavoidable accidents among boisterous youth. A smaller number result from the intentional torts of third parties, especially <b>assaults</b> <b>and</b> <b>batteries.</b> This article considers recent developments in the law regarding cases where a teacher’s tortious conduct injures a student. In particular, it compares two decisions of the New South Wales and Queensland Courts of Appeal, and examines their reasoning in light of relevant High court decisions...|$|R
40|$|Summary Aim: Few {{quantified}} data on work {{injuries are}} available {{on a regular basis}} for self-employed workers {{due to a lack of}} legislation and investigation. We designed a two months original survey in the PACA region of southern France. Our aims were first a better epidemiological knowledge of occupational accidents and second to evaluate the opportunity of sharing a common prevention program with salaried workers. Methods: The main ratio is made up of the work injury cases stemmed from regular wage replacement claims at the numerator; health insurance enrolment data provided the denominator. Circumstances were obtained by self administered questionnaires. Data from salaried population were implemented from a bibliographic research. Results: Independent workers’s incidence rate was 15 / 1000 person-years including 0, 67 / 1000 <b>assaults</b> <b>and</b> <b>battery</b> <b>and</b> 2, 47 / 1000 journey accidents. Male gender (OR 2, 058 and IC 95 % 1, 395; 3, 038) and working in the construction sector (OR 4, 849 and IC 95 % 2, 121; 11, 087) were significant risk factors. The lower rate than the salaried, which is 39 / 1000, suggests either a lower risk or under reporting or classification bias. Independent’s on duty journey accidents (1, 54 / 1000) occurred at a higher rate than salaried (1, 18 / 1000). Conclusion : Independents workers results show some heavy trends with higher level of violence, falls, or on duty traffic accidents. But in some lines of business, like the construction sector, where accidents are high, a common program of prevention could be justified. Prat Organ Soins. 2012; 43 (2) : 97 - 1...|$|R
