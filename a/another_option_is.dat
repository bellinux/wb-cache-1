5|$|Debian offers {{different}} network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian {{is available}} via the netinst CD, whereby Debian is installed {{with just a}} base and later added software can be downloaded from the Internet. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to boot the installer from the network.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{to insert}} a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not}} be as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to {{classify}} selection by {{the life cycle}} stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to realign the A2100 {{north of}} the junction, but this <b>option</b> <b>was</b> less {{favourable}} due to environmental concerns.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> a 50-pin {{connector}} at {{the rear}} of the void, for 8" [...] disk drives ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> arming ships for self-defence, which, {{according}} to the Germans, put them outside {{the protection of the}} cruiser rules.|$|R
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids can {{be obtained}} by chemical reduction of either their oxides or their sulfides. Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors. Boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium: B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + 3MgO; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97%. Boron of higher purity (> 99%) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds, such as BCl3 or BBr3, either in a hydrogen atmosphere (2 BX3 + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX) or to the point of thermal decomposition. Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen: SiO2 + C → Si + CO2; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O. Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite (FeAsS) or arsenical pyrite (FeAs2) by heating; alternatively, it {{can be obtained}} from its oxide by reduction with carbon: 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2. Antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron: Sb2S3 → 2 Sb + 3 FeS. Tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH, yielding tellurite, then by electrolytic reduction: TeO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2TeO3 + H2O; Na2TeO3 + H2O → Te + 2 NaOH + O2. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon: TeO2 + C → Te + CO2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to find {{applications}} for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to re-use them.|$|E
25|$|A {{self-healing}} concrete {{has been}} developed that can also last longer than conventional concrete. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to use hydrophobic concrete.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> the [...] "Major Authors" [...] edition. Compressed {{into the}} single volume was a {{selection}} of major authors of each period, from the anonymous author of Beowulf to J. M. Coetzee.|$|R
5000|$|One option favoured by Diamandi {{was to put}} the Principality {{under the}} {{sovereignty}} of the Romanian Crown (as an associated [...] "free state"). <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to link the principality to the ruling Italian House of Savoy. None of these <b>options</b> <b>was</b> to be realised.|$|R
50|$|Fly control <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>option</b> but <b>is</b> {{difficult}} to implement.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to {{sell the}} methane product as biogas. For example, biogas can be compressed, much like natural gas, and used to power motor vehicles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{a sticky}} trap baited with the sex {{pheromone}} {{of the species}} to capture males. The pheromone has been isolated and synthesized, and is commercially available.|$|E
25|$|Yet <b>another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> Farm Hall, {{located at}} the University Farm. Only a handful of students, often majors in {{agricultural}} science, live here each year. Their work on the farm helps them gain useful first-hand experience, as well as help pay for room and board.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{treatment}} <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{injection of}} ethanol into the nodules.|$|R
50|$|The Florentines {{knew that}} <b>another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> open to them. They {{knew that the}} French, under their new king—Louis XII—were intent on {{returning}} to Italy. Florence chose to take their chances with the French rather than the Holy Roman Empire. They felt that France might help them re-conquer Pisa.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> built, a 29 km-long line, later {{part of the}} West Rhine line (Linke Rheinstrecke). It runs in a wide arc through Roisdorf, Sechtem, Brühl and Kalscheuren to St. Pantaleon {{station in}} Cologne. This {{terminal}} station was built immediately after passing through the Pantaleon gate of the medieval Wall.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{the use of}} {{alternative}} fuel composition in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles, making them function partially on renewable energy sources. Other approaches include personal rapid transit, a public transportation concept that offers automated, on-demand, non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways.|$|E
25|$|Yet <b>another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{to use a}} compose key (hardware-based or software-emulated). Pressing the compose key, then ~, {{and then}} n results in ñ. A capital N can be {{substituted}} to produce Ñ, {{and in most cases}} the order of ~ and n can be reversed.|$|E
25|$|Depilation is {{the removal}} of the part of the hair above the surface of the skin. The most common form of {{depilation}} is shaving or trimming. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> the use of chemical depilatories, which work by breaking the disulfide bonds that link the protein chains that give hair its strength.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{additional}} <b>option</b> <b>were</b> the 20-inch rims {{running on}} (front: 235/30/20, rear: 285/25/20) rubber.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> which <b>is</b> slowly {{becoming}} {{available is}} {{minimally invasive surgery}} (MIS) which is performed laparoscopically and thoracoscopically.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> the {{relocation}} {{of most of the}} remaining Romany to existing houses in Obrnice u Mostu, while the rest would be moved to older houses in the new parts of Most. However, the residents of Obrnice refused to live with such a large group of Romany, and the Romany themselves also rejected this option.|$|R
25|$|While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be {{shielded}} from ambient light {{to prevent their}} destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to add overcurrent protection in the external circuit, {{so that when the}} measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{discussion}} {{has taken place}} on ways to make open-source hardware as accessible as open-source software. Providing clear and detailed product documentation is an essential factor facilitating product replication and collaboration in hardware development projects. Practical guides {{have been developed to}} help practitioners to do so. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to design products so they are easy to replicate, as exemplified in the concept of open-source appropriate technology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{probability}} {{proportional to}} size ('PPS') sampling, {{in which the}} selection probability for each element is set to be proportional to its size measure, up {{to a maximum of}} 1. In a simple PPS design, these selection probabilities can then be used as the basis for Poisson sampling. However, this has the drawback of variable sample size, and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> {{to cancel}} Solomon and Sheba altogether: the {{production}} was insured up to $3 {{million in the}} case of the death of one of the six lead players; Lloyd's of London covered the daily $100,000 bill while the film was halted. However, in the end it was decided to proceed with Brynner in the role of Solomon.|$|R
5000|$|A similar {{approach}} {{had been taken}} note of by neighbourly state Kedah, where its state government is looking into the possibility of building such an infrastructure, to [...] "overcome the menace", saying <b>another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> to create more job opportunities for them as {{most of them were}} jobless. The state's Chief Minister Azizan Abdul Razak said: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> that <b>is</b> {{somewhat}} similar to withdrawal of {{application for admission}} is voluntary return. The two are similar in the following respects: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{self-help}} {{based on}} principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Using {{a book or}} a website, a person does the kinds of exercises {{that would be used}} in therapy, but they do it on their own, perhaps with some email or phone support from a therapist. A systematic analysis of trials testing this kind of self-help found that websites, books, and other materials based on cognitive-behavioral therapy could help some people. The best-studied conditions are panic disorder and social phobia.|$|E
25|$|In San Diego, the San Diego Trolley's Blue Line {{goes from}} the San Ysidro Border Crossing, roughly along Interstate 5 to Downtown and Old Town. As the trolley travels it {{also serves as}} a means of {{transportation}} for the southern suburbs. Passengers may transfer at the 12th & Imperial station to an Orange Line trolley, serving the eastern suburbs. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> to transfer at the Old Town Trolley Station to a Green Line trolley serving Mission Valley and the campus of San Diego State University.|$|E
25|$|Many TV tuner/capture cards include remote {{controls}} {{for use with}} the applications included with the card. Software such as Boxee, GB-PVR, SageTV, MediaPortal and Beyond TV {{support the use of}} Windows MCE and other {{remote controls}}. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>is</b> an in-air mouse pointer like the Wii Remote, GlideTV Navigator, or Loop Pointer which gives cursor control from a distance. It is also possible to utilize common wireless keyboards and other peripherals to achieve the same effect (though the range may not be as long as a typical remote control's).|$|E
50|$|Growth hormone <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>option</b> {{that has}} <b>been</b> described.|$|R
50|$|In 1908 Thor {{achieved}} automatic intake valves {{on their}} engine and offered many typical {{options for the}} day. During this time there <b>was</b> <b>options</b> like battery ignition and belt drive. In 1913 Thor offered a Schebler carburetor on its 1200 cc twin. Thor also used updraft carburetors on their engines. In 1916 they offered a 3-speed transmission on their cycle. <b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> an acetylene lamps for light.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> {{a shared}} new purpose built stadium in Javelin Park, an area {{in-between}} Gloucester and Stroud off Junction 12 of the M5 motorway. The ground {{was to be}} used by the football club and Stroud rugby club. However, in the end the rugby club decided not to pursue the proposal, and the area is now being lined up to have an incinerator instead.|$|R
