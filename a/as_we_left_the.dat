60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> {{house to}} return to the woods, Bill shook his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> orchard I {{walked along}} behind Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> room, {{we heard}} his pen {{travelling}} shrilly over the foolscap.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall need}} no hunting. We must {{pick up the}} men at Cissham. You would not leave them to be murdered, too, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Ely men?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I led {{her out of}} {{the court}} into the air. As I passed the [...] "bar," [...] I saw Ambrose, deadly pale, looking after us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> him: <b>the</b> magistrate's {{decision}} had evidently daunted him. His brother Silas had dropped in abject terror on the jailer's chair; the miserable wretch shook and shuddered dumbly, like a cowed dog.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{crash of}} music, a swishing of colored dresses, and then, as the {{orchestra}} ceased, we {{stood before the}} astonished assembly just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> bush, in tattered fur wrappings and torn deerskin, with the stains of leagues of travel on our leggings, while I recollect that a creeper-spike on my heel made holes in the polished marquetry. All eyes were turned toward us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray do," [...] I replied coldly, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> {{trap and}} entered a dry-goods store, gay with Christmas decorations, and crowded with shoppers.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> breaks behind {{we got out}} upon a level pinyon flat. A few cedars grew {{with the}} pinyons. Deer runways and trails were thick.|$|E
60|$|At a hint {{from the}} {{solicitor}} I contented {{myself with a}} more definite promise to do me justice. Then <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> office, Martin Lorimer turned to the editor.|$|E
60|$|Prudence {{dictated}} {{that we should}} wait until daybreak; but I believe of a verity {{it would have made}} me wild to remain in that spot inactive, thinking only of my folly, and now, <b>as</b> when <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> canoe, I pressed on with but one idea in mind; but, fortunately, yet retaining so much of common sense as to understand that we must be on the alert to gain such information as was possible during the journey.|$|R
5000|$|The SDF {{chose to}} seek {{international}} affiliation immediately with the Socialist International, {{over the objections}} of some delegates like William Karlin of New York, who urged his fellows to wait the short time until [...] "the Trotsky Communists who call themselves the Socialist Party" [...] joined the Fourth International before seeking admission. This theme of communist influence in the Socialist Party from whence they sprung was echoed by Louis Waldman, who declared to the press than Norman Thomas had come under [...] "communist influence" [...] and that [...] "rather than lose our identity <b>as</b> Americans, <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> party." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> found {{everything}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> it at <b>the</b> camp, and we {{made our}} beds apparently dry. But I did not sleep well. I could not help thinking {{that it was not}} safe to sleep in a bed with a substratum of wet mattress, and I worried Euphemia a little by asking her several times if she felt the dampness striking through.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shan't say, my dear, {{that your}} wife {{has helped to}} make you uneasy by {{so much as a}} word or a look," [...] she whispered to me <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> inn.|$|E
60|$|Guest {{had never}} lost {{his sense of}} humor. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> agent's office and walked down Wellington Street into the Strand, he studied {{for a few moments}} my {{personal}} appearance, and began to laugh softly.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> house Lestrade {{remained}} in the front room, while the repentant constable {{opened the door to}} let us out. Holmes turned on the step and held up something in his hand. The constable stared intently.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was called}} in to them on the very day of their arrival," [...] she said; [...] "the husband was the first to take to his bed, and the wife {{followed}} suit twelve hours afterwards. We placed them in adjoining rooms, and, as often <b>as</b> was possible, <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> door ajar so that they could call out to one another.|$|R
40|$|Robert Garisto {{tells us}} (Physics Today, August 2016, page 10) of the secrecy he {{maintained}} at Physical Review Letters {{prior to the}} announcement that a “chirp” had been detected at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). On sabbatical at Caltech, I {{had the pleasure of}} joining local astronomers to watch the press conference from the astronomy and astrophysics auditorium (whose street number, 1216, is the Lyman-alpha wavelength in angstroms). But <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> after <b>the</b> dazzling announcement, with music in our ears, they gave out coffee cups and bumper stickers each with the data already emblazoned on it. I should have hung out in the print shop days before...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had no orders, general; but I was {{appointed}} to command the first company that entered, {{and was told that}} we were to turn right and <b>left</b> along <b>the</b> ramparts. It struck me that <b>as,</b> when <b>we</b> had <b>left,</b> <b>the</b> enemy would be sure to turn their guns upon us, it would be as well to silence them, so I brought the nails and a hammer with me for the purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will all}} come," [...] she said, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> table. [...] "One soon loses step with events in San Gabriel, but the bazar {{will help us}} {{to catch up with}} the world," [...] she added, mirthfully.|$|E
6000|$|The {{soldiers}} bustled about, {{and were}} ready to move. We were led out, along with Dougal, in the capacity of prisoners. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> hut, I heard our companion in captivity remind the Captain of [...] "ta foive kuineas." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> room, I heard but {{one comment}} all round, thus voiced by a school-boy: [...] "I'd a jolly sight rather {{it had been}} old Vandrift. This Clay chap's too clever by half to waste on a prison!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Red Star: Sword of Lies is the {{continuation}} of the comic series that brings readers back to <b>the</b> events <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> them in <b>the</b> previous Red Star Trade Paperback, 'Prison of Souls'. It also takes readers back into the time of the Great Revolution, revealing the downfall of the summoner Imbohl. Once a leader of the Revolution, Imbohl's embrace of evil is the origin of The Red Star saga. This run is currently on issue #3. Issue #3 premiered at Comicon International San Diego 2008 ...|$|R
6000|$|How we had wasted Ireland! The rich {{values that}} lay in Ireland, the gallantry and gifts, the {{possible}} friendliness, {{all these things}} were being <b>left</b> to <b>the</b> Ulster politicians and the Tory women to poison and spoil, just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> India to <b>the</b> traditions of the chattering army women and the repressive instincts of our mandarins. We were too lazy, we were too negligent. We passed our indolent days leaving everything to somebody else. Was this the incurable British, {{just as it was}} the incurable Britling, quality? ...|$|R
60|$|Before I well {{understood}} that it was advisable {{to get out of}} the bird's way, my companion had put spurs to his horse, and was off like an arrow. Or ever I was aware what my horse meant to do, I was almost thrown to the ground. He whirled on his hind-legs--without orders,--and went off like the wind. Nothing but a natural tendency to hold tight with my knees prevented me from being <b>left</b> beside Blind-boy. <b>We</b> went at racing-speed to the gate, and then found, on looking back, that we might have spared ourselves the rush, for Blind-boy was standing <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> him! <b>The</b> ditch had proved an impassable barrier, and he was gazing after us in apparent wonder at our haste. My own wonder at the smart behaviour of my horse was removed when Johnny told me that it was the identical steed his father had ridden when attacked, as I have described, by Master.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a charming}} family," [...] said my companion, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> door; [...] "and I feel {{proud of being}} able to claim some {{affinity}} to it, though it is not so near as I trust it may one day become." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{walked home}} {{together}} {{as far as}} Stanhope Gate. Our sense of doom oppressed us. [...] "And yet," [...] I said, turning to her, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> doorstep, [...] "I don't doubt Mrs. Le Geyt really believes she IS a model stepmother!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> gallery, I {{asked him}} what he thought of the Cleopatra (after making him laugh by telling him how Professor Emanuel had sent me to the right about, and taking him to see the sweet series of {{pictures}} recommended to my attention.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Lord Francis Douglas and I dined at the Monte Rosa hotel, and {{had just}} {{finished}} when Mr. Hudson and a friend entered the salle à manger. They had returned from inspecting the mountain and some idlers in the room demanded their intentions. We heard a confirmation of Croz's statement, and learned that Mr. Hudson intended to set off on the morrow at the same hour <b>as</b> ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> room to consult, and {{agreed that it was}} undesirable for two independent parties {{to be on the same}} mountain at the same time with the same object. Mr Hudson was therefore invited to join us, and he accepted our proposal. Before admitting his friend—Mr. Hadow—I took the precaution of asking what he had done in the Alps, and, as well as I remember, Mr. Hudson's reply was, [...] "Mr. Hadow has done Mont Blanc in less time than most men." [...] Whymper, Scrambles amongst the Alps ...|$|R
5000|$|Reverse {{culture shock}} is {{generally}} {{made up of}} two parts: idealization and expectations. When {{an extended period of}} time is spent abroad we focus on the good from our past, cut out the bad, and create an idealized version of the past. Secondly, once removed from our familiar setting and placed in a foreign one we incorrectly assume that our previous world has not changed. We expect things to remain exactly <b>the</b> same <b>as</b> when <b>we</b> <b>left</b> them. <b>The</b> realization that life back home is now different, that the world has continued without us, and the process of readjusting to these new conditions as well as actualizing our new perceptions about the world with our old way of living causes discomfort and psychological anguish.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Slope, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have said, <b>left</b> <b>the</b> palace with {{a feeling}} of {{considerable}} triumph. Not that he thought that his difficulties were all over--he did not so deceive himself--but he felt that he had played his first move well, as well as the pieces on the board would allow, and that he had nothing with which to reproach himself. He first of all posted the letter to the archbishop and, having made that sure, proceeded to push the advantage which he had gained. Had Mrs. Bold been at home, he would have called on her, but he knew that she was at Plumstead, so he wrote the following note. It was the beginning of what, he trusted, might be a long and tender series of epistles.|$|R
6000|$|... "You look {{capable of}} {{punishing}} him for it," [...] I answered, and as I spoke, I shuddered; for I saw her expression {{was precisely the}} expression Mrs. Le Geyt's face had worn for a passing second when her husband accidentally trod on her dress <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> dining-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "It really vexes me," [...] {{observed}} Zenobia, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> room, [...] "that Mr. Hollingsworth {{should be}} such a laggard. I should not have thought him at all {{the sort of person}} to be turned back by a puff of contrary wind, or a few snowflakes drifting into his face." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took the}} reins {{and started the}} horse. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> house I saw my {{mistress}} and Josephine looking after us from two of the windows on the second floor. The memory of those two attentive faces--one so fair and so good, the other so yellow and so wicked--haunted my mind perpetually for many days afterward.|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} {{properties of the}} human as an information-processing device differ in significant ways from the corresponding properties of the standard digital computer. One such important difference is that items in human long-term memory (e. g., names, numbers, facts) differ greatly in accessibility [...] that is, in the likelihood {{that they can be}} retrieved (recalled) when needed. Retrieval of information from long-term memory is erratic, probabilistic, and context dependent in ways that would seem intolerable in the search of a computer's memory. From one perspective, the unreliable nature of the retrieval of information from human memory seems nothing more than a weakness of the system. From another perspective, however, the retrieval failures we suffer are a by-product of a system that is, overall, adaptive. Given the virtually unlimited storage capacity of human memory, and the relatively slow rate of neural transmission, we do not want everything in our long-term memories to be accessible, particularly when that information is irrelevant or out of date (such <b>as</b> where <b>we</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> car yesterday, or the address where an important business associate used to work). We argue herein that the pattern of accessibility across items in memory changes in dynamic and adaptive ways as a consequence of input (presentation) events, output (recall) events, and shifts in environmental, social, and mood-state cues, and that inhibitory processes (and recovery over time from such inhibition) {{play a central role in}} such changes...|$|R
60|$|The next day, the 11th of September, {{the troops}} {{remained}} halted at Ghosam, and another squadron {{was ordered to}} escort the Intelligence Officer, Captain H.E. Stanton, D.S.O., while making a topographical reconnaissance of the passes into the Utman Khel country. The opportunity of making fresh maps and of adding to and correcting the detail of existing maps only occurs when troops are passing through the country, and must not be neglected. The route lay up the main valley which leads to Nawagei. We started early, but the way was long and the sun high before we reached {{the entrance of the}} pass. The landscape was one of the strangest I shall ever see. On the opposite bank of the river were the dwellings of the Utman Khels, and in an area seven miles by three, I counted forty-six separate castles, complete with moats, towers and turrets. The impression produced was extraordinary. It suggested Grimm's fairy tales. It almost seemed <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> natural earth and strayed into some strange domain of fancy, the resort of giants or ogres.|$|R
6000|$|Upon {{lighting}} the gas we found our victim as before, sitting absolutely <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> her. <b>The</b> table edge was twenty-four inches from her finger-tips. The {{place where the}} cone lay, which we had marked with chalk {{when it was first}} drummed upon, was thirty-six inches from one hand and forty inches from the other. But the most inexplicable of all--the tangible, permanent record--was the seven sheets of paper which were lying upon a couch six feet from Mrs. Smiley's left hand. They were all written upon legibly, and pinned together with a black pin, which had been thrust through the writing. [...] "Wilbur" [...] had scrawled his name, Mrs. Fowler's father's name was signed to a message, and there were other signatures unknown to any of us. The pencil was on the carpet, forty inches from Mrs. Smiley's hand. The leaves of paper, at the moment when they were grasped and lifted, were more than forty inches from her finger-tips. How this was done I do not know: but of this I am absolutely sure: the psychic did not remove them from the table by means of her ordinary, material limbs. Barring the failure to disassociate her voice from that of [...] "Wilbur," [...] she had met every demand upon her. Her powers were truly magical. I cannot say I saw the cone move, but I have proven that the psychic did not surreptitiously touch it or fraudulently write upon the papers during this sitting. I cannot swear that Fowler was controlling his wife's hands while the cone was floating (and while I held the psychic's imprisoned hands), but I believe he was. In short, barring the one sense of sight--an all-important one, I admit--these happenings were convincing and fitted in with phenomena which I had secured with other psychics.|$|R
