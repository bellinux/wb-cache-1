We talked about a lot of {{different}} things outside of cycling and I was fortunate to really get to know him when my career stopped. I believe he was also one of the generation that was cut short in the early nineties because he was not able to fulfill the rest of his career. But he was a great rider." ...|$|E

In that episode, Penn & Teller play a card game where each card depicts <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>person</b> in history. Each player picks a few cards at random, and bets on whether one thinks one's card shows a greater person than the other players' cards based on a characterization such as humanitarianism or scientific achievement. Penn gets Norman Borlaug, and proceeds to bet all his chips, his house, his rings, his watch, and essentially everything he's ever owned.

Craig Bellamy of Liverpool was {{withdrawn}} from Liverpool's squad by his manager Kenny Dalglish, as he was too affected by the news to play.

Dalglish himself had signed Speed for Newcastle, and expressed his sadness at the news, saying that he thought Speed {{was not only a}} great footballer but also <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>person.</b> Another of Speed's former teammates, Hugo Viana, also paid tribute to him.

2500|$|In 1991, Ferguson {{rented a}} room in the Flatbush {{neighborhood}} of Brooklyn. He was unemployed. Ferguson lived around many other West Indian immigrants. Neighbors said he dressed very neatly, but kept to himself and rarely smiled or spoke to anybody, except occasionally to say hello. His landlord Patrick Denis said Ferguson once told him, [...] "I'm such <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>person.</b> There must be only one thing holding me back. It must be white people." [...] In 1992, Ferguson's ex-wife Audrey Warren filed a complaint with police alleging Ferguson pried open the trunk of her car. Prior to the incident, Warren had not seen him since the divorce. In February 1992, Ferguson {{was arrested and charged with}} harassing a woman on a subway. The woman tried to sit in a vacant seat alongside Ferguson and asked him to move over, prompting Ferguson to scream at her and press his leg and elbow against her until police officers pinned him to the ground. Ferguson tried to escape the police and shouted [...] "Brothers, come help me!" [...] Ferguson sent letters to the New York City Police Commissioner and other officials complaining about his arrest, describing it as [...] "viscous and racist", and claiming he was brutalized by the officers who arrested him.

2500|$|The {{work was}} {{commissioned}} in about 1380 or 1390, perhaps {{by the person}} who later owned it, Jean, Duc de Berry, brother of Charles V of France, and the leading commissioner of illuminated manuscripts of the day. The original commissioner was certainly <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>person</b> of the French court – Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, uncle of the King and Berry, has also been suggested. [...] It {{seems to have been}} conceived, very unusually, as a combined book of hours, prayer-book and missal, all parts to be lavishly illustrated. [...] The first artist involved was the leading master of the period known as the Master of the Narbonne Parement. [...] There was another campaign by other artists in about 1405, by which time the manuscript was probably owned by the Duke of Berry, who had certainly acquired it by 1413, when the work, still very incomplete, was given to the Duke's treasurer, Robinet d'Estampes, who divided it. [...] D'Estampes retained most of the actual book of hours, whose illustrations were largely complete, which became known as the Très Belles Heures de Notre-Dame. [...] This remained in his family until the 18th century, and was finally given to the BnF in Paris (MS: Nouvelle acquisition latine 3093) by the Rothschild family in 1956, after they had owned it for nearly a century. [...] This section contains 126 folios with 25 miniatures, the latest perhaps of about 1409, and includes work by the Limbourg brothers.|$|E
