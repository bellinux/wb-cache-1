Photographic evidence is presented demonstrating that the African bombardier beetle, Stenaptinus insignis, can <b>aim</b> its <b>spray</b> in virtually any direction. It can target its individual legs, and even the individual segments of its legs. Moreover, in aiming at a leg, it takes into account the postural orientation of that leg. The beetle is able even to target sites on its back. It is postulated that the ability to aim helps the beetle mainly in defense against ants...|$|R

40|$|<b>Aim</b> : <b>Spray</b> dried solid {{dispersion}} (SDP) of crystalline simvastatin (SIM) in a fast disintegrating matrix of superdisintegrants was studied {{as a method}} to enhance SIM dispersibility, rheology, compactibility and compressibility for incorporation into orodispersible tablets (ODTs). Materials and Methods: The superdisintegrants investigated were crospovidone (CP), sodium starch glycollate (SSG) and calcium silicate (CS) were spray dried with simvastatin to form SDPs. Results: The SDPs were characterized and the median particle size of SDPs was similar or greater than the SIM, contributing to good rheology of SDPs, while the low bulk density of SDPs indicated a high compactibility. Interestingly electron micrographs for SDPs showed a CP or CS carrier coating of the SIM crystals, contributing to its rheology. Thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction conﬁ rmed that SIM was crystalline in the SDPs and no interaction between SIM and any of the carrier(s) was shown by Fourier transform-infra red. Drug content analysis showed a SIM content of 90 - 95...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface of}} metal parts {{operating}} at high temperature in energy production and aerospace industry is typically exposed to thermal stresses and oxidation phenomena. To this <b>aim,</b> plasma <b>spraying</b> {{was employed to}} deposit NiCoCrAlYRe coatings on metal substrates. The effects of early-stage oxidation, at ~ 1100 °C, on their microstructure were investigated. The partial infiltration of oxygen through some open pores and microcracks embedded in coating microstructure locally assisted {{the formation of a}} stable Al 2 O 3 scale at the splat boundary, while the diffusion of Cr and Ni and the following growth of Cr 2 O 3, Ni(Cr,Al) 2 O 4 and NiO were restricted to Al depleted isolated areas. At the same time, a continuous, dense and well adherent Al 2 O 3 layer grew on the top-surface, and was somewhere supported by a thin mixed oxide scale mainly composed of Cr 2 O 3 and spinels. Based on these results, the addition of Re to the NiCoCrAlY alloy is able to enhance the oxidation resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow in the}} {{secondary}} air system of a gas turbine engine passes over numerous oil supply and scavenge pipes and a fracture in such a pipe will cause a jet of oil to be ejected as a spray. This spray will disperse in the surrounding flow. Accurate and reliable numerical modelling of these sprays presents significant problems {{due in part to}} their complexity, but also the lack of experimental data available for model validation. This paper describes the design, manufacture, testing and results from an experimental test rig <b>aimed</b> at <b>spray</b> characterisation. The sprays considered were produced through a round sharp edged nozzle with a 0. 57 mm diameter and a length to diameter ratio of 1 61. The spray was introduced normal to the cross flow. Phase Doppler Anemometry was used to determine droplet size and velocity for Weber numbers within the range of 13 < We(g) < 580 and Momentum Flux Ratio within the range of 0. 8 < q < 136, resulting in 19 different spray fields Each of these spray fields has been characterised at three axial locations. Contours of droplet size, mass flux distribution, axial droplet velocity and transverse droplet velocity are presented. In addition, a pulsed laser sheet and CCD camera were used to analyse the jet behaviour in terms of break up length and jet trajectory...|$|R
40|$|In soils {{having a}} {{significant}} within-field spatial variability of physiical, {{chemical and biological}} characteristics, conventional agriculture, based on the the distribution of equal rates of crop inputs (fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides, etc.) can cause excess of these inputs in some points and deficit in others. The implementation of precision agriculture can prevent these spoilage or deficit. Herbicide spraying {{is one of the}} field operations which can get economical benefits from the spatially variable soil managemnent. The section of Agricultural Mechanisation of the Department of Engineering and Technologies in Agriculture and Forestry (ITAF) has set up a system for spraying herbicide in annual herbaceous crops. This system, mounted on a sprayer, consists of: a DGPS system, able to compute the machine real time "corrected" position; an electronic system, able to set up the herbicide rate, proportionally related to the machine forward speed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} investigation of inlet air pre-cooling with water <b>sprays</b> <b>aimed</b> {{to enhance the}} performance of Natural Draft Dry Cooling Towers during high ambient temperature periods. An open-circuit wind tunnel with a test 1 × 1 m test cross section and length of 5. 2 m was employed as an approximation to the inlet flow in a Natural Draft Cooling Tower. Experimental measurements of droplet evaporation and air cooling are presented. Nine high pressure, hollow cone nozzles were tested at various droplet sizes, air velocities (1, 2, 3 m/s), and injection rates under different ambient conditions. The water spray was characterized using a Phase Doppler Particle Analyser (PDPA). The effects of drop size distribution and air velocity on droplet evaporation and cooling effectiveness were investigated. The data shows clear trends of cooling with low air velocity or small droplet size distribution. It {{was found that the}} spray cooling efficiency, to a large extent, is dependent on spray coverage area. The experimental findings will benefit optimizing spray cooling performance in Natural Draft Dry Cooling Towers and nozzle arrangement...|$|R
40|$|According {{to the new}} EU {{directive}} {{on sustainable}} use of pesticides (EC 2009 / 128) calibration of sprayers has to be implemented in the EU Member States. It is also required in the environmental and operators’ safety context of different documents and guidelines determining the implementation of good practices or the compliance with standards of certified crop production. The most recent guidelines underline the up-to-date opinion that calibration of sprayer should optimise the on-crop product deposition, and reduce the off-target loss of pesticides. Therefore calibration for orchard sprayers should in particular include aspects regarding spray volume determination, airflow adjustment and selection of the type, number and configuration of nozzles, <b>aiming</b> at high <b>spray</b> application quality and its environmental impact. Spray volume adapted to specific orchard may be calculated based on Tree Row Volume concept. The air flow setting includes adjustment of air volume/velocity, air flow range and air- flow direction/deflection. The type, number and configuration of nozzles are selected aiming at enhanced deposition and distribution of spray in the crop canopy, and reduced spray drift. The practical methods of calibration considering these aspects are proposed in this paper...|$|R

In orderto {{increase}} efficiency of its control, this research objectified to study the oviposition behavior in the field, <b>aiming</b> tosubsidize the <b>spray</b> of insecticides. The {{study was conducted in}} areas of corn seed production in the municipality ofSanto Augusto, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. After starting style-stigma emission, monitoring of the H. zea infestationwas performed by verifying the presence of eggs in these structures. Daily, 20 corn ears were sampled at 10 randomizedpoints of two areas. From the oviposition data curve, the most appropriate time to carry out chemical control of H. zea was determined, by simulating spray intervals of 4, 5, 6 and 7 days. In both study areas, at 14 days from the startof emission of styles-stigma, 70 % of the corn ears were infested with eggs of H. zea. For the chemical control of H. zea, the best time for the first spray is 4 days after starting emission of styles-stigma, and reapplication after 4 days. In this simulation, 44. 5, 48. 5 and 7. 0 % of the corn ears will receive two, one or no spray of insecticide, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Cold gas dynamic spray {{is being}} {{explored}} as a repair technique for high-value metallic components, given {{its potential to}} produce pore and oxide-free deposits of between several micrometers and several millimeters thick with good levels of adhesion and mechanical strength. However, feedstock powders for cold spray experience rapid solidification if manufactured by gas atomization and hence can exhibit non-equilibrium microstructures and localized segregation of alloying elements. Here, we used sealed quartz tube solution heat treatment of a precipitation hardenable 7075 aluminum alloy feedstock to yield a consistent and homogeneous powder phase composition and microstructure prior to cold <b>spraying,</b> <b>aiming</b> for a more controllable heat treatment response of the cold spray deposits. It was shown that the dendritic microstructure and solute segregation in the gas-atomized powders were altered, such that the heat-treated powder exhibits a homogeneous distribution of solute atoms. Micro-indentation testing revealed that the heat-treated powder exhibited a mean hardness decrease of nearly 25 % compared to the as received powder. Deformation of the powder particles was enhanced by heat treatment, resulting in an improved coating with higher thickness (* 300 lm compared to * 40 um for untreated feedstock). Improved particle–substrate bonding was evidenced by formation of jets at the particle boundaries...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of mannitol has increased recently as an emerging diluent for orodispersible dosage forms. The study <b>aims</b> to prepare <b>spray</b> dried mannitol retaining high porosity and mechanical strength {{for the development}} of orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs). Aqueous feed of d-mannitol (10 % w/v) comprising ammonium bicarbonate, NH 4 HCO 3 (5 % w/v) as pore former was spray dried at inlet temperature of 110 - 170 °C. Compacts were prepared at 151 MPa and characterized for porosity, hardness and disintegration time. Particle morphology and drying mechanisms were studied using thermal (HSM, DSC and TGA) and polymorphic (XRD) methods. Tablet porosity increased from 0. 20 ± 0. 002 for pure mannitol to 0. 53 ± 0. 03 using fabricated porous mannitol. Disintegration time dropped by 50 - 77 % from 135 ± 5. 29 s for pure mannitol to 75. 33 ± 2. 52 - 31. 67 ± 1. 53 s for mannitol 110 - 170 °C. Hardness increased by 150 % at 110 °C (258. 67 ± 28. 89 N) and 30 % at 150 °C (152. 70 ± 10. 58 N) compared to pure mannitol tablets (104. 17 ± 1. 70 N). Increasing inlet temperature resulted in reducing tablet hardness due to generation of 'micro-sponge'-like particles exhibiting significant elastic recovery. Impact of mannitol polymorphism on plasticity/elasticity cannot be ruled out as a mixture of α and β polymorphs formed upon spray drying...|$|R

The experiment was carried out using a complete randomized factorial design. Samples were three solution of chitosan (CS) -maltodextrin (MD) based nanoparticles i. e. CS (0. 5 % w/v) and MD (9. 5 % w/v) in acetic acid (1. 0 % v/v) without liquid smoke (F 1), only MD (10 % w/v) in liquid smoke (F 2) and a mixture of CS (1. 5 % w/v) and MD (8. 5 % w/v) in liquid smoke (F 5). Each sample solution was prepared at 10 % solid contents with addition of 1. 0 % sodium tripolyphosphate. The experimental factors were inlet air temperatures (T) of 130 °C (T 1) and 150 °C (T 2) and feed flow rate (L) of 2. 4 mL/minute (L 1) and 5. 1 mL/minute (L 2). The parameters evaluated included bulk density, yield, moisture content, water activity, morphology and particle size. Results showed that the average particle sizes decreased when the inlet air temperature increased. The bulk density, moisture content and water activity of powders tended to decrease {{with the increase of}} inlet air temperature. In contrast, the powder yield increased with increasing of inlet air temperature.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} induced chlorosis {{represents the}} main nutritional disorder in fruit tree orchards grown on calcareous and/or alkaline soils. Until rootstocks tolerant to Fe deficiency chlorosis {{are available for}} most susceptible fruit species, the agronomic means of preventing or curing Fe deficiency chlorosis will be considered of utmost importance by fruit growers. Chlorosis of fruit trees has been successfully controlled through foliar or soil applications of Fe chelates, which are expensive {{and have to be}} applied annually. In this paper results of research carried out within an EU joint research project are reported, where the effectiveness of alternative, low-input, environmentally friendly management techniques to control Fe deficiency chlorosis has been tested in established kiwifruit, peach and pear orchards located in the Po Valley (Italy), in the Ebro Valley (Spain) and in the area of Imathia (Greece). Iron sulphate supply to the soil proved to be effective only if applied together with high amounts of organic matter such as compost or manure. Promising results in preventing chlorosis were obtained by sowing a mixture of graminaceous species along the tree row and supplying them with Fe sulphate. Laboratory tests indicated that long lasting decreases of pH in calcareous soils are difficult to achieve. We have also followed two approaches using foliar sprays: 1) testing a variety of compounds which may activate the Fe pool likely present in chlorotic leaves (citric, sulphuric, ascorbic and indole- 3 -acetic acid) and 2) applying Fe sources alternative to synthetic Fe chelates. <b>Sprays</b> <b>aiming</b> to activate the Fe pools in a chlorotic leaf were generally effective, although rarely caused a full recovery. This suggests that inactivation of Fe occurs outside the mesophyll cells. Sprays of Fe sulphate in all the crops tested showed similar or even higher regreening effect than FeDTPA.
