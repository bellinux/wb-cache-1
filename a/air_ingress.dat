5000|$|Although {{controversy}} arose between Stephenson's {{design and}} the Davy lamp (invented by Humphry Davy in the same year), Stephenson's original design worked on significantly different principles from Davy's final design. If the lamp were sealed except for a restricted <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> (and a suitably sized chimney) then the presence of dangerous amounts of firedamp in the incoming air would (by its combustion) reduce the oxygen concentration inside the lamp {{so much that the}} flame would be extinguished. (Stephenson had convinced himself of the validity of this approach by his experiments with candles near lit blowers: as lit candles were placed upwind of the blower the blower flame grew duller; with enough upwind candles the blower flame went out.) To guard against the possibility of a flame travelling back through the incoming gases (an explosive backblast), <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> was by a number of small-bore orifices through which the air flowed at a velocity higher than the velocity of the flame in a mixture of firedamp (mostly methane) and air. The body of the lamp was lengthened to give the flame a greater convective draw, and thus allow a greater inlet flow restriction and make the lamp less sensitive to air currents. Davy had originally attempted a safety lamp on similar principles, before preferring to enclose the flame inside a brass gauze cylinder; he had publically identified the importance of allowing the restricted airflow in through small orifices (in which the flame velocity is lower) before Stephenson had, and he and his adherents remained convinced that Stephenson had not made this discovery independently.|$|E

Significant <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> is a concern because it introduces potential to expose the fuel, graphite support rods, and core to a risk of severe graphite oxidation. Two of the most probable <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> scenarios involve rupture of a control rod or fuel access standpipe, and rupture in the main coolant pipe on {{the lower part of}} the reactor pressure vessel. Therefor, establishing a fundamental understanding of <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> phenomena is critical in order to rationally evaluate safety of existing VHTRs and develop new designs that mimimize these risks. But despite this importance, progress toward development these predictive capabilities has been slowed by the complex nature of the underlaying phenomena.

This paper gives an overview of basic phenomena of graphite burning like ignition conditions and moving reaction fronts. The pioneering graphite burning experiments of Don Schweitzer are successfully reevaluated. Ignition conditions are examined, and it is underlined that burning depends not only on graphite properties {{but also on the}} heat balance in the whole graphite arrangement. In graphite-moderated reactors, ignition occurs at about 650 °C for small air flow rates: this means that normal operation temperatures in HTRs always allow for ignition. Fuel behaviour in <b>air</b> <b>ingress,</b> as determined in the KORA facility, is discussed: up to about 1300 °C modern TRISO fuel is stable in air, but from 1500 °C a complete, fast destruction is observed. Exemplary calculations on massive <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> by chimney draught performed with REACT/THERMIX are outlined. For a hot bottom reflector there is a substantial time span before fuel is attacked. Because severe <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> in well-designed HTRs belongs to beyond design basis accidents, the knowledge is fairly good.

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} power plant, a {{potential}} risk in some low probable situations of severe accidents is <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> into the vessel, due to a chimney effect from core heat. Air is a highly oxidizing atmosphere that can enhance core oxidation and degradation intensified by nitride formation. In addition, air may {{have an effect on}} the release of fission products, especially that of ruthenium which is of particular interest due to its high radio-toxicity and ability to form highly volatile oxides. Because of an oxygen affinity decrease from Zircaloy claddings to fuel matrix and ruthenium inclusions, claddings are firstly oxidized by air.

40|$|Background: Dental handpieces {{are used}} in {{critical}} and semi-critical operative interventions. Although a number of dental professional bodies recommend that dental handpieces are sterilized between patient use {{there is a lack}} of clarity and understanding of the effectiveness of different steam sterilization processes. The internal mechanisms of dental handpieces contain narrow lumens (0 · 8 - 2 · 3 mm) which can impede the removal of <b>air</b> and <b>ingress</b> of saturated steam required to achieve sterilization conditions. Aim: To identify the extent of sterilization failure in dental handpieces using a non-vacuum process. Methods: In-vitro and in-vivo investigations were conducted on commonly used UK benchtop steam sterilizers and three different types of dental handpieces. The sterilization process was monitored inside the lumens of dental handpieces using thermometric (TM) methods (dataloggers), chemical indicators (CI) and biological indicators (BI). Findings: All three methods of assessing achievement of sterility within dental handpieces that had been exposed to non-vacuum sterilization conditions demonstrated a significant number of failures (CI= 8 / 3, 024 (fails/n tests); BI= 15 / 3, 024; TM= 56 / 56) compared to vacuum sterilization conditions (CI= 2 / 1, 944; BI= 0 / 1, 944; TM= 0 / 36). The dental handpiece most likely to fail sterilization in the non-vacuum process was the surgical handpiece. Non-vacuum sterilizers located in general dental practice had a higher rate of sterilization failure (CI= 25 / 1, 620; BI= 32 / 1, 620; TM= 56 / 56) with no failures in vacuum process.

In particular, the release of metallic dust and droplets from plasmafacing components is a crucial aspect of reactor operation. By penetrating into the burning plasma, these micrometric particles act as a source of impurities which tend to radiate away the plasma energy, cooling it down below the threshold temperatures for sustainable fusion reactions. By accumulating in the reactor chamber, dust particles tend to retain fuel elements, lowering the reactor efficiency and increasing its radioactivity content. Dust accumulation also increases the risk of explosive hydrogen production upon accidental <b>air</b> or water <b>ingress</b> in the vacuum chamber. Numerical dust transport codes provide the essential framework to guide theoretical and experimental dust studies by simulating the intricate couplings between the many physical processes driving dust dynamics in fusion plasmas.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that Al-Zn-Mg-(Cu) aluminum alloys are susceptible to hydrogen environment assisted cracking (HEAC) when exposed to aqueous environments. In Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys, overaged tempers are commonly used to increase HEAC resistance {{at the expense of}} strength. Overaging has little benefit in low copper alloys. However, the mechanism or mechanisms by which overaging imparts HEAC resistance is poorly understood. The present research investigated hydrogen uptake, diffusion, and crack growth rate in 90 % relative humidity (RH) air for both a commercial copper bearing Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy (AA 7050) and a low copper variant of this alloy in order to better understand the factors which affect HEAC resistance. Experimental methods used to evaluate hydrogen concentrations local to a surface and near a crack tip include nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), focused ion beam, secondary ion mass spectroscopy (FIB/SIMS) and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). When freshly bared coupons of AA 7050 are exposed to 90 C, 90 % RH <b>air,</b> hydrogen <b>ingress</b> follows inverse-logarithmic-type kinetics and is equivalent for underaged (HEAC susceptible) and overaged (HEAC resistant) tempers. However, when the native oxide is allowed to form (24 hrs in 25 C, 40 % RH lab air) prior to exposure to 90 C, 90 % RH air, underaged alloy shows significantly greater hydrogen ingress than the overaged alloy. Humid air is a very aggressive environment producing local ({approx} 1 {micro}m) hydrogen concentrations in excess of 10, 000 wt. ppm at 90 C. In the copper bearing alloy, overaging also effects the apparent diffusivity of hydrogen. As AA 7050 is aged from underaged {yields} peak aged {yields} overaged, the activation energy for hydrogen diffusion increases and the apparent diffusivity for hydrogen decreases, In the low copper alloy, overaging has little effect on hydrogen diffusion. Comparison of the apparent activation energies for hydrogen diffusion and for K independent (stage II) crack growth rate in 90 % RH air between 25 and 90 C indicates that hydrogen transport kinetics are responsible for the decreased crack growth rate of overaged AA 7050 relative to the peak aged temper...|$|R

Tritium mobilization and carbon monoxide generation via CFC oxidation are both safety concerns. This paper discusses chemical reactivity experiments that were performed using the state-of-the-art 3 -dimensional NB 31 CFC produced by SNECMA and a laminar reaction gas of Ar– 21 vol% O 2.

Experiments were also performed at CFC temperatures of 700 and 1000 °C and a 1000 sccm Ar–O 2 flow rate.

The fission products release and transport to the containment has been analysed during mid-loop operation of a reference PWR 1000 MWe reactor using the severe accident integral code ASTEC V 2. 0. The analyses have been performed considering the loss of residual heat removal (RHR) system at various times after reactor shutdown for the reactor vessel configuration with the removed upper head (open reactor). In this configuration, the possible <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> can have an impact on safety such as accelerated oxidation and increased volatility of certain FPs (particularly iodine and ruthenium). Sensitivity calculations have been performed in terms of <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> simulation with a different intensity. Besides equilibrium chemistry model, most of the calculations have also used a limited kinetics model. The study has shown that without <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> the only predicted gaseous form of iodine is HI (7. 4 % of the total mass of iodine released from core) and no gaseous RuO 4 is created. Sensitivity calculations have illustrated that the gross fraction of gaseous iodine (I 2 + HOI + HI) has an increased trend with growth of <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> intensity and with the duration of sequence evolution. In most oxidative atmosphere the gross iodine gaseous fraction could increase by a factor form of two to several times as compared to the corresponding case without <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> (particularly due to I 2 persistence).

Key considerations {{that need to be}} determined is the amount of <b>air</b> that will <b>ingress</b> into the reactor vessel during a Depressurized Conduction Cooldown (DCC) accident as well as the time scale of each events stage. Reactor components constructed of graphite will, at sufficiently high temperatures produce exothermic reactions in the presence of air while undergoing oxidation reaction. There is a danger that it may cause loss of core structural integrity via oxidation or surface corrosion. Thus, without any mitigation systems, this accident might result in exothermic chemical reactions of graphite and oxygen depending on the accident scenario and the design. Having the knowledge on the amount of air inside the vessel one can investigate how to reduce air concentration via specifically designed mitigation system. The main idea of the applied mitigation method is to replace air in the core with buoyancy force by insertion of secondary gas: helium, nitrogen or argon into the reactor's lower plenum. This can help to mitigate graphite oxidation inside the reactor core by reducing air volume mass fraction in the reactor components and by lowering the core and lower plenum temperatures.

In normal operation conditions, ultra-high purity helium will have chemically controlled impurities (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen) that will create a slightly oxidizing gas environment. Little is known from direct experiments on the reactivity of third generation (nuclear grade) SiC/SiC composites in contact with low concentrations of water or oxygen in inert gas, at high temperature. However, there is ample information about the oxidation in dry and moist air of SiC/SiC composites at high temperatures. This information is reviewed first in the next chapters. The emphasis is places on the improvement in material oxidation, thermal, and mechanical properties during three stages of development of SiC fibers and at least two stages of development of the fiber/matrix interphase. The chemical stability of SiC/SiC composites in contact with oxygen or steam at temperatures that may develop in off-normal reactor conditions supports the conclusion that most advanced composites (also known as nuclear grade SiC/SiC composites) have the chemical resistance that would allow them maintain mechanical properties at temperatures up to 1200 1300 oC in the extreme conditions of an <b>air</b> or water <b>ingress</b> accident scenario.

One accident class examined is <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> with forced flow by emergency cooling: For this case, therange of mass flow/air content in cooling gas has been evaluated, in which safe core cool down is possible resp. long term core burning occurs; for highest availableemergency cooling flow, a safe cool down of the THTR- 300, which has no reactor building, is possible for up to 20 vol-% of air in the cooling gas, whereas low flowallows only for about 5 vol-%. If the amount of available air is restricted to the content of a reactor building, as is examined for the PNP- 500, relevant consequences have not to be expected; this remains also true for forced convection flow, if burning of CO, formed by graphite oxidation, within the building is considered. For the second accident class examined, <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> with natural convection flow by chimney draught as studied for the HTR-Modul and some other concepts, the time span until significant fission product release begins has been determined; in case, that the bottom reflector is hot at accident start (> 600 °C) and therefore consumes most of the ingressing oxygen, this time span is at least several hours and leak tightening counter measures may be possible. Basing also an some additional sensitivity studies, relevant uncertainties and needs for further work have been revealed in this report...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the design}} basis {{accidents}} for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), a high temperature gas-cooled reactor, is <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> subsequent to a pipe break. Following a postulated double-ended guillotine break in the hot duct, and the subsequent depressurization to nearly reactor cavity pressure levels, air present in the reactor cavity will enter the reactor vessel via density-gradient-driven-stratified flow. Because of the significantly higher molecular weight and lower initial temperature of the reactor cavity air-helium mixture, {{in contrast to the}} helium in the reactor vessel, the air-helium mixture in the cavity always has a larger density than the helium discharging from the reactor vessel through the break into the reactor cavity. In the later stages of the helium blowdown, the momentum of the helium flow decreases sufficiently for the heavier cavity air-helium mixture to intrude into the reactor vessel lower plenum through the lower portion of the break. Once it has entered, the heavier gas will pool {{at the bottom of the}} lower plenum. From there it will move upwards into the core via diffusion and density-gradient effects that stem from heating the air-helium mixture and from the pressure differences between the reactor cavity and the reactor vessel. This scenario (considering density-gradient-driven stratified flow) is considerably different from the heretofore commonly used scenario that attributes movement of air into the reactor vessel and from thence to the core region via diffusion. When density-gradient-driven stratified flow is considered as a contributing phenomena for <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> into the reactor vessel, the following factors contribute to a much earlier natural circulation-phase in the reactor vessel: (a) density-gradient-driven stratified flow is a much more rapid mechanism (at least one order of magnitude) for moving air into the reactor vessel lower plenum than diffusion, and consequently, (b) the diffusion dominated phase begins with a much larger flow area and a much shorter distance for air to move into the core than earlier scenarios that attribute all <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> from the reactor cavity into the core to diffusion only. Hence, consideration of the density-gradient-driven stratified flow phenomena will likely lead to more rapid <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> into the core and also the presence of more air for core graphite oxidation than the widely-used <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> attributed solely to diffusion. This paper discusses the density-gradient-driven stratified flow phenomena and the implications of considering this behavior on the progression of the <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> event. Preliminary calculations are used to underline the importance of considering the density-gradient driven stratified flow phenomena in subsequent validation experiments and software development for analyzing VHTR scenarios...|$|E

Toxicological assessment of air quality {{depends on the}} standards that define acceptable air quality, measurements of pollutant levels during the flight, and reports from the crew on their in-flight perceptions of air quality. Air samples from ISS flight 2 A showed that contaminants in the Zarya module were at higher concentrations than the Unity module. At the crew's first entry, the amount of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) in Zarya was 23 Mg/cubic meter, whereas {{in the amount of}} NMVOCs in Unity was 5. 3 mg/cubic meter. Approximately 26 hours later at egress from the modules, the NMVOCs were comparable indicating good mixing of the atmospheres. The 2 A crew reported no adverse health effects related to air pollution during their flight. <b>Ingress</b> <b>air</b> samples from 2 A. 1, which was flown more than 5 months after 2 A, again showed that the Zarya had accumulated more unscrubbed pollutants than Unity. The NMVOCs in Unity were 3. 5 mg/cubic meter, whereas the were 20 mg/cubic meter in Zarya. After almost 80 hours of ISS operations, the NMVOCs were 7. 5 and 12 mg/cubic meter in Unity and Zarya, respectively. This suggests that the atmospheres in the modules were not mixing very well. The 2 A. 1 crew felt that the air quality in Zarya deteriorated when they were working in a group at close quarters, when the panels had been removed, and after they had worked in an area for some time. The weight of evidence suggests that human metabolic products (carbon dioxide, water vapor, heat) were not being effectively removed from the crew's work area, and these caused their symptoms. Additional local measurements of pollutants are planned for the 2 A. 2 mission to the ISS...|$|R
40|$|Dalam high {{temperature}} reactor, koefisien reaktivitas temperatur yang didesain negatif menjamin reaksi fisi dalam teras tetap berada di bawah kendali dan panas peluruhan tidak akan pernah melelehkan bahan bakar yang menyebabkan terlepasnya zat radioaktif ke lingkungan. Namun masuknya <b>air</b> (water <b>ingress)</b> ke dalam teras reaktor akibat pecahnya tabung penukar panas generator uap, yang dikenal sebagai salah satu kecelakaan dasar desain, dapat mengintroduksi reaktivitas positif dengan potensi bahaya lainnya seperti korosi grafit dan kerusakan material struktur reflektor. Makalah ini akan menganalisis efek kecelakaan water ingress terhadap reaktivitas Doppler teras RGTT 200 K. Kapabilitas koefisien reaktivitas Doppler untuk mengkompensasi reaktivitas positif yang timbul selama kecelakaan water ingress akan diuji melalui serangkaian perhitungan dengan program MCNPX dan pustaka ENDF/B-VII untuk perubahan temperatur bahan bakar dari 800 K hingga 1800 K. Tiga opsi kernel bahan bakar UO 2, ThO 2 /UO 2 dan PuO 2 dengan tiga model kisi bahan bakar pebble di teras reaktor diterapkan untuk kondisi water <b>ingress</b> dengan densitas <b>air</b> dari 0 hingga 1. 000 kg/m 3. Hasil perhitungan memperlihatkan koefisien reaktivitas Doppler tetap negatif untuk seluruh opsi bahan bakar yang dipertimbangkan bahkan untuk posibilitas water ingress yang besar. Efek water ingress lebih kuat pada model kisi dengan fraksi packing lebih rendah karena lebih banyak volume yang tersedia untuk air yang memasuki teras reaktor. Efek water ingress juga lebih kuat di teras uranium dibandingkan teras thorium dan plutonium sebagai konsekuensi dari fenomena Doppler dimana absorpsi neutron di daerah resonansi 238 U lebih besar daripada 232 Th dan 240 Pu. Secara keseluruhan dapat disimpulkan bahwa, koefisien Doppler teras RGTT 200 K mampu mengkompensasi insersi reaktivitas yang diintroduksi oleh kecelakaan water ingress. Teras RGTT 200 K dengan bahan bakar UO 2, ThO 2 /UO 2 dan PuO 2 dapat mempertahankan fitur keselamatan melekat dengan cara pasif. Kata kunci: Water ingress, reaktivitas Doppler, RGTT 200 K   In {{high temperature}} reactor, the negative temperature reactivity coefficient guarantees fission {{reaction in the}} core remain under the control and decay heat will not melt the fuel which cause the release of radioactive substances into the environment. But the entry of water (water ingress) into the reactor core due to rupture of a steam generator tube heat exchanger, which is {{known as one of}} the design basis accidents, can introduce positive reactivity with other potential hazards such as graphite corrosion and damage of the reflector structure material. This paper will investigate the effect of water ingress accident on Doppler reactivity coefficient of RGTT 200 K core. The capability of the Doppler reactivity coefficient to compensate positive reactivity incurred during water ingress accident will be examined through a series of calculations with MCNPX code and ENDF/B-VII library for fuel temperature changes from 800 K to 1800 K. Three options of UO 2, ThO 2 /UO 2 and PuO 2 fuel kernels with three lattice models of fuel pebble in the reactor core was applied for condition of water ingress with water density from 0 to 1000 kg/m 3. The results of the calculations show that Doppler reactivity coefficient is negative for the entire fuel options being considered even for a large possibility of water ingress. The effects of water ingress becomes stronger in lattice model with lower packing fraction because more volume available for water entering the reactor core. The effect of water ingress is also stronger in the uranium core compared to thorium and plutonium cores as a consequence of the Doppler phenomenon where the neutron absorption in resonance region of 238 U is greater than 232 Th and 240 Pu. It can be concluded overall that Doppler coefficient of RGTT 200 K core has capability to compensate the reactivity insertion introduced by water ingress accident. RGTT 200 K core with UO 2, ThO 2 /UO 2 and PuO 2 fuels can maintain the inherently safety features in a passive way. Keywords: Water ingress, Doppler reactivity, RGTT 200...|$|R
40|$|Within the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), {{considerable}} {{efforts are}} devoted in Europe {{to research and}} development of the (Very) High Temperature Reactor system. This is one of the six reactor systems which GIF had selected and recommended for further development, in particular for industrial process heat applications. The Joint Research Centre (JRC), through its Institutes in Petten and in Karlsruhe, disposes of the complete HTR fuel qualification string required for the development, qualification and licensing of HTR fuels including fabrication and quality control, the possibility of irradiation testing, post-irradiation examinations and safety testing. At the JRC, a vigorous experimental program is being pursued the goal of which is to irradiate HTR fuels (in particular pebbles available from external sources) at high temperature to high burn-ups in the High Flux Reactor Petten and to measure and confirm low fission product release rates. Since 2002, two such irradiation tests have been completed and several others are under preparation. The irradiations are followed by measurement of fission product release during out-of-pile simulation of accident conditions, again to confirm low release rates. For this purpose, a cold finger device (KÜFA), is being used to perform heating experiments on several irradiated HTR fuel pebbles from the AVR in Jülich, Germany, as well as from dedicated irradiation campaigns in the HFR. In KÜFA, gaseous fission products (FPs) released during the high temperature post-irradiation tests are collected in a liquid-nitrogen-cooled charcoal trap, while volatiles are plated out on a cooled condensation plate. In both cases, a quantitative measurement of the release is obtained by gamma spectroscopy. At present, interest in HTR fuels concentrates on UO 2, which will undoubtedly be the fuel deployed in the next HTR. However, plutonium oxide fuel is considered in a further step, for the incineration of excess stocks of military Pu, and even potentially for transmutation of minor actinides (¿deep burn¿). It is the reason why the development of a transuranium elements - bearing fuel fabrication and characterisation chain is being pursued at ITU. Future work may cover experimental production of ¿deep burn¿ fuel as well as thorium fuel. In this paper, we present an overview (including the most recent status of results) of: - two HFR irradiation tests including fission gas release measurements; - experimental results from KÜFA tests as well as the status of the on-going development of new experimental facilities (for corrosion tests under simulated accident conditions involving <b>air</b> or water <b>ingress,</b> and for the spectroscopic analysis of particle integrity); - the status of achievements in the fabrication of Pu-bearing kernels and coated particles, together with their fuel characterisation; - results from fuel fragmentation tests with dummy particles. It will be also highlighted how the research pursued by the JRC is fully integrated in the European goals and priorities set up by SNE-TP and its Strategic Research Area and Deployment Strategy, and also within the broader international context.

40|$|The {{double-ended}} guillotine break (DEGB) of {{the horizontal}} coaxial gas duct accident {{is a serious}} <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> accident of the high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed module (HTR-PM).

Phenomena identification and ranking studies (PIRT) to date have identified the <b>air</b> <b>ingress</b> event, following {{on the heels of}} a VHTR depressurization, as very important (Schultz et al., 2006). Consequently, the development of advanced air ingress-related models and verification and validation (V&V) are very high priority for the NGNP program. Following a loss of coolant and system depressurization, air will enter the core through the break. <b>Air</b> <b>ingress</b> leads to oxidation of the in-core graphite structure and fuel. The oxidation will accelerate heat-up of the bottom reflector and the reactor core and will cause the release of fission products eventually. The potential collapse of the bottom reflector because of burn-off and the release of CO lead to serious safety problems. For estimation of the proper safety margin we need experimental data and tools, including accurate multi-dimensional thermal-hydraulic and reactor physics models, a burn-off model, and a fracture model. We also need to develop effective strategies to mitigate the effects of oxidation. The results from this research will provide crucial inputs to the INL NGNP/VHTR Methods R&D project.

40|$|A {{large number}} of new fast {{reactors}} may be needed earlier than foreseen in the Generation IV plans. According to the median forecast of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios commissioned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control nuclear power will increase {{by a factor of}} four by 2050. The drivers for this expected boost are the increasing energy demand in developing countries, energy security, but also climate concerns. However, staying with a once-through cycle will lead to both a substantially increased amount of high-level nuclear waste and an upward pressure on the price of uranium and even concerns about its availability in the coming decades. Therefore, it appears wise to accelerate the development of fast reactors and efficient re-processing technologies. In this paper, two fast reactor systems are discussed—the sodium-cooled fast reactor, which has already been built and can be further improved, and the lead-cooled fast reactor that could be developed relatively soon. An accelerated development of the latter is possible due to the sizeable experience on lead/bismuth eutectic coolant in Russian Alpha-class submarine reactors and the research efforts on accelerator-driven systems in the EU and other countries. First, comparative calculations on critical masses, fissile enrichments and burn-up swings of mid-sized SFRs and LFRs (600 MWe) are presented. Monte Carlo transport and burn-up codes were used in the analyses. Moreover, Doppler and coolant temperature and axial fuel expansion reactivity coefficients were also evaluated with MCNP and subsequently used in the European Accident Code- 2 to calculate reactivity transients and unprotected Loss-of-Flow (ULOF) and Loss-of-Heat Sink (ULOHS) accidents. Further, ULOFs as well as decay heat removal (protected Total Loss-of-Power, TLOP) were calculated with the STAR-CD CFD code for both systems. We show that LFRs and SFRs can be used both as burners and as self-breeders, homogeneously incinerating minor actinides. The tight pin lattice SFRs (P/D = 1. 2) appears to have a better neutron economy than wide channel LFRs (P/D = 1. 6), resulting in larger BOL actinide inventories and lower burn-up swings for LFRs. The reactivity burn-up swing of an LFR self-breeder employing BeO moderator pins could be limited to 1. 3 $ in 1 year. For a 600 MWe LFR burner, LWR-to-burner support ratio was about two for (U, TRU) O 2 -fuelled system, while it increased to approximately 2. 8 when (Th, TRU) O 2 fuel was employed. The corresponding figures for an SFR were somewhat lower. The calculations revealed that LFRs have an advantage over SFRs in coping with the investigated severe accident initiators (ULOF, ULOHS, TLOP). The reason is better natural circulation behavior of LFR systems and the much higher boiling temperature of lead. A ULOF accident in an LFR only leads to a 220 K coolant outlet temperature increase whereas for an SFR the coolant may boil. Regarding the economics, the LFR seems to have an advantage since it does not require an intermediate coolant circuit. However, it was also proposed to avoid an intermediate coolant circuit in an SFR by using a supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle. But in an LFR, the reduced concern about <b>air</b> and water <b>ingress</b> may decrease its cost further. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|R
40|$|The boiler {{flue gas}} furnace exit {{temperature}} (FET) {{is a key}} operating parameter of coal fired steam boilers. From the design perspective, the FET is vital for materials selection and sizing of heat transfer surfaces. From an operating perspective, {{it is a major}} indicator of the rate of combustion and heat transfer that is occurring within the furnace. Downstream of the furnace, the FET has a significant impact on both the performance and reliability of the boiler heat exchangers, which ultimately impacts on both boiler efficiency and availability. Monitoring of the FET can advise operating and engineering corrective actions which will ultimately result in better efficiency, reliability and availability together with the associated economic benefits. Therefore, methods of determining FET are investigated. Two methods are focused on for this study, one indirect and one direct. The indirect method studied is a mass and energy balance method which begins with a global boiler mass and energy balance to calculate the major boiler flow rates of coal, air and flue gas which are difficult to measure online. These parameters are then used as inputs into a furnace or backpass mass and energy balance to calculate the furnace exit temperature. The method is applied to a case study, and is evaluated in terms of the measurement uncertainties which are propagated on the intermediate parameters calculated, {{as well as on the}} final calculated FET. The main conclusions are that this indirect method contains various uncertainties, due to parameters which have to be assumed such as (i) the distribution of <b>ingress</b> <b>air</b> (also called tramp air) in the different sections of the boiler and (ii) the estimation of the share of water evaporation heat transfer occurring in the water walls of the furnace part of the boiler. The method is however still useful and can be easily applied to any boiler layout and can be used as a reference tool to verify other measurements. The direct method studied is acoustic pyrometry. The work specifically focuses on the sources of error in determining the temperature from the measurement of the time of flight of sound, the impact of particle concentration on the speed of sound through a gas-particle mixture, and the temperature profile reconstruction from acoustic time of flight measurements. A limited set of physical testing was also carried out using one acoustic generator and receiver to take measurements on a real coal power plant. As part of this physical testing, the detection of time of flight from acoustic signals was explored. Already installed radiation pyrometers were also used as a reference for interpreting the acoustic measurements. The indications are that the acoustic pyrometer provides a more representative temperature measurement than the radiation pyrometers. The uncertainty of the acoustic measurement for the same case study as the indirect method was determined and compared with the calculated result. While many aspects still need to be researched further, this initial study and experimental testing produced very promising results for future application of acoustic pyrometry for better monitoring of the coal combustion processes in power plant boilers...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of a numerical model to investigate the heat and mass transport in an EAF freeboard. Some of the challenges presently faced by European steelmakers are increasing costs for raw materials and energy, as well as strict environmental policies. These can be addressed by improving the energy efficiency of the EAF steelmaking process by reducing off-gas and cooling losses. This can be achieved by increasing the degree of combustion of CO and H 2 in the furnace freeboard. A better understanding of the mechanisms that cause unwanted emissions during the steelmaking process can also help to develop new methods to reduce pollutants. The long term motivation behind the topic of this thesis is therefore to create a numerical EAF model with which the influence of process innovations on the fluid flow field, energy transport and chemical reactions within the freeboard of an electric arc furnace can be analysed. At this stage, the main objective is to qualitatively investigate the influence of the arc region on the amount of post-combustion within the freeboard. The effect of a change in the foamy slag height on the resulting amount of post-combustion is also investigated. The numerical EAF model represents the power-on/flat-bath stage of the steelmaking process in an exemplary AC electric arc furnace for quasi-steady state heat loss conditions. The AC EAF has a capacity of 100 tons of steel, a transformer rating of 90 MVA and and an inner vessel diameter of 6. 1 m. A simplified time-averaged arc model based on the channel arc model was developed in order to include the influence of the arc region on the conditions within the freeboard. The plasma arcs {{are not part of the}} solution domain, but are represented as segmented cylindrical surfaces extending from each electrode tip to the bath surface. In contrast to previous models, this simplified arc model includes not only the energy input due to the intense thermal radiation, but also the kinetic energy input due to the arc in- and outflow as well as the energy input due to the heating of the entrained furnace atmosphere in the arcs. The graphite electrodes are part of the solution domain, whereby the Joule heating due to the AC current flowing through the electrodes is taken into account. For the energy balance of the solution domain the energy input from the arc region plus the Joule heating in the electrodes represents the electric power input from the secondary circuit. This energy contribution is much smaller than the true electric power input, as it equates the amount needed, in addition to the other energy inflows, to cover the stationary power losses. The discrete ordinates thermal radiation model available in the CFD code ANSYS FLUENT (Version 14. 5) was chosen to model the thermal radiation exchange, whereby the thermal radiation absorption coefficient of the furnace atmosphere is calculated with the weighted-sum-of-grey-gases-model. Species transport with volumetric reactions and the finite-rate/eddy dissipation turbulence chemistry interaction is used to calculate the mass transfer and chemical reactions within the freeboard. The furnace atmosphere is defined to be a mixture of CO, CO 2, H 2 O, N 2 and O 2. The post combustion of CO to CO 2 is simulated according to the gas-shift reaction available for the oxidation of CO in FLUENT. The realizable k-ε model with standard wall functions for the near wall treatment was selected to simulate the turbulent viscous flow. The geometry of the EAF model extends from the uppermost layer of the metal bath to the beginning of the off-gas extraction downstream of the post-combustion gap. The foamy slag is modelled as a solid layer and the top layer of the bath, also considered as a solid, is included. These two layers allow the simulation of downward absorption and redistribution of energy from the arc region, which is reflected by the resulting temperature distribution at the foamy slag layer surface. Burners, lances or injectors are not included at present. The decarburization of the molten metal bath is taken into account by the definition of a homogenous source of CO at the surface of the foamy slag layer. An average value for the graphite electrode consumption is modelled by a corresponding CO source and O 2 sink at the electrode surfaces. <b>Ingress</b> <b>air</b> is defined to enter the freeboard through the slag door, roof gap and electrode gaps and air flows in at the post-combustion gap. It is assumed that a small amount of steam enters the vessel through the electrode gaps due to electrode cooling. The upper vessel, roof, exhaust elbow and exhaust extraction are cooled by water cooled panels. The walls of the lower vessel, balcony and roof delta zone are defined to consist of refractory material and are cooled by natural convection and thermal radiation to the ambient on the outside of the vessel. The results obtained with the numerical EAF model are used to evaluate the influence of the inclusion of the energy input due to the heating and increase in momentum of the furnace atmosphere drawn into and flowing out of the arc region on the conditions within the freeboard. Furthermore, the impact of the arc region flow on the post-combustion of CO to CO 2 in the freeboard for a free-burning arc length of 230 mm is compared to that for a free-burning arc length of only 50 mm. The modelling of the arc region has a large influence on the flow field, temperature distribution and post-combustion. The results show that due to the inclusion of the arc in- and outflow a total increase in the simulated energy input within the vessel of 4. 42 MW results. This is due to the correspondingly higher temperatures and circulation leading to an increase in the post-combustion of CO to CO 2 within the freeboard. The inclusion of the arc in- and outflow should therefore not be neglected in future EAF models. An increased slag height not only protects the cooling panels from the thermal radiation of the arcs. It also leads to a reduction in the interaction between the flow in the arc region and in the freeboard. This in turn reduces the amount of mixing of CO from the slag layer with the <b>ingress</b> <b>air</b> and therefore also the amount of post-combustion in the freeboard. As a result a decrease in the free-burning arc length from 230 mm to 50 mm leads to a reduction in the total energy input within the solution domain of 3. 22 MW. The numerical EAF simulation model developed during this thesis delivers valuable information which helps one to understand the heat and mass transfer processes taking place within the EAF freeboard. Furthermore, several important insights were gained concerning necessary future developments of the model...|$|R
