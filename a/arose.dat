5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue <b>arose</b> with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error <b>arose</b> because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which <b>arose</b> in 2001.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Arisen</b> {{arrives at}} the Tainted Mountain to fight Grigori, and is {{presented}} with a choice, to sacrifice the kidnapped love interest, or to face the dragon. The <b>Arisen</b> fights the dragon, and stabs it in the heart. The <b>Arisen</b> recovers their heart, {{and goes back to}} Cassardis with his/her beloved. After a few days of peace, the <b>Arisen</b> treks back to Gran Soren. Along the way, several details are revealed. The sky has been blotted out and replaced with greenish gray clouds that rain ash, and all normal monsters have been replaced with much stronger versions. After the <b>Arisen</b> reaches Gran Soren, it is revealed that half of it has collapsed, leaving a gaping hole. The <b>Arisen</b> goes to meet the duke, and is surprised to see that the duke has turned into a frail old man. It is revealed that the duke made a deal with Grigori to make himself immortal, but without Grigori, the deal is now forfeited. The duke attacks, blaming the <b>Arisen</b> for his condition, but he is swiftly beaten. Guards arrive, and the duke accuses the <b>Arisen</b> of placing a curse on him and of making a deal with Grigori. The <b>Arisen</b> is then hunted by the guards. The <b>Arisen</b> is chased to the hole in the town, where creatures begin to fly out of the hole, with one bumping the <b>Arisen</b> into the hole.|$|R

The Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae) appears to have evolved in western North America, with subsequent colonisation of East Asia by Streptopus and the ancestral Tricyrtis.|$|E
