5|$|Around Vikram 1664 (1607 CE), Tulsidas was <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> {{acute pain}} {{all over his}} body, {{especially}} in his arms. He then composed the Hanuman Bahuk, where he describes his bodily pain and suffering in several stanzas. He was relieved of his pain after this composition. Later he was also <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> Bartod boils (Hindi: बरतोड़, furuncles caused by {{pulling out of the}} hair), which may have been the cause of his death.|$|E

5|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} can be <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The {{viral infection}} causes feather loss and beak malformation {{and reduces the}} bird's overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose a high risk to smaller stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|Martha {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts in Art History from Stanford University. Prior {{to becoming a}} figure in politics, she served {{as a member of}} the Santa Barbara Museum Board of Trustees. She was once the most trusted adviser for the indecisive President Logan. She has also been portrayed as mentally ill, <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> depression and anxiety. Martha is a close personal friend of David Palmer.|$|E
5|$|PVSJ 407, a Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, had a pit in a skull bone {{attributed}} by Paul Sereno and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits {{occurred on}} the splenial. The areas around these pits are swollen and porous, suggesting the wounds were <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, {{it is likely that}} they were obtained in a fight with another Herrerasaurus.|$|E
50|$|An {{introductory}} rubric states: The Devil {{and other}} demons {{can not only}} <b>afflict</b> persons (<b>by</b> temptation and vexation), but also places and objects, and can cause various forms of opposition and persecution of the Church. If the diocesan Bishop, in the particular circumstances, judges it opportune to announce meetings for the faithful to pray, under the guidance {{and direction of the}} priest, selected prayers and directives can be taken from the following pages.|$|R
60|$|As {{it is as}} {{impossible}} for the humble historian of the March family {{to write a story}} without theatricals in it as for our dear Miss Yonge to get on with less than twelve or fourteen children in her interesting tales, we will accept the fact, and at once cheer ourselves after the last <b>afflicting</b> events, <b>by</b> proceeding to the Christmas plays at Plumfield; for they influence the fate of several of our characters, and cannot well be skipped.|$|R
50|$|From 1928 to 1930, a long drought <b>afflicted</b> China. <b>By</b> some accounts, {{abnormal}} weather over central China {{began in}} the winter of late 1930. Heavy snowstorms in the winter were followed by a spring thaw and heavy rains that raised river levels significantly. The rain grew heavier in July and August 1931. 1931 was also characterized by extreme cyclone activity - in July of that year alone, nine cyclones hit the region, whereas on average only two occur per year.|$|R
5|$|A {{promotion}} came in c. 46, when Alexander {{was appointed}} procurator of Judea by Claudius. The province {{had returned to}} direct Roman rule only {{after the death of}} Agrippa in 44, and the tenure of Alexander's predecessor Cuspius Fadus had been marked by unrest, so Alexander's Jewish background may have marked him as a more acceptable governor. Less trouble is attested during his office, although he did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> a severe famine. In 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} Christie feared and trembled; then pity conquered fear. She forgot herself, and only remembered this poor girl, so hopeless, helpless, and <b>afflicted.</b> Led <b>by</b> a sudden impulse, she put both arms about her, {{and held her}} close with a strong but silent {{tenderness}} better than any bonds. At first, Helen seemed unconscious of it, as she stood rigid and motionless, with her wild eyes dumbly imploring help of earth and heaven. Suddenly both strength and excitement seemed to leave her, {{and she would have}} fallen but for the living, loving prop that sustained her.|$|R
5|$|Dunstan was <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> {{illness in}} his final years. He was {{diagnosed}} with throat cancer in 1993 before contracting an inoperable lung cancer, which led to his death on 6 February 1999. A public memorial service was held on 9 February at the Adelaide Festival Centre {{as a tribute to}} Dunstan's love of the arts. In attendance were former Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, Premier John Olsen, and State Opposition Leader Mike Rann. Thousands more gathered outside the centre in Elder Park {{along the banks of the}} River Torrens. State flags were flown at half-mast and the memorial service was televised live.|$|E
5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> the first manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result}} of his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
50|$|The main {{mechanism}} of action for anatoxin-a(S) is by irreversibly inhibiting the active site of acetylcholinesterase leading to excess acetylcholine in the parasympathetic and peripheral nervous systems; inducing poisoning via nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor stimulation. Treatment of <b>afflicted</b> case <b>by</b> atropine has attested to suppress the muscarinic mediated toxicity; which prevents the namesake salivation that similarly reacts to prevent the toxin's other poisoning symptoms which include lacrimation, urinary incontinence and defecation. Atropine will not, however, counter another {{mechanism of}} the compounds toxicity as it also mediates a nicotinic adverse toxicity affecting muscle tremors, fasciculation, convulsions and respiratory failure.|$|R

500|$|An {{important}} part of the Khandoba-cult is navas, a vow to perform service to the god in return for a boon of good harvest, male child, financial success etc. On fulfilment of the navas, Khandoba was offered children or some devotees would <b>afflict</b> pain <b>by</b> hook-swinging or fire-walking. This type of worship using navas is called Sakama Bhakti - worship done with an expectation of return and is considered [...] "to be of a lower esteem". But the most faithful bhaktas (devotees) are considered to be greedy only for the company of their Lord, Khandoba is also called bhukela - hungry for such true bhaktas in Martanda Vijaya.|$|R
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was {{presiding}} over the Senate—a task given to junior members—when an aide rushed in {{to tell him that}} his brother, President John F. Kennedy, had been shot. His brother Robert soon told him that the President was dead. Ted and his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver immediately flew to the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to give the news to their invalid father, who had been <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> a stroke suffered two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Starr {{was twice}} <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> {{life-threatening}} illnesses during childhood, {{and he fell}} behind in school {{as a result of}} prolonged hospitalisations. In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze, developing a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.|$|E
5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a {{lower than normal}} blood clotting factor {{that can lead to}} heavy bleeding. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnder the endosymbiont hypothesis, over {{a billion}} years ago a {{heterotrophic}} eukaryote entered into a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium (the cyanobiont). This partnership culminated in the plastid that has spread to forms as diverse as plants and diatoms. However, why primary plastid acquisition has not been repeated multiple times remains unclear. Here, we report a possible {{answer to this question}} by showing that primary plastid endosymbiosis was likely to have been primed by the secretion in the host cytosol of effector proteins from intracellular Chlamydiales pathogens. We provide evidence suggesting that the cyanobiont might have rescued its <b>afflicted</b> host <b>by</b> feeding photosynthetic carbon into a chlamydia-controlled assimilation pathway...|$|R

In addition, {{the church has}} remnants of 15th and 16th-century frescoes. It also houses an Annunciation (17th century) by Livio Modigliani. The church houses large wooden altarpiece with the 17th-century sculptures of the Vergine Addolorata (Virgin in Grief) with the dead Christ, a theme endeared to the Servites.|$|R
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Marie urged Ferdinand to ally himself with the Triple Entente and declare war on Germany, which he eventually did in 1916. During {{the early stages of}} fighting, Bucharest was occupied by the Central Powers and Marie, Ferdinand and their five children took refuge in Moldavia. There, she and her three daughters acted as nurses in military hospitals, caring for soldiers who were wounded or <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> cholera. On 1 December 1918, the province of Transylvania, following Bessarabia and Bukovina, united with the Old Kingdom. Marie, now queen of Greater Romania, attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, where she campaigned for international recognition of the enlarged Romania. In 1922, she and Ferdinand were crowned in a specially-built cathedral in the ancient city of Alba Iulia, in an elaborate ceremony which mirrored their status as queen and king of a united state.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> {{the image of}} the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{animals in}} zoos were {{typically}} held in poor conditions in small, cramped cages, and the Zoological Gardens presented no exception. As a result, its animals were frequently <b>afflicted</b> <b>by</b> disease, and also {{suffered from the}} harsh easterly winds of the Edinburgh climate. Despite these setbacks, the menagerie attempted to maintain its popularity by putting on concerts, acrobatics shows and displays of fireworks and Montgolfier balloons. Children were carried around the park {{on the back of}} the zoo's elephant, giving it a rare opportunity for exercise. Even with these entertainments, the Zoological Gardens were eventually forced to admit defeat. The park was closed and the site sold to a property developer in 1857. Nothing now remains of the house or its gardens.|$|E
