40|$|In {{conventional}} cellular {{wireless communication}} system, interference modelling {{has focused on}} the six primary co-channel interfering cells (first tier co-channel cells). In the current <b>accepted</b> <b>interference</b> model, co-channel interfering cells beyond the first tier (subsequent tier co-channel cells) are neglected. This currently <b>accepted</b> <b>interference</b> models is suitable for cellular wireless communication systems operating at carrier frequencies, f c = 0. 9 and 1. 8 GHz, cell size radii R > 1 km and basic path loss exponent α ≥ 2. The future and emerging wireless communication systems are expected to be operating at frequencies f c > 2 GHz (3. 35 - 15. 75 GHz), cell size radii R≤ 1 km and basic path loss exponent α ≤ 2. This, makes the current acceptable co-channel interference model unsuitable for information capacity analysis of the future cellular systems. Therefore, a co-channel interference model suitable for future and emerging wireless communication system becomes necessary. In this thesis a new and modified interference model is proposed. The proposed interference model includes the first and subsequent tier co-channel interfering cells. The proposed interference model will be suitable for cellular wireless communication systems operating at carrier frequencies f c > 2 GHz, cell size radii R≤ 1 km and basic path loss exponent α ≤ 2. A mathematical analysis, supported by computer simulation is used, to study the uplink information capacity performance for the conventional and proposed interference model. The analysis and simulation results of the proposed interference model show that at carrier frequencies f c > 2 GHz, co-channel interfering cells beyond the first tier become active as cell size radius R, reduces. As an example for a carrier frequency f c = 15. 75 GHz, cell size radius R = 100 m at a normalized reuse distance Ru = 4, there was a 15. 32...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} the spectral efficiency, achievable by a low-complexity symbol-by-symbol receiver, when linear modulations {{based on the}} superposition of uniformly time- and frequency-shifted replicas of a base pulse are employed.

We also op-timize the spacing between adjacent signals to maximize the achievable spectral efficiency. Moreover, we propose a more involved transmission scheme, composed by the superposition of two independent signals and a receiver based on successive interference cancellation, showing that it allows a further increase of the spectral efficiency. Finally, we show that a more involved equalization algorithm, based on soft interference cancellation, allows to achieve an excellent bit-error-rate performance, even when error-correcting codes designed for the Gaussian-noise-limited channel are employed, and thus {{does not require a}} complete redesign of the coding scheme.

This article, {{based on the results of}} two recent research projects (Hauber et al. 1993 a, b), focuses on three questions central to the effectiveness and acceptability of three kinds of agents: city wardens, police patrollers, and public transport inspectors. First, objective security: what effects did supervision by different types of agents have on those forms of crime with which the agents were confronted, as observed by the researchers? Secondly, the performance of the agents and the reactions of the members of the public with whom they were in contact will be discussed. Finally, subjective security will be discussed: did the agents have a positive influence on the public's perception of their safety? The degree to which informal social control is accepted differs from culture to culture. One could place the different cultures on a continuum with on one pole, state encouraged, widespread informal social control networks (as in former communistic countries) and on the opposite pole almost a complete lack of informal social control.

5000|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the WMTS, medical telemetry devices generally could be operated on an unlicensed basis on vacant television channels 7-13 (174-216 MHz) and 14-46 (470-668 MHz) or on a licensed but secondary basis to private land mobile radio operations in the 450-470 MHz frequency band. This meant that wireless medical telemetry operations had to <b>accept</b> <b>interference</b> from the primary users of these frequency bands, i.e., the television broadcasters and private land mobile radio licensees. Further, if a wireless medical telemetry operation caused interference to television or private land mobile radio transmissions, the user of the wireless medical telemetry equipment would be responsible for rectifying the problem, even if that meant shutting down the medical telemetry operation.The FCC was concerned that certain regulatory developments, including the advent of digital television (DTV) service, would result in more intensive use of these frequencies by the primary services, subjecting wireless medical telemetry operations to greater interference than before and perhaps precluding such operations entirely in many instances. To ensure that wireless medical telemetry devices can operate free of harmful interference, the FCC decided to establish the WMTS. In a Report and Order released on June 12, 2000, the FCC allocated a total of 14 megahertz of spectrum to WMTS on a primary basis.
