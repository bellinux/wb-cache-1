Most of {{the existing}} work is focused on supervised methods for extracting answers using similarity features and forum-specific features. Although this works well for the domain or forum data {{that it has been}} trained on, it is difficult to use the same models for a domain where the vocabulary is different and some forum specific features may not be available. In this poster, we report initial results of a domain <b>adaptive</b> <b>answer</b> extractor that performs the extraction in two steps: a) an answer recognizer identifies the sentences in a post which are likely to be answers, and b) a domain relevance module determines the domain significance of the identified answer.

Modifications in the internal or external relevant conditions require adjustments and reactions that need agreements or, at least, alignments of changing behaviors and actions by many and diverse agents. Let us take the example of firms that jointly invest for innovating. Innovation is often the <b>adaptive</b> <b>answer</b> of the supplier to the needs expressed by the client. The client usually shares with the supplier the know-how and skills required for searching the innovative solution. The firms, thus, need to cooperate and specialize together, or, saying it with Teece, they co-specialize (Teece 1992). Co-specializing creates a link between the two (or more) firms. This link is not only associated to an increase {{of the value of the}} final product but also exposes the partners to losses in case one of the two breaks the cooperation. The process requires complex reciprocal repeated exchanges co-learning and other cooperative attitudes and activities.|$|R
40|$|Comparison of {{dispersal}} {{rates of}} the bog fritillary butterfly between continuous and fragmented landscapes indicates that between patch dispersal is significantly lower in the fragmented landscape, while population densities are of the same order of magnitude. Analyses {{of the dynamics of}} the suitable habitat for the butterfly in the fragmented landscape reveal a severe, non linear increase in spatial isolation of patches over a time period of 30 years (i. e. 30 butterfly generations), but simulations of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics using a structured population model show that the lower dispersal rates in the fragmented landscape are far above the critical threshold leading to metapopulation extinction. These results indicate that changes in individual behaviour leading to the decrease of dispersal rates in the fragmented landscape were rapidly selected for when patch spatial isolation increased. The evidence of such an <b>adaptive</b> <b>answer</b> to habitat fragmentation suggests that dispersal mortality is a key factor for metapopulation persistence in fragmented landscapes. We emphasise that landscape spatial configuration and patch isolation have {{to be taken into account}} in the debate about large-scale conservation strategies. (C) 2003 Academie des sciences.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi, {{the agent}} of Chagas disease, is {{subdivided}} into 6 discrete typing units (DTUs); their identification {{is important to understand}} clinical pleomorphism and track sylvatic DTUs that might (re-) invade domestic foci of the disease and jeopardize the running control programs. METHODS: The genetic polymorphism of 12 loci was analyzed by multilocus polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment [...] length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis (MLP analysis) in a sample representative of the diversity within T. cruzi. We paid particular attention to genes involved in host-parasite relationships, because these may be prone to polymorphism as an <b>adaptive</b> <b>answer</b> to the immune selective pressure. RESULTS: The results of MLP analysis were shown to agree with the current multilocus enzyme electrophoresis- and random amplified polymorphic DNA-based classification of T. cruzi in 6 DTUs, thereby providing a taxonomic validation of our method. Our data supported hypotheses of genetic recombination within T. cruzi. We demonstrated direct applicability of PCR-RFLP analysis to blood of mammal hosts and intestine content of vector insects. Domestic DTUs were encountered in wild animals, and, reciprocally, sylvatic DTUs were encountered in humans, raising questions about changes of transmission patterns. CONCLUSIONS: MLP analysis represents a new alternative to existing molecular methods for T. cruzi typing. It might offer an invaluable support to clinical and epidemiological studies and to control programs...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} research was to investigate in vivo the long-term morphofunctional changes of ITAs after their use as coronary artery bypass conduits, by comparing the morphological features and vasoreactivity of the grafted left ITA (LITA) with the native, nonharvested right ITA (RITA) in the same patient. METHODS AND RESULTS: At least 10 years after surgery, in 10 patients, LITA graft and nonharvested RITA were assessed by quantitative angiography and frequency-domain optical tomography. Endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilation was tested by selective infusion of acetylcholine and isosorbide dinitrate. Quantitative angiography showed that baseline mean diameter of LITA graft was significantly smaller than that of RITA (2. 59 mm [2. 29 - 3. 04] versus 3. 05 mm [2. 75 - 3. 32]; P= 0. 01). LITA showed a significant intimal thickening (P= 0. 05) and a nonsignificant medial thinning (P= 0. 22) compared with RITA, leading to an increased intima-media ratio (intima-media ratio, 0. 72 [0. 53 - 0. 91] versus 0. 23 [0. 12 - 0. 38]; P= 0. 02). The intima-media ratio correlated inversely with the vasodilatatory response in RITA (r=- 0. 68, P= 0. 03 for acetylcholine and r=- 0. 62, P= 0. 05 for isosorbide dinitrate) but not in LITA (r=- 0. 18, P= 0. 63 for acetylcholine and r=- 0. 11, P= 0. 75 for isosorbide dinitrate). CONCLUSIONS: Ten years after implantation to the coronary circulation, LITA grafts show intimal thickening, increased intima/media ratio, and maintained endothelium-derived vasodilation.

Each music is an <b>adaptive</b> <b>answer</b> {{to the demands}} of a particular environment, activity, or group. In which ways the acculturation to a particular kind of music can affect the fruition and ‘understanding’ of other kinds of music (see Walker, 1996), is a focal topic in music cognition. The present paper investigates how active and passive musical acculturation can influence reproduction and recall of music from other cultures. 24 Ss, half professional musicians, half naïve listeners, were invited individually to learn, reproduce and recall three excerpts of songs from three different cultures, unknown to them (Gaelic, Romanian, and Chinese). The songs were {{selected on the basis of}} their rhythmic and melodic features, which had different degrees of similarity to Western music. Ss were invited to freely learn the songs in order to reproduce them singing, with the highest fidelity to the model. After a retention interval of approximately 60 mins, they were invited to sing them again. The results showed a clear difference between the learning style of the musicians and that of the naïves. The professional musicians reproduced and recalled more accurately the melody of the excerpts closer to familiar music. The Chinese excerpt, which was melodically and structurally very distant from Western music, was poorly reproduced by all the Ss, independently from their level of expertise. These results confirm the finding about meter structures obtained in a previous analysis (Brunetti & Olivetti Belardinelli, 2003). It is possible to conclude that acculturation to the music of a particular culture seems to impair the reproduction and recall of music from other cultures. Theoretical implications are discussed, in order to integrate the results within the concept of musical expertise and the possibility of ‘understanding’ music from other cultures...|$|R

While a complete answer to the above question seems impossible given the development of present computational complexity theory. We study the analogous question in query complexity, which sheds light on the limitation of relativized methods (the relativization barrier) to the above question. Informally, we show that, for a partial function f, if there is no efficient (In the world of query complexity, being efficient means using O(polylog(n)) time.) small bounded-error algorithm for f classically or quantumly, then there is no efficient postselection bounded-error algorithm to <b>answer</b> <b>adaptive</b> queries to f classically or quantumly.

Brazilian Journal of Biomotricity, v. 5, n. 2, p. 117 - 131, 2011. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) are derived from exogenous sources or produced endogenously, as a normal consequence of cellular functions. The unbalance caused by the excess {{in the production of}} these species associated with the fall in the cellular antioxidant capacity provokes what we call {{oxidative stress}}; a process that generates, over all, alterations in the cellular membranes and in the genes structures, at extreme circumstances. The objective of this work consisted in investigating the oxidative stress potential in sedentary obese subjects, since the obesity became a public health problem, over all in industrialized countries. Thirty men volunteers (age 26, 6 ± 3, 5) participated of the study and have divided in three groups, in accordance with corporal composition and active style of life: sedentary group with normal body mass index (BMI) (IMC-NS), n = 10; sedentary group with elevated BMI (IMC-ES), n = 10; and physical activity practitioner group with normal BMI (IMC-NPAF), n = 10. The analyses have divided in antropometrics – BMI, arterial pressure, waist-hip relation and fat percentage; biochemistry – hemoglobin dosage; antioxidant markers – catalase (CAT) and total sulphydril groups (TSG); oxidant markers – thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs); and cellular alteration markers – creatine kinase (CK). The results had shown that the subjects of IMC-ES group, when compared to the other groups, have lower levels of CAT (0, 19 ± 0, 10 k/gHb/min), TSG (298, 0 ± 67, 0 µM), TBARS (1, 60 ± 0, 40 nmol/mL) and CK (45, 0 ± 25, 0 U/L), probably for the sedentary condition where if they find. The subjects of IMC-NS group, although also sedentary condition, had presented significantly bigger values of CAT (0, 30 ± 0, 04 k/gHb/min, p< 0, 05), TSG (450, 0 ± 111, 0 µM, p< 0, 01), TBARS (2, 30 ± 1, 0 nmol/mL, p< 0, 05) and CK (100 ± 25, p< 0. 05), in relation to obese, suggesting that the physical condition can determine the cellular regulatory adjustments. In relation to IMC-NPAF group, the significant increases of CAT (0, 40 ± 0, 10 k/gHb/min, p< 0, 01), TSG (503, 0 ± 121, 0 µM, p< 0, 01), TBARS (2, 80 ± 1, 40 nmol/mL, p< 0, 05) and CK (150, 0 ± 45, 0 U/L, p< 0, 05), when compared to IMC-ES group, reflects the influence of the physical activity in the <b>adaptive</b> <b>answers.</b> In conclusion, the oxidative stress levels can be more dangerous to the sedentary obese subjects in virtue of the extreme reduction of the studied markers.

40|$|The hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction (HPV) {{is defined}} as the <b>adaptive</b> <b>answer</b> to alveolar hypoxia which leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction. The HPV is a physiological process which directs the bloodflow, in case of regional lung disease e. g. atelectasis, in better ventilated area to improve the oxygenation. In case of global hypoxia e. g. in altitude above 2500 m the HPV leads to a constriction of pulmonary arteries throughout the whole lung and results in a raise of pulmonary vascular resistence which impairs the oxygenation. Acute consequense of excessive HPV is the high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), which occurs within days after fast ascent to altitudes above 2500 m. The cellular mechanism leading to HPV are still not clear. The HPV is not actuated by a central mechanism, it is a complex interplay of different factors in cellmembrane, organelles and contractile apparatus. Trigger for the HPV is a reduced alveolar PO 2. which induces calcium currents from intra to extracellular which lead to depolarisation of the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC). Possibly the carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbonic acid in water, takes part in the formation of HPV. The reduced PO 2 in case of inadequate acclimatization may lead to high altitude diseases. Part of these are the acute moutain sickness (AMS), the high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and the high altitude cerebrale edema. The exact causes for formation of high altitude diseases are still not clear. Drug of choice for medicinal therapy of AMS is acetazolamide (Acz). It is recommended for prevention of AMS and for improving the acclimatization. Acz is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The CA in a zinc metall encym, which accelerates by 107 times the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide and dehydration of bicarbonate. 1968 Forwand first discovered that Acz can be used to prevent AMS. It seems to be a multifactorial effect and is still not clarified. Emery et al. described 1977, that Acz inhibits HPV in isolated-perfused lungs. In previous studies we showed a complete inhibition of HPV in conscious, spontaniously breathing dogs with 10 mg/kg Acz and a partial inhibition with 2 mg/kg Acz. This study aimed to determine the effect of different forms of administration of Acz on the HPV in conscious, spontaniously breathing dogs during acute hypoxia. Further we invastigated the possibility for minimizing side-effects of different application forms in detail. Eight conscious, trained, female beagle-dogs were invastiged in four protocolls. The protocols were as follows: protocol 1 : controls given no Acz, protocol 2 : Acz infused intravenously 2 mg/kg (Acz iv), protocol 3 : Acz oral 2 mg/kg (Acz oral), protocol 4 : Acz inhalation 750 mg (Acz inhalation). The dogs spontanioulsy breathed one hour normoxic air (FiO 2 = 0, 21) followed by two hours of hypoxia (hypoxia I and II, FiO 2 = 0, 10) which is compareble to an altitude of 5000 m. We invastigated which adminitration form of Acz showed the lowest possible systemic effect swhile inhibiting the HPV. In controls the physiological effect of increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure(MPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistence(PVR) which is expression for HPV formation was seen. In protocols with Acz iv and Acz inhalation there was no increase in MPAP and PVR. In this study the inhibiting effect of Acz oral could not be confirmed. The measured hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistence, cardiac output) were approximatley identical. In protocols with Acz inhalation comparatively lower plasma levels have been seen while better inhibiting effect in comparision to the protocols with Acz oral. This confirms a local effect of inhaled Acz in the pulmonary vascular system. At present the oral application of Acz is recommended for prevention of AMS and for improving the acclimatization in altitude. The results of our study show a better effect of intravenous or inhaled application. Further this study shows an inhibition of HPV by Acz...|$|R

The <b>answer</b> to this question is of great relevance in conservation biology, where we aim at species’ rescue {{and the maintenance of}} biodiversity, and in agriculture and medicine, where we seek to hamper the emergence of pesticide or drug resistance. By reshuffling the genome, recombination has two antagonistic effects on the probability of evolutionary rescue: it generates and it breaks up favorable gene combinations. Which of the two effects prevails depends on the fitness effects of mutations and on the impact of stochasticity on the allele frequencies. In this article, we analyze a mathematical model for rescue after a sudden environmental change when adaptation is contingent on mutations at two loci. The analysis reveals a complex nonlinear dependence of population survival on recombination. We moreover find that, counterintuitively, a fast eradication of the wild type can promote rescue in the presence of recombination. The model also shows that two-step rescue is not unlikely to happen and can even be more likely than single-step rescue (where adaptation relies on a single mutation), depending on the circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{important}} evolutionary adaptations {{originate in}} the modification of gene regulatory circuits to produce new gene activity phenotypes. How do evolving populations sift through an astronomical number of circuits to find circuits with new <b>adaptive</b> phenotypes? The <b>answer</b> may often involve phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity allows a genotype to produce different - alternative - phenotypes after non-genetic perturbations that include gene expression noise, environmental change, or epigenetic modification. Results We here analyze a well-studied model of gene regulatory circuits. A circuit's genotype encodes the regulatory interactions among circuit genes, and its phenotype corresponds to a stable gene activity pattern the circuit forms. For this model, we study how genotypes are arranged in genotype space, where the distance between two genotypes reflects the number of regulatory mutations that set those genotypes apart. Specifically, we address whether this arrangement favors adaptive evolution mediated by plasticity. We find that plasticity facilitates the origin of genotypes that produce a new phenotype in response to non-genetic perturbations. We also find that selection can then stabilize the new phenotype genetically, allowing it to become a circuit's dominant gene expression phenotype. These are generic properties of the circuits we study here. Conclusions Taken together, our observations suggest that phenotypic plasticity frequently facilitates the evolution of novel beneficial gene activity patterns in gene regulatory circuits. </p...|$|R
30|$|However, what is {{particularly}} challenging when conducting DIF analyses with CAT is that CAT requires {{large numbers of}} items since item banks are required to allow continuous testing while simultaneously limiting the amount {{of exposure to the}} item. As a result, these large banks of items must first be developed and continually restored in order to reduce item exposure and keep test security while allowing for continuous administration of the test. At the same time, procedures, policies, and reviews must be designed and applied to ensure that items meet the basic standards anticipated for equity and fairness. In this regard, sensitivity reviews are conducted to ensure that items used for CAT observe these basic standards (Educational Testing Service 2007). Since panelists can focus their interpretations of test scores on those items which entail large DIF estimates and, thereby, those which produce large differences in groups, sensitivity reviews are then also informed by the outcomes from such analyses of DIF. However, unfortunately, relative to the items on a paper-based exam, the number of examinees on an <b>adaptive</b> test who <b>answer</b> any one item may be small, especially when there is a large item bank. Accordingly, DIF methods designed to help monitor fairness in CAT must function in diverse testing environments and, often, when there are large number of items in the bank but the number of individual examinees who respond to each one of these items is rather small.|$|R

As a corollary, we obtain optimal lower bounds for ℓ_p-sampling in strict turnstile streams for 0 < p < 2, {{as well as for}} the problem of finding duplicates in a stream. Our lower bounds do not need to use large weights, and hold even if it is promised that x∈{ 0, 1 }^n at all points in the stream. Our lower bound demonstrates that any algorithm A solving sampling problems in turnstile streams in low memory can be used to encode subsets of [n] of certain sizes into a number of bits below the information theoretic minimum. Our encoder makes adaptive queries to A throughout its execution, but done carefully so as to not violate correctness. This is accomplished by injecting random noise into the encoder's interactions with A, which is loosely motivated by techniques in differential privacy. Our correctness analysis involves understanding the ability of A to correctly <b>answer</b> <b>adaptive</b> queries which have positive but bounded mutual information with A's internal randomness, and may be of independent interest in the newly emerging area of adaptive data analysis with a theoretical computer science lens...|$|R
40|$|Local {{adaptation}} {{occurs when}} natural selection favours different phenotypes in different locations. Here, I studied the genetics of adaptation using local adaptation for seed dormancy in Arabidopsis thaliana {{as a model}} system. I asked, is there local adaptation for seed dormancy and what environmental factors drive it? What is the genetic basis of adaptation {{and what is the}} molecular nature of <b>adaptive</b> changes? To <b>answer</b> these questions I conducted a population genetic study, comparing neutral markers, candidate genes and traits. Some QTL-mapping experiments were also performed. The results obtained indicate that there is local adaptation in seed dormancy and this is mediated by the amount of precipitation received during the summer months. Local adaptation seems to occur at a regional geographic scale. Based on genetic mapping and studies, the large effect gene DOG 1 is mainly responsible for adaptation, together with several other loci with minor effects. A population genetic study of DOG 1 revealed that there is a signature of local selection on DOG 1. Several functional alleles of DOG 1 are segregating in natural populations. Mutations that increase or decrease dormancy seem to have occurred several times independently. This likely happens because of a low migration rate, new mutations occur in separate populations but they cannot migrate efficiently to other populations and thus no single mutation becomes fixed. The molecular basis of adaptive changes could not be determined, yet some candidate mutations for functional changes were identified. In addition, some of the results raised concerns about the proper way to estimate genetic differentiation. Therefore, the statistical properties of some estimators of genetic differentiation were studied using computer simulations. An estimator that takes mutation model into account can be used to compare different types of markers...|$|R

The infectious and metabolically inert Elementary Bodies (EBs) begin the cycle of infection by attaching and invading a host cells. Once inside, the EBs differentiate into the metabolically active, dividing Reticulate Bodies (RBs) within their own cellular compartment. A {{significant portion of the}} chlamydial developmental cycle takes place within the host cell, which presents a challenge for the host immune system to detect and clear the infection. MHC Class I antigen presentation is the <b>adaptive</b> immune system’s <b>answer</b> to this problem by displaying both host and parasitic antigens, if present, to other cells such as CD 8 ⁺ cytotoxic T cells. Previous research has identified chlamydial interactions with host-cell metabolism such as alteration of host transcription and translation. Other previous work has identified chlamydial antigens displayed in MHC Class I molecules. This body of work is the first to describe the impact of Chlamydia spp. infection on MHC Class I self-antigen presentation by enhancing presentation of peptides derived from defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). We hypothesize that enhancing self-antigen presentation is a novel immune evasion strategy by which Chlamyidae saturate MHC Class I molecules with self-antigen and therefore decrease the likelihood that chlamydial antigens are presented. Mechanisms of pathogenesis have often been used to elucidate host molecular pathways such as herpesvirus and the MHC Class I and MHC Class II antigen presentation pathways. The DRiPs pathway is currently unknown, and future endeavors will aim to utilize chlamydial infection to discover the molecular mechanisms of the DRiPs pathway. Additionally, we used a small molecule inhibitor of chlamydial lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis and identified the sensitivities of C. trachomatis L 2, C. trachomatis J 6276, C. muridarum, C. caviae, and C. suis to the drug. Treatment of infected cells with the inhibitor of LOS resulted in aberrant inclusions in some, but not all species as well as a differential effect on output of infectious EBs. Future experiments will seek to validate the use of the LOS inhibitor as an agent of selection in chlamydial recombination...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCellular {{telephony}} systems, where {{locations of}} mobile users are unknown at some times, {{are becoming more}} common. In such systems, mobile users are roaming in a zone and a user reports its location only if it leaves the zone entirely. The conference call search (CCS) problem deals with tracking a set of mobile users {{in order to establish}} a call. To find a single roaming user, the system may need to search each cell where the user may be located. The goal is to identify the location of all users, within bounded time, satisfying some additional constraints on the search scheme. We consider cellular systems with n cells and m mobile users (cellular phones). The uncertain location of users is given by m probability distribution vectors. Whenever the system needs to find the users, it conducts a search operation lasting at most d rounds. A request for a single search step specifies a user and a cell. In this search step, the cell is asked whether the given user is located there. In each round the system may perform an arbitrary number of such requests. An integer number B⩾ 1 bounds the number of distinct requests per cell in every round. The bound d results from quality of service considerations, whereas the bound B results from the wireless bandwidth allocated for signaling being scarce. Every search step consumes expensive wireless links, which motivates search techniques minimizing the expected number of requests thus reducing the total search costs. We distinguish between oblivious, semi-adaptive and adaptive search protocols. An oblivious search protocol decides on all requests in advance, and stops only when all users are found. A semi-adaptive search protocol decides on all the requests in advance, but it stops searching for a user once it is found. An adaptive search protocol stops searching for a user once it has been found (and its search strategy may depend on the subsets of users that were found in each previous round). We establish the difference between those three search models. We show that for oblivious “single query per cell” systems (B= 1), and a tight environment (d=m), it is NP-hard to compute an optimal solution (the case d=m= 2 was proven to be NP-hard already by Bar-Noy and Naor) and we develop a PTAS for these cases (for fixed values of d=m). However, we show that semi-adaptive systems allow polynomial time algorithms. This last result also shows that the case B= 1 and d=m= 2 is polynomially solvable also for <b>adaptive</b> search systems, <b>answering</b> an open question of Bar-Noy and Naor...|$|R
