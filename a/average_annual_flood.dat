30|$|The goal of {{the second}} part of this {{research}} was to quantify present and future losses incurred from flood damages to residential property, and how changes in losses influenced the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> losses (AAL). AAL is a value that is equivalent to a “pure premium” and thus {{can be used as a}} basis for calculating risk-based flood insurance premiums available to consumers, whereby a higher AAL is likely to result in higher market premiums (Sly and Ma 2013; Lloyds 2014; Ermolieva et al. 2017). AAL is calculated “as the sum product of the mean loss and the annual likelihood of occurrence (i.e., the event rate) for each event in the [catastrophe model] event set” (Grossi and TeHennepe 2008). For this research, AAL serves as an indicative figure for detecting overall changes in the costs of flooding over time.|$|E
40|$|Flooding {{is one of}} {{the most}} deadly and costly natural {{disasters}} in the world. While improved technology has allowed for increased prediction and warning times, there is still a lack of knowledge and accuracy in the prediction of floods. The focus of this study is to compare <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> extent to annual precipitation. This study examines the hypothesis of annual flood extent along the West Fork of the White River increasing during years of higher annual precipitation, and will confirm the hypothesis if flood extent is greater during years of higher annual precipitation. The hypothesis will be rejected if flood extent is less than average during years of high annual precipitation. Inundation maps were produced for Muncie, Anderson, and Indianapolis in Indiana, each of which the West Fork of the White River runs through. These inundation maps and annual precipitation data were compared with synoptic events in order to determine the relationship between flood extent and annual precipitation.

5|$|Much of {{southern}} Massachusetts, from its border with New York toward Worcester {{and to the}} ocean, experienced flooding. Most streams in western Massachusetts overflowed their banks, and in southeastern Massachusetts, which is largely flat terrain, streams flooded large areas along their channels; these streams moved slowly, while other areas in New England sustained damage due to the fast-moving nature of the floods. Record flooding was reported along 24stream gauges in the state, including ones that surpassed the peak set by the 1938 New England hurricane. Both the Charles and Neponset rivers were among those that flooded. About 40% {{of the city of}} Worcester was flooded during Diane, and in Russell, the state police forced many residents to evacuate. In Weymouth, the floods were considered at least a 1 in 50 year event. The Little River in Buffumville, Massachusetts had a peak discharge of 8,340ft³/s (236m³/s), which was 6.2times greater than the previous peak and 28.5times the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>flooding.</b> Flooded rivers breached run-of-the-river dams and covered nearby roadways, although dams with reservoirs resulted in less flooding. Nearly all dams along the French River were severely damaged or destroyed. One failed dam in West Auburn washed out a portion of U.S. Route 20, and the same route was washed out near Charlton. An overflown brook also damaged the Massachusetts Turnpike. A train on the Boston and Albany Railroad line plunged into a washed out portion along the Westfield River. Along the same river, floods destroyed roads and tobacco farms. In the state, 97houses were destroyed. Damage in Massachusetts was second worst of the affected states, totaling $110million; the damage was largely due to flooded basements. There were 12deaths in the state.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} {{methodology}} that could be used by local communities to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their floodplain management programs. The methodology (i. e. : model) was designed to be usable by communities without requiring computer capability. The model looks at cost-effectiveness in terms of minimizing the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> damages and the costs of programs implemented by the community to reduce flood damages. The Cities of Decatur, Elkhart, and Kokomo were selected to field test the model to illustrate current conditions in these communities. The City of Decatur was used as an example to show how alternative program scenarios could be developed, incorporated into the model, and used to determine the most cost-effective combination of average annual damages and program costs. The model was run to illustrate its method of operation and not to determine the cost-effectiveness of the floodplain management programs in the Cities of Decatur, Elkhart, and Kokomo.

Thematic maps of flood disasters in Africa between 1990 and 2014 were drawn using ArcGIS 9. 3 to research the spatial distribution patterns of <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> frequency, total deaths, total affected, and damage. There were eight natural and socio-economic indicators chosen to explore the main factors influencing the spatio-temporal distribution of flood disasters in Africa, including precipitation, ENSO, runoff, forest coverage rate, reservoir capacity, per capita GDP, population, and urbanisation rate. Studies show that seasonal changes of flood disasters in various regions of Africa, except North Africa, {{are closely related to}} precipitation. Annual flood frequencies, from 1990 to 2014, showed a fluctuating upward trend and were in good agreement with ENSO years.

40|$|Design floods are {{critical}} in the hydrological sizing or review of all waterworks. In sites of interest without hydrometric information, their estimation is carried out with re- gional methods, whose results must be scaled or dimensioned based on the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> (Qaa). In order to estimate the Qaa in an ungauged watershed, hydrolo- gists use power regression equations developed for a homogeneous region, relating the observed values of the Qaa with different physiographic characteristics of their water- sheds. The importance of estimating the Qaa justifies the search for such regressions with different approaches and techniques for obtaining the best fit parameters. In this paper, 22 records of annual maximum flows were processed, with periods ranging from 21 to 56 years. Four regression equations were analyzed and two techniques of adjustment were applied: the least–squares of the residuals in the logarithmic domain, including their bias correction, and another based on numerical optimization, using the multivariable unconstrained Rosenbrock algorithm. 28 regression equations were obtained, including four {{for each of the}} two watersheds subgroups in which the hydro- logical region was divided. Five numerical contrasts were applied in the hydrometric stations not used in deriving the regression equations. Finally, the conclusions are formulated, which emphasize the similarity of the results and recommend the applica- tion of this analysis for other regions of the country...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of riparian vegetation on sediment transport rates and flow dynamics in the South Platte River just downstream of Fort Lupton, Colorado. FaSTMECH, a two-dimensional coupled fluvial and hydraulic model, was used to compute flow characteristics (velocity and depth) in addition to sediment mobility characteristics (shear stress and sediment flux) for four discharge levels ranging from 5 % of bankfull flow to bankfull flow (Qbf). Estimates of a dimensionless drag coefficient (Cd) representative of the middle-aged bushy willows found on the river banks at the study site were {{used to create a}} spatially variable roughness in the model throughout the river reach. Model results show that during <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>flood</b> events, vegetation on the river banks causes increased drag forces on the flow, leading to an increased proportion of flow being diverted into the main channel and resulting in higher velocities. The spatial distribution of shear stresses collapse under these conditions with an order of magnitude decreases over river banks and significant increases throughout the main channel. Sediment fluxes in the reach increase by nearly an order of magnitude with the presence of bank vegetation, however, the greatest differences occur during Qbf when the highest fraction of the sediment is mobile. Further analysis of vegetation effects was conducted by performing a sensitivity analysis by altering the representative non-dimensional vegetation drag coefficient by as much as +/- 400 %. These alterations represent differences in vegetation density, height, orientation, leafy/leafless structure, age, rigidity, and vegetation type. Although there is a relationship between sediment fluxes and changes in Cd, there only exists a 14 % increase in transport at Qbf between the two exterior limits of Cd...|$|E
40|$|In May 1973, {{there were}} 194 {{faculty members at}} the University of Minnesota and State and Private Colleges in Minnesota with water {{resources}} expertise. Water resources research effort in Minnesota, 1963 through 1972, in terms of numbers of ongoing projects increased from 65 in 1963 to 140 in 1972. The estimated annual man-years of effort rose from 41 in 1963 to 200 in 1972. Total expenditures increased from $ 620, 000 in 1963 to $ 3, 900, 000 in 1972. Federal agencies conducted the greatest amount (50 percent of total research) with the University of Minnesota, Consultants, Private Organizations, State and Private Colleges, and State agencies following in that order. About 485 water resources research projects were completed during the period 1963 through 1972. In 1972, approximately 76 percent of expenditures for water resources research were Federal funds and about 24 percent were non-Federal funds. Eight water resources problem-research need analysis conferences were held during 1973 to determine research needs and to set research need priorities. A committee reviewed institutional arrangements for coordinating water resources research efforts in Minnesota and recommended that he Water Resources Research Center expand its Advisory Committee to include additional members from State Colleges and Branches of the University of Minnesota. A statewide priority list of 230 needed research projects was generated and research costs ($ 9 million) and manpower (500 man-years) needs were estimated. High priority needed water resources research topics were identified as follows: Methods for making beneficial use of waste heat from thermal power production in Minnesota. Identification and evaluation of groundwater pollution caused by municipal and industrial waste discharges, urbanization, and agricultural practices; monitoring groundwater pollution in Minnesota; and identifying groundwater pollution hazard areas. Management methods and techniques for protecting groundwater resources in Minnesota. Improving the water resources planning process in Minnesota by integrating water resources planning with land-use planning; integrating water quality planning with total water resources planning; and more fully considering alternatives, environmental consequences, public interests, and priority setting. Alternative solutions for small community waste disposal problems in Minnesota; income index-hardship cases involving pollution control policies. Determining the optimum balance between preservation and protection of wetlands and drainage for agricultural practices in Minnesota; social and economic impacts of wetland drainage. Ways and means for encouraging {{the private sector to}} preserve and protect wetlands in Minnesota; feasibility of providing tax (individual and county) incentives for wetland preservation. Estimating the effects of future large groundwater withdrawals in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area on groundwater levels, stream flows, lake levels, and pollution hazards; social and economic impacts of withdrawals; design of computer hydrologic system model.

Projections of expenditures can only be classified as modest.
