5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} <b>as</b> <b>big</b> and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|Big Hill {{was first}} used for the 1916 Winter Carnival, in which Nelsen set a hill record at 56meters (183ft). He beat his own record several times and kept the hill record until 1921. The tournament was {{gradually}} expanded, and by 1921 it cost $5,800 to arrange. That year, Henry Hall set a world length record in the hill, jumping 70meters (229ft). Three thousand spectators watched the games, in which many of the world's elite skiers competed. To accommodate the extra spectators, Canadian Pacific Railway stationed sleeping cars at Revelstoke to supplement the hotels. In 1922, Isabel Coursier debuted <b>as</b> <b>Big</b> Hill's first women jumper. In 1923, the tournament climaxed with 99 participating ski jumpers. In 1925, while sick with the flu, Nelsen beat Hall's world record by jumping 73meters (240ft). The record would remain until 1930.|$|E

The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E
