5|$|On 21 October 2013, Grabner was {{suspended}} for two games for an illegal check {{to the head of}} Carolina Hurricanes forward Nathan Gerbe. Later that season, on February 27, 2014, Grabner <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> rare feat, scoring two short handed goals on the same penalty kill in a 5-4 overtime win over the Toronto Maple Leafs, scoring both goals in a span of 46 seconds; Grabner became the first player to score two shorthanded goals on the same penalty kill since Ryan O'Reilly did it on February 2, 2010. However, O'Reilly scored two on a four-minute penalty kill, while Grabner did it during a standard two minute penalty.|$|E

25|$|A {{small number}} of PA-22s have been {{converted}} to taildragger configuration, resulting in an aircraft that {{is very similar to}} a PA-20 Pacer, but which retains the model refinements and features of the PA-22.

When this conversion is <b>accomplished,</b> <b>a</b> 2 puck disc brake conversion is usually installed in place of the original drum brakes, and the Lycoming O-360 180 HP engine is the preferred upgrade.|$|E

25|$|Afrocentrism {{can be seen}} as an African-American-inspired {{ideology}} that manifests an affirmation of themselves in a Eurocentric-dominated society, commonly by conceptualizing a glorified heritage in terms of distinctly African, foreign origins (where foreign is anything not indigenous to the African continent). It often denies or minimizes European, Near Eastern and Asian cultural influences while accenting historical African civilizations that independently <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on African-American culture and the history of Africa. It involves an African diaspora version of an African-centered view of history and culture to portray the achievements and development of Africans who have been marginalized.|$|E

25|$|Born on 18 September 1892, Newstead Colliery, Nottinghamshire, Staples first {{played for}} Nottinghamshire in 1920. Though he <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> few good {{performances}} such as 6 for 81 against the great Surrey batting side at The Oval, it was {{though he had}} little sting, and although he obtained a permanent place in 1921 and took 76 wickets, there was still little to suggest a significant career. Although in 1922, Staples bowled very well at times (notably four quick wickets to round off a brilliant win over Yorkshire) and made 85 not out in a last wicket stand of 140 with Richmond, he did not establish {{a reputation as a}} major force in the game until 1923, when his bowling gave Yorkshire its only defeat in the Championship and he took almost 100 wickets. In addition, he surprised everyone by making 110 against Surrey in the August Bank Holiday match.|$|E
25|$|Between 2005–2007, MICA <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> two-phased, $6.3million {{renovation}} of the building by the architectural firm of Grieves, Worrall, Wright & O’Hatnick, Inc. The first phase, {{renovation of}} the interior, was completed in Fall, 2005: interior finishes, such as the mosaic tile flooring, marble columns, tin ceilings, wood wainscot, and trim were cleaned and restored. Classroom space was also increased, {{as well as the}} quality and quantity of studio space. The second phase, restoration of the building's exterior and train shed, was completed in Spring, 2007: stonework and wood were cleaned, repaired, and repainted, the slate canopy restored, and the drainage system fixed; clerestory and structural timbers in the train shed were replaced and the steel roof framing was reinforced. In keeping with the pedestrian landscaping and streetscape that MICA has created along Mount Royal Avenue, a new plaza with benches, bike racks, shrubs, and ornamental grasses and ground cover was added.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on 11 February 1891 in Hillingdon, and was highly {{successful}} in local games even as a teenager, so that Middlesex engaged him soon after his eighteenth birthday in 1909. He was an immediate success with his sharp spin, coming second in the Middlesex averages behind Frank Tarrant, whilst in 1910, though erratic, he <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> sensational performance against Essex, taking 7 wickets for 2 runs in 25 balls. That year, still a teenager, Hearne made two hundred for Middlesex, and in the dry summer of 1911, he went from strength to strength. His major feats that year were 234 against Somerset, 6 for 17 against Essex and nine wickets in nine overs for 40 runs against Surrey, all at Lord's. In all, he took 102 wickets and scored 1627 runs {{at an average of}} 42.81, and was named as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden.|$|E

25|$|During {{the time}} the Tullahassee Mission was broken up, in 1861 Loughridge moved his family East into the Cherokee Nation, and preached to the churches there for one year, which had been left by other missionaries, who {{returned}} to {{their homes in the}} North because of the dangers during the Civil War. The Indians themselves, both Creek and Cherokee, were divided on the war question; some joined the South and others the North. It also became useless and very dangerous for Loughridge and his family to remain in the territory any longer. So, on July 17, 1862, Loughridge packed up his belongings, along with his family, in two small wagons, and went south to Texas, where most of his relatives were living. In Texas during the war, and afterwards for eighteen years, Loughridge was regularly employed in preaching to churches {{in different parts of the}} state. His wife was also employed as a teacher and taught in several different schools. During this time while Loughridge <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> lot of good for others, and also was able to provide his children with an education.|$|E
25|$|After {{the entry}} of Italy in the Second World War, British {{authorities}} designed a formal system of aircraft reinforcement to Malta, {{in order to build}} up a credible air defence and replace potential losses. Only two possible routes remained open after the fall of France: the most obvious, via North Africa, by shuttling the fighters through the Sahara or the Suez Canal to Egypt, and its alternative, by delivering them by carrier from the western Mediterranean. The first unit to be transferred by carrier was 418 Flight, a group composed by Navy and RAF pilots specially trained for deck operations. They <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> successful mission on 2 August 1940 from the old carrier HMS Argus, escorted by the fleet carrier , three battleships, two cruisers and 10 destroyers. Three Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 medium bombers attacked the convoy, but a group of Skuas from Ark Royal shot down one of the SM.79s and repulsed the surviving two. All the British fighters reached the airstrip of Luqa at Malta, although two planes crash-landed. The first engagement of the new arrived aircraft took place on the night of 13 August, when they shot down another SM.79. By 16 August 418 Flight and the original Malta units were merged into 261 Squadron.|$|E
25|$|Simeo Ondeto {{is known}} as the Lodvikus or The Glory of God, whose role is to bring the world to {{understand}} the hidden treasures of life after death and dramatise the reality of eternal life. According to Legio Maria the promise by Jesus to return has been fulfilled by the coming of Simeo. Legio Maria also seems not to believe in a final judgement of the whole world. They believe in immediate judgement of individuals immediately after death. This is supported by the long list of adored Legio saints. Some of the official Legio Maria saints include Timotheo Atila, Maria Ombwayo, Tobias Oongo, Petro Otieno, Mumbo Carilus and Angi Clement. Church leaders distinguish Messias Simeo Ondeto's mission as separate from that of Jesus. He was not sent to replace Jesus, for Jesus was a name given to the son of God when he <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> second dispensational mission. Instead, Messias Simeo Ondeto is God incarnated in another context, specifically for the third dispensation of the glory of God. Often, 1 John 4:1 is used as biblical support for the confession that God has again come into the flesh through Messias Simeo Ondeto, for “every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every Spirit that does not confess Jesus is not of God…Therefore we say that Jesus has come in the flesh.|$|E

Even with the disappointing season Sweetland's team did <b>accomplished</b> <b>a</b> first in Ohio State football history. It was the first Buckeye team to cross the goal line against University of Michigan. The touchdown was scored by the Buckeye's when Bill Marquardt returned a fumble fifty yards. The next year, he and the Buckeyes improved to 8–2–2. This team did not give up any points in Ohio Athletic Conference games. They did have a 0–0 tie to Case Institute of Technology. Case won the conference due to the fact they played and won two more games in conference than the Buckeyes. The two losses that season were to future Big Ten Conference rivals University of Michigan (40–0) and Indiana University (11–0). Sweetland finished with a combined record of 14–7–2 in his two years as the Buckeyes head man. Sweetland also coached the Buckeye's track and field team. With a victory over Oberlin in a dual meet by a score of 52–33 the Buckeyes won the state championship for 1905.|$|E
