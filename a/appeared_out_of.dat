5|$|Australia dropped Bill Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. Brown was Australia's reserve opener, but Bradman opted to play {{him out of}} {{position}} in the middle-order, instead of using a specialist. Brown had also struggled in his unfamiliar position in the matches against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, scoring 25 and 26. According to O'Reilly, Brown had <b>appeared</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in the middle-order because {{he was used to}} the opener's classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. He was replaced by the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had hammered an unbeaten 159—including several sixes—against Gloucestershire, and that innings was particularly noted for his quick footwork, which he used to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the same}} day Haldane ordered US 1/28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels in their area of operations, {{uncovering}} a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps. A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American {{was killed by a}} Viet Cong soldier who suddenly <b>appeared</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a large anthill. Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.|$|E
5|$|Brown was rested for the {{following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test. Loxton scored 159 not out, featuring in two century partnerships and propelling Australia to 7/774 declared, which was its highest score of the tour and {{laid the foundation for}} an innings victory. Loxton’s effort was enough to oust Brown from his middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford. According to O’Reilly, Brown had <b>appeared</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in the middle-order because he was used to the opener’s classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. During the Test, which was drawn, Barnes was injured and off spinner Ian Johnson was used as a makeshift opener as Morris was the only specialist left after Brown’s omission. Afterwards, Brown managed only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.|$|E

25|$|On 19 January, the Russians finally <b>appeared</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the forests, driving Ney's {{troops from}} Schippenbeil. After {{detaching}} 3,000 men to {{link with the}} 6th Division, Bennigsen commanded about 63,000 troops, while L'Estocq had 13,000 in the area. On the 21st, Bennigsen's advance elements were in Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński) with L'Estocq on his right flank. The three Russian advance guards were led by Major Generals Markov, Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, and Karl Gustav von Baggovut. Though his cavalry under General of Brigade Auguste Francois-Marie de Colbert-Chabanais was roughly handled, Ney managed to escape southward to Neidenburg (Nidzica).|$|E

Jackson's damaged aircraft made it back to Coltishall, but Downing's aircraft crashed into the sea, killing all aboard.|$|E
25|$|For all of {{the sound}} common sense that Illingworth had {{demonstrated}} {{as a player and}} reinforced as a commentator, his abrasive man-management style <b>appeared</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> date by 1994. Examples of this were his readiness to speak to the media to criticise his own players, as he did twice with Mike Atherton: firstly during the dirt in the pockets scandal in 1994 and later the same year during the Melbourne Test match. Illingworth also engaged in a public argument with Devon Malcolm just after Malcolm had produced a rather wayward burst of bowling in the fifth test of the 1995–96 South African series, which saw a long 10th wicket stand that effectively cost England the match.|$|E
25|$|The National {{government}} was humiliated in early 1970 in a disastrous by-election. Political commentators speculated about when Holyoake would retire, {{and by the}} early 1970s his closest allies, including Jack Marshall, were privately encouraging him to retire. The {{government was}} perceived as careworn—two of its strongest ministers had died, and the party caucus was increasingly divided. After {{more than a decade}} in power, Holyoake's dogged conservatism <b>appeared</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> touch with an increasingly liberal society. However, it was not until 1972 that he resigned to ease the succession for Marshall. By then he had become the senior statesman of the Commonwealth. Holyoake remained in Cabinet as Minister of Foreign Affairs until National lost office {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most of Britain's defence forces, 3 AA Division was {{frequently}} in action during the so-called Phoney War that lasted from September 1939 to May 1940. The first action occurred unexpectedly on 16 October 1939, when nine enemy aircraft suddenly <b>appeared</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> cloud and dived on warships off Rosyth Dockyard, {{close to the}} Forth Bridge. No warning had been given, but the crews of 71 HAA Rgt were undergoing gun drill and the gun positions hastily loaded for a 'crash' action under individual gun control, normal prediction being impossible against diving and turning targets. A total of 104 rounds were fired and one aircraft had its tail shot off (fighters accounted for another two). HMS Southampton was damaged. These {{are thought to have}} been the first British guns to open fire against the enemy during the war.|$|E

The following day, 14 hostile aircraft in three waves attacked warships lying in Scapa Flow. The Chain Home early-warning radar system did not yet cover Scapa, but 226 Bty of 101 HAA Rgt was able to engage and claimed one shot down. Among the vessels damaged in this raid was the Jutland veteran HMS Iron Duke, acting as a base ship and floating AA battery.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{previous}} Chogye Trichen Rinpoches, Khyenrab Choje (1436–97), beheld the sustained vision of the female tantric deity Vajrayogini at Drak Yewa in central Tibet, and received extensive teachings and initiations directly from her. Two forms of Vajrayogini <b>appeared</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the face of the}} rocks at Drak Yewa, one red in color and the other white, and they bestowed the Kālacakra initiation on Khyenrab Choje. When he asked if there was any proof of this, his attendant showed the master the kusha grass that Khyenrab Choje brought back with him from the initiation. It was unlike any kusha grass found in this world, with rainbow lights sparkling up and {{down the length of the}} dried blades of grass. This direct lineage from Vajrayogini is the 'shortest', the most recent and direct, lineage of the Kālacakra empowerment and teachings that exists in this world. In addition to being known as the emanation of Manjushri, Khyenrab Choje had previously been born as many of the Kings of Shambhala as well as numerous Buddhist masters of India. These are some indications of his unique relationship to the Kālacakra tradition.|$|E

500|$|Around eleven, {{the five}} {{warships}} began a salvo of broadside fire that flattened the flimsy American breastworks and panicked the Connecticut militia. [...] "So terrible and so incessant a roar of guns few {{even in the}} army and navy had ever heard before," [...] wrote Ambrose Serle, private secretary to Lord Howe. Nearly eighty guns fired at the shore for a full hour. The Americans were half buried under dirt and sand, and were unable to return fire due to the smoke and dust.

Together, the three British ships removed the prisoners from Thétis and affected improvised repairs: Thétis had lost her remaining masts shortly after she had been boarded and Amethysts were in immediate danger of collapse. British casualties in the engagement were severe, with 19 killed and 51 wounded, but French losses were several times larger, with 135 dead, including Pinsum, and 102 wounded.|$|E

Izumo and Iwate had rejoined the 2nd Division in {{anticipation}} of this battle and Kamimura's ships confirmed the initial spotting later that morning before joining Tōgō's battleships. Together {{with most of the}} Japanese battleships, the division opened fire at 14:10 on the Russian battleship , which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later.
