25|$|When {{the vendor}} {{is aware of}} the {{customer}} request it will determine the customer needs. By checking what the customer current configuration is and what the customer desires. This process can also take place automatically by checking the customer configuration in the configuration management system. More information on this system is provided in the next chapter. When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product it is necessary to determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the configuration management system. When the configuration of the customer appears to be insufficient the customer is informed <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> <b>For</b> example the vendor can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system of the vendor is updated. There is more information about this in the chapter about CRM.|$|E
25|$|Saṅkrānti (Hindi: सङ्क्रान्ति, meaning Revolution): In {{the first}} 27 verses (first quarter) of the canto, the poet expounds on Saṅkrānti, {{the concept of}} true revolution. It {{is not to be}} {{attained}} by spilling blood, but by spreading a thought. Rarely do people want such a revolution, their egos do not allow it. The narrative then proceeds – after the Puṃsavana and Sīmantonnayana Saṃskāras of Sujātā, one day, late in the night, Kahola is practising Vedic chanting, perfecting his knowledge of what he is to teach his disciples on the following day. Out of fatigue and the four defects of Bhrama, Pramāda, Vipralipsā and Karaṇāpāṭava, Kahola starts erring in all eight types of recitations – Jaṭā, Rekhā, Mālā, Śikhā, Ratha, Dhvaja, Daṇḍa, and Ghana. The child of Sujātā, while still in the womb, thinks <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> some time and then asks his father to stop practising and teaching verses incorrectly, pointing out that the sage is making eight errors in reciting each verse. Kahola is taken aback and asks the child in the womb to stay quiet, saying he is reciting as per tradition, and forgetfulness is only human. The child replies by saying that the father should throw away the old corpse of so-called tradition and again requests Kahola to learn the Vedas once more from Uddālaka. The enraged Kahola curses the child to be born with all eight limbs crooked. Kahola repents immediately after, but the child (Aṣṭāvakra) takes the curse in his stride, and asks his father not to repent.|$|E

500|$|At the lighthouse, Mr. Briscoe {{decides to}} brave the storm in a landing craft, but is {{immediately}} swamped {{with water and}} carried by the tide towards the mainland. After Castro avails himself of {{the services of a}} prostitute, he rampages around the property searching for Picasso. The storm crashes through the inn. A guest is killed by a billiards table that falls on top of him and is dragged off into the sea. Mr. Glowery is also dragged off into the sea by the storm. Castro and his assistant round up the guests and interrogate them about the location of the $1.5 million Picasso stole. In another part of the inn a fire starts. Finally, Mr. Briscoe shows up and kills Castro's assistant before knocking Castro unconscious. While Hawthorne learns his wife is leaving him for the prostitute, the inn becomes completely engulfed in flames. Picasso, Hawthorne, and Briscoe motor a lobster boat over to the lighthouse, and dump Castro's dead assistant into the sea along with Castro himself, weighed down with two cinder blocks chained to his ankles. When they land on the island, Briscoe runs into the lighthouse and blows himself up. Amongst the rubble of the lighthouse, Picasso notices the inscription [...] "MORTE D'AUTHOR" [...] painted on one of the surrounding rocks and says to the innkeeper [...] "He's been thinking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> some time, George." ...|$|E
500|$|Seventy-one {{years of}} age and {{becoming}} increasingly deaf, Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972, that he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, having served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley. The lame duck Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war, after an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again. Without advance notice, Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionally end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months. The measure, which had no co-sponsors, stunned Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and provoked heated debate in the Senate. Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The revised amendment passed 62–33, whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill. At Nixon's insistence, the Senate defeated the amended bill 48–42. Disappointed, Cooper nevertheless proclaimed, [...] "I feel purged inside. I've felt strongly <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> a long time. Now it's {{in the hands of the}} President.

500|$|A {{significant}} plot {{element is}} House's use of Vicodin to manage pain, {{caused by an}} infarction in his quadriceps muscle five years before the show's first season, which also forces him to use a cane. In the first season, 11th episode [...] "Detox", House admits he is addicted to Vicodin, but {{says he does not}} have a problem because the pills [...] "let me do my job, and they take away my pain". His addiction has led his colleagues, Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson, to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times. When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain, he occasionally self-medicates with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty, and classifies himself as a [...] "big drinker". Toward the end of season five, House begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses, Wilson and he determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause. House goes into denial <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> a brief time, but {{at the close of the}} season finale, he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital. In the following season's debut episode, House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control. However, about a year and a half later, in season seven's 15th episode, [...] "Bombshells", House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin, and his addiction recurs.|$|E

[...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something {{that a lot of people}} actually believe in".

Tirunesh's sister Ejegayehu Dibaba finished in third place {{with a time of}} 14:36.78 (4.04 seconds off her personal best). Dibaba bettered Meseret Defar's world record by 5.48 seconds.
