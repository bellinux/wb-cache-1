The Flamant MD 311s (which were based in Algeria to train pilots and navigators at first) were the first aircraft in history to fire one of the world's first wire-guided <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles</b> in anger, using French Army SS.11 <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles,</b> in a combat experiment to get at fortified caves located in deep mountain gorges, in 1956 from an aircraft based with the special unit of the French Air Force in Algeria, GOM.86. The SS.11 attacks proved extremely successful and the French Army which had provided the missiles, began an experiment {{which resulted in the}} world's first attack helicopters firing <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles.</b> [...] The Flamant stayed in service until 1981. In addition to the French air force, the Flamant served in Cambodia, Madagascar, Tunisia, and Vietnam.|$|R
