To {{assessment}} of windbreak efficiency two main parameters are using: height of windbreak (H) and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>porosity.</b> In South Moravian Region the total area of windbreaks is approximately 1200 ha. For purposes of horizontal profile measurement of wind speed and wind direction windbreaks with various spices composition, age and construction in cadastral territory Suchá Loz and Micmanice were chosen. Windbreak influence on horizontal wind profile was found out in distance of 50, 100, 150 and 200 m in front and behind windbreak in two-meter height above surface. For the optical porosity measurement the ImageTool program was used. The wind field measurement results of windbreak in Suchá Loz cadastral shows limited effect of windbreak on wind speed. The windbreak is created mainly by Canadian poplars (Populus × canadensis). In dependence on main species foliage stage the effect of windbreak was obvious on leeward side to distance of 100 – 150 m (c. 5 – 7 H). Average optical porosity of windbreak in Suchá Loz was 50 % (April). Reduction of average wind speed was about 17 % maximally in this stage. Optical porosity was 20 % and wind speed reduction was about 37 % during second measurement (October). The second monitored windbreak (Micmanice) had a significant influence on wind speed even to the maximal measured distance (200 m, c. 14 H). This windbreak crea­ted mainly by Acer sp. and Fraxinus excelsior reduced the wind speed about 64 %. During first measurement (May) the optical porosity of 20 % and maximal wind speed reduction of 64 % were assessed. For optical porosity of 21 % (October) the wind speed reduction was about 55 %. Close relation between optical porosity and wind speed reduction was found out by statistical evaluation. Correlation coefficient regardless locality for distance of 50 m was − 0. 80, 100 m − 0. 92, 150 m − 0. 76 and for distance of 200 m − 0. 63...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{estimating}} the size-segregated particle collection efficiencies of three hedgerow species of different <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>porosities</b> {{has been developed}} and tested in the particle size range 0. 5 –View the MathML source. Collection efficiency (CE) has been {{described in terms of}} the coupled effects of the deviation of the approach flow (CEflow) and the filtration through the foliage elements (CEfiltration). Variations in barrier porosities with wind speed, which govern both the flow and the particle collection mechanism, have been modelled using an empirical parameter called the “rigidity factor” (r) for representative leaf-sizes of the three hedge types. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allows simulation of velocity fields and turbulence around the barriers, leading to identification of prominent flow separation zones in the wake of denser hedges. Application of different turbulence closure schemes in the CFD model influences the predicted CE only for particles above View the MathML source. Field validations obtained for a porous (hawthorn) and a denser (yew) hedge indicate that CEfiltration ranges between 10 and 35 % for “coarse” particles (10 –View the MathML source) and 1 – 5 % for “fine” particles (0. 5 –View the MathML source), the porous hedge showing higher values in the former case and vice versa in the latter. Model predictions of CE over the particle size range studied for the porous hedge lie within 1 – 30 % and for the denser hedge within 0. 4 – 3 %...|$|R
40|$|For an inhaled {{tuberculosis}} (TB) treatment, antibiotic aerosolization has to {{be produced}} by using drugs in their solid state administered by means of Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) devices. In this regard, untreated drugs generally fail to reach alveolar epithelium and penetrate alveolar macrophages (AM) as the primary site of the infection. 1 Therefore, the urgency to treat TB disease effectively may be addressed with approaches consisting of micro- or nanoparticulate carriers redeveloping existing drugs to reach the intended goal. 2, 3 Specific modifications of the particulate carrier surface by conjugation with molecules that can specifically bind the receptors (active targeting) are expected to boost the particle avidity to cells increasing accumulation and intracellular uptake. Macrophages possess mannose-specific membrane receptors (MR) that can recognize and facilitate the internalization of carriers bearing mannose residues. In particular, the infected AM have an overexpression of MR. 4 In the present study, surface engineered Solid Lipid Nanoparticle assemblies (SLNas) were developed as potential carriers of rifampicin, a first choice antitubercular drug, intended to maximize drug concentration at the primary site of TB infection. To increase specificity for macrophages and internalization potential, SLNas surface was functionalized by a mannosylated derivative to induce AM active targeting. Biocompatible lipid components such as fatty acids and their derivatives, diglycerides and triglycerides were processed {{by means of the}} melt emulsifying technique using biocompatible surfactants (sodium taurocholate and methyl mannopyranoside). Mannosylated SLNas were examined for their intrinsic properties (size and size distribution, shape, surface charge, bulk and tap density, <b>aerodynamic</b> diameter, <b>porosity,</b> flowability, physical state of the components). Powder breathability in terms of Emitted Dose and Fine Particle Fraction was assayed by Next Generation Impactor (NGI). This information on powder interparticle adhesion and deaggregation ability influencing powder dispersion and deposition onto alveolar epithelia. SLNas mannosylation was investigated by means of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis. Prototypes of SLNas in terms of successful functionalization, optimal breathability and chemico-physical stability, were examined for cytotoxicity by MTT test on murine macrophages J 774 cell lines...|$|R

MaghirangWind erosion is an {{important}} problem in many locations, including the Great Plains, {{that needs to be}} controlled to protect soil and land resources. This research was conducted to assess the effectiveness of vegetation (specifically, standing vegetation and tree barriers) as controls for wind erosion. Specific objectives were to: (1) measure sand transport and abrasion on artificial standing vegetation, (2) determine porosity and drag of a single row of Osage orange (Maclura pomifera) barrier, (3) assess effectiveness of Osage orange barriers in reducing dust, (4) predict airflow through standing vegetation, and (5) predict airflow and particle collection through Osage orange barriers. Wind tunnel tests were conducted to measure wind speed profiles, relative abrasion energies, and sand discharge rates for bare sand and for two vegetation heights (150 and 220 mm) at various densities of vegetation. Results showed that vegetation density was directly related to threshold velocity and inversely related to sand discharge. The coefficient of abrasion was adversely affected by saltation discharge but did not depend on wind speed. Field tests measured the <b>aerodynamic</b> and optical <b>porosities</b> of Osage orange trees using wind profiles and image analysis, respectively, and an empirical relationship between the two porosities was derived. Vertical wind profiles were also used to estimate drag coefficients. Optical porosity correlated well with the drag coefficient. Field measurements also showed a row of Osage orange barrier resulted in particulate concentration reduction of 15 to 54 % for PM 2. 5 and 23 to 65 % for PM 10. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software (OpenFOAM) was used to predict airflow in a wind tunnel with artificial standing vegetation. Predicted wind speeds differed slightly from the measured values, possibly due to oscillatory motions of the standing vegetation not accounted for in the CFD simulation. OpenFOAM was also used to simulate airflow and particle transport through a row of Osage orange barrier. Predicted and measured wind speeds agreed well. Measured dust concentration reduction at two points (upwind and downwind) were also similar to the predicted results...|$|R
