500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} an epidemic caused by [...] virus was made by Lurman in 1885. An outbreak of smallpox occurred in Bremen in 1883 and 1,289 shipyard employees were vaccinated with lymph from other people. After several weeks, and up to eight months later, 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with jaundice and were diagnosed as suffering from serum hepatitis. Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy. Lurman's paper, now regarded as a classical example of an epidemiological study, proved that contaminated lymph {{was the source of}} the outbreak. Later, numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction, in 1909, of hypodermic needles that were used, and, more importantly, reused, for administering Salvarsan for the treatment of syphilis. The virus was not discovered until 1966 when Baruch Blumberg, then working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), discovered the <b>Australia</b> <b>antigen</b> (later known to be [...] surface antigen, or HBsAg) in the blood of Australian aboriginal people. Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by Frederick MacCallum in 1947, David Dane and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by electron microscopy. By the early 1980s the genome of the virus had been sequenced, and the first vaccines were being tested.|$|E

40|$|Human {{antisera}} against <b>Australia</b> (Au) <b>antigen</b> {{have been}} characterized by liquid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) for their precipitation of 125 I-labeled Au antigen. The end-point dilutions of sera (anti-Au) which precipitated 50 % of 125 I-Au antigen by RIA correlated well with complement fixation titers but had a much wider range, indicating a greater precision and perhaps a better sensitivity of assay. Anti-Au serum diluted to precipitate 50 % of 125 I-labeled Au antigen was used as standard antibody in RIA tests to detect either inhibition or enhancement of the reaction by preincubated mixtures of Au antigen and antibody specimens. Without free Au antigen or antibody in the resultant mixtures there was no inhibition or enhancement; the mixtures presumably contained immunoreactively equivalent proportions of Au antigen and antibody. RIA data for diagnostic specimens indicated an end-point sensitivity which was proportional to the dilution of the standard anti-Au sera used in the test. High concentrations of the standard antibody permitted detectable inhibition of 125 I-Au antigen precipitation at lower antigen specimen concentrations. Similarly, low concentrations of the standard antibody permitted detectable enhancement of 125 I-Au antigen precipitation at lower antibody specimen concentrations.

40|$|In a {{significant}} percentage of examined cases of fulminant hepatitis, subacute hepatitis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and chronic persistent hepatitis, <b>Australia</b> (hepatitis-associated) <b>antigen</b> (Au HAA) was identified in the liver and in extrahepatic locations. The several immunofluorescent patterns of Au HAA localization in hepatocytes strongly suggested various stages of Au HAA accumulation and release. Deposits of a mixture of immunoglobulins G and M and occasionally β 1 C-globulin were found in the cytoplasm of Au HAA containing hepatocytes, on their plasma membranes, on or in the nuclei, in the cytoplasm of Kupffer cells and, rarely, in the sinusoids. The accompanying tissue changes were hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis. These intra- and extracellular complexes of Au HAA and immunoglobulins displayed strong affinity for guinea pig complement in the immunohistochemical complement fixation reaction. When tested by immunodiffusion in agar, IgG dissociated from these complexes by potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) treatment showed anti-Au HAA specificity. In fulminant hepatitis neither Au HAA nor immunoglobulins and complement were found in the liver. In chronic aggressive hepatitis and subacute hepatitis the amount of the Au HAA immune complexes identified in the liver was approximately inversely proportional to the extent and severity of the parenchymal lesions. In liver cirrhosis and chronic persistent hepatitis there was a positive correlation between the amount of the Au HAA immune complexes found in the liver and the degree of hepatocellular damage. The deposits of Au HAA, identified in extrahepatic locations including germinal centers of lymph nodes and spleen, kidney glomeruli and blood vessel walls, were as a rule accompanied by deposits of IgG, IgM, β 1 C-globulin and fibrin. All these deposits showed strong affinity for guinea pig complement in the immunohistochemical reaction of complement fixation. Germinal center activation, chronic membraneous glomerulonephritis, panarteritis and simple arteriolar hyalinosis were found at sites of localization of these deposits...|$|R

None of twenty-four <b>Australia</b> <b>antigen</b> positive cases exceeded 3 mg/ml IgM, and only 3 / 58 <b>Australia</b> <b>antigen</b> negative cases exhibited values below 3 mg/ml.

40|$|Liver cell {{dysplasia}} {{is defined}} as cellular enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism, and multinucleation of liver cells occurring in groups or occupying whole cirrhotic nodules. The prevalence, natural history, and relationship to the <b>Australia</b> or hepatitis-associated <b>antigen</b> (HAA) have been studied in 552 Ugandan African patients with normal, cirrhotic, and cancerous livers. Liver cell dysplasia was found in only two of 200 (1 %) patients with normal livers, in three of 43 (6 · 9 %) of patients with normal livers bearing primary liver cell carcinoma, 35 of 175 (20 · 3 %) patients with cirrhosis, and 80 of 124 (64 · 5 %) of patients with cirrhosis and primary liver cell carcinoma. Cirrhotic patients without dysplasia were, on average, ten years younger than those with dysplasia and the latter were on average six years younger than those with cirrhosis and carcinoma. Liver cell dysplasia occurred more frequently in males than in females. It was found {{in all but one}} instance in macronodular or mixed forms of cirrhosis only. There was a strong relationship between dysplasia and the presence of HAA in 104 patients that suggests a possible carcinogenic mechanism for the longincubation (serum or B) hepatitis virus in liver cell carcinoma.
