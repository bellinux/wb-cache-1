5|$|The {{study of}} the {{classification}} or taxonomy of any insect is called systematic entomology. If one works with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> order or even a family, the term may also be made specific to that order or family, for example systematic dipterology.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record. It was obtained through samples of hair and a tooth. The DNA did not match the profiles stored in databases of known missing persons. Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas to create <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from {{the bones of the}} child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E

50|$|Many {{words in}} Rennellese use either whole or partial reduplication. Reduplication serves three main {{purposes}} in Rennellese: pluralization, making <b>a</b> word <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> or changing the whole word.|$|R
5|$|Meare Pool was drained {{after the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries {{and the fish}} house fell into disrepair. It {{suffered}} {{a fire in the}} 1880s, which destroyed the roof and gutted the interior. In 1893 some repairs were made to the walls, although the roof was not replaced until work was undertaken by the Ministry of Works in the 1920s, with further conservation being carried out in the 1960s. A piece of timber from the building was subject to dendrochronology testing in an attempt to provide <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> date for the buildings construction, but the results proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|There is a three-stage {{process in}} which the area, time period, and details of a severe weather {{forecast}} are refined from a broad-scale forecast of potential hazards to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> and detailed forecast of what hazards are expected, and where and in what time frame they are expected to occur. If warranted, forecasts will also increase in severity through this three-stage process.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
50|$|In syntax, {{the most}} general {{formulation}} of possible movement permitted by <b>a</b> rule. <b>More</b> <b>specific</b> rules include move NP and move wh, {{which in turn}} are <b>more</b> general than <b>specific</b> transformations such as those involved in passivization.|$|R
50|$|The RFS {{may be used}} as {{the first}} step in a {{procurement}} process. Once a determined solution has been selected, the process can advance one step, issuing, for example, <b>a</b> RFP, <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> and detailed.|$|R
50|$|In Deaf culture, Deaf audiences {{will use}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{visually}} expressive variant of clapping. Instead of clapping their palms together, they {{raise their hands}} straight up with outstretched fingers and twist their wrists. However, in <b>a</b> situation <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> to hearing culture, the traditional clap is used.|$|R
5|$|The subgenre has {{its origins}} in open world action {{adventure}} games popularized in Europe (and particularly the United Kingdom) throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The release of Grand Theft Auto (1997) marked a major commercial success for open-ended game design in North America, and featured a more marketable crime theme. But it was the popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 {{that led to the}} widespread propagation of <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> set of gameplay conventions consistent with a subgenre. The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over the world where the player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons. The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> disorder are unmet.|$|E
25|$|Whilst GPUs and FPGAs perform {{far better}} than CPUs for these tasks, a factor of 10 in {{efficiency}} can still be gained with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> design, via an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).|$|E

40|$|Consistency of {{functional}} characteristics in wheat {{is a concern}} confronting buyers and sellers. This research analyzes the cost and risk of different procurement strategies for importers. A stochastic simulation model is {{used to determine the}} probability {{of functional}} characteristics being satisfied subject to quality targets and costs for alternative purchase strategies. Stochastic efficiency was employed to identify purchase strategies that dominate others and {{to determine the extent of}} preference. <b>As</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> characteristics are incorporated into a contract, results indicate that the probabilities of meeting end-use requirements increasebuying strategies, costs, functional characteristic tests, location, risks, simulation, stochastic efficiency, variety, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

50|$|In {{most of this}} article, {{the term}} monastery is used generically to refer to any {{of a number of}} types of {{religious}} community.

25|$|Although {{in general}} use, {{polymorphism}} {{is quite a}} broad term, in biology, it {{has been given a}} specific meaning, being distinguishable from monomorphism (having only one form). <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> term, when only two forms occur, is dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Hess (1888), the Court {{held that}} a mail fraud {{indictment}} was insufficient where it merely parroted {{the words of the}} statute. Rather, the Court required <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>specific</b> description of the scheme and the fraud.|$|E

25|$|Usually, if {{the enthusiasm}} of the novice {{increases}} over time, random coins found in circulation are not enough to satisfy their interest.
