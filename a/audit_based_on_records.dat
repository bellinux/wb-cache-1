40|$|Objective: To audit and {{categorize}} pathological lesions {{and conditions}} {{that occurred in}} the orofacial region among children aged up to 15 yrs. Setting: Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Moshi, Tanzania. Design: Retrospective cross-sectional <b>audit</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> archival <b>records</b> and material between 1985 to 2005. Results: Biopsy results were generated into 11 categories whence most common lesions encountered were in the categories of soft tissue benign neoplasms (35. 1 %) and soft tissue malignant neoplasms (21. 8 %). Remarkably, Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) in the category of malignant soft tissue neoplasia constituted 11. 8 % of all the lesions biopsied while haemangiomas and tuberculous adenitis comprised 8. 1 % and 3. 8 % respectively. The age groups revealed the highest burden (37. 1 %) among the 0 to 5 -year-olds followed by the 11 to 15 -(34. 5 %) and 6 to 10 -year-olds (28. 4 %). The orofacial site distribution among the 211 biopsied cases included 62. 1 % in the mandibular 29. 9 % in the maxillary region and 8 % in the tongue areas. Malignant neoplasms of the bone were rare and all were diagnosed in the mandible. Overall, malignant neoplasms of soft tissue were significantly more in the age group of 6 - 10 years as well as in males than females. On the other hand, significantly more benign soft tissue neoplasms occurred in females than in males. Main Outcome Measure: There is great diversity and preponderance of soft tissue than skeletal orofacial lesions on the present audit. Significantly, clinicians should maintain high index of suspicion regarding the remarkably high frequency of diagnosing BL and tuberculous lymphadenitis in such a population in this era of HIV infection/AIDS...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{comprehensive}} report on healthcare quality in Italy {{published by the}} Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommended that regular monitoring of quality of primary care by means of compliance with standards of care for chronic diseases is performed. A previous ecological study demonstrated that compliance with standards of care could be reliably estimated on regional level using administrative databases. This study compares estimates <b>based</b> <b>on</b> administrative data with estimates <b>based</b> <b>on</b> GP <b>records</b> for the same persons, to understand whether ecological fallacy {{played a role in}} the results of the previous study. We compared estimates of compliance with diagnostic and therapeutic standards of care for type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM), hypertension and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) from administrative data (IAD) with estimates from medical records (MR) for the same persons registered with 24 GP's in 2012. Data were linked at an individual level. 32, 688 persons entered the study, 12, 673 having at least one of the three diseases according to at least one data source. Patients not detected by IAD were many, for all three conditions: adding MR increased the number of cases of T 2 DM, hypertension, and IHD by + 40 %, + 42 %, and + 104 %, respectively. IAD had imperfect sensitivity in detecting population compliance with therapies (adding MR increased the estimate, from + 11. 5 % for statins to + 14. 7 % for antithrombotics), and, more substantially, with diagnostic recommendations (adding MR increased the estimate, from + 23. 7 % in glycated hemoglobin tests, to + 50. 5 % in electrocardiogram). Patients not detected by IAD were less compliant with respect to those that IAD correctly identified (from - 4. 8 percentage points in proportion of IHD patients compliant with a yearly glycated hemoglobin test, to - 40. 1 points in the proportion of T 2 DM patients compliant with the same recommendation). IAD overestimated indicators of compliance with therapeutic standards (significant differences ranged from 3. 3. to 3. 6 percentage points) and underestimated indicators of compliance with diagnostic standards (significant differences ranged from - 2. 3 to - 14. 1 percentage points). IAD overestimated the percentage of patients compliant with therapeutic standards by less than 6 percentage points, and underestimated the percentage of patients compliant with diagnostic standards by a maximum of 14 percentage points. Therefore, both discussions at local level between GP's and local health unit managers and discussions at central level between national and regional policy makers can be informed by indicators of compliance estimated by IAD, which, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> those results, have the ability of signalling critical or excellent clusters. However, this study found that estimates are partly flawed, because a high number of patients with chronic diseases are not detected by IAD, patients detected are not representative of the whole population of patients, and some categories of diagnostic tests are markedly underrecorded in IAD (up to 50 % in the case of electrocardiograms). Those results call to caution when interpreting IAD estimates. <b>Audits</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> medical <b>records,</b> <b>on</b> the local level, and an interpretation taking into account information external to IAD, on the central level, are needed to assess a more comprehensive compliance with standard...|$|R
