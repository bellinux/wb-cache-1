25|$|In September 1995 {{in southwestern}} Washington State, a low–flying LongRanger was downed by a metal arrow {{launched}} by an irate deer hunter. The arrow pierced a rotor blade, bending the blade. The <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> tore the tailfin and boom {{as it was}} being chopped up by the spinning rotor. The helicopter was still flyable, but the pilot made a precautionary landing to assess the damage.|$|E
25|$|Blunts are unsharpened arrowheads {{occasionally}} {{used for}} types of target shooting, for shooting at stumps or other targets of opportunity, or hunting small game when {{the goal is}} to stun the target without penetration. Blunts are commonly made of metal or hard rubber. They may stun, and occasionally, the <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> may penetrate the head and the target; safety is still important with blunt arrows.|$|E
25|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a socketed tang, or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, sinew, or wire.|$|E
50|$|The Nydam <b>arrow</b> <b>shafts</b> (DR MS1995;344 and DR AUD1994;266) are two <b>arrow</b> <b>shafts</b> {{discovered}} in Nydam Mose, South Jutland, Denmark that bear the inscriptions la and lua respectively. They {{have both been}} interpreted as alu, {{but it is not}} certain. The <b>arrow</b> <b>shafts</b> are dated to around 300 to 350 CE. Today they are housed at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen.|$|R

25|$|The {{weight of}} an <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> can be {{expressed}} in GPI (Grains Per Inch). The length of a shaft in inches multiplied by its GPI rating gives {{the weight of the}} shaft in grains. For example, a shaft that is 30 inches long and has a GPI of 9.5 weighs 285 grains, or about 18 grams. This does not include the other elements of a finished arrow, so a complete arrow will be heavier than the shaft alone.|$|E
25|$|Recent DNA {{analyses}} {{claim they}} revealed traces of blood {{from at least}} four other people on his gear: one from his knife, two from the same arrowhead, and a fourth from his coat. Interpretations of these findings were that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow, {{and was able to}} retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood on his coat was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back. Ötzi's posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a theory that before death occurred and rigor mortis set in, the Iceman was turned onto his stomach in the effort to remove the <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|The basic costume of the Mongol {{fighting}} man {{consisted of}} a heavy coat fastened at the waist by a leather belt. From the belt would hang his sword, dagger, and possibly an axe. This long robe-like coat would double over, left breast over right, and be secured with a button a few inches below the right armpit. The coat was lined with fur. Underneath the coat, a shirt-like undergarment with long, wide sleeves was commonly worn. Silk and metallic thread were increasingly used. The Mongols wore protective heavy silk undershirts. Even if an arrow pierced their mail or leather outer garment, the silk from the undershirt would stretch to wrap itself around the arrow as it entered the body, reducing damage caused by the <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft,</b> and making removal of the arrow easier.|$|E

2500|$|A flu-flu {{is a form}} of fletching, {{normally}} made {{by using}} long sections of full length feathers taken from a turkey, in most cases six or more sections are used rather than the traditional three. Alternatively two long feathers can be spiraled around the end of the <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft.</b> The extra fletching generates more drag and slows the arrow down rapidly after a short distance, about 30 m or so [...]|$|E

5000|$|The {{perishable}} artifacts {{found at}} Sisyphus Shelter {{consisted of a}} fragment of basketry and an <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> with a nock.

The archaeologists were unable to determine the material the <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> fragment was composed of, however, a reinforced collar around the nock {{was found to be}} made of yucca. The basketry fragment was also composed of yucca.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic spine {{is largely}} {{determined}} by shaft length, head weight, and static spine. Static spine is the stiffness {{of the center}} portion of the shaft under static conditions. The Archery Trade Association (ATA) (formerly the Archery Manufacturers and Merchants Organization (AMO)) static spine test method hangs a 2 lb weight {{from the center of}} a 26 in suspended section of the <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft.</b> The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F2031-05 ("Standard Test Method for Measurement of <b>Arrow</b> <b>Shaft</b> Static Spine (Stiffness)") hangs an 880 g weight from the center of a 28 in suspended section of the <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft.</b> The (obsolete) British Grand National Archery Society (GNAS) system used a 1.5 lb weight and a variable length with the arrow supported just behind the head and {{just in front of the}} nock. Because of this, GNAS cannot be directly converted to ATA or ASTM.|$|E

50|$|An <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> {{smoother}} made of red sandstone {{was discovered}} during the excavation of area II in 1981. The object is engraved (see below) and measures 71 × 34 × 22mm. Both {{in terms of}} function and artistic expression, the arrow smoother {{is one of the}} most superb finds from Niederbieber. <b>Arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> smoothers are characteristic tool types of the Federmesser culture. They were used in pairs and also serve as indirect evidence for the increasing reliance on bow and arrow. In the case of Niederbieber, the presence of the arrow smoother indicates manufacture or repair of hunting weapons.|$|E
50|$|Unlike a {{conventional}} arrowhead which tapers to a point, the transverse arrowhead usually widens to {{a cutting edge}} and was hafted onto an <b>arrow</b> <b>shaft</b> at its narrowest point.

25|$|The shaft is {{the primary}} {{structural}} element of the arrow, to which the other components are attached. Traditional <b>arrow</b> <b>shafts</b> are made from lightweight wood, bamboo or reeds, while modern shafts may be made from aluminium, carbon fibre reinforced plastic, {{or a combination of}} materials. Such shafts are typically made from an aluminium core wrapped with a carbon fibre outer.|$|R
50|$|Cyanoacrylate {{is used in}} archery to glue {{fletching}} to arrow shafts. Some special fletching glues {{are primarily}} cyanoacrylate repackaged in special fletching glue kits.

50|$|The wood is brown, hard, close-grained, and heavy. The {{heartwood}} is reddish-brown, and the sapwood {{is lighter}} in color. It {{can be used}} for tool handles and fishing rods.

50|$|The {{plant is}} not cultivated. Some Native Americans in its limited range learned {{traditional}} ways of using it: the Cahuilla prepared the drupe as a delicacy. The wild almonds were considered a delicacy by Native Americans.
