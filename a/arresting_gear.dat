5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified <b>arresting</b> <b>gear.</b> The wires of the <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush {{with the rest of the}} flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E
5|$|Akagi {{was reduced}} to second-class reserve status on 1 December 1931 in {{preparation}} for a short refit in which her <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> was replaced and her radio and ventilation systems were overhauled and improved. After completion of the refit, Akagi became a first-class reserve ship in December 1932. On 25 April 1933, she resumed active service and joined the Second Carrier Division and participated in that year's Special Fleet Maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 {{the concept}} of a piston being pulled through a tube of water was first purposed as a cheap <b>arrest</b> <b>gear</b> system for land airbases. In the early 1960s, the British took this basic concept and {{developed}} a spray-type <b>arrest</b> <b>gear</b> system for both land and sea use. The engine had hydraulic cylinders that moved through water filled pipe, with a smaller pipe alongside that has holes of various size along its length. The Royal Navy claimed that there was no theoretical weight limit, but there was a speed limit.|$|R
50|$|All {{engineering}} of {{the aircraft}} carriers like catapults, <b>arresting</b> <b>gears</b> and so on were tested and developed at the Erprobungsstelle See Travemünde (Experimental Place Sea in Travemünde) including the airplanes for the aircraft carriers, the Fieseler Fi 167 ship-borne biplane torpedo and reconnaissance bomber and the navalized versions of two key early war Luftwaffe aircraft: the Messerschmitt Bf 109T fighter and Junkers Ju 87C Stuka dive bomber.|$|R
2500|$|As completed, Vikramaditya has {{a larger}} full load {{displacement}} {{than when the}} ship was originally launched in 1982 as Baku. 1,750 out of 2,500 compartments of the ship were re-fabricated, and extensive re-cabling was done to support new radars and sensors. The elevators were upgraded, and two restraining stands were fitted, allowing combat aircraft to reach full power before making a ski jump-assisted short take-off. Three <b>arresting</b> <b>gears</b> were fitted on the aft part of the angled deck, and navigation and carrier-landing aids were added to support fixed-wing [...] "short take-off but arrested recovery" [...] (STOBAR) operations.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ended up}} being used primarily to develop <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> and barriers, but were used operationally {{for a short time}} by at least one Texas-based United States Naval Reserve squadron as they transitioned to jets. Between them, the 30 production aircraft had only a total of 945 hours of flight time, only 31.5 hours each. Some aircraft flew only six hours which was enough for little more than their acceptance flight and the flight to their ultimate disposition.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{had entered}} refit to {{accommodate}} the Phantom in 1967; this involved a major reconstruction, including several elements to allow the ship to operate the aircraft – the flight deck was increased in area and fully angled to 8½°, the <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> was replaced with a new water-spray system {{to accommodate the}} Phantom's higher weight and landing speed, and bridle catchers and water-cooled JBDs were fitted to the catapults. Once this work was complete, Eagle was scheduled to undergo a similar modernization. In 1969, the planned refit of Eagle was cancelled, and the options for seven additional FG.1s was not taken up. As a consequence, {{it was decided to}} further reduce the FAA's Phantom fleet to just 28 aircraft. The remaining 20 aircraft were then allocated to the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Furious was recommissioned in May 1932 {{as part of}} the Home Fleet with {{a reduced}} crew before being brought up to full {{complement}} in November. Transverse <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet from May to October 1934. Furious was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the Munich Crisis in September 1938, she embarked Nos. 801, 821 and 822 Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow, before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.|$|E

40|$|Cardiac arrest is a {{condition}} in which the heart abruptly ceases to beat and stops supplying blood to the tissues and vital organs of the body. In order to survive cardiac arrest with good neurological function there must be immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, advanced cardiac life support, and quintessential post-cardiac arrest care. However, much emphasis and attention has been given to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced cardiac life support with little consideration to post-cardiac arrest care. Unfortunately, even amidst all the interventions, hypoxic brain injury has been shown by various studies to occur after cardiac arrest. Hypoxic brain degeneration is part of an umbrella of pathologic condition known as Post-cardiac Arrest Syndrome. This is a complex pathological process that comprises post-cardiac arrest brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, systemic ischemia, and persistent precipitating pathology. Many prominent research studies have revealed the pertinent role that post-cardiac arrest care plays in enhancing patient neurological prognosis. The primary focus of post-cardiac <b>arrest</b> intervention is <b>geared</b> toward improving possible cerebral edema, post-ischemic neurodegeneration and impaired cerebrovascular auto regulation. The thesis therefore strives to analyze the effectiveness of present modalities within the chain of survival and also to unveil novel improvements in this field of study, which comprise both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions...|$|R
5|$|Furious was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925 although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard Furious. In the 1920s, the ship commonly carried one flight of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart), each usually of six aircraft.|$|E

5|$|HMS Argus was a British {{aircraft}} carrier that {{served in the}} Royal Navy from 1918 to 1944. She was converted from an ocean liner that was under construction when the First World War began, {{and became the first}} example of what is now the standard pattern of {{aircraft carrier}}, with a full-length flight deck that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was heavily involved for several years {{in the development of the}} optimum design for other aircraft carriers. Argus also evaluated various types of <b>arresting</b> <b>gear,</b> general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert, and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s. She spent one brief deployment on the China Station in the late 1920s before being placed in reserve for budgetary reasons.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the {{operations}} of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded {{on the development of the}} steam catapult, <b>arresting</b> <b>gear,</b> optical and radio landing systems. The pilots were trained at a new establishment in Crimea, named NITKA, for Aviation Research and Training Complex. In 1981, the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143.5 carriers, which also included cancelling the fifth Project 1143 carrier and the Varyag. A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers. Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (−3, −24 and −25), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a ski-jump profile.|$|E
25|$|Both carrier- and {{land-based}} <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> {{consists of}} one or more cables (aka “arresting wires” or “cross deck pendants”) stretched across the landing area and attached on either end to <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> engines through “purchase cables”.|$|E
25|$|<b>Arresting</b> <b>gear</b> is not available.|$|E
25|$|The {{certification}} {{included a}} full {{evaluation of the}} <b>arresting</b> <b>gear,</b> steam catapults, and flight-deck personnel. Reagans air department was assessed {{on its ability to}} maintain a fully operational flight deck and respond to simulated mishaps.|$|E
25|$|As {{the ships}} were {{designed}} with the repair and transportation of aircraft in mind, {{much of the}} equipment required for carrier flight operations, including control facilities, <b>arresting</b> <b>gear,</b> and catapult, were not installed. This space was instead used for additional hangar room, repair and maintenance workshops, and system testing facilities.|$|E
25|$|The major {{modifications}} were to allow Admiral Gorshkov {{to operate as}} a STOBAR aircraft carrier in Indian service, {{as opposed to the}} STOVL configuration the ship was built as. This involved removal of all the armament, including the P-500 Bazalt cruise missile launchers and the four Antey Kinzhal surface-to-air missile bins fitted on ship's bow, {{to make way for a}} 14.3°, full-width ski-jump. The 20-ton capacity aircraft lift beside the ship's island superstructure was unchanged, but the aft lift was enlarged and its lift capacity increased to 30 tons. For STOBAR operations, three 30m arrestor wires and three restraining gears on the stern of the angled deck were fitted. Sponsons were installed to increase the area of the flight deck, to allow the ski-jump to be fitted, for strengthening of <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> and runway area, and to lengthen the after end, which allowed an increase to the length of the landing strip aft of the <b>arresting</b> <b>gear.</b> 234 new hull sections were installed to achieve the desired shape, and the total steel added to carry out these modifications amounted to 2500 tons.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, {{the annual}} Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT) report {{recorded}} that critical ship systems in lab and test environments (including the EMALS, Advanced <b>Arresting</b> <b>Gear</b> (AAG), Dual Band Radar, and weapons elevators) were not reliable enough and needed more testing and improvements. Radar and weapons elevator test data were also below expectations. The Navy implemented a rigorous testing program to ensure performance issues would be resolved before the systems were {{installed on the}} aircraft carrier.|$|E
25|$|After Vengeance was {{returned}} from her loan to Australia, she {{was sold to}} the Brazilian Navy on 14 December 1956. From mid-1957 until December 1960, the carrier underwent a massive refit and reconstruction at Verolme Dock in Rotterdam; the work performed included the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck and a steam catapult, strengthening of <b>arresting</b> <b>gear,</b> and reinforcing of the hangar elevators. The carrier was commissioned into the Marinha do Brasil (MB, Brazilian Navy) as Minas Gerais on 6 December 1960.|$|E
25|$|In October 1916, Commodore Murray Sueter, the Air Department's Superintendent of Aircraft Construction, {{solicited}} Sopwith for a single-seat aircraft {{capable of}} carrying a 1,000lb torpedo and sufficient fuel to provide an endurance of four hours. The resulting aircraft, designated T.1 by Sopwith, was a large, three-bay biplane. Because the T.1 was designed to operate from carrier decks, its wings were hinged to fold backwards. The T.1 could take off from a carrier deck in four seconds, {{but it was not}} capable of making a carrier landing and no <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> was fitted. A split-axle undercarriage allowed the aircraft to carry a 1,000lb Mk. IX torpedo beneath the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Sixteen Light Fleet {{carriers}} were ordered, and {{all were}} laid down to the Colossus class design during 1942 and 1943. However, only eight were completed to this design; of these, four entered service {{before the end of}} the war, and none saw front line operations. Two more were fitted with maintenance and repair facilities instead of aircraft catapults and <b>arresting</b> <b>gear,</b> and entered service as aircraft maintenance carriers. The final six were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were redesignated the Majestic class. The construction of the six ships was suspended at the end of the war. Five were eventually completed with the last commissioning in 1961; however, the sixth, Leviathan, was dismantled for spare parts and scrap.|$|E
25|$|Speculation {{mounted in}} 2009 that the UK {{government}} would switch from the F-35B to the F-35C model, with its greater range and payload. The UK would require fewer F-35Cs and save about $25 million for each aircraft ordered. In October 2010, press reports {{suggested that the}} Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government were considering reducing the order for the F-35 from 138 to a currently unspecified but lower number as of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. This was confirmed by a MoD spokeswoman in 2012. The proposed cuts would also close RAF Lossiemouth, chosen as the main operating base for the F-35. On 19 October 2010 Prime Minister David Cameron announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review that the UK would procure an unspecified number of F-35Cs, to fly from a Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier, instead of the F-35B. This change would require the aircraft carrier to be equipped with catapults and <b>arresting</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shangri-La recommissioned on 10 May 1951, Captain Francis L. Busey in command. For {{the next}} year, she {{conducted}} training and readiness operations out of Boston, Massachusetts. Reclassified {{as an attack}} carrier (CVA-38) in 1952, she returned to Puget Sound that fall and decommissioned again on 14 November, this time for modernization at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. During the next two years, she received an angled flight deck, twin steam catapults, and her aircraft elevators and <b>arresting</b> <b>gear</b> were overhauled. At a cost of approximately $7 million, she was virtually a new ship when she commissioned {{for the third time}} on 10 January 1955, Captain Roscoe L. Newman commanding; she was the second (after CV-A 36 Antietam)operational US carrier with an angled flight deck. She conducted intensive fleet training for the remainder of 1955, then deployed to the Far East on 5 January 1956. Until 1960, she alternated western Pacific cruises with operations out of San Diego. On 16 March 1960, she put to sea from San Diego en route to her new home port, Mayport, Florida. She entered Mayport after visits to Callao, Peru; Valparaíso, Chile; Port of Spain, Trinidad; Bayonne, New Jersey; and Norfolk, Virginia.|$|E
