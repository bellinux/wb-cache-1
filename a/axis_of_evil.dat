5|$|In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush {{referred}} to an <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, {{in which the}} United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as {{being part of the}} War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E

Bush's claim that Iran, Iraq and North Korea formed an [...] "axis of evil." [...] In an article titled [...] "Axis <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> or <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> resistance," [...] the paper wrote in 2002 that [...] "the only common denominator among Iran, Iraq and North Korea is their resistance to US hegemony." [...] The Iranian newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami subsequently adopted the language in reference to the Shia insurgency in Iraq, writing in 2004 that [...] "if the line of Iraq's Shi'is needs to be linked, united and consolidated, this unity should be realized on the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> resistance and struggle against the occupiers." ...|$|R

25|$|In January 2002 U.S. President George W. Bush labeled North Korea in {{his first}} State of the Union Address {{as part of an}} <b>Axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evil.</b> In October 2006 North Korea {{conducted}} its first nuclear weapons test. On May 27, 2009, North Korea announced it no longer felt bound by the armistice agreement. There were two isolated violent incidents in 2010, the ROKS Cheonan sinking (attributed to North Korea, despite denials) and the North Korean Bombardment of Yeonpyeong.|$|E
25|$|Some in the Republican Party support unilateralism {{on issues}} of {{national}} security, believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of neorealism and realism, characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure, {{as opposed to being}} the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's Evil Empire stance on the Soviet Union and George W. Bush's <b>Axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> stance.|$|E
500|$|The group {{began work}} in January 1998 and issued their {{unanimous}} final report on July 15, 1998, within the six-month mandate. The report warned {{of a growing}} threat of ballistic missiles and the inability for US intelligence {{to keep track of}} developments. [...] This contrasted with the views of previous US intelligence estimates, which stated that the threat of ballistic missiles was still 10 to 20 years away. The commission further fueled the debate over a national missile defense system, and {{may have contributed to the}} coining of the phrase <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E

50|$|Responses to {{the problem}} <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> have {{occasionally}} been classified as defences or theodicies; however, authors disagree on the exact definitions. Generally, a defense against the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> may refer to attempts to defuse the logical problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> by showing {{that there is no}} logical incompatibility between the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> and the existence of God. This task does not require the identification of a plausible explanation <b>of</b> <b>evil,</b> and is successful if the explanation provided shows that the existence of God and the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> are logically compatible. It need not even be true, since a false though coherent explanation would be sufficient to show logical compatibility.|$|R

500|$|The {{disqualification}} upset South Korean supporters, {{many of whom}} directed {{their anger}} at Ohno and the International Olympic Committee. A large number of e-mails protesting the race results crashed the Olympic Committee's email server, and thousands of accusatory letters, many of which contained death threats, were sent to Ohno and the committee. Ohno shared his thoughts on the Koreans' hostile reaction by saying, [...] "I was really bothered by it. I grew up around many Asian cultures, Korean one of them. A lot {{of my best friends}} were Korean growing up. I just didn't understand. Later on I realized that was built up by certain people and that was directed at me, negative energy from other things, not even resulting around the sport, but around politics, using me to stand on the pedestal as the anti-American sentiment". Earlier the same year, President George Bush had named North Korea as one of three members of the <b>Axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evil,</b> which had upset some South Koreans; directing their anger at Ohno was a less direct way of voicing anger against Bush's decision. The controversy continued at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held jointly in South Korea and Japan several months after the Olympics. When the South Korean football (soccer) team scored a goal against the U.S. team, Korean players Ahn Jung-Hwan and Lee Chun-Soo made an exaggerated move imitating the move Ohno had made during the speed skating event to indicate the other athlete had drifted into his lane.|$|E

Benjamin supported banning partial-birth abortion, except for cases where the mother's life is at risk, and abolishing unfunded Medicaid mandates on municipalities.

50|$|According to Jon Levenson, {{the writers}} of Hebrew Bible were well aware <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> as a {{theological}} problem, {{but he does not}} claim awareness of the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> In contrast, according to Yair Hoffman, the ancient books of the Hebrew Bible do not show an awareness of the theological problem <b>of</b> <b>evil,</b> and even most later biblical scholars did not touch the question of the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> The earliest awareness of the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> in Judaism tradition is evidenced in extra- and post-biblical sources such as early Apocrypha (secret texts by unknown authors, which were not considered mainstream at the time they were written). The first systematic reflections on the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> by Jewish philosophers is traceable only in the medieval period.|$|R

The belief that God exists and is omniscient) omnipotent, and omnibenevolent has been claimed to be inconsistent with the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> Though philosophical theists have provided successful defenses against the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil,</b> few if any, have given an adequate explanation of the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> that is considered plausible on a specific belief system. In this thesis I explore the contributions that Christian theism makes toward resolving the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> I divide the problem into four areas and argue that the origin <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> must be addressed if an adequate response to the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> is to be identified. I also argue that since the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> is to be expected on a traditional Christian belief system, inductive arguments that claim the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> makes it improbable that the Christian God exists fail...|$|R
