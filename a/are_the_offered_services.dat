40|$|In recent years, an {{important}} {{increase in the}} amount and impact of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) threats has <b>been</b> reported by <b>the</b> different information security organizations. They typically target the depletion of the computational resources of the victims, hence drastically harming their operational capabilities.

Therefore, the most common EDoS approach <b>is</b> making <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> <b>services</b> unsustainable by exploiting their auto-scaling algorithms.

40|$|AbstractQuantity {{surveying}} is {{global and}} provides services across various industries. Quantity surveyors {{are involved in}} all phases of a facility's lifecycle such as feasibility, design, construction, extension, refurbishment, maintenance, and demolition. The competencies of quantity surveyors are aimed at producing constructions that meet the client's value system. Building engineering services are part of buildings, but quantity surveyors’ involvements in procurement are limited. Therefore, this study examines the kinds of services that quantity surveyors play in the procurement of building services. Primary data is collected through a survey questionnaire. The results of the findings led {{to the conclusion that}} quantity surveyors were actively involved in the procurement of building services. Cost advice during construction <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most <b>offered</b> <b>service</b> while advice on the impact of building engineering services on environment is seldom offered. However, most of <b>the</b> services <b>are</b> still at <b>the</b> downstream side in the supply chain.

The results of <b>the</b> study <b>are</b> useful to quantity surveyors, service engineering consultants, academic institutions and other stakeholders in the construction industry...|$|R
