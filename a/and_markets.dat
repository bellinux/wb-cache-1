Previous research proposes that organisational structure and/or location may be influential in creating greater collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} high performing organisations may structure their sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> functions as single departments. This study tests both these propositions through a survey of managing directors and CEOs of large UK organisations. The results indicate that there is no relationship between structure or location of sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Further, high performing organisations structure their sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> functions both as separate departments and as single departments...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} antecedents and {{consequences}} of collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> The results suggest that collaborative sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> functions have benefits for the organisation in terms of improved business performance. In addition, improvements in collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> will positively affect <b>marketing</b> orientation <b>and</b> leading to superior marketing quality. The research began with {{an exploration of the}} interface between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> through the available literature. The existing research conceptualises the relationship between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> highlights the benefits of interfunctional collaborative behaviour. Therefore, a study was designed to not only identify the antecedents of collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> so that the relationship between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> can be assessed and improved to the benefit of the organisation, but also to establish that business performance can be directly influenced by improvements in collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> The research was undertaken through a mixed methodology, utilising exploratory case studies, a large-scale quantitative survey and confirmatory interviews. The data analysis involved four distinct analytical methods: within-case analysis, crosscase analysis, statistical analysis and confirmatory interviews. The large-scale survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was sent to the Managing Directors/Chief Executives of large, UK-based organisations operating in the business-to-business arena. Through the findings from the survey five antecedents to collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> were identified - management attitudes towards co-ordination, conflict of interests, communications, <b>market</b> intelligence <b>and</b> organisational learning - and a revised conceptual framework was developed. The correlation and multiple regression analysis confirmed the weighting of each of the independent variables upon collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> established a number of other relationships between the variables. The second part of the research focused on the consequences of improved collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> It was found through the survey that collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> may have a positive effect upon business performance. The research also established that marketing orientation was not an antecedent to collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> but that collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> may have a positive influence on marketing orientation. In addition, it was established that collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> has a positive effect on business performance. This research identifies some of the antecedents of collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> clarifies the benefits of collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> to the organisation.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> {{interface}} <b>and</b> to identify some of the elements that may influence collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>and</b> provide a framework demonstrating how these elements may interrelate. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores the sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> relationship through qualitative research using one-to-one, tripartite interviews with senior executives <b>and</b> sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> managers of three, UK-based business-to-business organizations. Findings – The paper indicates that there are two types of factor that affect collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Those that are out of the control of sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> staff – management attitudes to coordination, interdepartmental culture and structure and orientation, and four that are internal to the interface – inter-functional conflict, communications, <b>market</b> intelligence <b>and</b> learning. The paper also identifies that senior managers play a critical role in influencing this interface. Research limitations/implications – Improving collaboration in the sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> interface should be a focus for senior managers. The paper is limited by the number of cases. Practical implications – The factors identified may be used by organizations to improve collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing.</b> Originality/value – The identification of factors that may improve collaboration between sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> <b>and</b> provide a conceptual framework for further study. The paper increases the understanding of the sales <b>and</b> <b>marketing</b> interface by identifying two additional factors that may influence the interface – learning <b>and</b> <b>market</b> intelligence, <b>and</b> demonstrates how the various factors may interrelate to create improved collaboration...|$|R

Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E
