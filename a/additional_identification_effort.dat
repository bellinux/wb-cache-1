The gene map for this region {{is far from being}} complete, however, strengthening the need for <b>additional</b> gene <b>identification</b> <b>efforts.</b> We describe the extension of an existing contig map with P 1 -derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) to cover 7. 5 Mb of 11 p 13 – 14. 1. The extended sequence-ready contig was established by end probe walking and fingerprinting and consists of 201 PAC clones. Utilizing bins defined by overlapping PACs, we generated a detailed gene map containing 20 genes as well as 22 anonymous ESTs which have been identified by searching the RH databases. RH maps and our established gene map show global correlation, but the limits of resolution of the current RH panels are evident at this scale. Initial expression studies on the novel genes have been performed by Northern blot analyses. To extend these expression profiles, corresponding mouse cDNA clones were identified by database search and employed for Northern blot analyses and RNA in situ hybridizations to mouse embryo sections. Genomic sequencing of clones along a minimal tiling path through the contig is currently under way and will facilitate these expression studies by in silico gene identification approaches...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{analysis}} by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry {{has been demonstrated}} in numerous laboratories, and a few {{attempts have been made}} to compare results from different laboratories on the same organism. It has been difficult to understand the causes behind the observed differences between laboratories when different instruments, matrices, solvents, etc. are used. In order to establish this technique as a useful tool for bacterial <b>identification,</b> <b>additional</b> <b>efforts</b> in standardizing the methods by which MALDI mass spectra are obtained and comparisons of spectra from different instruments with different operators are needed. Presented here is an extension of our previous single-laboratory reproducibility study with three different laboratories in a controlled experiment with aliquots of the same bacterial culture, matrix stock solution, and calibrant standards. Using automated spectral collection of whole-cell bacteria and automated data processing and analysis algorithms, fingerprints from three different laboratories were constructed and compared. Nine of the ions appeared reproducibly within all three laboratories, with additional unique ions observed within each of the laboratories. An initial evaluation of the ability to use a fingerprint generated within one laboratory for bacterial identification of a sample from another laboratory is presented, and strategies for improving identification rates between laboratories is discussed...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{analysis}} is increasingly {{used to identify}} the remains of victims of conflicts and disasters. This {{is especially true in}} cases where remains are badly damaged and fragmented, or where antemortem records are unavailable. Incidental findings (IFs) -that is, genetics-related information for which investigators were not looking-may result from these <b>identification</b> <b>efforts</b> employing DNA analysis. Because of the critical role played by family members of the missing in <b>identification</b> <b>efforts,</b> as well as the familial nature of DNA, identification initiatives employing DNA analysis are particularly prone to reveal IFs about familial relationships, such as misattributed paternity or false beliefs about sibling relationships. Despite forensic scientists 2 ̆ 7 widespread awareness of the possibility of generating IFs, to date there has been relatively little explicit guidance about their management. This paper fills that gap. It offers substantive guidance about the ethical management of IFs in this context. To ensure that the analysis addresses actual needs and practices in the field, one author (JDA) conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants from six regionally diverse organizations involved in post-conflict or post-disaster <b>identification</b> <b>efforts.</b> The paper first describes how methods of DNA analysis give rise to IFs. Next, it explains the importance of developing an ethically justified general policy for managing IFs and discusses features of DNA <b>identification</b> <b>efforts</b> that are relevant to such a policy. Then it presents an argument in support of a general policy of nondisclosure-specifically, that considerations of fair access to the individual and social benefits of <b>identification</b> <b>efforts,</b> and the concern to minimize and fairly distribute the risks of participation, support a policy of nondisclosure. It concludes by considering some implications of this argument for the choice among scientific practices involved in using DNA analysis to identify human remains, as well as for managing non-genetic incidental findings...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{dynamics}} {{and challenges of}} undertaking human identifications in states experiencing armed conflict or emerging therefrom. It emphasises the integral role of the State in human identifications {{and the need for}} the legal acts of the State in identifying an individual and confirming their death to be integrated into any humanitarian response to repatriating the dead. Conflict-related mass fatalities occur in uncontrolled circumstances, making DNA-based human identifications necessary. In states lacking the necessary forensic infrastructure, the promise of expedited human identifications through outsourcing DNA work can lead to the State abdicating the necessary jurisdiction and scientific transparency over DNA samples and their analysis. This raises important issues of consent, privacy and human rights. Furthermore, attempts to minimise initial delays in human identifications at the expense of building local knowledge, skills and necessary legal frameworks risks undermining the legitimacy of the human <b>identification</b> <b>effort.</b> Through analysis of the cases of Guatemala, the former Yugoslavia, and Libya, the authors conclude that human <b>identification</b> <b>efforts</b> cannot be separated from the need for a long-term integrated solution within a transitional justice context in which accountability and the right to the truth are addressed as part of a political solution...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to infer PrP {{genotype}} probabilities and derived statistics in sheep in provide additional information for selection against susceptibility to classical scrapie. The method was demonstrated with data from Jezersko-Solcava breed. Pedigree data consisted of 10429 animals of which 3669 animals had known PrP genotype and 2673 were alive and not genotyped. Five PrP alleles were present with the following frequencies: ARR 0. 174, AHQ 0. 074, ARH 0. 083, ARQ 0. 632, and VRQ 0. 037. Iterative allelic peeling with incomplete penetrace model as implemented in the GenoProb program was used to infer genotype probabilities. There were only some <b>additional</b> <b>identifications</b> of PrP genotype and NSP (national scrapie plan) type with high probability. The main reasons for a low number of <b>additional</b> <b>identifications</b> {{can be attributed to}} the large number of alleles with moderate frequencies, incomplete penetrace model, uniform prior, and inherent pedigree and genotype data structure. In order to overcome the limits of <b>additional</b> genotype <b>identifications</b> novel statistics were derived (maximal NSP type, average NSP value its variance and reliability) to facilitate practical implementation of seection for csrapie resistance based on NSP types. Maximal NSP type can be used to infer maximal potential scrapie susceptibility of individual animals as well as for the entire flocks. the average NSP value encompasses all information contained in PrP genotype probabilities and its the most useful dtatistic for the selection on NSP type and tehrefore PrP genotype. These novel statistics can be used as a criterion for the selection against scrapie susceptibility fot the whole population taking into the account possible errors in genotype and/or pedigree data...|$|R

40|$|Smallholder {{irrigation}} in Central Mozambique predominantly {{takes place}} in an informal setting. This renders these smallholders and their activities invisible for policy purposes. <b>Identification</b> <b>efforts</b> of smallholder irrigation {{as well as the}} potential for new irrigation development are often the basis for policy setting. But the potential is often approached technocratically: the technical availability of water and land with the assumption that smallholder irrigation is not happening and should be developed. Although more and more effort is done to include social economical aspects into the identification as well, it remains a GIS exercise, based on incomplete data using large pixel sizes, analyzing countries or continents as a whole. This study describes and presents the methodology and the results of an irrigation potential identification exercise carried out in two studies in Central Mozambique. Apart from describing the identification methods used, this study highlights the extent of farmer-led irrigation development, its drivers and the potential for farmer-led smallholder irrigation development. This study demonstrates the prolific nature of smallholder irrigation, arguing for the recognition that smallholder farmers are already developing irrigation and that this should lead to changing the focus of <b>identification</b> <b>efforts</b> towards the drivers behind farmer-led irrigation development. Using these context-specific drivers to define the potential for new irrigation development should result in a better response in policy to both the technical and socio-economical potential of smallholder irrigation development...|$|R
