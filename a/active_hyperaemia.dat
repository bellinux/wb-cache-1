50|$|Functional hyperaemia, {{metabolic}} hyperemia, arterial hyperemia or <b>active</b> <b>hyperaemia,</b> is {{the increased}} blood flow {{that occurs when}} tissue is active.|$|E
50|$|It {{is widely}} thought that <b>active</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> is {{mediated}} by the increased synthesis and/or release of vasodilatory agents during periods of heightened cellular metabolism. The increase in cellular metabolism causes the increase in vasoactive metabolic byproducts. Some of the putative vasodilatory agents (associated with metabolism) include, {{but are not limited}} to: Carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen ion (H+), potassium (K+), adenosine (ADO), nitric oxide (NO)). These vasodilators released from the tissue act on local arterioles causing vasodilation, this causes a decrease in vascular resistance and allows an increase in blood flow to be directed toward the capillary bed of the active tissue. Consequently allowing blood flow to meet and match the metabolic demand of the tissue and prevents a mismatch between O2-demand O2-supply. Recent research has suggested that the locally produced vasodilators may be acting in a redundant manner, in which the antagonism of one dilator, be it pharmacologically or pathologically, may be compensated for by another in order to preserve blood flow to tissue. While the locus of blood flow control (at least in skeletal muscle tissue) is widely thought to reside {{at the level of the}} arteriole, research has begun to suggest that capillary endothelial cells may be coordinators of skeletal muscle blood flow during functional hyperaemia. It is thought that vasodilators (released from active muscle fibers) can stimulate a local capillary endothelial cells which, in turn, causes the conduction of a vasodilatory signal to upstream arterioles, this then elicits arteriolar vasodilation consequently, creating a pathway of least resistance so blood flow can be precisely direct to capillaries supplying the metabolically active tissue.|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{recombinant}} tumour necrosis factor (TNF) on {{functional and}} structural vascular volumes in solid murine Meth A tumours were investigated by injection of Hoechst 33342 and staining for the vascular basement membrane component laminin, respectively. Systemic injection of 3 x 10 (4) U TNF caused an initial increase in functional volume in the tumour, but a strong decrease from 1 to 48 h after treatment. Early effects of intralesional treatment were more moderate. Systemic injection of 10 (4) U TNF or 0. 3 or 3 micrograms lipid A caused a fall in functional volume at 4 h, but a recovery was seen at 24 h. This recovery {{did not occur}} after treatment {{with a combination of}} 10 (4) U TNF and 0. 3 micrograms lipid A. Structural vascular volume was not markedly reduced until 24 h after treatment with the high doses of the separate agents and the combination. All effects appeared generally more prominent in the tumour centre than in the borders. Data suggest that TNF induces initially an <b>active</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> that rapidly converts to passive hyperaemia. A prolonged disturbance of tumour blood supply is probably necessary for therapeutic activity. Breakdown of laminin in the vascular basement membrane may be a cause of loss of vascular integrity...|$|E
40|$|Ischaemic {{contraction}} of skeletal muscle increases the venous concentration of adenosine. The present investigation was undertaken to determine changes in blood flow {{and the release}} of adenosine into venous blood resulting from 5 min of free flow contractions of the isolated gracilis muscle in dogs anaesthetised with pentobarbitone sodium (42 mg · kg- 1) and artificially ventilated. Arterial and venous concentrations of adenosine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Five-minute-contractions (induced electrically, 6 V, 1. 8 ms, 4 Hz) caused significant increases in blood flow (to 304 ± 33 % of control; mean ± SEM, n = 9) and venous plasma adenosine concentration (from 126 ± 18 nM to 293 ± 76 nM, equivalent to an average increase in release of 7. 28 ± 1. 89 nmol · min- 1 100 g- 1 we weight of muscle). The venous oxygen tension decreased from 8. 33 ± 0. 48 to 3. 39 ± 0. 31 kPa (62. 5 ± 3. 6 to 25. 4 ± 2. 3 mm Hg). This small but significant increase in venous adenosine concentration within the vasoactive range, {{in the face of a}} concomitant increase in blood flow, suggests that an increase in the interstitial adenosine concentration during free-flow exercise may contribute to the total dilatation of the resistance vessels to increase blood flow and keep its own concentration low. A significant correlation between venous adenosine concentration and vascular conductance is therefore absent. The results suggest that adenosine may contribute to sustained <b>active</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> in skeletal muscle. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: Frequently, the spleen may be {{targeted}} by <b>active</b> <b>hyperaemia,</b> or acute or active congestion, common in acute systemic infections {{and in some}} acute bacterial intoxications, and also by passive congestion, or chronic congestion, due to disturbances in the systemic and portal circulation and, most commonly, due {{to the use of}} barbiturate drugs. An acutely congested spleen is enlarged, moderately turgid and cyanotic, with the capsule blue-black. The normal architecture is not discernible on the cut surface and the pulp is red-black and exudes blood. Microscopically, the red pulp sinusoids are dilated filled with packed red cells, the germinal centres are widely separated and trabeculae are thinned. With chronic congestion, the spleen becomes firm, the capsule and trabeculae thickened; there is lymphoid atrophy, sinus proliferation, with a marked increase in fixed cells in the red pulp and heavy sinus colonization with macrophages and hemosiderin, following RBC destruction in dilated sinusoids. Extend of the acute congestion may make histological examination difficult. In some species there is still some difficulty on determine the severity of spleen congestion and rule out other conditions like primary neoplastic lesions, metastatic disease or manifestation of systemic involvement, due to it specific circulation system. Objectives: The authors present an illustrated system to evaluate splenic congestion, using the pig as a model. Methods: Samples of the spleen of Large White Pigs were fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin, for a maximum of 48 hours, embedded in paraffin wax, and 3 µm sections were stained for routine histopathological diagnosis with hematoxylin and eosine. All samples were examined by light microscopy, using a Microscope Zeiss Mod. Axioplan 2. Results: In this study, fourteen spleen samples from Large White pigs were observed and classified. The semi-quantitative parameter congestion was evaluated by two independent examiners and classified in a specific scale from 0 (minimal) to 3 (severe and extensive damage), from which exemplificative pictures will be presented, in order to better characterize the grading system used. Conclusion: Based on the description and pictures presented, the authors conclude {{that it was possible to}} clarify a classification grading system to evaluate splenic congestion, using the pig as a model, which can be used to evaluate splenic congestion in other domestic animals, as dogs and cats, which can be of great importance to characterize lesions in specific diseases and conditions.
