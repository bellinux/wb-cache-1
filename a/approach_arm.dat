40|$|Research {{suggests}} that {{states of the}} body, such as postures, facial expressions, and arm movements, play central roles in social information processing. This study investigated the effects of approach/avoidance movements on memory for facial information. Faces displaying a happy or a sad expression were presented and participants were induced to perform either an <b>approach</b> (<b>arm</b> flexion) or an avoidance (arm extension) movement. States of awareness associated with memory for facial identity and memory for facial expression were then assessed with the Remember/Know/Guess paradigm. The results showed that performing avoidance movements increased Know responses for the identity, and Know/Guess responses for the expression, of valence-compatible stimuli (i. e., sad faces as compared to happy faces), whereas {{this was not the}} case for approach movements. Based on these findings, it is suggested that approach/avoidance motor actions influence memory encoding by increasing the ease of processing for valence-compatible information. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A cluster {{analysis}} approach is employed to compare Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program observational data at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site with the corresponding output from an {{integration of the}} Community Climate System Model (CCSM 3) run under the IPCC SRES A 2 business as usual scenario for the current decade. A parallel clustering algorithm developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) designed for analyzing very large datasets was applied to obtain various atmospheric column regimes/states at the SGP site from the observations and, separately, from the CCSM 3 model results based on vertical temperature, humidity and wind speed tropospheric profiles and surface pressure. A three way process was implemented to compare ARM data with GCM output, where CCSM 3 output is projected on to ARM data derived regimes as a first <b>approach,</b> <b>ARM</b> data is projected onto CCSM 3 output derived regimes as a second approach, and finally regimes derived from a merged data pool of ARM data and CCSM 3 output are analyzed. The analysis reveals distinct singular regimes that exist in ARM observations and CCSM 3 output, which are not replicated in the other. These distinct regimes in CCSM 3 output and ARM observations suggest misrepresentation of atmospheric states in CCSM 3 over the SGP site. The comparisons also indicate that the inter-annual variability of CCSM 3 is comparatively lesser than that of ARM observations on the multi-variate basis with a strong seasonal locking of regimes in CCSM 3 not observed in ARM data. This study introduces {{cluster analysis}} as a superior technique, to compare observations and GCM on a multi-variate basis pro...|$|E
