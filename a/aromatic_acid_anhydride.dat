40|$|In this research, polyalkyd resins were {{prepared}} from palm oil by using polycondensation reaction. A two-step method viz., alcoholysis and esterification {{was conducted to}} synthesize polyalkyd resins. Prior to alcoholysis, crude palm oil was subjected for dehydration process to increase its unsaturation. Different types of catalysts such as, sulphuric acid, para-toluene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydrogen sulphate and potassium hydrogen sulphate {{were used for the}} dehydration. In alcoholysis process, the triglyceride-based dehydrated oil was reacted with glycerol to produce monoglyceride. The prepared monoglyceride was further brought into contact with acid anhydride to prepare polyalkyds. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the reaction parameters for esterification like reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst concentration, acid anhydride to mono-glyceride ratio and agitation speed. The optimum condition was used to prepare various types of polyalkyds by using different types of acid anhydrides such as, maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydrophthalic anhydride and cis- 1, 2 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride. A comparison was drawn among the resins prepared by using different types and percentages of acid anhydrides. The produced bioresins were characterized for physico-chemical properties such as, viscosity, density, iodine value, acid value, drying time, non-volatile materials content, specific gravity, colour, etc. The resins prepared with optimum reaction parameters were subjected for curing process by using methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and cobalt naphthanate. To enhance the resinous property, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were dispersed into the resin at different percentages of loading such as, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 wt. %. The loading was optimized based on the tensile strength of the film. Finally, in-situ polymerization with carbon nanotubes during esterification was performed by adding optimum percentage of loading. The films produced from different formulations were characterized by different testing such as, adhesion, chemical resistivity, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, contact-angle measurement, tensile testing, pencil hardness, gloss, etc. In addition, the curing kinetics of the resin was analysed to evaluate the kinetic parameters such as, reaction rate, activation energy and degree of conversion in terms of time and temperature. Result analyses through RSM revealed a desirability of 0. 985 for the reaction time of 88. 64 min. Moreover, 91. 5 % fractional conversion was achieved actually, which is close to the predicted value. Analysis revealed that 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydophthalic anhydride-based resin showed improved resinous property than others due to high degree of crosslinking. It was also found that higher amount of aliphatic acid anhydrides are responsible for high degree of crosslinking density, whereas higher thermal stability was ensured by the inclusion of <b>aromatic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride.</b> Finally, incorporation of MWCNTs into the alkyd resin enhanced the overall film properties, which was further improved through in-situ reaction. The physical bonding and mechanical entanglement were the possible reason for showing improved properties, as revealed from the analysis...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The synthesis, {{characterization}} {{and development}} {{of a new generation of}} fluoro-containing polyamideimide (PAI) polymers are described in this paper. The polymers are generally prepared by forming the polycondensation product of an aromatic diamine, a trifunctional <b>aromatic</b> <b>anhydride</b> <b>acid</b> chloride and an aromatic dianhydride containing trifluoromethyl moieties. These new materials possess high glass transition temperatures, useful mechanical properties and outstanding thermoplastic flow behavior which render them readily melt processable into fibers, films, sheets and other molded articles. The as-precipitated fluoro-containing PAI materials are soluble in many organic solvents and are thus amenable to solution casting techniques. They also show excellent resistance towards thermooxidative degradation at temperatures to 450 &deg;F and have low moisture uptake. In addition, compatible blends with polybenzimidazole (PBI) resin have yield synergistic effects on the mechanical properties of the resulting polymer. 1...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between exposure to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> {{and the risk of}} developing immediate skin prick test responses to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride</b> human serum albumin (AA-HSA) conjugates or work related respiratory symptoms; to assess whether these relations are modified by atopy or smoking. METHODS: A cohort of 506 workers exposed to phthalic (PA), maleic (MA), and trimellitic anhydride (TMA) was defined. Workers completed questionnaires relating to employment history, respiratory symptoms, and smoking habits. Skin prick tests were done with AA-HSA conjugates and common inhalant allergens. Exposure to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> was measured {{at the time of the}} survey and a retrospective exposure assessment was done. RESULTS: Information was obtained from 401 (79 %) workers. Thirty four (8. 8 %) had new work related respiratory symptoms that occurred for the first time while working with <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> and 12 (3. 2 %) were sensitised, with an immediate skin prick test reaction to AA-HSA conjugates. Sensitisation to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> was associated with work related respiratory symptoms and with smoking at the time of exposure to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride.</b> When all subjects were included and all three <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> were taken into account there was no consistent evidence for an exposure-response relation, but with the analysis restricted to a factory where only TMA was in use there was an increased prevalence of sensitisation to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> and work related respiratory symptoms with increasing full shift exposure. This relation was apparent within the current occupational exposure standard of 40 micrograms. m- 3 and was not modified significantly by smoking or atopy. CONCLUSIONS: Intensity of exposure and cigarette smoking may be risk factors for sensitisation to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides.</b> Exposure is also a risk factor for respiratory symptoms. As there was evidence for sensitisation to TMA at full shift exposures within the occupational exposure standard this standard should be reviewed...|$|R
