An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, <b>arms</b> <b>extended</b> as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E

2500|$|Avoid {{using the}} {{pectoral}} muscles, such as by pushing {{on the chair}} arms to assist one's self out of a chair, or by using the arms to assist in sitting down.

Also, avoid using the arms overhead.|$|E
