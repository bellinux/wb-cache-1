5|$|Broad-headed {{compared}} with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown with a black pattern <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> its thorax, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's tymbals and sac-like covers. Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. They emerge from the ground where they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear in great numbers in some years, yet are absent in others.|$|E
5|$|The brawl {{began with}} 45.9seconds {{remaining}} in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. The Pistons' Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by the Pacers' Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace), who slapped him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit. Wallace responded by shoving Artest {{in the face with}} both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.|$|E

25|$|I {{will never}} forget his arrival running <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the stage, and his catlike way of holding himself {{opposite}} the ramp. He wore a white sash over an ultramarine costume, had large wild eyes and hollow cheeks under a turban topped with a spray of feathers, bulging thighs, immaculate tights. This was already Nijinsky in Firebird.|$|E
500|$|Pettigrew had {{the head}} {{examined}} by a phrenologist. Examination was considered {{difficult because of}} the large fracture <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the head caused by the gunshot. His conclusions were consistent with contemporary European opinion of Indigenous Australians. Dale published these in a pamphlet entitled Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View [...] of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country, which Pettigrew encouraged his guests to buy as a souvenir of their evening. The frontispiece of the pamphlet was a hand-coloured aquatint print of Yagan's head by the artist George Cruikshank.|$|E

2500|$|The Hamar {{are known}} for their unique custom of [...] "bull jumping," [...] which initiates a boy into manhood. First, female {{relatives}} dance and invite whipping from men who have recently been initiated; this shows their support of the initiate, and their scars give them a right to demand his help in time of need. The boy must run back and forth twice <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> a row of bulls or castrated steers, and is ridiculed if he fails.|$|R

500|$|A month {{into the}} 2007–08 season, Bieksa {{suffered}} a severe calf laceration {{in a game}} against the Nashville Predators on November 1, 2007. After battling with forward Vernon Fiddler against the , Fiddler's skate slashed Bieksa <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his right calf. Bieksa was helped to the bench, leaving a trail of blood behind him on the ice. He ended up missing more than half the season with 47 games. Before returning to the line-up, he was assigned to the Moose for a one-game conditioning stint. Bieksa managed 12 points in 34 games.|$|E
500|$|Carr {{designed}} {{the house in}} Palladian style, even though by the 1760s this style was becoming less fashionable. [...] His design consisted of a rectangular building in three storeys, with a projecting portico on the south front, and two pavilions on each side, which were set back and approached by curved corridors. [...] On {{each side of the}} portico was a curved stairway leading to the main middle floor, the piano nobile. [...] As the house was originally planned, it had a central staircase, with three rooms on the south front. [...] The middle of these rooms was the entrance hall, to the west of it was the drawing room, and to the east was the dining room. [...] Behind the drawing room was the library, and behind the dining room was a room known as the common parlour. [...] <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the house, on this floor, there were two bedrooms and three dressing rooms. [...] The western pavilion contained the servants' bedrooms, and in the eastern pavilion was the kitchen. [...] The interior of the house contained craftsmanship of a high quality. [...] The plasterwork was created by Thomas Oliver of Warrington, the woodcarving of the doorcases and staircase was by Mathew Bertram, assisted by Daniel Shillito. [...] Much of the furniture was made by Gillow of Lancaster. [...] Sir Peter also commissioned a number of paintings, which included full-length portraits of himself and his wife by Francis Cotes, and landscapes of the grounds and the halls by J.M.W.Turner and Richard Wilson amongst others.|$|E

50|$|P. aurotaenia is one {{of three}} species known to be used for {{poisoning}} darts; the others being P. terribilis and P. bicolor. The Chocó Native Americans of the upper San Juan drainage region of Colombia attract and capture these species by imitating their calls. Because they release their poison only under stress, the poison is extracted by piercing the frogs through the mouth with a wooden skewer and holding them over a fire. The Chocóan people then coat their darts by rubbing <b>the</b> darts <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frogs.|$|R
60|$|Marston was wakened by a lurch that {{threw him}} off the chair, and getting up stiffly he noted the sharp slant of deck. Then he saw foam boil behind the lee rail and {{straining}} curves of canvas that kept their hollowness when the yacht rolled to windward. She trailed a snowy wake <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sparkling seas and her rigging hummed on a high, piercing note. The sky was blue, but the blue was dim and the sunshine had lost its dazzling glare. One felt a bracing quality in the breeze.|$|R

2500|$|In modern times, saris are {{increasingly}} woven on mechanical looms {{and made of}} artificial fibres, such as polyester, nylon, or rayon, which do not require starching or ironing. They are printed by machine, or woven in simple patterns made with floats <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the sari. This can create an elaborate appearance on the front, while looking ugly on the back. The punchra work is imitated with inexpensive machine-made tassel trim. Fashion designer Aaditya Sharma declared, [...] "I can drape a sari in 54 different styles".|$|E
2500|$|The 1997 race saw McLaren, through David Coulthard, break {{a drought}} of 50 races without a victory. The next {{year was a}} McLaren benefit, with Mika Häkkinen and Coulthard lapping the entire field {{en route to a}} {{dominant}} 1–2 finish. The result was clouded by controversy when Coulthard pulled over with two laps remaining to allow Häkkinen to win, honouring a pre-race agreement between the pair that whoever made it to the first corner in the lead on lap one would be allowed to win. Ferrari won its first Grand Prix in Melbourne in 1999, but it was not with team number one Michael Schumacher. Northern Irishman Eddie Irvine took his maiden victory after the all-conquering McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard retired before half-distance. Schumacher broke his Melbourne drought the following year when he headed a dominant Ferrari 1–2 with new teammate Rubens Barrichello. The 2001 event, won by Michael Schumacher, was marked by tragedy when 52-year-old volunteer marshal Graham Beveridge was killed after a high-speed accident involving Ralf Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve on lap five. Villeneuve's B.A.R rode up <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Schumacher's Williams and crashed into the fence, behind which Beveridge was standing; Beveridge was hit by a tyre that flew off of Villeneuve's car.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{dry suits}} have a {{watertight}} zipper for entry and exit. The original bronze-toothed version {{was developed by}} NASA to hold air inside space suits. This complex and special zipper {{is one of the}} most expensive parts of the suit. Heavy duty. medium and lightweight versions are made. A later design uses injection moulded plastic teeth, and these are lighter, more flexible and less costly. The zipper is commonly installed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the shoulders, since this placement compromises overall flexibility the least — but this design normally means the wearer requires assistance to close and open the zipper. The other common zipper placement is diagonally across the torso, which allows self-donning. Other designs place the zipper straight down the middle of the back (early Poseidon Unisuit), Up one side of the front, around the back of the neck and partway back down the front (later model Poseidon Unisuit) or on a wide tubular chest entry opening which is folded down and clipped round the waist after sealing the zip (some Typhoon suits). The waterproof-zipper is stiff, and cannot stretch at all, which can make it difficult for a user to get into and out of the suit. Dry suits may also be fitted with an extra waterproof [...] "fly", [...] "relief" [...] or [...] "convenience" [...] zipper to let the user urinate when out of the water when the suit is worn for long periods.|$|E
2500|$|Barnard later wrote, [...] "For a {{dying man}} {{it is not}} a {{difficult}} decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced {{you have a chance to}} swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E
