500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, I had had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E

[...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>books,</b> you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things. In that sense, it was a very honest look at a period of WWF history from a guy who had ups and downs... but survived a long time." ...|$|E

50|$|Since impressionism {{the modern}} art styles were {{reflected}} in graphic design and typography too. Since 1890 the Art nouveau became popular.

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} written {{extensively}} on the place of women within the novel, even though it focuses on men. In part this is because Barker's previous novels focus on working class women's history. In her companion to the novel, Karin Westman sees the novel as a response by Barker to critics stereotyping her as only being interested in writing about women. However, Baker has repeatedly talked about how this novel as connected with her earlier interests in feminism. Barker describes the novel as providing a voice for the home front, stating, that [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> about war by men the women are totally silenced. The men go off and fight and the women {{stay at home and}} cry; basically, this is the typical feature. And the women in the trilogy are always deeply significant, and whatever they say in whatever language they say it in, it is always meant to be listened to very carefully." [...] In particular, Barker is interested in the contradictions placed on women's expectations during war period, and its history; for example, she points out that the women in the munitions factories are expected to produce weapons to kill thousands, but a woman who attempts to abort her unborn child is criticised.|$|E
