40|$|Concrete as a {{conglomerate}} of sand, {{stone and}} a binder, {{is a very}} old material indeed. In the Roman period earth from Puozzoli, together with lime and water could bind the sand and the stones to form a conglomerate that has an affmity to our modem concrete. Later, in the more northem areas of Europe, the use of trass, plus water for a reaction, also produced cement. The Romans proved that they could build in a durable way with earth from Puozzoli, because even today we can still enjoy the <b>aquaducts</b> built all over Europe and the water reservoirs in Rome, which are still functioning. From building specifications for the Basilica of Constantine and the Pantheon, both in Rome, we know that cost could be reduced by using a mixture of stone fragments, Puzzuoli earth, lime and water for the inner parts of the walls.

40|$|Two century-old {{hospitals}} {{that are now}} part of UNESCO's world heritage and the recent trend concerning 'healing environments' inspire to take a short trip in history [...] . At 300 BC the Greek were already well aware of the role the environment could play in the healing process. The Romans perfected the Greek ideas further, providing buildings and cities with a sewage system, bathhouses and <b>aquaducts.</b> One century ago, spread across Europe, hospitals and sanatoria were built, taking into account the effects of hygiene, colour and lighting to the healing process of patients. In this presentation, best practices from one century ago (the 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau' in Barcelona (Spain) and the 'Sanatorium Zonnestraal' in Hilversum (Netherlands) and Paimio Hospital in Paimio (Finland)) are compared with the recent best practice at St. Charles Medical Centre in Redmond (Oregon, USA)). It will become clear that the knowledge how to make a health stimulating environment is there and is based on centuries of experience. 'Modern' is the attention that is paid to the 'mood' and 'behaviour' aspects of the healing environment. The role of the behaviour of staff and volunteers in putting the patient in a good mood and in stimulating healthy behaviour of the patient is an important aspect. Here lies a great challenge for facility management, a great chance to prove 'added value' as a 'healthy thinking' advisor...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the benthic diversity of River Gomti {{in relation to}} the prevailing environmental conditions, four stations, viz., Maa Chandrika Devi, Daliganj, Ambedkar Park and <b>Aquaduct,</b> were identified from upstream to downstream along the course of the river in Lucknow. Dissolved oxygen was low on many occasions at all the stations except Maa Chandrika Devi and chemical oxygen demand values were high. There was a gradual increase in mean nitrite and phosphate values from up to downstream. Benthic fauna was dominated by oligochaetes and chironomus larvae. Other groups reported were leeches, nematodes, sponges, crustaceans, pelycypodes, gastropods and fish fry. Population density was exceptionally high at Daliganj (20, 135 m sub(- 1)) followed by Ambedkar Park (5, 199 m sub(- 1)) and <b>Aquaduct</b> (3, 287 m sub(- 1)), and low at Maa Chandrika Devi (264 m sub(- 1)). Oligochaete genera common at all the four stations were Lumbricillus, Limnodrillus, Branchiura, Chaetogaster, Nais and Tubifex. Odonates were reported only from Maa Chandrika Devi while sponges were encountered at Daliganj and <b>Aquaduct.</b> On some occasions, fish fry were also found at Ambedkar Park and <b>Aquaduct.</b> Seasonally, maxima for population density were observed during pre-monsoon and minima during monsoon. The organic pollution indicator benthic species reported were tubificids, chironomids, culicoid larvae, Lamellidens sp., Corbicula sp., Lymnaea sp. and leech. Branchiurans, Tubifex sp. and Chironomus larvae were reported at all the stations. Filthy condition with foul smell throughout the length of the river coupled with poor water quality and appearance of indicator organisms at all the stations indicate that the river is under severe pollution stress due to anthropogenic discharges and it has reached an alarming stage...|$|E

40|$|After a brief {{review of}} the {{biological}} action and the role played by macro - and trace elements in diet and especially in drinking water, a systematic dose-sampling of some of these elemnts (Ca, Mg, Cr, Cd, Co, Cn, Zn, Pb, Ni and Mn) was carried out in 126 <b>aquaducts</b> and 30 springs in the Province of Macerata. The concentration of the trace elemnts considere proved greatly inferior to the limit-values indicated by OMS for drinking water and such as not to represent in any way a toxic risk for the users. As {{can be seen from the}} maps, the distribution of cobalt, nickel, chromium, manganese and cadmium show fairly homogeneous progress; greater variation emerged for copper, zinc, and lead, the values of which at distribution, compared with those determined at source, showed a constant significant increase (being elemnts that are more easily lost from the pipes). The contribution of oligoelemnts in drinking water in comparisono with the quntities ingested with foodstuffs represents a rather modest percentage (0. 1 % - 2. 3 %), but it must be emphasied that their presence in water in ionic form permits their almost complete absorption by the organism. The Authors, finally, underline the importance of the exact knowledge of the mineral contribution partcularly for possible correlations with chronic diseases: as far as thise is concerned, according to the Authors, more attention ought to be given to the quantitative relations between the elemnts, and therefore to the mineral imbalance, rather to the absolute concentrations of the individual trace elements...|$|R
40|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 21 st century, we are inheriting aworld that has seen {{unprecedented}} demographic, social, technological, and environmental changes during the last 100 years. These changes have had a great impact on all industries, including the construction industry. So far, the concrete construction industry has met the need for housing and infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner. We are now entering an era when the industry faces an additional challenge: how to build concrete structures that are environmentally more sustainable. Climate change resulting from the high concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has emerged as the most threatening environmental issue and, as discussed below, the construction indus-try happens {{to be a part of}} the problem. 1, 2 The primary greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide and, during the 20 th century, its concentration in the environ-ment has risen by 50 %. Carbon dioxide is a major by-product in the manufacturing of the two most important materials of construction: portland cement and steel. Therefore, the construction industry needs to determine how future infrastructural needs can be met without further increases in the production of cement and steel. Conservation of these materials through enhancing the durability of structures is one of the ways by which the construction industry can become a part of the solution to the problem of sustainable development. Some 2000 -year-old unreinforced concrete structures, such as the Pantheon in Rome and several <b>aquaducts</b> in Europe, made of slow-hardening, lime-pozzolan ce-ments, are in excellent condition, while the 20 th century reinforced concrete structures that are constructed with portland cement are quickly deteriorating. When exposed to corrosive environments like deicer salts and seawater, serious durability problems have occurred i...|$|R

40|$|Now {{there are}} many {{pipelines}} to deliver liquid-like water diversions in the world. Optimal route for pipeline transportation {{is a major concern}} for engineers, economists, and decision makers. Pipeline route selection is governed by many factors such as the shortest distance between supply and demand points, constructability, affordability, environmental impacts, and approachability. There are many methods developed for the pipeline route selection like Gestalt method, land suitability mapping techniques, geographic information systems (GIS), imaging technologies for pipeline mapping with the use of airborne lidar, etc. But these methods, though robust in translating physical constraints into feasible alternatives for route location, have their own pros and cons for applications, which are weak in incorporating the decision maker 2 ̆ 7 s preferences. This paper presents an easy approach to route selection with the goal of saving energy and having the shortest distance. The method in this paper makes an attempt to establish a method for the route with minimum energy required with the aid of mathematics computing and GIS or the data coming from Google Earth. This method is demonstrated here through two different case studies of pipe route selection, the Los Angeles <b>aquaduct,</b> the second Los Angeles <b>aquaduct</b> in USA, and water diversion from Palmer to Millbrook Reservoir in Australia.
