5|$|The {{review was}} carried out by the Assembly's Management Services Division, the Property Advisors to the Civil Estate and Symonds Group Ltd. They {{considered}} the following options, cancel the project, continue with the existing design, design a building on Site 1E, improve the existing debating chamber, construct <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one</b> in the courtyard of Crickhowell House, and relocate to Cardiff City Hall. On 21 June 2000 it was agreed that the original proposal using the RRP design should proceed.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} by first {{introducing}} the central character. Three contestants are then introduced, each accompanied by three pieces of baggage: <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> a medium one, and a large one, with each one containing a corresponding secret. The central contestant also has a piece of baggage {{of his or her}} own, which is only revealed {{at the end of the}} show. During the show, three possible secrets about the central contestant are given, one of which is the actual secret contained in their baggage. These secrets can include bad habits, strange relationship preferences, issues with one's past, or strange hobbies. After the three other contestants are introduced, they each open the smallest piece of baggage, and explain the secrets they contain.|$|E

5|$|Within an hour, White {{called his}} wife {{from a nearby}} diner; she met him at a church and was {{with him as he}} turned himself in. Many left flowers on the steps of City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a {{spontaneous}} candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at St. Mary's Cathedral. Two memorials were held for Milk; <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one</b> at Temple Emanu-El and a more boisterous one at the Opera House.|$|E
25|$|Musashi says {{to learn}} one-thousand things from one thing; as a builder may build a large {{structure}} from <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> so too must a strategist learn {{to see on}} the large scale of things.|$|E
25|$|Differences in labour {{abundance}} {{would not}} produce a difference in relative factor abundance (in relation to mobile capital) because the labour/capital ratio would be identical everywhere. (A large country would receive twice as much investment as <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> for instance, maximizing capitalist's return on investment).|$|E
50|$|In any {{of these}} cases, one Pythagorean {{triangle}} with two sides {{each of which is}} a square or twice a square has led to <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>one,</b> which in turn would lead to <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>one,</b> etc.; since such a sequence cannot go on infinitely, the original premise that such a triangle exists must be wrong.|$|R

There are some Romanians, concentrated in Islamabad.|$|E
25|$|The Deposition {{from the}} Cross. Prior to the Apokathelosis, Vespers on the {{afternoon}} of Great Friday, the priest and deacon will place the Epitaphios on the Holy Table. The priest may also anoint the Epitaphios with perfumed oil. A chalice veil and the Gospel Book is placed on top of the Epitaphios. This may be either the large Gospel Book used at the Divine Liturgy, or it may be <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|In April 1989, Rangers {{owner and}} oil tycoon Eddie Chiles, sold {{the team to}} an {{investment}} group headed by George W. Bush, son of the President of the United States, George H. W. Bush. After hearing that Chiles planned to sell the team, Bush headed {{a group of investors}} that bought the team for $89 million. While his own equity in the team was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one</b> (approximately 1%), he was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment the following year.|$|E

25|$|Though the Port of Tuscaloosa is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> {{it is one}} of {{the larger}} {{facilities}} on the Black Warrior River at waterway mile marker 338.5. There are no railway connections at this port as they primarily concentrate on the shipment of dry bulk commodities, including lignite, coal and coal coke. The federal government and the City of Tuscaloosa share the ownership of the Port of Tuscaloosa; the operation of the port is leased out to Powell Sales and has been run by them since 1997.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in spite}} {{of more than a}} century of formal {{separation}} of the two religions, temples or shrines that do not separate them are still common, as proven for example by the existence of some important Buddhist Inari shrines. During the Meiji period, in order to help the spread of Shinto, shrine-temples (jingū-ji) were destroyed while temple-shrines (chinjusha) were tolerated. As a result, shrine-temples are now rare (an extant example is Seiganto-ji), but temple-shrines are common, and most temples still have at least <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|As it was then, this {{election}} is still today shrouded in controversy, and there exist two popular stances in this discussion. On one hand, some people argue {{that there was a}} resolve in favor of independence, as there actually was a factual majority for secession, even if it was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one.</b> On the other hand, other people argue that the majority was far too small, as there were in fact only 161 more votes for independence, and this side specifically argues that only a qualified majority can be large enough grounds to pass a vote of such social and political consequence.|$|E

25|$|Two {{signs are}} truly 'diagnostic' of Graves' disease (i.e., {{not seen in}} other hyperthyroid conditions): exophthalmos and nonpitting edema (pretibial myxedema). Goiter is an {{enlarged}} thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (i.e., spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goiter may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves' disease {{is the most common}} cause of diffuse goiter. A large goiter will be visible to the naked eye, but <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one</b> (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical examination. Occasionally, goiter is not clinically detectable, but may be seen only with computed tomography or ultrasound examination of the thyroid.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s there were {{students}} in most large cities, {{towns and villages}} in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan, as well as within the Indian communities in South Africa. Meetings were still small, and Sri Hans' close relationship with his students continued. In 1963, {{the first of many}} large public programs was held in the Ram Lila grounds in New Delhi, reportedly attended by 15,000. In 1964, an event took place on Gandhi Maidan in the heart of old Delhi that attracted even larger crowds. Several ashrams were opened during that time, including <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one</b> in Rajasthan and another larger one called Satlok ("Place of Truth") located between Delhi and Haridwar.|$|E
25|$|A lot of Bad Religion {{merchandise}} including hats, belt buckles, t-shirts, and hoodies {{contain the}} Crossbuster. The logo {{was also used}} on the covers for their early EPs, 1981's self-titled and 1985's Back to the Known, and the disc for New Maps of Hell. It {{can also be found}} on other Bad Religion albums including Suffer (on the back of the boy on fire's t-shirt), All Ages (on the center part of the disc), No Substance (on Kristen Johnston's right breast, behind one of the actors playing a TV host and on a woman's fingernails), The Process of Belief (inside the booklet there is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one</b> mixed with all the other symbols) and on 30 Years Live (replacing the zero in 30).|$|E

25|$|Buxtehude's last post, from 1668, {{was at the}} Marienkirche, Lübeck {{which had}} two organs, a large one for big {{services}} and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one</b> for devotionals and funerals. There he succeeded Franz Tunder and followed {{in many of the}} footsteps of his predecessor. He married Tunder's daughter Anna Margarethe in 1668 – it was not uncommon practice that a man marry the daughter of his predecessor in his occupation. Buxtehude and Anna Margarethe had seven daughters who were baptized at the Marienkirche; however, his first daughter died as an infant. After his retirement as organist at St Olaf's Church, his father joined the family in Lübeck in 1673. Johannes died a year later, and Dieterich composed his funeral music. Dieterich's brother Peter, a barber, joined them in 1677.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of the 1950s, British Railways were making a working profit, albeit <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one.</b> However, Britain had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in terms of {{dieselisation}} and electrification of its railways. There were political as well as practical reasons behind the resistance to dieselisation in particular: the Labour Government of Clement Attlee did not want to significantly reduce the demand for domestically-produced coal in favour of imported oil, thus both affecting the balance of payments and potentially causing unemployment. Robin Riddles, who was effectively the British Railways' Chief Mechanical Engineer, disagreed with the dieselisation programme, arguing that it would be too expensive to import oil given the large amounts of domestically available coal. He continued to order steam locomotives on a large scale and from 1948 to 1953, 1,487 steam locomotives were built.|$|E
25|$|The Jacobite {{army was}} {{originally}} arrayed between {{the corners of}} Culloden and Culwhiniac parks (from left to right): the three Macdonald battalions; <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>one</b> of Chisholms; another small one of Macleans and Maclachlans; Lady Mackintosh and Monaltrie's regiments; Lord Lovat's Regiment; Ardsheal's Appin Stewarts; Lochiel's Regiment; and three battalions of the Atholl Brigade. Murray who commanded the right wing, however {{became aware of the}} Leanach enclosure that lay ahead of him, a wall that would become an obstacle {{in the event of a}} Jacobite advance. Without any consultation he then moved the brigade down the moor and formed into three columns. It seems probable that Murray intended to shift the axis of the Jacobite advance to a more northerly direction, thus having the right wing clear the Leanach enclosure and possibly taking advantage of the downward slope of the moor to the north.|$|E
