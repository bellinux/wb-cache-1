40|$|The {{fluid loss}} of {{modified}} aluminate phosphate cement system with excellent CO 2 resistant ability cannot {{meet the demand}} of cementing engineering and the conventional fluid loss additive lose effectiveness in this cement system. The aim {{of this paper is}} to reveal the failure mechanisms of the conventional fluid loss additive and develop one kind of <b>amphoteric</b> <b>ion</b> polymer to control the fluid loss. Results showed that massive of sodium hexametaphosphate exists in cement system limits the hydration and expansive degree of hydrophilic group of fluid loss additive and succeeds in the competition with fluid loss additive for adsorbing on the surface of cement particle. Using 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl propane sulfonic acid, acrylamide, diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, and itaconic acid, a new fluid loss additive which has excellent ability to control fluid loss is synthesized by free radical aqueous solution copolymerization. The reducing fluid loss function of this kind of fluid loss additive is achieved by the cationic groups adsorbing on the surface of cement particle and anionic groups absorbing water to achieve hydration expansion to plug the flow passages between the cement particles. However, the dosage of this kind of fluid loss additive is limited by the negative retarding effect...|$|E

In these melts Fe^ -ion may be an <b>amphoteric</b> <b>ion,</b> that is, the oxygen coordination number of Fe^ is 4 and/or 6 (Fe^ (4) and/or Fe^ (6). Fe^ (4) forms a complex anion with oxygen such as Si^, and Fe^ (6) acts as a cation. Effects of Na_ 2 O and RO-content on the physical properties of ferrite melts have been discussed in term of the ratio of Fe^ (4) and Fe^ (6). The controlling factors of Fe^ (4) /Fe^ (6) ratio are the basicity and content of alkali, alkaliearth oxides. The distribution of Fe^ (4) and Fe^ (6) for the RO-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 systems was assumed by considering the basicity and content of RO, and measured values of physical properties. IR spectra and Mossbauer spectra of splat quenched glassy samples are measured to estimate the structure of molten state and these support this distribution. The magnetic properties of crystallized glasses were measured. The coercive forces depended on the BaO・ 6 Fe_ 2 O_ 3 particle size and it showed the maximum value of 5. 6 kOe with the size of 800 Å...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. - The {{behavior}} of iron atoms in calcium-silicate glasses {{has been studied}} by the Mossbauer effect. The equilibrium concentration ratio, NFe 3 +/NFe 2 +> increases as the CaO content or the partial oxygen pressure during heat treatments increases. In the glasses containing {{a large amount of}} Fe 203, Fe 2 * ions occupy octahedral sites, while Fe 3 + <b>ions</b> behave as <b>amphoteric</b> <b>ions.</b> For a small partial oxygen pressure, N F e'+ t/N F e ^ t increases slightly with increasing Ca 0 /Si 02 ratio. In glasses contai-ning a small amount of Fe 203, the coordination state of Fe 3 * ion has not been made clear, while the Fe 2 + ion occupies tetrahedral sites besides octahedral sites. In steel-refinements and welding, it is impor-tant to investigate the slag of Ca 0 -Si 02 -Fe 203 sys-tem. In this work, the redox reaction and coordina-tion {{behavior of}} iron atoms in Ca 0 -Si 02 slags con-taining 10 mol % Fe 203 and 0. 2 mol % Fe 203 have been studied by the Mossbauer effect as function of CaO/Si 02 ratio and partial oxygen pressure during heat treatments...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{reactions}} {{occurring at}} solid-water interfaces in calcium mineral-ligands {{systems have been}} studied. Both hydrous apatite and fluorite surfaces show clear <b>amphoteric</b> properties. An <b>ion</b> exchange process between lattice ions of F- on fluorite and OH- ions in bulk solution is discovered. The surface adsorption of Alizarin Red S and sodium oleate are determined. Surface chemical reaction models are established based on acidbase potentiometric titrations, solubility, adsorption and zeta-potential measurements in 0. 1 mol dm- 3 ionic media at 25 'C. Experimental data are evaluated using the computer program FITEQL assuming a constance capacitance model for the electric double layer. Surface complexes identities are obtained from FT-IR, FT-Raman, and UV/visible spectroscopy studies. A series of surface equilibrium constants in the system are presented. The correlation between surface complex formation and mineral flotation is discussed. Godkänd; 1994; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R
