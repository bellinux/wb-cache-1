In recent work, the reference collection of groundnut had been assessed across seasons varying for drought intensity, i. e. two moderate temperature (rainy season) and two high temperature (dry season) experiments under well-watered (WW) and water stress (WS) conditions (Hamidou et al., 2012, 2013). Here <b>aflatoxin</b> concentration (AC) in seeds is measured in these trials, first for possibly identifying germplasm with low <b>aflatoxin</b> concentrations and second for investigating possible relationships between <b>aflatoxin</b> concentration and drought tolerance. Drought stress intensity increased <b>aflatoxin</b> concentration in seeds and higher <b>aflatoxin</b> contamination was observed under combined drought and high temperature conditions than under drought alone. No germplasm with lower AC than resistant check (55 - 437) were found. <b>Aflatoxin</b> contamination showed very high GxE interactions, which suggest that selection for resistance to <b>aflatoxin</b> contamination must be specific to environment.

40|$|<b>Aflatoxin</b> is a {{mycotoxin}} and {{a secondary}} metabolite, {{and the most}} potent known liver carcinogen that contaminates several important crops, and represents a significant threat to {{public health and the}} economy. Available approaches reported thus far have been insufficient to eliminate this threat, and therefore provide the rational to explore novel methods for preventing <b>aflatoxin</b> accumulation in the environment. Many terrestrial plants and microbes that share ecological niches and encounter the <b>aflatoxin</b> producers have the ability to synthesize compounds that inhibit <b>aflatoxin</b> synthesis. However, reports of natural <b>aflatoxin</b> inhibitors from marine ecosystem components that do not share ecological niches with the <b>aflatoxin</b> producers are rare. Here we show that a non-pathogenic marine bacterium, Vibrio gazogenes, when exposed to low non-toxic doses of <b>aflatoxin</b> B 1, demonstrates a shift in its metabolic output and synthesizes a metabolite fraction that inhibits <b>aflatoxin</b> synthesis without affecting hyphal growth in the model <b>aflatoxin</b> producer, Aspergillus parasiticus.

Historically, the exposure of <b>aflatoxin</b> in Malaysia can be dated in 1960 s where an outbreak of disease in pig farms caused severe liver damage to the animals. Later, an aflatoxicosis case in Perak in 1988 was reported and caused death to 13 children, as up to 3 mg of <b>aflatoxin</b> was present in a single serving of contaminated noodles. Since then, extensive research on <b>aflatoxin</b> has been conducted in Malaysia. The food commodities such as peanuts, cereals, spices and their products are the main commodities commonly found to be contaminated with <b>aflatoxin.</b> Surprisingly, some of the contaminated foods had levels greater than the permissible limit adopted by the Malaysian Food Regulation 1985. Besides, exposure assessment through the measurement of <b>aflatoxin</b> biomarkers in human biological samples {{is still in its}} infancy stage. Nevertheless, some studies had reported the presence of these biomarkers. In fact, it is postulated that Malaysians are moderately exposed to <b>aflatoxin</b> compared to those high risk populations, where <b>aflatoxin</b> contamination in the diets is prevalent. Since the ingestion of <b>aflatoxin</b> could be the integral to the development of liver cancer, the incidence of cancer attributable by dietary <b>aflatoxin</b> exposure in Malaysia has also been reported and published in the literatures.
