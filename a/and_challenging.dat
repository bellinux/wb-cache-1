The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).

A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – To justify an {{increase}} in information technology (IT) spending and to understand utilization of limited organizational resources on IT, the correlation between IT and business performance has been {{of great interest to}} business managers. However, business managers face issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> in finding out how and to what extent IT is able to deliver the intended benefits. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine IT evaluation issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> faced by information systems (IS) researchers, IS specialists, and business managers. Design/methodology/approach – This paper begins by reviewing the disparate discussions in past literature on IT evaluation issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges.</b> It then provides a synthesis of the disparate discussions by identifying eight issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> in IT evaluation. Findings – The eight issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> identified are: evaluation scope, evaluation timing, unit of analysis, level of analysis, different perspectives, different dimensions, different measures, and underpinning theoretical frameworks. It concludes with some suggestions on ways to improve IT evaluation practices. Originality/value – This paper posits that before a pragmatic IT evaluation approach can be developed, it is necessary to first understand the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> faced by IS researchers, IS specialists, and business managers in IT evaluation. Having identified the eight issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges,</b> this paper provides pointers on what needs to be considered when conducting IT evaluation...|$|R
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting <b>and</b> <b>challenging.</b> It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E

However, some reviewers noted {{that during the}} latter stages of the game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style {{made it difficult to}} understand what was happening.

5|$|Fertilisation of Orchids {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable <b>and</b> <b>challenging</b> experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.|$|E

40|$|Business Intelligence (BI) has {{embarked}} on decision-making setting. This has influenced many organizations from different industries that are located in diverse regions to implement BI. Critical Successful Factors (CSF) becomes the guideline for the implementer to adopt BI successfully. However, lack of BI knowledge and weak consideration of BI CSF led {{to the failure of}} BI implementation project. Several issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> have been identified during the BI implementation. In addition, other researchers rarely discussed this subject. Thus, the objective {{of this paper is to}} recognize the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> on BI implementation. Through qualitative method, BI practices systematically described the purpose of BI execution on selected organizations, industries and regions. It has given the path towards the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> of BI implementation. The identified issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> are defining the business goal, data management, limited funding, training and user acceptance as well as the lack of expertise issues. The findings categorized the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> into three dimensions of CSF for BI implementation, which are Organization, Process and Technology dimension. Limitation in this study requires future researchers to study in details of these issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> including the solutions and the impact of BI implementation...|$|R

5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book {{one of the}} most {{exciting}} <b>and</b> <b>challenging</b> in the field of education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on moral education, despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E

5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, <b>and</b> <b>challenging</b> the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E

After some losses before the council, Calvin believed he was defeated; on 24 July 1553 he asked the council to allow him to resign. Although the libertines controlled the council, his request was refused. The opposition realised that they could curb Calvin's authority, but they did not have enough power to banish him.|$|E
