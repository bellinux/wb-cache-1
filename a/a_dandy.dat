5|$|<b>A</b> <b>dandy,</b> Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești himself led {{a life of}} luxury, {{marked by}} excess, and had by then become a drug addict. He was a proud {{homosexual}} (or bisexual), which did not prevent him from keeping as his concubine a younger woman, {{commonly referred to as}} Domnica ("Little Lady") or Mica ("Little One"). Born Alexandra Colanoski, she was born in 1894 to Romanian Poles from Bessarabia, and, according to memoirist Constantin Beldie, had previously been a prostitute at a nightclub.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he dressed like <b>a</b> <b>dandy</b> in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E

25|$|Ulrich Wessel (9 January 1946 – 24 April 1975) {{was the son}} of a rich Hamburg businessman. Wessel was {{described}} as <b>a</b> <b>dandy,</b> and he was a millionaire by inheritance. He was involved with the SPK and took part in the West German embassy siege in Stockholm. He died during the siege when the TNT was accidentally exploded; the force of the explosion startled him so much that he dropped a grenade he was holding and it exploded on him. He died soon afterwards.|$|E

25|$|Whistler had a {{distinctive}} appearance, short and slight, {{with piercing eyes}} and a curling mustache, often sporting a monocle and the flashy attire of <b>a</b> <b>dandy.</b> He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies. Though he could be droll and flippant about social and political matters, he always was serious about art and often invited public controversy and debate to argue for his strongly held theories.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, Halbertsma {{had himself}} a large new house built in Grou, {{something}} his brothers were rather boastful of in their letters. He also dressed himself {{according to the}} latest fashion, leading to Eeltsje complaining, in 1841, that his brother had become <b>a</b> <b>dandy.</b> But in the end Halbertsma miscalculated badly: when the shares in other businesses he had invested in dropped sharply in value in 1848, he panicked, sold out, and put all his money in rye. When subsequently the rye market also collapsed, he suffered heavy losses amounting to about half of his fortune. This was a severe blow, especially to his ego, which he never truly recovered from.|$|E
25|$|Since the 18th century, {{the civic}} {{dimension}} of gender identity has been eclipsed by the sexual dimension of gender identity, and, today, effeminacy {{has often been}} considered a vice, indicative of other negative character traits and often involving a pejorative insinuation of homosexual tendencies in boys or men. In other societies, by contrast, effeminate boys or men may be considered a distinct human gender (third gender), and may have a special social function, {{as is the case}} of Two-Spirits in some Native American groups. Furthermore, some see effeminacy to be a characteristic or trait, part of a particular person's gender role and in this sense would not be considered a vice or indicative of any other characteristics. An effeminate boy or man is similar to a fop or <b>a</b> <b>dandy,</b> though these tend to be archaic identities that are taken on by the individual rather than insulting labels.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he began}} writing the novel, Ainsworth {{suffered}} from {{more of his}} father-in-law's financial problems {{and was unable to}} resume work on it until 1833. During the autumn of that year he managed to complete large portions of the novel while staying in Sussex, near Sergison's home. The novel was published in April 1834 by Richard Bentley and contained illustrations by George Cruikshank. After working five years in the legal profession, Ainsworth gave it up and dedicated himself to writing. Rookwood garnered wide critical and financial success, and pleased his associates at Fraser's Magazine. He started to dress as <b>a</b> <b>dandy,</b> and he was introduced to the Salon of Margaret Power, Countess of Blessington. Her Salon was a group of men and literary women, and would include many others but many in London believed that Blessington had a damaged reputation. However, this did not stop Ainsworth from meeting many famous British authors from the Salon. While part of her circle, he wrote for her collection of stories called The Book of Beauty, published in 1835. Ainsworth continued in various literary circles, but his wife and daughters did not; he stayed in Kensal Lodge while they lived with Ebers. During this time, Ainsworth met Charles Dickens and introduced the young writer to the publisher Macrone and to George Cruikshank. Ainsworth also introduced Dickens to John Forster at Kensal Lodge, initiating a close friendship between the two.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} the Spanish word dengue are not certain, but it is {{possibly}} derived from dinga in the Swahili phrase Ka-dinga pepo, which describes the disease as being caused by an evil spirit.

500|$|Sheppard's {{final period}} of liberty lasted just two weeks. He {{disguised}} {{himself as a}} beggar {{and returned to the}} city. [...] He broke into the Rawlins brothers' pawnbroker's shop in Drury Lane on the night of 29 October 1724, taking a black silk suit, a silver sword, rings, watches, a wig, and other items. [...] He dressed himself as <b>a</b> <b>dandy</b> gentleman and used the proceeds to spend a day and the following evening on the tiles with two mistresses. [...] He was arrested a final time in the early morning on 1 November, blind drunk, [...] "in a handsome Suit of Black, with a Diamond Ring and a carnelian ring on his Finger, and a fine Light Tye Peruke".|$|E

500|$|From {{the start}} of his career, Ravel {{appeared}} calmly indifferent to blame or praise. Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine. The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical. At twenty years of age he was, {{in the words of the}} biographer Burnett James, [...] "self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter." [...] He dressed like <b>a</b> <b>dandy</b> and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour. Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame, and bony in features, Ravel had the [...] "appearance of a well-dressed jockey", whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect. During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven.|$|E
500|$|Keenan is {{featured}} in several segments of Mr. Show, {{most notably in}} the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he {{is featured}} wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band [...] "Puscifer". When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies [...] "Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he knows it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?" [...] He also appears in episode 2.6, [...] "The Velveteen Touch of <b>a</b> <b>Dandy</b> Fop", {{as one of the}} viewers of Coupon: The Movie, saying [...] "Now is not the time", waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the Mr. Show incarnation Run Ronnie Run, and appear in the [...] "music video sex scene" [...] on its DVD. Keenan appeared {{on the cover of the}} May/June 1999 issue of Pop Smear magazine, portraying Charles Manson as part of a photo essay, imitating a famous Life magazine portrait. He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film Bikini Bandits and its 2004 sequel Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, [...] "Oh, Manson. He's a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked. With Satan there's so much gray area." ...|$|E
