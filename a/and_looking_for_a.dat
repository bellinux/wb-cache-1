King had originally been the drummer for the project but quit during recording sessions to return to London, while House, who had temporarily left the band to join a David Bowie tour, elected to remain with Bowie full-time, but nevertheless contributed violin to these sessions. At the end of the band's UK tour, Calvert, wanting King back in the band, dismissed Griffin, then promptly resigned himself, choosing to pursue a career in literature. Swindells left to record a solo album after an offer had been made to him by the record company ATCO.|$|E

500|$|Both Steinbeck and Ricketts had {{achieved}} {{some measure of}} security and recognition in their professions by 1939: Steinbeck had capitalized on his first successful novel, Tortilla Flat, {{with the publication of}} The Grapes of Wrath, and Ricketts had published Between Pacific Tides, which became the definitive handbook {{for the study of the}} intertidal fauna of the Pacific Coast of the coterminous United States. Steinbeck was exhausted <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new start; Ricketts was looking for a new challenge.

Initially they planned a motoring trip to Mexico City as a break from their work on the handbook, but as time went on they became more interested in a collecting trip around the Gulf of California.

500|$|In {{a parody}} of The Devil and Daniel Webster, at work, Homer states that he would sell his soul for a {{doughnut}} after finding that Lenny and Carl took all the doughnuts and threw them at an old man (Grampa) [...] "for kicks". The devil, revealed to be Ned Flanders, appears and offers Homer a contract to seal the deal. However, before Homer finishes the doughnut, he realizes that Ned {{will not be able}} to have his soul if he does not eat all of the doughnut and keeps the final piece in the refrigerator. Unfortunately, while half-asleep <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> midnight snack, he eats the final piece of the [...] "forbidden donut", and Ned instantly reappears to take possession of Homer's soul. Marge and Lisa plead with Ned, finally getting him to agree to hold a trial the next day. Until then, Homer is sent to spend the rest of the day being punished in Hell. At the stroke of twelve midnight, Ned brings Homer back to the Simpson household for his trial. Then, when the Simpsons' lawyer, Lionel Hutz, flees after ruining his case, Marge makes a final effort to save Homer by displaying a photo from their wedding day. On the back of the photo, Homer has written that, in return for Marge giving him her hand in marriage, he pledges his soul to her forever; therefore, it was not his property to sell at the time of his deal with Ned. The jury rules in favor of the Simpsons and the presiding judge dismisses the case. Enraged, the Devil leaves, but gets his revenge by turning Homer's head into a doughnut.|$|E
500|$|Through {{his work}} Clark became {{acquainted with the}} {{partners}} of the Philip Hill, Higginson, Erlanders merchant bank (later known as Hill Samuel), {{one of the two}} largest in the country. The three men were all over [...] tall, [...] "frightfully clever" [...] <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fourth partner. [...] Clark, a tall man himself, fitted their apparent criteria and in 1961 accepted the fourth partnership at the bank; he retired from his partnership at Slaughter and May on 30 September 1961. At Hill Samuel he headed the issues and mergers department and advised on some of the largest company mergers in British history. Clark handled the General Electric Company plc's takeovers of Associated Electrical Industries and English Electric under Arnold Weinstock, and the expansions of Racal, Beecham Group and Courtaulds. He also worked to win the firm business abroad. In 1967 he acted for the Astor family in the sale of The Times newspaper to Lord Thomson of Fleet. With the parties deadlocked and the final price disputed by £50,000, Clark successfully reached an agreement by flipping a coin. [...] He correctly called the fall and won the Astors the additional £50,000. [...] Clark kept the half-crown he had used as a memento and had it mounted on a silver stand. Clark helped to draft the 1968 City Takeover Code that remains in force and regulates how takeovers are carried out in British companies. He chaired the National Film Finance Corporation from 1969 to 1976 and sat on a committee to represent Rolls-Royce's creditors during the nationalisation process. Clark worked with Robert Maxwell when he attempted to purchase the News of the World in 1969.

500|$|In 1967, Redding {{performed}} at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, {{the second day of}} the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler. Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences. [...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> big response. The ballad [...] "I've Been Loving You" [...] followed. The last song was [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. [...] "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones, [...] "I think we did one of our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey." [...] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, [...] "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens." ...|$|E
