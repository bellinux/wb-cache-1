Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and <b>adsorbent</b> in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools.

In this work, we classified the molten salts-modified MgO <b>adsorbents</b> into four categories: (1) homogenous molten salt-modified MgO <b>adsorbents,</b> (2) molten salt-modified double salts-based MgO <b>adsorbents,</b> (3) mixed molten salts-modified MgO <b>adsorbents,</b> and (4) molten salts-modified MgO-based mixed oxides <b>adsorbents.</b> This contribution critically reviews the recent developments in the synthetic method, adsorption capacity, reaction kinetics, promotion mechanism, operational conditions and regenerability of the molten salts-modified MgO CO 2 <b>adsorbents.</b> The challenges and prospects in this promising field of molten salts-modified MgO CO 2 <b>adsorbents</b> in real applications are also briefly mentioned...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{we report}} {{the use of}} two new <b>adsorbents</b> derived from Nepenthes rafflesia {{for the removal of}} toxic methyl violet 2 B dye. Both the <b>adsorbents</b> gave high maximum {{adsorption}} capacities towards MV dye as compared to many reported natural <b>adsorbents.</b> Kinetics of the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion was found not to be the rate determining step. Both the <b>adsorbents</b> were also able to maintain its removal efficiency under different medium pH. High q m values coupled with successful regeneration of the spent <b>adsorbents</b> gave added values for them to be utilized as potential <b>adsorbents</b> for the removal of MV dye in wastewater treatment.|$|R
25|$|Adsorption {{is usually}} {{described}} through isotherms, that is, {{the amount of}} adsorbate on the <b>adsorbent</b> {{as a function of}} its pressure (if gas) or concentration (if liquid) at constant temperature. The quantity adsorbed is nearly always normalized by the mass of the <b>adsorbent</b> to allow comparison of different materials. To date, 15 different isotherm models were developed.|$|E

25|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} (HPLC; formerly {{referred to as}} high-pressure {{liquid chromatography}}), is a technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. It relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid <b>adsorbent</b> material. Each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the <b>adsorbent</b> material, causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to {{the separation of the}} components as they flow out the column.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{to surface}} tension, {{adsorption}} {{is a consequence}} of surface energy. In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms {{on the surface of the}} <b>adsorbent</b> are not wholly surrounded by other <b>adsorbent</b> atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E

25|$|Combining an <b>adsorbent</b> with a refrigerant, {{adsorption}} chillers use heat {{to provide}} a cooling effect.

25|$|Expanded-bed {{adsorption}} (EBA) chromatography is {{a convenient}} and effective technique for {{the capture of}} proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the <b>adsorbent,</b> while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer. The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends {{on the characteristics of}} the feed. After elution, the <b>adsorbent</b> is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.|$|E

25|$|In other instances, {{molecular}} {{interactions between}} gas molecules previously adsorbed on a solid surface form significant interactions with gas molecules in the gaseous phases. Hence, adsorption of gas molecules {{to the surface}} {{is more likely to}} occur around gas molecules that are already present on the solid surface, rendering the Langmuir adsorption isotherm ineffective for the purposes of modelling. This effect was studied in a system where nitrogen was the adsorbate and tungsten was the <b>adsorbent</b> by Paul Kisliuk (1922–2008) in 1957. To compensate for the increased probability of adsorption occurring around molecules present on the substrate surface, Kisliuk developed the precursor state theory, whereby molecules would enter a precursor state at the interface between the solid <b>adsorbent</b> and adsorbate in the gaseous phase. From here, adsorbate molecules would either adsorb to the <b>adsorbent</b> or desorb into the gaseous phase. The probability of adsorption occurring from the precursor state is dependent on the adsorbate’s proximity to other adsorbate molecules that have already been adsorbed. If the adsorbate molecule in the precursor state is in close proximity to an adsorbate molecule that has already formed on the surface, it has a sticking probability reflected {{by the size of the}} SE constant and will either be adsorbed from the precursor state at a rate of kEC or will desorb into the gaseous phase at a rate of kES. If an adsorbate molecule enters the precursor state at a location that is remote from any other previously adsorbed adsorbate molecules, the sticking probability is reflected by the size of the SD constant.|$|E

25|$|A third {{approach}} is to adsorb molecular hydrogen {{on the surface of}} a solid storage material. Unlike in the hydrides mentioned above, the hydrogen does not dissociate/recombine upon charging/discharging the storage system, and hence does not suffer from the kinetic limitations of many hydride storage systems.

The adsorption capacities of the composite <b>adsorbents</b> developed at higher temperatures (0 and - 79 degrees C) {{are found to}} be larger than those of normal alumina pillared clays. The experimental results showed that the framework of these <b>adsorbents</b> is made of alumina particles and clay sheets while the pyrolyzed carbon distributes in the space of interlayers and interpillars. The pores between the carbon particles, clay sheets, and alumina pillars are very narrow with very strong adsorption forces, leading to enhanced adsorption capacities at 0 and - 79 degrees C.
