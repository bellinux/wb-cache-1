He read the {{screenplay}} and turned it down, thinking that the filmmakers could not pull it off. Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and {{was impressed by the}} latter's vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 hours until the filmmakers agreed to shoot the film in Los Angeles, where the actor lived, and make it in five weeks.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Lombard's death, Gable, who was inconsolable and {{devastated by}} his loss, joined the United States Army Air Forces. Lombard had <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that {{numerous}} times after the United States had entered World War II. After officer training, Gable headed a six-man motion picture unit {{attached to a}} B-17 bomb group in England to film aerial gunners in combat, flying five missions himself. In December 1943, the United States Maritime Commission announced that a Liberty ship named after Carole Lombard would be launched. Gable attended {{the launch of the}} SS Carole Lombard on January 15, 1944, the two-year anniversary of Lombard's record-breaking war bond drive.

5|$|Hayao Miyazaki {{made his}} {{credited}} directorial debut in 1979 with The Castle of Cagliostro, a film {{which was a}} distinct departure from the antics of the Lupin III franchise, but still went on to receive the Ofuji Noburo Award at the 1979 Mainichi Film Concours. Although Cagliostro was not a box office success, Toshio Suzuki, editor of the magazine Animage, {{was impressed by the}} film and encouraged Miyazaki to produce works for Animage's publisher, Tokuma Shoten. Miyazaki's film ideas were rejected, and Tokuma <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a manga: this {{led to the creation of}} Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki began writing and drawing the manga in 1981, and it quickly became Animage's most popular feature. Hideo Ogata and Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founders of Animage and Tokuma Shoten respectively, encouraged Miyazaki to work on a film adaptation. Miyazaki initially refused, but agreed on the condition that he could direct.|$|E
5|$|In November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of {{the largest}} and most {{elaborate}} rock concerts in history, The Wall– Live in Berlin, on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate. The show reported an official attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers. Leonard Cheshire <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters' group of musicians included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Scorpions, and Sinéad O'Connor. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the U.S. 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron. Designed by Mark Fisher, the Wall was 25metres tall and 170metres long and was built across the set. Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale, and although many rock icons received invitations to the show, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, did not. Waters released a live double-album of the performance, which has been certified platinum by the RIAA.|$|E

25|$|Still in the service, Caesar {{was ordered}} to Palm Beach, Florida, where Vernon Duke and Howard Dietz were putting {{together}} a service revue called Tars and Spars. There he met the civilian director of the show, Max Liebman.

Tars and Spars toured nationally, and became Caesar's first major gig as a comedian. Liebman later produced Caesar's first television series.|$|E

25|$|Bishop Ghenadie was a {{candidate}} for the Metropolitan seat in 1885, and gained significant support. Dobrescu-Argeș later claimed that Ghenadie withdrew from the race after the National Liberal lobby, who supported Iosif Gheorghidan for the position, <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; there was no grudge preserved between the two contestants, with Ghenadie canvassing votes for Iosif. When Metropolitan Iosif resigned in early 1893, Ghenadie {{was one of the first}} choices for the seat: in May, the Synod and Parliament of Romania both voted him in as leader the Romanian Church. Since Ghenadie lacked formal training, the regulation on such appointments had to be modified. He received his investiture from King Carol I, on May 21.|$|E

25|$|Since 2005, the Dalek {{voice in}} the {{television}} series has been provided by Nicholas Briggs, speaking into a microphone connected to a voice modulator. Briggs had previously provided Dalek and other alien voices for Big Finish Productions audio plays, and continues to do so. In a 2006 BBC Radio interview, Briggs said that when the BBC <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the voice for the new television series, they instructed him to bring his own analogue ring modulator that he had used in the audio plays. The BBC's sound department had changed to a digital platform and could not adequately create the distinctive Dalek sound with their modern equipment. Briggs {{went as far as}} to bring the voice modulator to the actors' readings of the scripts.|$|E

500|$|Campbell {{changed the}} {{approach}} to the magazine's cover art, hoping that more mature artwork would attract more adult readers and enable them to carry the magazine without embarrassment. [...] Howard V.
