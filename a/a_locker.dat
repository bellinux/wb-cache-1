Each player to wear the jersey will also dress at <b>a</b> <b>locker</b> bearing a plaque with Oosterbaan's name and his time of tenure at Michigan.|$|E

The thieves attempted to ransom the trophy, but the CFL refused to pay and made plans to replace it with a duplicate. An anonymous phone call led to the trophy's recovery two months later in <b>a</b> <b>locker</b> at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. The thieves were never found.|$|E

5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only <b>a</b> <b>locker,</b> and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Greer {{was capable}} of seating 7,200spectators, but was {{expanded}} to 8,800 {{by the end of}} the inaugural season.

5|$|The {{story begins}} with an {{introductory}} sequence depicting {{the assassination of the}} President of the United States, William Sheridan. The protagonist, Jason Fly (voiced by David Duchovny), awakes on Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, New York City. Badly wounded, he is rescued by a lifeguard and is brought into a beach house. He has lost all his memories and all that he possesses is <b>a</b> <b>locker</b> box key. He also has a tattoo with the Roman numeral XIII on his right shoulder. He is then attacked by unknown assailants, led by a hitman known as The Mongoose, with whom Fly does battle several times throughout the game. However, he is later instead arrested by the FBI as a chief suspect in the murder. A photo proves that he resembles the murderer. XIII succeeds in escaping the headquarters {{with the aid of a}} female soldier, Jones. One of Fly's few other allies is Ben Carrington: an old war veteran and superior to Jones, Carrington knows valuable information about the President's death and is willing to help XIII. However, he is arrested and brought to a military station in the Appalachian mountains to be silenced by the conspiracy. XIII must infiltrate the base and free Carrington if he is to learn about his past.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such <b>a</b> <b>locker</b> in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally {{going to be the one}} driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, it was the first time a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E

50|$|Pitching in the National League for {{the first}} time, Locker had {{one of his best}} seasons, winning 10 games, saving 18 and topping 100 innings pitched {{for the first}} time since 1969. In an odd twist, in November the Cubs sent him back to Oakland. According to Bruce Markusen in his 1998 book, Baseball's Last Dynasty: Charlie Finley's Oakland <b>A's,</b> <b>Locker</b> had told Cubs general manager John Holland that he would only pitch one season for the Cubs, then he wanted to be traded back to the A's as owner Charlie Finley had agreed to try to arrange. Locker moved his family to Oakland and planned to live and work there after his {{baseball}} career. Holland and Charlie Finley obliged the pitcher's request but it turned out to be a bad deal for the <b>A's.</b> <b>Locker</b> had to undergo surgery to remove bone chips from his pitching elbow and would sit out the entire 1974 season.|$|R

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} deal was finalised, Mitsubishi became embroiled in accusations that it had covered up {{complaints}} from customers about defects in their vehicles. A police raid on its headquarters in July 2000 uncovered hidden documents stashed in <b>a</b> <b>locker,</b> and soon after over 500,000 vehicles were recalled for repairs.
