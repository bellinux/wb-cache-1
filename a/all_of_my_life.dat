There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{death penalty}} was a notable issue during the 1988 presidential election. It {{came up in}} the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the {{moderator}} of the debate, asked Dukakis, [...] "Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [...] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" [...] Dukakis replied, [...] "No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime." [...] Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as {{the beginning of the end}} of his campaign.|$|E

6000|$|All these they beheld, as it were, {{upon the}} palm of the hand. And after they had gazed for a while, Sir Ector said: [...] "Methinks that yonder is as fair a place as ever I saw in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Now let us descend thitherward and let us seek to {{discover}} to what noble lord yonder island castle belongeth."

6000|$|So Sir Launcelot {{won that}} tournament for King Bagdemagus, {{and after the}} battle was over and done King Bagdemagus came to Sir Launcelot and said to him: [...] "Messire, thou hast brought to me the {{greatest}} glory this day that ever fell to my lot in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Now I prithee come with me and refresh thyself with me, so that I may give thee fitting thanks for all thou hast done, and so that I may reward thee {{in such a way}} as is fit for a king to reward a knight-champion such as thou art." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he who {{had before}} spoken to Sir Gawaine spake still again, saying: [...] "Sirrah, {{you are to}} know that the pet dwarf of the lady of the castle at which we dwell hath died only a few days ago.

6000|$|Then Percival said: [...] "Alas, dear Sir Knight! It is {{not meet}} that I should lay command upon such as thou art. But, if thou wilt do so, I beseech thee when thou art come to King Arthur's court that thou wilt tell the King that I, who am his young knight Percival, have borne myself not unbecomingly in my battle with thee. For {{this is the}} first battle, knight against knight, that I have {{undertaken}} in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> And I beseech thee that thou wilt greet Sir Kay the Seneschal, from me, and that thou wilt say to him that by and by I shall meet him and repay him that buffet which he gave to the damsel Yelande, the Dumb Maiden, in the Queen's pavilion." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{the crew}} of the Cassandra saw the result of their fire they burst out {{shouting}} and cheering like madmen. Down came the sloop drifting stern on, whilst the Cassandra, making up for lost time, poured broadside after broadside into her. Never did I behold such a sight in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> for every shot we gave her ploughed great lanes along her crowded decks. To make matters worse for them, their mast was presently shot through, falling alongside in a great tangled wreck, thus preventing any manoeuvres which they might still have hoped to make. They drifted by us at about forty or fifty yards' distance, shouting and yelling, and giving us a last broadside with great courage and determination. They presently ran aground upon a sandbar and there stuck fast for the time, though in such shoal water that we could not come nigher to them than we then were.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I can't tell lies what's {{to become}} of me?" [...] said Mary with a sob. [...] "YOU don't understand. You don't know {{anything}} about it.

Why, this is the first day I ever remember of feeling 'sif I'd enough to eat. I've been knocked about <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> 'cept for the two years I was at the asylum. They didn't lick me there and it wasn't too bad, though the matron was cross. She always looked ready to bite my head off a nail.

And I make my oath that I never beheld so fierce and manful a combat in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But now your troubles are over and done, and Sir Launcelot greets you all with words of good cheer and bids me tell you to take all ease and comfort that you can in being free, and in especial he bids me greet you, Sir Ector, and you, Sir Lionel, and {{to tell you that}} you are to follow him no farther, but to return to court and bide there until he cometh; for he goeth upon an adventure which he must undertake by himself." ...|$|E

60|$|The pirates {{were the}} first to open the battle, which they did when within {{about a quarter of a}} mile from us, giving us a broadside. It was the first time that I had ever been under fire in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and never shall I forget it as long as I may live. Their aim was wonderfully accurate, so that when their shot struck us a great cloud of white {{splinters}} flew from a dozen places at once. I saw three men drop upon the deck, and one who stood at a gun on the quarter-deck just below me leaned suddenly forward half across the cannon with a deep groan, whilst a fountain of blood gushed out from his bosom across the carriage and upon the deck. One of the others caught him by the arm, whereupon he turned half round and then slipped and fell forward upon his face. He was the first man killed in this action, and the first that I ever beheld die in a like manner.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{standing}} {{just under the}} poop-deck at the time, with the glass to my eye, when, of a sudden, I saw something black begin rising from the deck to the fore. There was not enough breeze going to spread it, but I knew as well as anything in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> {{that it was the}} [...] "Black Roger," [...] and that the white that I could see among the folds was the wicked sign of the [...] "skull and crossbones," [...] which those bloody and cruel wretches are pleased to adopt as the ensign of their trade. Nor were we long in doubt as to their design, for even as I watched I saw a sudden puff of white smoke go up from her side and hang motionlessly in the still air, whilst a second or two later sounded the dull and heavy boom of the distant cannon, and a round shot came skipping across the water from wave to wave, though too far away and with too poor aim to do any damage from that distance, which could not have been less than two miles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet well {{knowing how}} this lady loved mischief, I {{was for a}} time very ill at ease, not knowing {{whether or not she}} might be minded to cast some evil spell upon me. Yet she made no sign of such intent, but spake me very fair and gave me courteous greeting. And she took my hand and led me into an {{adjoining}} apartment where there was a feast set with all sorts of meats and wines, and we two took our places at the board side by side. And as we feasted so together, there came some who sang and others who made sweet music and I felt such great pleasure as I have hardly ever felt in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> before. Meanwhile, as we sat at the table, the Lady Vivien conversed with me upon such matters as she deemed would be of entertainment to me. And she inquired of many lords and ladies at the court of the King and spake well of them all. Then after a considerable while she inquired of me whether it would be pleasant to me to tell her upon what errand I was bound, and so I told her I was errant in search of Sir Launcelot.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got me, anyhow. I'm {{not good}} for much, I know, but I'll stand by you, Jo, <b>all</b> the days <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Upon <b>my</b> word I will!" [...] and Laurie meant what he said.|$|R

60|$|Then {{my dream}} snapped: {{and with a}} heart that leapt I saw across the tavern where I slept, The sight <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> most full <b>of</b> grace, A gin-damned drunkard's wan half-witted face.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Nay, madam, give me time,’ he replied. ‘When first I saw you, {{you were}} still young; not every man would have remarked your powers; but I had not been twice honoured by your {{conversation}} ere I had found my mistress. I have, madam, I believe, some genius; and I have much ambition. But the genius is of the serving kind; and to offer a career to my ambition, I had to find one born to rule. This is the base and essence of our union; each had need of the other; each recognised, master and servant, lever and fulcrum, the complement of his endowment. Marriages, they say, are made in heaven: how much more these pure, laborious, intellectual fellowships, born to found empires! Nor is this all. We found each other ripe, filled with great ideas that took shape and clarified with every word. We grew together—ay, madam, in mind we grew together like twin children. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> until we met was petty and groping; was it not—I will flatter myself openly—it was the same with you! Not till then had you those eagle surveys, that wide and hopeful sweep of intuition! Thus we had formed ourselves, and we were ready.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the top of}} {{the mound}} there sat a man of {{gigantic}} size and so hideously ugly that I never beheld his like in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> before that time. This being called to me in a voice exceedingly loud and rough, demanding of me whither I went and upon what business. Thereupon I told him that I sought a certain magic fountain and that I would be much beholden to him if he would direct me upon my way. Upon this he laughed very boisterously, and after a while he said: 'Take that path yonder through the glade. Follow that path until you come to a hill. From the hilltop you will find before you a valley, and you will see in the valley a fountain of water that flows into a small lake with many lilies about the margin. At the fountain is a tall tree with wide-spreading branches, and beneath the tree is a marble slab, and upon the slab is a silver bowl attached to it by a chain of silver. Take some of the water of that fountain into the silver bowl and fling it upon the marble slab, and I believe you will find an adventure that will satisfy your desires {{for a very long time}} to come.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot sighed very deeply, and {{he looked}} steadfastly at the Lady Elaine, and he said: [...] "Lady, you know not how great a thing it is you ask of my pride, for I would fain remain unknown as I am at this present. And you know not {{what it is you}} ask of my knighthood, for wit ye it must be against my {{one-time}} friends and companions-in-arms that you would have me contend. So it is that if I should have success in such an affair as this, whatsoever credit I should win therein shall bring discredit unto them. Moreover, I must tell you that never in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> have I worn the favor of any lady, having vowed my knighthood to one who is a queen and the wife of a king. Natheless, though all this is so, yet far be it from me to refuse a boon when it is you who ask it of me. For I speak the truth, Lady, when I say that I would freely lay down my life at your bidding. So in this case, maugre all that I have said, I will even do as you ask me, wherefore, if you will purvey me that armor of which you speak, I will do your will in all ways that I am able." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear friend!' said Cadurcis, {{putting his}} arm affectionately in Herbert's {{as they walked}} along, 'for, indeed, you must allow me to style you so; all the {{happiness}} and <b>all</b> the sorrow <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> alike flow from your roof!' ...|$|R
50|$|I, ____, take you, ____, {{to be my}} (husband/wife). I {{promise to}} be true to you in good times and in bad, in {{sickness}} and in health. I will love you and honour you <b>all</b> the days <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
6000|$|There was no hurry. I {{had passed}} for master, and I had <b>all</b> the rest <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> before {{me to make}} the best of it. That seemed a long time. I went leisurely through a small mental calculation, and said: ...|$|R
