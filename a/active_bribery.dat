50|$|As {{indicated}} {{on the pages}} devoted to political corruption, efforts {{have been made in}} recent years by the international community to encourage countries to dissociate and incriminate as separate offences, active and passive bribery. From a legal point of view, <b>active</b> <b>bribery</b> can be defined for instance as the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage any public official, for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions. (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173) of the Council of Europe). Passive bribery can be defined as the request or receipt any public official, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).|$|E
40|$|Active {{trading in}} influence, namely promising, giving an undue {{advantage}} to someone, who asserts or confirms {{that he or}} she is able to exert an improper influence over third persons, is not explicitly regulated by the HCC. Exceptionally this conduct may be qualified as <b>active</b> <b>bribery</b> of domestic or foreign (international) public officials, but only if the active influence trader intends that the passive influence trader (on the basis of their arrangement) will transmit the undue advantage to the public official. Other cases of active trading in influence are not punishable under Hungarian Law, e. g. when the entire advantage is given to an influence trader, who asserts only his or her influence (without pretending the commission of <b>active</b> <b>bribery).</b> In this regard the Hungarian legislation is not in conformity with the requirements of the COE Convention, which oblige member states to active trading in influence irrespective of the allegation of bribery. Hungarian criminal law shall be harmonized with the requirements of the COE Convention by penalizing active trading in influence. ...|$|E
40|$|In Hungary {{there is}} a wide range of acts of {{corruption}} forbidden by criminal law. As of 1 April 2002 the measures of penal law applicable in the crackdown on corruption were further extended. In the Hungarian Criminal Code the system of corruption offences are as follows: bribery (official bribery, economic bribery, bribery in connection with hindering of official procedure), failure to report bribery, trading in influence, persecution of a conveyor of an announcement of public concern, crimes against the propriety of international affairs. Furthermore passive forms of bribery are traditionally judged more strictly than <b>active</b> <b>bribery</b> patterns. As regards the comparison of official and economic bribery, the degree of penal law sanctioning gradually came closer time to time. The criminal law regulation on bribery in international relations was introduced by Act of 1998 with due consideration to the OECD's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The sanctioning of bribery offences committed in national and international relationships is very similar in the Hungarian Criminal Code. ...|$|E

25|$|Tunisia is an export-oriented {{country in}} the process of liberalizing and privatizing an economy that, while {{averaging}} 5% GDP growth since the early 1990s, has suffered from corruption benefiting politically connected elites. Tunisia's Penal Code criminalises several forms of corruption, including <b>active</b> and passive <b>bribery,</b> abuse of office, extortion and conflicts of interest, but the anti-corruption framework is not effectively enforced. However, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index published annually by Transparency International, Tunisia was ranked the least corrupt Arab African-country in 2016, with a score of 41. Tunisia has a diverse economy, ranging from agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and petroleum products, to tourism. In 2008 it had a GDP of US$41 billion (official exchange rates), or $82 billion (purchasing power parity).|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to writing {{about the history of}} punishment, it is always linked with {{critically}} re-thinking and better understanding of the contemporary system of punishment, {{as a result of its}} long historical development. In such a way, „contemporary criminal law cannot be seen as a result of an effort made by a certain nation or in a certain epoch“. „Permanently faced with social changes, in its long historical development, criminal law has been modifying its fundamental principles and categories, by building new institutes and instruments, in order to become less cruel and more human, but not less efficient than in earlier stages of its development, characterized by rudeness, cruelty and exemplarity of its sanctions. Although it is not easy to answer the question, if there is the measure, in which social understanding of punishment and its purpose, determines the civilizational level in the society, there is no doubt about the fact that civilizational and legal point of view towards punishment derives from a waste range of factors: general, cultural, sociological, psychological, religious, political and other factors that should be taken altogether in their historical dimension. The genesis of criminal law is linked with the moment of establishing the public authorities and the state. According to different criteria, it is possible to introduce different periodization of criminal law. When {{it comes to}} the historical criterion, there can be made a historical division into periods of ancient, medieval, modern and contemporary criminal law (punishment), which periods should not be taken as absolutely inseparable.

Article {{deals with}} the concept of the person who shall be held {{equivalent}} to a civil servant as a subject of the crimes and misdemeanours against civil service and public interests and its interpretation in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Lithuania. Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (1999) has established requirements for states that are related to inter alia the criminalization of corruption in the private sector. Article 7 (“Active bribery in the private sector”) of the Convention determines that “Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally in the course of business activity, the promising, offering or giving, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage to any persons who direct or work for, in any capacity, private sector entities, for themselves or for anyone else, for them to act, or refrain from acting, in breach of their duties”, whereas Article 8 (“Passive bribery in the private sector”) of the Convention determines that “Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, in the course of business activity, the request or receipt, directly or indirectly, by any persons who direct or work for, in any capacity, private sector entities, of any undue advantage or the promise thereof for themselves or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in breach of their duties”. Analogous behaviours were required to be criminalized essentially under Council Framework Decision 2003 / 568 /JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector. International and EU law requirements were implemented by determining in the new Criminal Code of Lithuania (further – CC) that not only a civil servant, but also a person equivalent to a civil servant is liable for <b>active</b> <b>bribery,</b> bribery of an intermediary, passive bribery, abuse of office, unlawful registration of rights to an item, failure to perform official duties as crimes and misdemeanours against civil service and public interest. Precisely, according to Article 230 of the CC, “a person who works at any state, n on-state or private body, undertaking or organisation or engages in professional activities and holds appropriate administrative powers or has the right to act on behalf of this body, undertaking or organisation or provides public services shall also be held equivalent to a civil servant”. Supreme Court of Lithuania, interpreting the conception of a person equivalent to a civil servant, requires not only the establishment of formal compliance of position held with the requirements indicated in Article 230 of the CC, but also the establishment of the significance of performed activities for the civil service or public interests...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} to what extent companies can be held criminally liable for – <b>active</b> – <b>bribery</b> offences perpetrated by their employees. It focuses on the questions of to what extent companies have a duty of care to prevent bribery by employees {{and to what extent}} can a breach of such a duty of care cause criminal liability to ensue. In this contribution, the authors set out to answer these questions by comparing the Dutch and the British legal systems. After assessing the international and national legal frameworks, they conclude that the Dutch anti-corruption provisions are, compared to the British, broadly formulated, including ambiguous terms and that – {{as a result of this}} – their scope is somewhat vague. Due diligence measures have a varying effect on determining the criminal liability of companies. In contrast, the due diligence question has a fixed, unequivocal place in the UK system of determining criminal liability, making the UK system seem more straightforward. But still, neither anti-corruption legislation nor case law provides clarity as to the scope of due diligence measures. To increase legal certainty, this article calls upon the Dutch Government to produce guidelines, similar to the British MoJ Guidance, that provide specific examples of the details of a compliance scheme...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{public health}} service delivery at the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam National Hospital (S. S. R. N. H.) in Mauritius. Particular emphasis is laid on {{the historical development of}} {{public health service}} delivery at S. S. R. N. H. Public health service delivery has been approached from the view points of its nature and scope. The core components of the research survey have been on some major obstacles and flaws in effective public health service delivery at S. S. R. N. H. The measuring instrument used for the research survey was a self­ administered questionnaire. 	The main findings were discussed especially absenteeism, personnel turnover, stress, burnout, morale, sexual harassment, lethargy and disobedience, nepotism, shirking responsibility, alcohol and drug abuse, <b>active</b> political interference, <b>bribery</b> and corruption, dishonesty and retaliation and neglect of duty. Attention was also devoted on the current national health policy for improving public health service delivery at S. S. R. N. H., inter-alia, the National Policy for Public Heath Act 17 of 2000 and the White Paper on Health Sector Development and Reform of December 2003. The public health environment is constantly altering. Therefore, it is essential to adjust to the changing health environment. This dissertation has addressed the future challenges in the micro health environment and macro health environment of S. S. R. N. H. Ultimately, a holistic instead of a parochial approach to addressing shortcomings identified in public health service delivery at S. S. R. N. H. has been advocated in this dissertation.

40|$|In Dutch law {{there is}} no overall {{criminal}} offence on corruption. In Dutch criminal law corruption is divided in specific criminal offences which all have their own specific definition. Most corruption can be qualified as a criminal offence but it is sometimes difficult to qualify them as such. Qualifying in general as an offence is easy (forgery for example) but proving that the act specifically qualifies as corruption is harder. Given this general observation, a specific form of active corruption in the Dutch Criminal Code (DCC) seems relevant regarding to art. 2, par. 1, section a of the Framework Decision 2003 / 568 /JHA of 22 July 2003 on combatting corruption in the private sector. Art. 328 ter par. 2 of the DCC deals with bribery of a private person: punishable is the private person that gives or offers someone other than a civil servant, working in employement or acting as an agent, in exchange for something he has done or not done or will do or refrain from doing {{in the performance of}} his burden, a gift or promise, or a service of that nature or under such circumstances that he should reasonable assume that such a gift or promise will be withheld from his employer or principal contrary to good faith. This provision covers active corruption on the initiative of all private persons, including employees, managers and directors of private entities. However, this provision is limited to the bribery of employees and managers and seems to exclude the bribery of a director of a private entity. This means that this provision does not fully cover the obligation under art. 2, par. 1, section a of the Framework Decision 2003 / 568 /JHA. In addition to art. 328 ter DCC more general provisions can be used, especcially when the <b>active</b> corruption involves <b>bribery</b> of a director of a private entity. Dependant upon the circumstances of the case the provisions on forgery, falsifying of documents and cheating could be relevant. These circumstances should then involve: the forgery of a written statement with the intention to use this statement as genuine (art. 225 DCC), the falsification of stock certificates or other official certificates or documents, (art. 226 DCC) or the elements of cheating. In art. 326 of the DCC cheating is described as: the person who intentionally favours himself or another person in a unlawfull way, by using a false name, a false capacity, cunning manouvres or fabrications, moving another person to hand over a good, a service, information or a debt...|$|R
