The geometric locus of horopteric points in this plane {{takes the form of}} the arc of a circle (the Vieth-Müller circle) going from one nodal point to the other in space, passing through the fixation point.

The plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> process employs a plasma torch with a very narrow bore to produce a transferred arc to the workpiece. A technique for modelling plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> has been developed by applying the thermo-metallurgical model to the process and integrating a model of material removal to this model. The model is solved using the finite element method using the FE package SYSWORLD, more specifically SYSWELD. The objective {{is to determine the}} minimum energy required to cut a plate of some thickness using this virtual model. The characteristics of the cut need to exhibit the characteristics of a "high quality cut". The model presented can predict the kerf size given certain process variable settings. The numerical results obtained are assessed by conducting experiments. By maintaining Ill 1 rumum energy input cost savings can be made through energy savings, limiting additional finishing processes and reducing expense of shortening the electrode and nozzle lifetimes. The modelling of the PAC process using virtual design techniques provides a cost-effective solution to the manufacturing industries with respect to process specification development.

40|$|Abstract—Industrial surveys {{shows that}} {{manufacturing}} companies define {{the qualities of}} thermal removing process based on the dimension and physical appearance of the cutting material surface. Therefore, the roughness of the surface area of the material cut by the plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> process {{and the rate of}} the removed material by the manual plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> machine was importantly considered. Plasma arc cutter Selco Genesis 90 was used to cut Standard AISI 1017 Steel of 200 mm x 100 mm x 6 mm manually based on the selected parameters setting. The material removal rate (MRR) was measured by determining the weight of the specimens before and after the cutting process. The surface roughness (SR) analysis was conducted using Mitutoyo CS- 3100 to determine the average roughness value (Ra). Taguchi method was utilized to achieve optimum condition for both outputs studied. The microstructure analysis in the region of the cutting surface is performed using SEM. The results reveal that the SR values are inversely proportional to the MRR values. The quality of the surface roughness depends on the dross peak that occurred after the cutting process.

The optimization of the process parameters have been carried out using desirability function, grey based principal component analysis (PCA) hybrid approach, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing (SA) and teaching-learning-based-optimization (TLBO) algorithm coupled with response surface methodology (RSM).

Ion current signals collected by an electrostatic probe sweeping across a 30 A oxygen <b>cutting</b> <b>arc</b> at 3. 5 mm from the nozzle exit were registered for different nozzle lengths. The temperature and density radial profiles of the arc plasma were found in each case by an inversion procedure of these signals. A comparison between the obtained results shows that the shorter nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, L N = 4. 5 mm operated at 0. 7 MPa and 35 Nl/min) produces a thinner and hotter arc than the larger nozzle (RN = 0. 50 mm, LN = 9. 0 mm operated at 1. 1 MPa and 20 Nl/min). This behavior is attributed to the marked difference of gas flow rate due to the clogging effect. A smaller gas mass flow reduces the convective cooling at the arc border and decreases the power dissipation of the arc column, resulting in small axis temperatures. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In the present work, a three-dimensional numerical simulation using a plasma model combined with a melting process model is conducted and results are discussed, leading {{to a better understanding of}} the physical phenomena within the kerf region of a commercial plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> tool. The modeling includes three different phenomena: 1) the plasma jet flow, 2) the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method in identify the gas to molten metal interface, and 3) the phase change model for computing the melting process. The model is implemented in the open source CFD software, OpenFOAM. Thermodynamic and transport properties, calculated by kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics, are implemented for accurate simulation in the high temperature regions. The simulation results show the transient cutting process including the physical phenomena for melting of the work piece as well as the plasma flow. The simulated kerf shape is compared to measured kerf under same operations. Additionally, the temperature, velocity, and current density distributions are discussed to understand the plasma characteristics during the cutting process. In an attempt to make a more reasonable kerf shape, the swirl component of the jet, the surface tension and the phase change model are investigated for improvement and discussed.

Plasma <b>arc</b> <b>cutting</b> (PAC) is a widely used process for the cutting of different types of metals in several operating conditions.

The aim of the work is the optimization of PAC of mild steel thin plates, both in terms of cut quality and performances of the consumables, to achieve cut quality standards and productivity levels usually obtainable through laser cutting processes.
