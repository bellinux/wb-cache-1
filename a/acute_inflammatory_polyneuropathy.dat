40|$|Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} (<b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyneuropathy)</b> {{is a rare}} disorder with an {{incidence of}} one to two per 100, 000 per year (Kennedy et al., 1978) {{but it is the}} commonest cause of acute muscle weakness in patients under 40 years of age. The clinical diagnosis is made by finding a symmetrical motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy, commonly with cranial nerve involvement. Mechanical ventilation is required in 14 % of patients because of paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Early treatment with plasma exchange leads to more rapid and complete recovery of neurological function, and reduces the time spent on the ventilator. Early diagnosis and referral for plasma exchange is therefore very important. The present authors report a case in which abdominal pain was the patient's initial symptom and her main complaint...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Acute Human Immunodeficiency Virus {{infection}} {{is associated with}} a range of neurological conditions. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare presentation; <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> is the commonest form of Guillain-Barré syndrome. <b>Acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> has occasionally been reported in acute Immunodeficiency Virus infection but little data exists on frequency, management and outcome. Case presentation We describe an episode of Guillain-Barré syndrome presenting as <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> in a 30 -year-old man testing positive for Immunodeficiency Virus, probably during acute seroconversion. Clinical suspicion was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid analysis and nerve conduction studies. Rapid clinical deterioration prompted intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and early commencement of highly active anti-retroviral therapy. All symptoms resolved within nine weeks. Conclusion Unusual neurological presentations in previously fit patients are an appropriate indication for Immunodeficiency-Virus testing. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy with adequate penetration of the central nervous system should be considered as an early intervention, alongside conventional therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{combination}} of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ylated interferon (pegylated interferon) and ribavirin {{has been shown}} to be an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus. In general, common side effects related to this combination therapy are mild and are well tolerated. However, peripheral neuropathy including demyelinating polyneuropathy related to PEG-interferon α 2 a (pegylated interferon alfa- 2 a) is extremely rare. In the literature, only one case of <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> related to PEG-interferon α 2 a has been published previously. Case presentation To the best of our knowledge we present only the second case of <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> related to PEG-interferon α 2 a, occurring in a 63 -year-old Caucasian man. He developed tingling, numbness, and weakness of his upper and lower extremities with acute neurological deficits after five weeks of a combination therapy with PEG-interferon α 2 a and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. His clinical course, neurological findings, and his electromyogram results were all consistent with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy.</b> Our patient recovered completely after interferon was stopped and symptomatic treatment and a further electromyogram showed a disappearance of neuropathy. Four weeks later, PEG-interferon α 2 a was reintroduced with a gradually increasing dose without any reappearance of neurological symptoms allowing hepatitis C seroconversion. Conclusions Recognition of this rare yet possible presentation is important for early and accurate diagnosis and treatment. This case report also suggests that the reintroduction of PEGylated interferon in patients who had presented with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> related to interferon α may be safe, but this must be confirmed by further studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 43 -year-old man {{presenting}} with a 2 -week history of painless ascending sensory disturbances, suspected to be suffering from <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyneuropathy.</b> On clinical examination, deep tendon reflexes were preserved and muscle strength was 5 / 5 everywhere. Gait was ataxic with positive Romberg test. Lumbar puncture was normal and electroneurography demonstrated demyelination. With spinal cord involvement centred on the posterior tracts on MRI, differential diagnosis focused on cobalamin deficiency. Initial laboratory work up showed nearly normal holotranscobalamin (43  pmol/L, normal> 50) suggesting no vitamin B 12 deficiency. Surprisingly, further testing including methylmalonic acid (3732  nmol/L, normal< 271) and homocysteine (48. 5  µmol/L, normal< 10) showed an impairment of vitamin B 12 -dependent metabolism leading to the diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration. Only after repeated history taking did the patient remember having taken tablets containing cobalamin for 3  days before hospitalisation. In case of B 12 deficiency, holotranscobalamin can rapidly normalise during supplementation, whereas methylmalonic acid and homocysteine might help to detect B 12 deficiency in patients who recently started supplementation...|$|E
40|$|Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyneuropathy,</b> most {{commonly}} characterized by rapidly progressive, essentially symmetric weakness and areflexia(1). Since the marked decline in poliomyelitis incidence, GBS {{has become the}} most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis in children. There is no distinctive test to confirm the diagnosis of GBS, and there is considerable heterogeneity in the presentation and clinical course. Further, variants of the disease have emerged to make GBS a true syndrome rather than a specific disease. Epidemiology GBS, reported worldwide, involves both genders and all ages. The incidence of typical GBS has been reported to be between 0. 6 and 4 cases per 100000 population per year across the world (2), the incidence for children under 15 years being similar to that of adults. In a report from the northwest of Iran, the incidence rate was 2. 27 per 100000 population of ≤ 15 years children (3).

40|$|Background: Guillain-Barr&# 233; {{syndrome}} (GBS) is an <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> commonly {{characterized by}} rapidly progressive, symmetric weakness and areflexia. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively assessed the clinical manifestations, results of electrodiagnostic tests, functional status and prognosis of 36 children diagnosed with GBS. Results: Based on clinical and electrophysiological findings, {{the patients were}} classified as having acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) (n = 25), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) (n = 10) and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) (n = 1). Twenty (55. 5 &#x 0025;) patients were males and 16 (44. 5 &#x 0025;) patients were females. The {{mean age of the}} 36 patients was 68. 1 &# 177; 45. 01 months (range, 6 - 180 months). Five (13. 8 &#x 0025;) patients were younger than 2 years. The most common initial symptoms were limb weakness, which was documented in 34 (94. 4 &#x 0025;) patients. In our study, 18 patients (51. 4 &#x 0025;) showed albuminocytological dissociation (raised protein concentration without pleocytosis) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Three patients (8. 3 &#x 0025;) required mechanical ventilation therapy during hospitalization. Unfortunately, three (8. 3 &#x 0025;) patients died; one patient had AIDP and two patients had axonal involvement (one case was AMAN and another case was AMSAN). When we compared the cases of residual sequel/dead and cases of complete recovery for neural involvement type including AIDP, AMAN and AMSAN, we did not find a statistically significant difference between the groups (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: Our findings showed that cases of GBS was not uncommon in children younger than 2 years of age, and CSF protein level might be found high {{in the first week of}} the disease in about one half of the patients, with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in patients with axonal involvement than in those with AIDP...|$|E

40|$|Guillain — Barre {{syndrome}} (GBS) is {{an acute}} inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, with the autoimmune {{character of the}} peripheral nervous system disorder. More than 2 / 3 of the patients indicate a previous infection caused by Campylobacter jejuni (35 %), Cytomegalovirus (15 %), Epstein — Barr virus (10 %), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (5 %). <b>Acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> with listeriosis, {{which is based on}} an autoimmune response to infection, is rare; it has an extremely severe course with brain stem structures damage. An immunocompetent patient aged 20 admitted. The disease debuted with a body temperature raised to 38. 5 °C, progressive weakness in the legs which reached the umbilical region within 2 days. To the third day of the disease muscular weakness in the hands and pelvic disorders were added in the form of flatal incontinence. On the 4 th day of the disease the patient was hospitalized to the neurological (rehanimation) unit. At admission, the consciousness was clear. The examination showed eye slits D = S, pupils D = S, weakness of ocular convergence on both sides, weakness of abduction in all directions, nasolabial asymmetry, medial tongue. The pharyngeal reflex was preserved, the soft palate was movable. Hand tendon reflexes were alive, D = S. Knee jerk and Achilles reflexes were absent on both sides. Muscular strength was reduced to the level of pronounced lower paraparesis in the limbs, and down to 4 points in the hands. Conductive hypoesthesia was revealed from the Th 10 level. Meningeal signs were negative. Neurological symptoms increased quickly within 5 days: there was a pronounced upper paraparesis, ophthalmoplegic and bulbar syndromes, respiratory muscle paralysis. A tracheotomy was performed, followed by a transfer to APV. HIV EIA test as of 09. 11. 2016 showed negative result. SCT revealed no signs of volumetric and focal brain lesions. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis as of 07. 11. 2016 showed that CSF is clear and transparent, colorless, contains protein 0. 71 g/l, cytosis makes 1  cell per mcl (lymphocyte), red cell count was 1 – 3 per mcl, positive Pandy’s test, and glucose ratio of 3. 9 mmol/l. IIFT (IgM, liquor) as of 07. 11. 2016 indentified: negative Rubella virus; measles, mumps, Varicella zoster virus, adenovirus type 3; EBV, capsid antigen; Treponema pallidum; Toxoplasma gondii; HSV type I; negative HSV type II; Coxsackie virus type B 1; Coxsackie virus type А 7; Echo virus type 7; positive Borrelia afzelii; Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto; Borrelia garinii; Listeria monocytogenes 1 / 2 а; Listeria monocytogenes 4 b; СМV; negative Hemophilus influenza. PCR (liquor) as of 07. 11. 2016 showed: no Toxoplasma gondii, Human herpes virus type 6, СМV. IgM antibodies profile to Borrelia antigens in the immunoblotting reaction (blood) as of 09. 11. 2016 revealed specific antibodies of IgM class to Borrelia garinii (Flagellin, OspC); OspC to Borrelia afzelii — negative; OspC to Borrelia burgdorferi — negative. There was diagnosed Guillain — Barre acute inflammatory-allergic polyneuropathy (Landry type) with pronounced quadriparesis, bulbar syndrome, oculomotor dysfunctions, associated with ixodes tick borreliosis and listeriosis, which were confirmed by IgM revealed to Borrelia garinii (IIFT in the liquor and Western blot reaction in the blood), IgM to Listeria monocytogenes 1 / 2 а, 4 b (IIFT in the liquor). The therapy included immunovenin, 5 sessions of plasmapheresis, cefepime, retarpen, cytoflavinum, cycloferonum, ceraxon, actovegin, neuromidin, proserinum, combilipen, diclophenacum, nucleo CMP, mexidol, fluconazole, probiotics, glucose solution, panangin, insulin, L-lysine aescinat, berlithion, suprastin, lasix, berlipril, bisoprololum, tube feeding, APV, microclysters. Since the 48 th day of the disease the state of the patient started improving and the rapid recovery of neurological status was observed. Independent breathing restored. The laryngeal-pharyngeal reflexes, sensitive and motor activity in the upper extremities, the function of the pelvic organs restored as well. Legs began moving and became sensitive. The patient was transferred to the neurological department for community-base further care. The described clinical case demonstrated the complexity of etiological diagnosing severe form of acute polyneuropathy with bulbar syndrome. The absence of clinical and epidemiological data enables to suspect ITB and listeriosis as the cause of the disease that emphasizes the role of modern methods of examination of patients suffering from neuroinfection (IIFT, immunoblotting technique, PCR, etc.), with mandatory cerebrospinal fluid testing.

40|$|Introduction. Polyneuropathies or {{peripheral}} neuropathies {{present a}} dysfunction or disease of {{larger number of}} peripheral nerves or their dysfunction. Considering their morbidity - mortality characteristics they present an important aspect in daily clinical practice. One particular polyneuropathy that deserves special review is chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy,</b> which, due to its clinical - laboratory presentation, {{does not include the}} group of „simple” neuropathies, thus requiring further examinations. Neurophysiological testing should be performed using the protocol for neuropathy examinations. Neurophysiological examination, during the electroneurographic examination, shows neurographic parameters referring to polyneuropatic demyelinating type of lesion, while the electromyographic finding records the presence of neuropathic lesions (denervation activity, great action potentials with a reduced sample). Case report. A 54 -year-old patient was diagnosed to have a “complicated” demyelinating polyneuropathy according to the clinical-laboratory findings and electromyographic examination. Exclusion criteria, targeted diagnostic examinations, considering the mentioned peripheral neuropathies, pointed to <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy.</b> However, the chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> was finally differentiated during the clinical and electromyographic monitoring. Conclusion. The presented case is interesting because it shows how one can ”wander” towards the diagnosis, which is eventually {{made on the basis of}} electromyographic examination and monitoring as well as according to exclusion criteria, which have differentiated the <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> from the chronic one...|$|R

They are seen in less than 1 % of patients with malignancies and cause a variety of disorders, including hematologic, dermatologic, renal and neurologic abnormalities [1, 2]. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), or <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> (AIDP), is characterized by distal paresthesia and progressive bilateral, symmetric [4 - 10]. Since these associations are rare with only case reports in the literature, it is not truly known if the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes, such as GBS, should be considered when determining treatment intensity, or if the co-presence of these syndromes affects the prognosis of patients with underlying lymphoma. We describe the treatment and course of disease in a young man with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) with associated GBS. * Correspondence...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{examine the}} pattern and burden of {{neurologic}} disorders at electrophysiology lab of a tertiary care centre. Methodology: This retrospective chart review {{was carried out}} from the records and notes of electrophysiology lab in National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital (NINS) from January to December 2013. A total of 1372 patients were evaluated with nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) during this period. Result: Majority of the patients (67. 6 %) presented after forty {{with a mean age}} at presentation of 48. 11 ± 17. 3 years. The male patients (55. 2 %) predominated. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) was the most common condition (19. 2 %) observed, followed by different form of polyneuropathy namely Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) (6. 04 % with 50 % being <b>Acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> (AIDP), chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> (CIDP) (3. 27 %), sensory motor polyneuropathy 3. 13 % and multifocal acquired motor axonopathy (MAMA) 2. 55 %. Though plexopathy and radiculopathy were rare (1. 09 and 0. 94 % respectively), anterior hor...|$|R
40|$|Twenty five {{patients}} with peripheral neuropathy {{at different stages}} of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings were available in 17 cases, electrophysiology in all and a neuromuscular biopsy in 11. Of six otherwise asymptomatic HIV+ patients, five had chronic <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> (CIDP) and one <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> (AIDP). CSF showed pleocytosis in all cases. Infiltration of the endoneurium and/or the epineurium by mononuclear cells was seen in biopsies from three cases. These six patients recovered either spontaneously, or with corticosteroids or plasmaphereses. Of {{five patients}} with AIDS related complex (ARC), three had distal predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy (DSPN), one CIDP and one mixed neuropathy. Of 14 patients with AIDS, one had mononeuropathy multiplex and 13 painful DSPN. Electrophysiological studies were consistent with an axonopathy. Nerve biopsies in six cases showed axonal changes but surprisingly associated with marked segmental demyelination in two cases. Cell infiltration was present in nerve samples in two cases. Five patients died within six months after the onset of the neuropathy...|$|R
40|$|Immune {{mediated}} {{demyelinating disease}} after allogeneic stem cell transplantation {{is a rare}} entity with unclear etiology. <b>Acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating <b>polyneuropathy</b> (AIDP) has been reported after related and adult unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation but no such case has been reported after unrelated cord blood transplantation. We hereby present the first case of AIDP after double umbilical cord blood transplantation (DUCBT). A 55 -year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) received a cord blood transplant for relapsed refractory disease with high risk cytogenetics. On day 221, patient presented with skin rash, tingling in both lower extremites, and ascending paralysis that progressed rapidly {{over the course of}} 2 days. The workup resulted in a diagnosis of AIDP and administration of intravenous immunoglobulins plus steroids was initiated. Motor and sensory powers were fully recovered and his chronic GVHD was managed for several months with single agent sirolimus...|$|R
