25|$|Because nuclei are all {{positively}} charged, they strongly repel one another. Normally, in {{the absence}} of a catalyst such as a muon, very high kinetic energies are required to overcome this charged repulsion. Extrapolating from known fusion rates, the rate for uncatalyzed fusion at room-temperature energy would be 50 orders of magnitude lower than needed to account for the reported excess heat. In muon-catalyzed fusion there are more fusions because the presence of the muon causes deuterium nuclei to be 207 times closer than in ordinary deuterium gas. But deuterium nuclei inside a palladium lattice are further apart than in deuterium gas, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> fewer fusion reactions, not more.|$|E

In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by [...] "youthful exuberance and desire for recognition".

The Governor, he declared, had given the number of evacuees first as 13,000, then as 14,000 and finally as 16,000. He asked for the situation to be clarified, stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13,000 could be accepted, 2,000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira. The situation, replied General Liddell on 19 July, [...] "is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> no civilians here whereas there are 22,000.
