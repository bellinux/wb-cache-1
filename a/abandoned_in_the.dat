5|$|During 1962 Sykes was {{approached}} by the Russian-American composer Nicolas Nabokov, who was interested in making an opera from the Pinfold story {{on the basis of}} a libretto provided by Sykes. Waugh gave his approval to the idea, and in March 1962 met with Nabokov. Discussions continued during the following months, before the project was <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic {{separation}} for {{uranium enrichment}} was <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-war period {{in favor of}} the more complicated, but more efficient, gaseous diffusion method. Although most of the calutrons of the Manhattan Project were dismantled {{at the end of the}} war, some remained in use to produce isotopically enriched samples of naturally occurring elements for military, scientific and medical purposes.|$|E
5|$|From 1871 to 1880, the Corradino Lines {{were built}} on the Corradino Heights. The V-shaped trace and ditch were meant to protect the {{dockyard}} and harbour from landward attacks. They were <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s due to advancements in technology, although they saw some use once again in World War II.|$|E

5|$|The pavilion's {{construction}} was {{aided by the}} French CATIA software program and internet conferencing. Early plans to incorporate a surrounding waterfall and stairway were <b>abandoned.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, budget limitations led to compromises with the original architectural plan that left many elements in their most straightforward form, such as exposed pipes and conduits, or rough concrete.|$|E
5|$|A new {{publication}} called Classic Rock, featuring Barton {{and many}} of the writers from Kerrang!s first run, championed the NWOBHM revival and continues to focus much of its attention on rock acts from the 1980s. Starting in the 2000s, many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles, <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of the 1980s. Their presence, at metal festivals and on the international rock club circuit, has been constant ever since.|$|E
5|$|A station {{here was}} part of the {{abandoned}} phase two expansion of the Fleet line (now Jubilee line). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.|$|E

5|$|After Aymer's {{death in}} 1324, the castle passed by {{marriage}} to Lawrence, Lord Hastings, and {{was held in}} the Hastings family until 1390, when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it. There are few historical records of the castle beyond this point, but it appears to have been <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 14th century and by the 15th century had become ruined.|$|E
5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century {{agricultural community}} {{of the same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the American Civil War. It was strategically important during {{the early stages of the}} war, due to its proximity to fresh water and the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching its low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of oil. A fictional lake of the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Broadly speaking, {{daylight}} saving time was <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{years after the war}} (with some notable exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, and Ireland). However, it was brought back for periods of time in many different places during the following decades and commonly during World War II. It became widely adopted, particularly in North America and Europe, starting in the 1970s {{as a result of the}} 1970s energy crisis.|$|E
5|$|Castle Hill, {{also called}} Mere Castle, was a medieval {{fortification}} built by Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, in 1253 {{on a hill}} overlooking the village of Mere, Wiltshire, England. The castle was constructed in stone, with six towers, inner buildings and gates. It was <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 14th century and stripped of its stone and metalwork. Only earthworks remain in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de San José was largely <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E

5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. They {{appear to have been}} largely <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Roman period, both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of the threat posed by Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|The California Highway Commission {{considered}} several easterly routes between Saugus and Gorman: Soledad Canyon (used by the Southern Pacific) had frequent washouts; Mint Canyon (used by the Midway Route) was {{too long}} and cost too much; Bouquet Canyon (used by both automobile routes) had bad drainage; and San Francisquito Canyon (used by the Tejon Pass Route) was steep and narrow. Another possible route, through Piru Canyon to the west, was rejected because of {{a proposal for a}} dam. This route was later chosen for the Ridge Route Alternate, but had to be <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s due to the construction of Pyramid Lake.|$|E
5|$|The border fortifications were {{progressively}} {{torn down}} and eventually <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> months following its opening. Dozens of new crossings were opened by February 1990, and the guards no longer carried weapons nor made much effort to check travellers' passports. The guards' numbers were rapidly reduced; half were dismissed within {{five months of}} the opening. On 1July 1990 the border was abandoned and the Grenztruppen were officially abolished; all but 2,000 of them were dismissed or transferred to other jobs.|$|E

On 20 August 2006, the final section opened, from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass, with the whole project costing NOK1,348 million.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO2). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial {{relation to the}} iron ores. Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, Gabon and Brazil. According to 1978 estimate, the ocean floor has 500 billion tons of manganese nodules. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Although Aucouturier had <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first stage, {{and so was}} not {{eligible}} for the general classification, he could still start {{the rest of the}} stages. In the second stage, Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second stage, which eliminated him from the race.|$|E
50|$|A {{direct line}} to Leeds was also planned but {{following}} Hudson’s downfall this was <b>abandoned.</b> Authorised <b>in</b> 1846 and <b>abandoned</b> <b>in</b> 1849 <b>the</b> only tangible {{evidence of this}} line is a railway viaduct built at Tadcaster.|$|R
