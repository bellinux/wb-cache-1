40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on the impact of}} social {{developments}} related to "globalisation" on education. In line with the world systems approach as most prominently expounded by Immanuel Wallerstein the author conceptualises globalisation not as a new development, but as the current expression of a long historical process originating in sixteenth century Europe. In order to make use of world systems theory for education, the author makes a strong argument in favour of taking Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s concepts of cultural capital and the relative <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> into account. On this basis, the author reviews a secondary analysis based on numerous studies of national education systems with respect to the various degrees of convergence, divergence and variation. It is argued with reference to the neo-institutionalist approach of the Stanford group that convergence and standardisation in education are not questions of affirmation or rejection as much as historical processes that by no means imply a deterministic implementation of an economic rationale.

3000|$|The {{study of}} contextual effects on migrant pupils’ {{scholastic}} performance is relatively recent. This study examines {{the influence of}} three important aspects <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> on the <b>educational</b> performance <b>of</b> migrant children. National education systems differ for instance in the number <b>of</b> distinct <b>educational</b> programs at secondary education, {{the age at which}} children are selected into different educational programs, and the existence of nationally standardized examinations at the end of primary and secondary education (Shavit and Blossfeld, 1993; Shavit and Müller, 1998). Although these different educational structures have been suggested to explain differences in the <b>educational</b> success <b>of</b> migrants across countries, there is little systematic evidence for this claim (Buchmann and Parrado, 2006; Heath and Birnbaum, 2007). Moreover, no study so far has taken into account <b>educational</b> <b>system</b> features <b>of</b> migrant children’s countries of origin. Since first generation migrant children might have attended school in their origin countries (Rumbaut, 2004), their educational performance is partly determined by the structure and organization of education in those countries. Therefore, in order to establish the effects <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> on the scholastic performance of migrant children, characteristics <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> origin countries must be studied. Levels et al. (2008) analyzed only general macro-characteristics of the origin and destination countries and found significant effects of economic development and political stability of the origin countries. However, these results might be explained by features <b>of</b> the <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> the countries of origin and destination, because the level of economic development and political stability will be related to some characteristics <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore we try to answer the following research question: To what extent is the <b>educational</b> performance <b>of</b> 15 -year-old migrant children determined by the degree of differentiation and standardization and the level <b>of</b> resources <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> both their countries of origin and destination, also after controlling for the economic and political macro-characteristics of the countries of origin?

Moreover, {{in order to provide}} more robust tests of hypotheses concerning effects <b>of</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems,</b> information from a larger number of destination countries would be necessary.
