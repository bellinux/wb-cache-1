5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by circulatory {{patterns in the}} atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than <b>a</b> <b>millimeter.</b> Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension {{on the order of}} <b>a</b> <b>millimeter,</b> as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.|$|E

A third design, {{referred to as the}} Rendezvous Earth Finder mission, is based on <b>a</b> 40 <b>millimeter</b> starshade and is currently under study. This paper presents error budgets for the detection of Earth-like planets with each of these missions. The budgets include manufacture and deployment tolerances, the allowed thermal fluctuations and dynamic motions, formation flying alignment requirements, surface and edge reflectivity requirements, and the allowed transmission due to micrometeoroid damage...|$|R

25|$|There was a {{time when}} {{deviations}} from the truly beautiful page proportions 2:3, 1:√3, and the Golden Section were rare. Many books produced between 1550 and 1770 show these proportions exactly, to within half <b>a</b> <b>millimeter.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{tentative}} (but inconclusive) field identification {{can be made}} of this thrips by {{searching for}} the following traits under low power magnification: small size (under <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> in length), yellow coloration, dark antennae, and dark striping on the lower abdomen.|$|E

25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} less than <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> in length, kidney-shaped, and have a pitted surface. It takes 3,300 poppy seeds {{to make up a}} gram, and between 1 and 2million seeds to make up a pound. The primary flavor {{compound}} is 2-Pentylfuran.|$|E
25|$|Jellyfish lifespans {{typically}} {{range from}} a few hours (in the case of some very small hydromedusae) to several months; there are some indications that deep sea species may live {{on the order of}} years. Life span varies by species. Most large coastal jellyfish live 2 to 6 months, during which they grow from <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> or two to many centimeters in diameter.|$|E
25|$|One {{can think}} of MEMS {{resonators}} as small bells that ring at high frequencies. Small bells ring at higher frequencies than large bells, and since MEMS resonators are small they can ring at high frequencies. Common bells are meters down to centimeters across and ring at hundreds of hertz to kilohertz; MEMS resonators are a tenth of <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> across and ring at tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz. MEMS resonators have operated at over a gigahertz.|$|E

25|$|Separators have to {{physically}} {{separate the two}} electrodes to prevent a short circuit by direct contact. It can be very thin (a few hundredths of <b>a</b> <b>millimeter)</b> and must be very porous to the conducting ions to minimize ESR. Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers. More sophisticated designs use nonwoven porous polymeric films like polyacrylonitrile or Kapton, woven glass fibers or porous woven ceramic fibres.|$|E
25|$|As {{the piston}} moves in and out, the seal drags and {{stretches}} on the piston, causing the seal to twist. The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of <b>a</b> <b>millimeter.</b> The piston {{is allowed to}} move out freely, but the slight amount of drag caused by the seal stops the piston from fully retracting to its previous position when the brakes are released, and so takes up the slack caused by the wear of the brake pads, {{eliminating the need for}} return springs.|$|E
25|$|More {{accurately}} {{known as}} limiting resolution, tube resolution {{is measured in}} line pairs per millimeter or lp/mm. This {{is a measure of}} how many lines of varying intensity (light to dark) can be resolved within <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> of screen area. However the limiting resolution itself {{is a measure of the}} Modulation Transfer Function. For most tubes, the limiting resolution is defined as the point at which the modulation transfer function becomes three percent or less. The higher the value, the higher the resolution of the tube.|$|E

50|$|The linear or widely {{lance-shaped}} {{leaves are}} narrow, up to 4.5 centimeters long but only <b>a</b> few <b>millimeters</b> side. The flowers occur in long, erect spikes. Each flower is a rounded, lobed, pocket-like structure with 4 curving sepals and usually two whitish petals {{which may be}} partially fused together. The fruit is a capsule <b>a</b> few <b>millimeters</b> long containing tiny shiny black seeds.|$|R

25|$|Depending on the frequency, waveguides can be {{constructed}} from either conductive or dielectric materials. Generally, the lower the frequency to be passed the larger the waveguide is. For example, the natural waveguide the earth forms given by the dimensions between the conductive ionosphere and the ground {{as well as the}} circumference at the median altitude of the Earth is resonant at 7.83Hz. This is known as Schumann resonance. On the other hand, waveguides used in extremely high frequency (EHF) communications can be less than <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> in width.|$|E
25|$|After {{a growth}} interval, the polyp begins {{reproducing}} asexually by budding and, in the Scyphozoa, {{is called a}} segmenting polyp, or a scyphistoma. Budding produces more scyphistomae and also ephyrae. Budding sites vary by species; from the tentacle bulbs, the manubrium (above the mouth), or the gonads of hydromedusae. Polyps asexually produce free-swimming ephyra, which then become a medusa. New specimens (usually only <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> or two across) swim away from the polyp and then grow. Some polyps can asexually produce a creeping frustule larval form, which then develops into another polyp.|$|E
25|$|Medical ultrasonography, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI), confocal microscopy, and OCT are differently suited to morphological tissue imaging: while the first two have whole body but low resolution imaging capability (typically a fraction of <b>a</b> <b>millimeter),</b> the third one can provide images with resolutions well below 1 micrometer (i.e. sub-cellular), between 0 and 100 micrometers in depth, and the fourth can probe as deep as 500 micrometers, but with a lower (i.e. architectural) resolution (around 10 micrometers in lateral and a few micrometers in depth in ophthalmology, for instance, and 20 micrometers in lateral in endoscopy).|$|E

25|$|These {{core drill}} bits {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to reamers as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. Core drill bits differ from reamers {{in the amount of}} material they are intended to remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps <b>a</b> <b>millimeter.</b> A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.|$|E
25|$|A {{claystone}} is lithified, and non-fissile mudrock. In {{order for}} a rock {{to be considered a}} claystone, it must consist of up to fifty percent clay, which measures less than 1/256 of <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> in particle size. Clay minerals are integral to mudrocks, and represent the first or second most abundant constituent by volume. There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth. They make muds cohesive and plastic, or able to flow. Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. Most materials in nature are clay minerals, but quartz, feldspar, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral.|$|E
25|$|Because the ammolite {{layer is}} usually mere {{fractions}} of <b>a</b> <b>millimeter</b> in thickness, most ammolite gems {{are in fact}} composite stones: these usually {{take the form of}} two-part doublets, with the ammolite layer adhered to a dark backing material. This is usually the matrix or mother rock from which the ammolite was quarried; black onyx or glass could also be used as backing. In composites where the ammolite layer is exceptionally thin, a third component is used: this constitutes a triplet, with a durable and transparent convex topping piece. This cap may be either synthetic spinel, synthetic corundum, synthetic quartz, or in lower-end productions, glass. The convex cap acts as a lens and has the effect of enhancing the ammolite's iridescent display.|$|E
