In confidential proceedings the Court may assist both parties in securing a settlement, in which case the Court monitors the compliance of the agreement with the Convention. However, in many cases, a hearing is not held. The judgment of the Grand Chamber is final. Judgments by the Chamber of the Court becomes final three months after they are issued, unless a reference to the Grand Chamber for review or appeal has been made. If the panel of the Grand Chamber rejects the request for referral, the judgment of the Chamber of the Court becomes final.

We find that a lower overnight interest rate induces lowly capitalized banks to grant more loan applications to ex ante risky firms and to commit larger loan volumes with fewer collateral requirements to these firms, yet with a higher ex post likelihood of default.

40|$|International audienceResource {{management}} {{is critical for}} application domains where components share their execution environments but belong to dif-ferent stakeholders, such as smart homes or cloud systems. Yet, current middleware <b>and</b> <b>application</b> containers often hide system-level details needed for dynamic resource management. In particular, they tend to hide resource usage by offering automatic management of these resources (e. g., CPU, memory and I/O). In contrast, system-level containers, such as Linux Containers (LXC), allow fine-grain resource management. How-ever, they lack knowledge about the application's structure and its re-quirements {{in order to provide}} fine tuned resource management. In this tutorial, we will expose Squirrel: a new middleware which aims at combining the benefits from the component based software engineering to design flexible <b>and</b> modular <b>application</b> <b>and</b> the system level contain-ers to manage resources. Squirrel follows an approach where develop-ers specifies <b>contracts</b> on components <b>and</b> connections to describe the expected behavior of their application regarding resource consumption. These high level contracts are then used to automatically configure the system level containers which will hosts the running applications. At the end of this tutorial, applicants will be able to design <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracts</b> using Squirrel <b>and</b> run their <b>application</b> inside system level containers to ensure a correct behavior of their application regarding resource consumption...|$|R
40|$|To {{continue}} to grow, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires scalable and secure system software solutions for resource constrained devices. To maximize {{return on investment}} of these devices, IoT platforms should support multiple third party <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> adaptation of software over time. However, realizing the vision of shared IoT platforms de mands not only strong guarantees on the confidentiality <b>and</b> integrity of <b>application</b> data, but also guarantees {{on the use of}} critical resources such as computation, sensors and energy. We refer to this vision as resource security. Prior research on Operating Systems (OS) for tiny IoT devices has focused on miniaturizing core functionality such as scheduling and communication and does not consider resource security. To address this problem, we introduce CerberOS, a resource secure OS for sharing IoT devices. CerberOS enables mul tiple applications on constrained IoT devices while, for the first time, guaranteeing data confidentiality, integrity and se cure resource management. Our approach is based upon the twin pillars of virtualization, which isolates <b>applications,</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracts,</b> which control <b>application</b> resource usage.

40|$|This paper studies how credit {{constraints}} develop over bank relationships. I analyze {{a unique}} dataset of matched loan <b>application</b> <b>and</b> loan <b>contract</b> information <b>and</b> measure credit constraints as {{the ratio of}} requested to granted loan amounts. I find {{that the most important}} determinants of receiving smaller than requested loan amounts are firm age and size {{at the time of the}} first interaction between borrower and bank. Over loan sequences, credit constraints decease most pronouncedly in the beginning of relationships and for the initially young and small firms. Moreover, the structure of the dataset allows me to disentangle the demand and supply effects behind these observed credit constraints. I find that the gap between requested and granted loan amounts decreases because both sides converge. If previous credit constraints were large, requested amounts increase more moderately, while granted amounts increase more strongly than in the case of small previous constraints. The findings are a sign of the use of dynamic incentives at the bank side to overcome information problems when contracting repeatedly with opaque borrowers. The results further suggest that, particularly in the beginning of a bank relationship, borrowers learn from their previous experience with credit constraints and adjust their demand accordingly. ...|$|R
40|$|Repackaged {{applications}} {{are based on}} genuine applications, but they subtlety include some modifications. In particular, trojanized {{applications are}} one of the most dangerous threats for smartphones. Malware code may be hidden inside applications to access private data or to leak user credit. In this paper, we propose a contract-based approach to detect such repackaged applications, where a contract specifies the set of legal actions that can be performed by an application. Current methods to generate contracts lack information from real usage scenarios, thus being inaccurate and too coarse-grained. This may result either in generating too many false positives or in missing misbehaviors when verifying the compliance between the <b>application</b> <b>and</b> the <b>contract.</b> In the proposed framework, application contracts are generated dynamically by a central server merging execution traces collected and shared continuously by collaborative users executing the application. More precisely, quantitative information extracted from execution traces is used to define a contract describing the expected application behavior, which is deployed to the cooperating users. Then, every user can use the received contract to check whether the related application is either genuine or repackaged. Such a verification is based on an enforcement mechanism that monitors the application execution at run-time and compares it against the contract through statistical tests...|$|R
