5|$|Central <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in March 1940, and covered the central portion of New South Wales. Headquartered at Sydney, Central <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. It was disbanded in August 1941 and control of its units taken over by other RAAF formations. Proposals in 1943–44 to raise a new Central <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> did not come to fruition.|$|E
5|$|North-Western <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. Its wartime sphere of operations included the Northern Territory, adjacent portions of Queensland and Western Australia, and the Dutch East Indies. The command was formed in January 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War, from the western part of Northern <b>Area</b> <b>Command,</b> which had covered all of northern Australia and Papua. Headquartered at Darwin, North-Western <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was initially responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|North-Eastern <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> {{was formed}} at Townsville, Queensland, on 15January 1942, {{taking over the}} eastern portion of what was {{previously}} Northern <b>Area</b> <b>Command.</b> Northern Area had been established on 8May 1941 {{as one of the}} RAAF's geographically based command-and-control zones, and covered northern New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Papua. The roles of the area commands were air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance. Each area was led by an Air Officer Commanding (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary.|$|E

5|$|Northern <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in May 1941, and covered the whole of northern Australia and Papua. Headquartered at Townsville, Queensland, Northern <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. In January 1942, following the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was divided into North-Western and North-Eastern Area Commands, to counter Japanese threats to northern Australia and Papua, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On 15January 1942, Northern Area {{was split}} into North-Western Area and North-Eastern Area, to counter {{distinct}} Japanese threats to Ambon and Darwin {{in the former}} case, and Rabaul and Port Moresby in the latter. Lukis remained at Townsville as AOC of the new North-Eastern <b>Area</b> <b>Command.</b> North-Western <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was headquartered at Darwin, Northern Territory; its inaugural AOC was Air Commodore Douglas Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's <b>area</b> <b>command</b> {{structure}} was revised in 1942, following {{the outbreak of}} the Pacific War: Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command covering New South Wales and southern Queensland, Eastern Area, was created, making a total of five commands. In October 1943, the Air Board proposed carving a new Central <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> out of Eastern Area, which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision. This Central <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland. The War Cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time the new Central <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland. Once again, nothing came of the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Western <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in January 1941, and controlled RAAF units located in Western Australia. Headquartered at Perth, Western <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. Its aircraft conducted anti-submarine operations throughout the war, and attacked targets in the Dutch East Indies during the Borneo campaign in 1945. Western <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> continued to operate following the end of the war, before its responsibilities were subsumed in 1954 by the RAAF's new functional command-and-control system; the headquarters was disbanded two years later.|$|E
5|$|As of 20April 1942, {{operational}} {{authority over}} all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was {{invested in the}} newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under South West Pacific <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> (SWPA). On 15May, Southern Area, which by then was considered too large, yielded responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new <b>area</b> <b>command,</b> Eastern Area. Control of maintenance units under Southern Area {{was transferred to the}} newly established No.4 (Maintenance) Group in Melbourne on 14September. September also saw the formation of RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA. Bostock exercised control of air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority over Australian units.|$|E
5|$|In March 1940, the RAAF began {{dividing}} Australia and New Guinea into geographically based command-and-control zones; No.1 AD {{came under}} the auspices of Southern <b>Area</b> <b>Command,</b> which was headquartered in Melbourne and was responsible for RAAF units located in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The depot spawned Nos.1 and 2Aircraft Parks, which were dedicated to aircraft assembly, in April–May 1940, and No.1 Replenishing Unit, which was responsible for the upkeep of ordnance and ammunition at units in Southern Area, in June 1942. In October that year, control of No.1 AD was transferred from Southern <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> to the recently formed No.4 Maintenance Group, also headquartered in Melbourne, which took over responsibility for maintenance units in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|The Federal {{government}} retired Air Marshal Jones in 1952 {{and replaced}} him with Air Marshal Donald Hardman, RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands in October 1953. The first was re-formed from Eastern <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> {{as it was}} considered the RAAF's de facto operational organisation. The second was re-formed from Southern <b>Area</b> <b>Command,</b> {{as it was the}} hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and last functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Areas.|$|E
5|$|To help {{overcome}} the static {{nature of the}} <b>area</b> <b>command</b> system, in September 1942 the RAAF created a large mobile formation known as No.9 (Operational) Group, a self-contained tactical air force that could keep pace with Allied advances north through New Guinea and towards Japan. By April 1944, No.9 Group had become a garrison force in New Guinea and lost its mobile function to No.10 (Operational) Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force). No.9 Group was therefore re-formed as a dedicated <b>area</b> <b>command</b> covering air units in New Guinea; Bostock had recommended calling it Northern Area, before RAAF Headquarters settled on Northern Command. In August that year, RAAF Headquarters proposed disbanding the training and maintenance groups formed in 1941–42 and return their functions to {{the control of the}} area commands, but no action was taken. The same month, the Air Board recommended carving a new Central <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> out of Eastern Area, which it considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters. This proposed Central Area would have been responsible for units in southern Queensland but the War Cabinet deferred its decision, as it had when a similar concept was raised in October 1943.|$|E

Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings, with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E

One of these would have been Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory. The Australian Government rejected the plan and the wartime <b>area</b> <b>command</b> boundaries essentially remained in place until supplanted in 1953–54 by a functional command-and-control system made up of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands.|$|E

5|$|Headquartered in the Sydney {{suburb of}} Edgecliff, Eastern <b>Area</b> <b>Command</b> was formed on 15May 1942 under the {{leadership}} of Air Vice Marshal Bill Anderson. Staff numbered 114, including forty-five officers. Training units in New South Wales remained part of No.2 (Training) Group. No.5 (Maintenance) Group was formed in Sydney on 1June, and took responsibility for all maintenance units initially controlled by Eastern <b>Area</b> <b>Command.</b> In September, the Allied Air Forces commander in the South West Pacific Area, Major General George Kenney, formed the majority of his US flying units into the Fifth Air Force, and most of their Australian counterparts into RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock. Bostock exercised control of Australian air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority, meaning that Bostock and his area commanders were ultimately dependent on the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, for supplies and equipment.|$|E

The following month, Air Vice Marshal Jones proposed reducing the five mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The proposal {{was part of a}} much larger plan to restructure the post-war RAAF; the Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime <b>area</b> <b>command</b> boundaries largely remained in place.
