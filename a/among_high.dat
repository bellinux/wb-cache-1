Gottesman testified that genes influenced IQ, but only in conjunction with elements such as schooling, money, and nutritious food from childhood onwards. In 2003, he and colleagues published a study showing that heritability was higher for IQ differences within high socioeconomic status (SES) people than among low SES people, i.e., genes influenced differences between children's test scores more <b>among</b> <b>high</b> SES than among low SES children.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze <b>among</b> <b>high</b> society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{predictors of}} career adaptability skill <b>among</b> <b>higher</b> education students in Nigeria. A sample of 603 higher education students {{randomly selected from}} six colleges of education in Nigeria participated in this study. A set of self-reported questionnaire was used for data collection, and multiple linear regression {{analysis was used to}} analyze the data. Results indicated that 33. 3 % of career adaptabil- ity skill was explained by the model. Four out of the ve predictor variables signi cantly predicted career adaptability skill <b>among</b> <b>higher</b> education students in Nigeria. Among the four predictors, career self-e cacy sources was the most statistically signi cant pre-dictor of career adaptability skill <b>among</b> <b>higher</b> education students in Nigeria, followed by personal goal orientation, career future concern, and perceived social support respec- tively. Vocational identity did not statistically predict career adaptability skill <b>among</b> <b>higher</b> education students in Nigeria. The study suggested that similar study should be replicated {{in other parts of the}} world in view of the importance of career adaptability skill to the smooth transition of graduates from school to the labor market. The study concluded by requesting stakeholders of higher institutions in Nigeria to provide career exploration database for the students, and encourage career intervention program in order to enhance career adaptability skill among the students...|$|R
40|$|In {{two studies}} we {{hypothesized}} that outgroup perspective-taking promotes group-based guilt among weakly identifi ed perpetrator group members, but hinders it <b>among</b> <b>higher</b> identifiers. In Study 1, native Dutch participants (N = 153) confronted their group’s past mistreatment of outgroups, while perspective-taking was manipulated. This manipulation significantly increased guilt among lower identifi ers, but decreased guilt <b>among</b> <b>higher</b> identifi ers. In addition, guilt predicted positively participants’ support for reparation. In Study 2 (N = 217), we replicated this interaction and elaborated on its underlying processes. As predicted, perspective-taking positively predicted feelings of compassion for outgroup members, {{as well as the}} perceived responsibility of the ingroup for the harm infl icted. Path analyses indicated the dual role of compassion: it predicted guilt positively among lower identifiers, but negatively <b>among</b> <b>higher</b> identifiers. The double-edged potential of perspective-taking for improving relations between groups that have a history on conflict is discussed...|$|R

Research has examined 13 high achievers from various professions, {{all of whom had}} experienced challenges in the workplace and negative life events over the course of their careers but who had also been recognized for their great achievements in their respective fields. Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, sense of control, flexibility and adaptability, balance and perspective, and perceived social support. High achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies, exercising, and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones.|$|E
25|$|Our {{knowledge}} of this period is supplemented by Pali Buddhist texts. Whereas the Brahmanical texts speak of the four-fold varna system, the Buddhist texts present an alternative picture of the society, stratified {{along the lines of}} jati, kula and occupation. It is likely that the varna system, while being a part of the Brahmanical ideology, was not practically operative in the society. In the Buddhist texts, Brahmin and Kshatriya are described as jatis rather than varnas. They were in fact the jatis of high rank. The jatis of low rank were mentioned as chandala and occupational classes like bamboo weavers, hunters, chariot-makers and sweepers. The concept of kulas was broadly similar. Along with Brahmins and Kshatriyas, a class called gahapatis (literally householders, but effectively propertied classes) was also included <b>among</b> <b>high</b> kulas. The people of high kulas were engaged in occupations of high rank, viz., agriculture, trade, cattle-keeping, computing, accounting and writing, and those of low kulas were engaged in low-ranked occupations such as basket-weaving and sweeping. The gahapatis were an economic class of land-holding agriculturists, who employed dasa-kammakaras (slaves and hired labourers) to work on the land. The gahapatis were the primary taxpayers of the state. This class was apparently not defined by birth, but by individual economic growth.|$|E
