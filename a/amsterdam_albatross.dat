5|$|The adult plumage {{of most of}} the {{albatrosses}} {{is usually}} some variation of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. The extent of colouration varies: the southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges of the wings in fully mature males, while the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross</b> has an almost juvenile-like breeding plumage {{with a great deal of}} brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest. Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape. Three albatross species, the black-footed albatross and the two sooty albatrosses, vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown (or dark grey in places in the case of the light-mantled albatross).

5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross</b> with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial.

50|$|The great {{albatrosses}} are seabirds in {{the genus}} Diomedea in the albatross family. The genus Diomedea formerly included all albatrosses except the sooty albatrosses, but in 1996 the genus was split, with the mollymawks and the North Pacific albatrosses both being elevated to separate genera.

[...] The group was eventually subsumed into, and its work continued by, the Southern Oceans Seabird Study Association (SOSSA), established in 1994 by members of the NSWASG as an umbrella organisation for many groups involved in studies of the biodiversity of the Southern Ocean.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>{{albatross}}</b> or Amsterdam Island albatross, Diomedea amsterdamensis, {{is a huge}} albatross which breeds only on Amsterdam Island in {{the southern}} Indian Ocean. It was only described in 1983, and was thought by some researchers to be a sub-species of the wandering albatross, D. exulans. BirdLife International and the IOC recognize it as a species, James Clements does not, and the SACC has a proposal {{on the table to}} split the species. More recently, mitchondrial DNA comparisons between the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross,</b> the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, the Antipodean albatross D. antipodensis and the Tristan albatross D. dabbenena, provide clear genetic evidence that the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross</b> is a separate species.|$|E
50|$|Because of its rarity, {{the feeding}} ecology and at-sea {{distribution}} of the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross</b> is not well understood, although {{it is believed that}} the birds eat squid, crustaceans, and fish.

5000|$|The {{albatrosses}} and petrels are [...] "amongst {{the most}} severely threatened taxa worldwide".

Several species {{are among the most}} common of seabirds, including Wilson's storm petrel (an estimated 12 to 30 million individuals) and the short-tailed shearwater (23 million individuals); while the total population of some other species is a few hundred. There are less than 200 Magenta petrels breeding on the Chatham Islands, only 130 to 160 Zino's petrels and only 170 <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatrosses.</b> Only one species is thought to have become extinct since 1600, the Guadalupe storm petrel of Mexico, although a number of species had died out before this. Numerous species are very poorly known; for example, the Fiji petrel has rarely been seen since its discovery. The breeding colony of the New Zealand storm petrel was not located until February 2013; it had been thought extinct for 150 years until its rediscovery in 2003, while the Bermuda petrel had been considered extinct for nearly 300 years.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} century or so a {{combination}} of factors caused further ecological devastation of the island, which had already been impacted by the introduction of invasive species of plants and animals, as well as by unrestricted hunting, timber-cutting and wildfire caused by sealers and other visitors. The Amsterdam duck and several species of petrel became extinct, and the breeding population of the endemic <b>Amsterdam</b> Island <b>albatross,</b> previously thought to be a subspecies of the wandering albatross, was reduced to just five pairs.|$|R
5000|$|These {{isolated}} {{islands are}} not rich in wildlife diversity but {{are home to}} a large population of subantarctic fur seal.

50|$|The <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>{{albatross}}</b> {{is a great}} albatross that breeds in brown, {{rather than}} in the more usual white, plumage. This bird weighs 4.8 to(-) 8 kg and is 107 to(-) 122 cm long with a wingspan of 280 to(-) 340 cm. The adult bird has chocolate brown upper parts and is white on its face mask, throat, lower breast, and belly. It has a broad brown breast band along with brown undertail coverts. Its pink bill has a dark tip and dark cutting edges, and finally, its underwings are white except for the dark tip and the dark leading edge.|$|E
5000|$|Amsterdam {{albatrosses}} breed biennially in open marshy ground. Both parents incubate the egg in alternate stints {{that last}} {{for about a}} week, with the chick hatching after 80 days. The chick is brooded for a month, and overall takes 230 days to fledge. At first it is fed by its parents every three days, with the feeding frequency reduced as it approaches fledging. At the peak of weight gain the chick weighs more than its parents, but then loses weight as the extra reserves are used to grow feathers. Having fledged, the young bird stays at sea for around five years {{before returning to the}} colony, and begins breeding a few years later. The breeding [...] "language" [...] of the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross</b> {{is similar to that of}} the wandering albatross.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross</b> {{is listed}} as {{critically}} endangered, by the IUCN, with an occurrence range of 4400000 km2 and a breeding range of only 7 km2. The population upon discovery was just five breeding pairs; with conservation this has increased to eighteen to twenty-five breeding pairs. Monitored continuously since 1983, the world population is estimated at 80 mature individuals {{and a total of}} some 130 birds. The island on which the albatross breeds has undergone a significant decline in habitat condition due to the introduction of ship rats, feral cats and cattle, while the birds are threatened at sea by the practice of longline fishing. The draining of a peat bog on the plateau has degraded the breeding environment, and because there is only one breeding location, they are also especially vulnerable to diseases such as Pasteurella multocida (avian cholera) and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.|$|E

Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage.|$|E
50|$|Mating with related {{individuals}} {{is rare in}} naturally occurring populations of birds due {{to the production of}} lower quality offspring suffering from the genetic effects of inbreeding depression. Seabirds have an inherently high risk of inbreeding because most are natally philopatric, and many are highly endangered with some species’ entire populations breeding on one small island. Despite this, inbreeding was observed no more than expected by random chance in the wandering albatross and the critically endangered <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross</b> (D. amsterdamensis). In contrast, some studies of seabirds have shown evidence of inbreeding. Huyvaert and Parker (2010) detected low frequencies of inbreeding in waved albatrosses and genetic similarity was negatively related to EPFs, which is an unusual result that does not support the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis. Close inbreeding was observed at low frequencies in the Mediterranean Cory’s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea diomedea) where two mother-son pairs were reported.|$|E
50|$|The {{wandering}} albatross, snowy albatross, white-winged albatross or goonie (Diomedea exulans) {{is a large}} seabird {{from the}} family Diomedeidae, which has a circumpolar range in the Southern Ocean. It was the first species of albatross to be described, and was long considered the same species as the Tristan albatross and the Antipodean albatross. A few authors still consider them all subspecies of the same species. The SACC has a proposal {{on the table to}} split this species, and BirdLife International has already split it. Together with the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross,</b> it forms the wandering albatross species complex. The wandering albatross is one of the two largest members of the genus Diomedea (the great albatrosses), being similar in size to the southern royal albatross. It {{is one of the largest}} birds in the world, and one of the best known and studied species of bird in the world. This is also one of the most far ranging birds.

5000|$|The Gibson Plumage Index (GPI), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Gibson Code, is a system for describing the plumage of great albatrosses. It is named after, and originally devised in the late 1950s by, John Douglas Gibson {{and other members of}} the New South Wales Albatross Study Group. [...] Gibson was an Australian amateur ornithologist who carried out fieldwork on albatrosses along the coast of New South Wales for thirty years. [...] The index assigns separate numerical values (from 1 to 6 with increasing proportion of white) to the degrees of colouration on four parts of the body - the back, head, inner wing and tail - of albatrosses to indicate variations in age and between different breeding populations. For instance, a bird with a completely brown back would receive a score of 1 for the back, while a bird with an all-white back would be scored as a 6. The index was later expanded by Pierre Jouventin and colleagues to cover the more complex patterning of the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross,</b> adding belly and tibial feather colouration. [...] This system for categorising the wide and complex variation in appearance of great albatrosses has been instrumental in the discovery of several genetically isolated populations and consequent description of new taxa, and has made field identification easier.|$|E

The small population of albatrosses (170 individuals including 26 pairs breeding annually) on Amsterdam Island in the Indian Ocean, Diomedea amsterdamensis, has been given species status based on plumage and morphometrics, but genetic data published to date provide weak support and its specific status remains controversial for some authors.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Industrial fisheries represent one of {{the most}} serious threats worldwide to seabird conservation. Death ofbirds in fishing operations (i. e. bycatch) has especially adverse effects on populations of albatrosses, which haveextremely low fecundity. 2. The single population worldwide of <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross</b> (Diomedea amsterdamensis) comprises only 167 individuals and risks considerable decline over the mid-term from additional mortality levels potentially inducedby fisheries. The priority actions listed in the current conservation plan for this species included characterizingthe longline fisheries operating within its range, dynamically analysing the overlap between albatrosses and thesefisheries, and providing fisheries management authorities with potential impact estimates of longline fisheries onthe <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross.</b> 3. During all life-cycle stages and year quarters the birds overlapped extensively with fishing effort in thesouthern Indian and Atlantic oceans. Fishing effort, and consequently overlap score (calculated as the productof fishing effort and time spent by the birds in a spatial unit) was highest in July–September (45 % of the hooksannually deployed). Just three fleets (Taiwanese, Japanese and Spanish) contributed to > 98 % of the overlap scoresfor each stage (72 % from the Taiwanese fleet alone, on average). Daily overlap scores were higher for thenon-breeding versus the breeding stages (3 -fold factor on average). 4. Based on previous bycatch rates for other albatross species, this study estimated that longline fisheriescurrently have the potential to remove ~ 2 – 16 individuals (i. e. ~ 5 %) each year from the total Amsterdamalbatross population, depending on whether bycatch mitigation measures were or were not systematicallyemployed during the fishing operations. 5. Recent bycatch mitigation measures may be instrumental in the conservation of the Amsterdamalbatross. This study suggests three further key recommendations: (1) to focus conservation efforts on theaustral winter; (2) to require all operating vessels to report ring recoveries; and (3) to allocate specialregulation of fishing operations in the areas of peak bycatch risk for the Amsterdam albatrosses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLow genetic {{diversity}} {{is predicted to}} negatively impact species viability {{and has been a}} central concern for conservation. In contrast, the possibility that some speciesmay thrive in spite of a relatively poor diversity has received little attention. The wandering and Amsterdam albatrosses (Diomedea exulans and Diomedea amsterdamensis) are long-lived seabirds standing at an extreme along the gradient of life strategies, having traits that may favour inbreeding and low {{genetic diversity}}. Divergence time of the two species is estimated at 0. 84 Myr ago from cytochrome b data. We tested the hypothesis that both albatrosses inherited poor genetic diversity from their common ancestor. Within the wandering albatross, per cent polymorphic loci and expected heterozygosity at amplified fragment length polymorphisms were approximately one-third of the minimal values reported in other vertebrates. Genetic diversity in the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>albatross,</b> which is recovering from a severe bottleneck, was about twice as low as in the wandering albatross. Simulations supported the hypothesis that genetic diversity in albatrosses was already depleted prior to their divergence. Given the generally high breeding success of these species, it is likely that they are not suffering much from their impoverished diversity. Whether albatrosses are unique in this regard is unknown, but they appear to challenge the classical view about the negative consequences of genetic depletion on species survival...|$|E

Using stage-relevant tracking techniques (satellite tags, GPS and GLS loggers), we surveyed 361 at-sea trips by 93 individuals over 9 yr, covering incubation, brooding, chick-rearing, sabbatical, failed-breeding, juvenile and immature stages. Our data show that Amsterdam albatrosses exhibit a wide and variable foraging radius (from 326 ± 193 km during brooding to 5519 ± 766 km for immatures) and at-sea distribution across stages, putting them beyond the French EEZ of Amsterdam Island for {{all or part of the}} trips surveyed in each stage, and even outside the Indian Ocean when breeding.

First the breeding colonies andsurrounding zones: Amsterdam and Saint Paul Islands, Marion and Prince Edward islands and the DelCano Rise, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Plateau and East Antarctica (Adlie Land sector). Second, theupwelling-current zones: Benguela and Agulhas Currents Systems and third several the oceanic zones:the Southwest Indian Ridge (East Bouvetya and the North Subtropical Front), the Mid-Indian Ridge(North of Kerguelen and the Eastern Indian Ocean, the Southeast Indian Ridge (Great Australian Bightand Tasmania, Ob and Lena Banks, and East Antarctica (Prydz Bay - Queen Maud Land sectors, AdlieLand sector). The analysis of distribution indicates that some pelagic species have a much wider foraging rangeoutside the breeding season than during the breeding season (some disperse over very large areas,i. e. wandering albatross). This highlights the urgent need to strengthen collaborations, namelybetween conservation and management organisms such as CCAMLR and the fisheries organisations(RFMOs), to ensure the protection of these species and the conservation of the ecosystem that willalso be beneficial for many other species. In conclusion, although this inventory of areas of key importance is preliminary because of the lackof data on several keystone species such as burrowing petrels which could not be studied in thiswork, the results presented here show an unprecedented improvement in the identification ofpriority areas within the Southern Indian Ocean, which should be the primary targets of site-basedconservation efforts in the near future. The Southern Indian Ocean is not pristine. The most seriousthreats are linked to industrial fishing activities, including fishery discards, bycatch of seabirds andmarine mammals, as well as, in a lesser extent, degradation of marine environments through globaland local pollution. On land, alien introductions and diseases are now the main threats. Despitemuch improvement in the conservation measures taken by several fisheries, especially in thesouthern part of the Indian Ocean, fisheries continue to exert an important negative influence onseveral seabirds, especially on the high seas. However climate change is now increasingly consideredto have a negative impact on seabirds at some Antarctic and sub-Antarctic localities.
