5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound {{is similar to that}} of the chirp. It may {{resemble}} <b>a</b> <b>growl.</b> Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Later studies support {{coevolution}} in that dogs can discriminate {{the emotional}} expressions of human faces, {{and that most}} people can tell from a bark whether a dog is alone, being approached by a stranger, playing, or being aggressive, and can tell from <b>a</b> <b>growl</b> how big the dog is.|$|E

When hurt or afraid, it howled like a wolf, and when curious, it made a sound described as <b>a</b> <b>growl</b> building up to a howl.|$|E

2500|$|A {{peculiar}} {{report from}} The Brighton Gazette, {{which appeared in}} the 14 April 1838 edition of The Times, related how a gardener in Rosehill, Sussex, had been terrified by a creature of unknown nature. The Times wrote that [...] "Spring-heeled Jack has, it seems, found his way to the Sussex coast", even though the report bore little resemblance to other accounts of Jack. The incident occurred on 13 April, when it appeared to a gardener [...] "in the shape of a bear or some other four-footed animal". Having attracted the gardener's attention by <b>a</b> <b>growl,</b> it then climbed the garden wall and ran along it on all fours, before jumping down and chasing the gardener for some time. After terrifying the gardener, the apparition scaled the wall and made its exit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mountainous}} wilds of British Columbia circa 1885, a young grizzly bear cub suffers the {{accidental}} {{death of his}} mother from a rockslide while digging for honey. [...] Forced to fend for himself, the cub struggles to find food and shelter. Elsewhere in the mountains, a large male grizzly is pursued by two trophy hunters (Jack Wallace and Tcheky Karyo). Although the younger hunter attempts to kill the bear, his shot fails to take the animal down, and the wounded bear flees. Coming across the grizzly a short time later, the cub attempts to befriend him. Uninterested in the cub and distracted by his wound, the adult bear warns the young orphan away with <b>a</b> <b>growl.</b> The cub approaches again, however, and manages to soothingly lick the other bear's wound. A friendship forms between the two bears, and the grizzly takes the orphan under his wing, teaching him to fish and hunt. At night, the cub suffers from nightmares, reliving the tragic death of his mother.|$|E

2500|$|As a rule, brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, {{and usually}} avoid people. They are, however, {{unpredictable}} in temperament, and will attack {{if they are}} surprised or feel threatened. Sows with cubs account {{for the majority of}} injuries and fatalities in North America. Habituated or food conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and in some cases associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked than large groups, with no attacks being recorded against parties of more than seven people. In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks tend to result in serious injury and in some cases death. In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with <b>a</b> <b>growl</b> or huffing sound, and seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to [...] "disarm" [...] their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn. Such a bite can be more severe than that of a tiger, and has been known to crush the heads of some human victims.|$|E
