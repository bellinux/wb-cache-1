5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement,</b> white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement</b> because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Mugabe became {{chair of}} the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a {{position}} that he retained until 1989. As the leader {{of one of the}} Front Line States, the countries bordering apartheid South Africa, he gained credibility within the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

50|$|Malahlele was a {{founding}} member of the YWCA in South Africa, and active in the peace and <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements.</b> She was a member of the Women's Peace Movement, a member of the Fort Hare University Council, and a chairwoman of the Roodepoort School Board.|$|R
50|$|South Africa {{lived under}} Apartheid—the separations of race {{enforced}} by law. Non-white race {{were barred from}} political office or even removed from the country. Uprising and protests increased in number and lead to major <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements.</b> One of these movements, in 1989, was called the Voëlvry movement.|$|R
5|$|Following growing {{pressure}} from the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement</b> both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990.|$|E
5|$|Springbok colours is {{the name}} given to green and gold blazers awarded {{to members of the}} South Africa {{national}} rugby union team. They were historically awarded to all South African teams and individuals representing the country in international competition following their creation in 1906. With the arrival of South Africa's new post-apartheid government in 1994, the name 'Springbok' was abandoned by the various control boards since they felt that the term had been abused by the previous apartheid governments, and stigmatised by the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement.</b> An exception was made {{in the case of the}} national rugby union team where they have retained the practice of awarding colours.|$|E
5|$|Students from Bristol University held {{a protest}} {{march to the}} bus station and the local {{headquarters}} of the TGWU on 1 May, which attracted heckling from bus crews as they passed through the city centre, according to the local press. Local MP Tony Benn contacted then Labour Opposition leader Harold Wilson, who spoke out against the colour bar at an <b>Anti-Apartheid</b> <b>Movement</b> rally in London. On 2 May local Labour Party Alderman Henry Hennessey spoke of the apparent collusion between bus company management and the TGWU over the colour bar. On 3 May, the ruling Labour Group on the city council threatened him with expulsion, despite his honourable service of over forty years.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements</b> in the United States and Europe were gaining {{support for}} boycotts against South Africa, for the {{withdrawal}} of US firms from South Africa and {{for the release of}} Mandela. South Africa was becoming an outlaw in the world community of nations. Investing in South Africa by Americans and others {{was coming to an end}} and an active policy of disinvestment ensued.|$|R
50|$|While {{waiting for}} orders {{to report to}} active duty, Hawkins {{remained}} active in the anti-war movement, and became active in the anti-nuclear and the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements</b> as well. He helped form the People’s Energy Project New Hampshire in 1974 to fight the proposed Seabrook nuclear power plant, and then the New England-wide Clamshell Alliance in 1976 to organize occupations of the Seabrook nuclear plant site.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{apartheid}} era in South Africa, Nigeria {{was one of}} the foremost supporters of <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements,</b> including the African National Congress; the Nigerian government issued more than 300 passports to South Africans seeking to travel abroad. Sonny Okosun, a Nigerian musician, wrote the hit song [...] "Fire in Soweto" [...] in 1977 to commemorate the 1976 Soweto uprising against apartheid in South Africa.|$|R
5|$|Writing for RT, Afshin Rattansi {{speculated that}} if 14 August protests are met with state violence, then {{it could be}} one of the last times Bahraini activists use {{peaceful}} means to seek democratic change and that other methods could include an armed struggle in the same way the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement</b> led by Nelson Mandela deployed armed tactics after peaceful protests failed to bring about change. Jean Shaoul wrote in the World Socialist Web Site that the concurrent timing of crackdown in Bahrain and Egypt was not a coincidence and that evidence showed it was coordinated by the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf.|$|E
5|$|In April 1982, Mandela was {{transferred}} to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they {{believed that they were}} being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement</b> on racial lines.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Sharpeville {{massacre}} in 1960, Makeba {{learned that her}} mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, she found that her South African passport had been cancelled. Two of Makeba's family members were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned about her family, many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement.</b> Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt a responsibility to help, as she had been able to leave the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa.|$|E
50|$|Civil strife in both Portuguese {{colonies and}} a {{mounting}} Namibian War of Independence {{resulted in an}} influx of refugees and compounded transportation issues. The Benguela railway, which extended west through Angola, was essentially closed to Zambian traffic by the late 1970s. Zambia's support for <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements</b> such as the African National Congress (ANC) also created security problems as the South African Defence Force struck at dissident targets during external raids.|$|R
50|$|Verwoerd was prime {{minister}} during {{the establishment of}} the Republic of South Africa in 1961, thereby fulfilling the Afrikaner dream of an independent republic for South Africans. During his tenure as {{prime minister}}, <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements</b> such as the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) were banned, and the Rivonia Trial, which prosecuted ANC leaders, was held. His term ended with his assassination on 6 September 1966 by Dimitri Tsafendas.|$|R
50|$|Within {{two years}} of the unbanning of the African National Congress and other <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements,</b> and just a year after the holding of the 1991 conference of the African National Congress, at the University of Durban-Westville, white South Africans {{overwhelmingly}} voted to end apartheid on 17 March 1992, (see South African apartheid referendum, 1992). Political organisations of every hue, were invited to participate in a Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA).|$|R
25|$|He was a campaigner against {{apartheid}} in South Africa, {{serving on the}} National Executive of the <b>Anti-Apartheid</b> <b>Movement,</b> and was arrested in 1984 while demonstrating outside South Africa House.|$|E
25|$|He was {{involved}} in the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement</b> from 1969 {{until the end of the}} white minority regime in 1990, being a regular protester and speaker at the 24/7 non-stop, four-year-long picket outside South Africa House.|$|E
25|$|City AA was {{eventually}} expelled {{by the national}} leadership of the <b>Anti-Apartheid</b> <b>Movement,</b> over differences centering on City Group's insistence on making the link between British support for apartheid in South Africa, and racism within Britain.|$|E
50|$|From {{the time}} Muammar Gaddafi assumed power in Libya in 1969 {{until the end}} of {{apartheid}} in South Africa and the country's first democratic elections in 1994 the Gaddafi regime was hostile to the government in Pretoria. Libya provided funding and support to South African <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements.</b> as well as military training to ANC combatants. After the legalisation of the ANC, then ANC leader Nelson Mandela visited Gaddafi in Libya in May 1990 to thank him for Libya's assistance.|$|R
50|$|The {{deaths of}} South African {{soldiers}} in this conflict, particularly conscripted National Servicemen, was a politically sensitive issue amongst the white population, who resented their being sent into conflict in other countries. The use of forces such as UNITA, Koevoet, and 32 Battalion helped to provide {{resources for the}} conflict {{while at the same}} time avoiding headlines. Towards the end of the conflict, the anti-conscription and <b>anti-Apartheid</b> <b>movements</b> gained momentum, particularly through the End Conscription Campaign.|$|R
50|$|Steve Biko {{had been}} {{involved}} in clandestine contacts with two outlawed <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements,</b> the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). Returning to his home one evening from a trip to Cape Town, Biko was arrested, imprisoned and mortally beaten. Woods went to the morgue with Biko's wife Ntsiki and photographed Biko's battered body. The photographs were later published in Woods's book, exposing the South African government's cover-up of the cause of Biko's death.|$|R
25|$|Belafonte {{was active}} in the <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement.</b> He was the Master of Ceremonies at a {{reception}} honoring African National Congress President Oliver Tambo at Roosevelt House, Hunter College, in New York City. The reception was held by the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) and The Africa Fund. He is a current board member of the TransAfrica Forum and the Institute for Policy Studies.|$|E
25|$|In {{many western}} countries, {{such as the}} United States, the United Kingdom (where the <b>Anti-Apartheid</b> <b>Movement</b> was based) and the Commonwealth there was much debate over the {{imposition}} of economic sanctions in order to weaken Botha and undermine the white regime. By the late 1980s – as foreign investment in South Africa declined – disinvestment began to have a serious effect on the nation's economy.|$|E
25|$|Gordimer's writing {{dealt with}} moral and racial issues, {{particularly}} apartheid in South Africa. Under that regime, {{works such as}} Burger's Daughter and July's People were banned. She {{was active in the}} <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement,</b> joining the African National Congress during the days when the organization was banned, and gave Nelson Mandela advice on his famous 1964 defence speech at the trial which led to his conviction for life. She was also active in HIV/AIDS causes.|$|E
5000|$|The Department of Military Veterans is a {{department}} of the Government of South Africa {{that is responsible for}} providing support and services to veterans of the South African military, including veterans of the armed wings of <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements</b> (Umkhonto we Sizwe and APLA). The political head of the department is the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans; [...] this is Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. Her deputy is Kebby Maphatsoe, and the administrative head of the department is Director-General Tsepe Motumi.|$|R
50|$|The {{last part}} of Craven's {{chairmanship}} of the SARB occurred during the country's most tumultuous years. Rugby had become the national sport of white South Africans and a symbol of Afrikaner power. In the 1970s and 1980s, the outlawed African National Congress allied with overseas <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements</b> to successfully isolate South Africa from sporting and cultural contact {{with the rest of}} the world. Of all the sanctions aimed at South Africa, none irked the Afrikaner population more than the ban on rugby internationals.|$|R
5000|$|Rooi gevaar is an Afrikaans phrase, {{translated}} into English as the [...] "red threat" [...] or [...] "communist threat". The term gained popularity in South Africa during the Cold War and {{was associated with}} the perceived threat of international communism to religious, economic, and political freedom on the Southern African subcontinent. This pretext was used to justify the banning of the South African Communist Party (SACP) and its sister organisation, the African National Congress (ANC), which were regarded as leading <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|R
25|$|Skinner {{attended}} the University of California, Berkeley, and earned both a B.S. from the College of Natural Resources and a Masters in Education from the UC Berkeley School of Education. As a student, {{she was a}} leader in the <b>Anti-Apartheid</b> <b>Movement,</b> served as the Academic Affairs Vice President of the ASUC, the student government, and was a founder of ASGE, the Union of Graduate Student Employees. Skinner later taught courses in native California plants and interned at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.|$|E
25|$|In the 1945 general election, which Labour {{won by a}} landslide, she {{was elected}} as the Member of Parliament for Blackburn and became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade and then to George Isaacs, Minister of Labour and National Service. She soon {{achieved}} {{a reputation as a}} left-winger and a rousing speaker. During the 1950s she was a high-profile Bevanite and made a name for herself as a vocal advocate of decolonisation and the <b>Anti-Apartheid</b> <b>Movement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movement</b> led the ICC {{to impose}} a {{moratorium}} on tours in 1970. This decision excluded players such as Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Mike Procter from partaking in international Test Cricket. It would also cause the emigration of future stars like, Basil D'Oliveira, Allan Lamb and Robin Smith, who both played for England, and Kepler Wessels, who initially played for Australia, before returning to South Africa. World class cricketers of their day like Clive Rice, Vintcent van der Bijl also never played Test Cricket despite their first class records.|$|E
50|$|In June 1990, Hamilton was {{recruited}} by the right-wing Monday Club activist Derek Laud to work for Strategy Network International, a firm specifically created to lobby against <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements</b> and economic sanctions and for apartheid South Africa's 'transitional government' of Namibia set up in defiance of UN Resolution 435 on Namibian independence. Derek Laud was an ex-Monday Club activist and protégé of Hamilton's friend Michael Brown, who offered Hamilton a fee of £8,000 per year. Hamilton failed to register the paid-for consultancy. Hamilton took free trips to South Africa {{in the company of}} Brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{foundations}} of apartheid were firmly laid during Malan's six-and-a-half years as prime minister. On February 24, 1953 Malan was granted dictatorial powers to oppose black and Indian <b>anti-apartheid</b> <b>movements.</b> Although {{the system was}} officially dismantled in 1994, the legacy of apartheid continues {{to have an impact}} in South Africa. Malan retired in 1954 at the age of 80, but in the succession battle that accompanied his retirement, his anointed heirs, N. C. Havenga and T. E. Donges, were defeated, and Malan was succeeded by J. G. Strijdom.|$|R
