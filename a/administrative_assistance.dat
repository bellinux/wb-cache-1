25|$|In the Chilean rural areas, the {{ministry}} of health and {{the ministry}} of economy are responsible for supervising water cooperatives and water committees. In rural areas there is no independent regulator, such as the SISS in urban areas. Since 1994, the Direction for Water Works (DOH) is in charge of executing the national program of Rural Potable Water (APR). Unlike urban service providers, rural water supply and sanitation sector has not been subject of regulation like urban services. Currently, the Government of President Bachelet has submitted before the Chilean Congress a Bill to give this sector a new institutional framework. According to Law 19,549 of 1998, urban concessionaires have to provide technical and <b>administrative</b> <b>assistance</b> to water committees and cooperatives in their respective region.|$|E
25|$|However, Switzerland did {{not want}} to be seen as an {{obstacle}} to closer tax cooperation among EU-member states and decided to support the international efforts to adequately tax cross-border investment income. The retention tax agreed with the European Union (EU) in the taxation of savings income agreement is a suitable and efficient means of doing so. The EU is committed to eliminating existing loopholes in the system of taxation of savings income. Switzerland has expressed to the EU its willingness in principle to correspondingly adjust the taxation of savings income. Here it should be noted that Switzerland has adopted the OECD standard on <b>administrative</b> <b>assistance</b> and that the Federal Council rejects the automatic exchange of information. Since July 1, 2005, Switzerland has charged a withholding tax on all interest earned in the personal Swiss accounts of European Union residents.|$|E
25|$|One {{test of the}} {{reformed}} RAOU {{was to be the}} extent of its involvement with the International Ornithological Congress (IOC), held in Canberra in 1974 with about 800 delegates attending. The secretary-general of the congress (i.e. the principal organiser) was Dr Harold Frith who was not only one of the hardliners of the ‘scientists’ faction of the pre-reform RAOU, but had also threatened to start a competing group with its own journal if the reforms had not proceeded. Ultimately the RAOU contributed {{to the success of the}} IOC through provision of funding (along with the Australian Academy of Science (AAC) and the <b>administrative</b> <b>assistance</b> of the CSIRO), and with the organisation of excursions for delegates. The appointment in 1974 of Tommy Garnett as RAOU secretary was also a move that assisted in bringing order to the growing administrative demands of the evolving organisation.|$|E

500|$|When Eisenhower {{left the}} Mediterranean {{to become the}} Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gale {{was one of a}} number of key {{officers}} that Eisenhower insisted on taking with him to his new headquarters, SHAEF. When Field Marshal Brooke demurred at this, Eisenhower's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith pointed out that Eisenhower had always felt [...] "he would be unwilling to undertake another large Allied Command without Gale's <b>administrative</b> <b>assistance</b> .... He has that irreplaceable quality of being able to handle British-American supply problems with tact and judgement and he is almost as familiar with the American system of supply as with the British." [...] However, General Gale found that while his title at SHAEF was the same, his role was different from that at Allied Force Headquarters. In the Mediterranean he had also had broad responsibility for logistics. In the European theatre, General Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group controlled its own supply while the American units had Headquarters, Communications Zone under Major General John C. H. Lee. At SHAEF, Gale had less real control over supply and administration than at Allied Force Headquarters and his duties mostly involved coordinating the activities of the SHAEF staff sections and serving as chairman of various high-level committees that dealt with matters of supply. Gale was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant general in August 1944, and in January 1945 he became Colonel Commandant of the Royal Army Service Corps, a position he held until 1954. He was also colonel commandant of the Army Catering Corps from 1946 to 1958. For his work at SHAEF, he was awarded the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

2500|$|If an {{enforceable}} agreement – {{a contract}} – exists, {{the details of}} the contract's terms matter if one party has allegedly broken the agreement. A contract's terms are what was promised. Yet {{it is up to the}} courts to construe evidence of what the parties said before a contract's conclusion, and construe the terms agreed. Construction of the contract starts with the express promises people make to one another, but also with terms found in other documents or notices that were intended to be incorporated. The general rule is that reasonable notice of the term is needed, and more notice is needed for an onerous term. The meaning of those terms must then be interpreted, and the modern approach is to construe the meaning of an agreement from the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the whole context. The courts, as well as legislation, may also imply terms into contracts generally to 'fill gaps' as necessary to fulfil the reasonable expectations of the parties, or as necessary incidents to specific contracts. English law had, particularly in the late 19th century, adhered to the laissez faire principle of [...] "freedom of contract" [...] so that, in the general law of contract, people can agree to whatever terms or conditions they choose. By contrast, specific contracts, particularly for consumers, employees or tenants were built to carry a minimum core of rights, mostly deriving from statute, that aim to secure the fairness of contractual terms. The evolution of case law in the 20th century generally shows an ever-clearer distinction between general contracts among commercial parties and those between parties of unequal bargaining power, since in these groups of transaction true choice is thought to be hampered by lack of real competition in the market. Hence, some terms can be found to be unfair under statutes such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 or the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 and can be removed by the courts, with the <b>administrative</b> <b>assistance</b> of the Competition and Markets Authority.|$|E
