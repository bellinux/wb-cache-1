500|$|While Nelson was {{apparently}} convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine, most biographers, researchers, and other observers {{have concluded that}} his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>longtime</b> pornography critic. He told Dobson that [...] "true crime" [...] detective magazines had [...] "corrupted" [...] him and [...] "fueled [...] fantasies ... {{to the point of}} becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, [...] "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [...] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up." [...] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer. [...] "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. [...] "The problem was Bundy." [...] "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," [...] wrote Rule. [...] "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on himself, but on us." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Michael Bendis, {{writer for}} the series, said in an {{interview}} he was [...] "honored" [...] to add to the Halo lore. He noted that the graphic novel brought [...] "humanity and perspective" [...] to the franchise, something not easily imparted through the games. Bendis described himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>longtime</b> player of Halo and had [...] "done [...] Halo homework", reading and playing everything Halo. Bendis stated that Bungie was open to the Marvel team exploring lesser-known elements of the Halo universe or even bringing up new ideas, as opposed to sticking to a script or set of preplanned ideas from Bungie or Microsoft. The Philadelphia Daily News suggested that a Halo comic book would attract readers who had never picked up a comic book before. Bendis said that drawing casual gamers to the comics was a major goal for the series. While using established characters meant that Bendis had to cooperate with Bungie and Microsoft, {{he said he did not}} feel it was a restriction. [...] "You can get pretty bloated and sloppy with total autonomy all the time." [...] The Bungie team allowed Bendis to explore lesser known areas of the Halo story, which he enjoyed. Writing the dialogue for the Master Chief, who is faceless and normally silent during gameplay, was a challenge; Bendis scrapped much of the drafted dialogue to allow Maleev's work to define the character.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{reviews of}} the film were highly positive. Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, hailing the film as a [...] "procedural thriller for the {{information}} age" [...] that [...] "spins your head in a new way, luring you into a vortex and then deeper still." [...] Nathan Lee in his review for The Village Voice wrote that director Fincher's [...] "very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, gives Zodiac its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it works just fine. As an allegory {{of life in the}} information age, it blew my mind." [...] Todd McCarthy's review in Variety praised the film's [...] "almost unerringly accurate evocation of the workaday San Francisco of 35–40 years ago. Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote, [...] "Zodiac is meticulously crafted – Harris Savides's state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film – and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still, the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish. Fincher boldly (and some may think perversely) withholds the emotional and forensic payoff we're conditioned to expect from a big studio movie." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "The film is a police procedural crossed with a newspaper movie, but free of most of the cliches of either. Its most impressive accomplishment is to gather a bewildering labyrinth of facts and suspicions over a period of years, and make the journey through this maze frightening and suspenseful." [...] Ebert also praised the casting (critical in an ensemble film) and, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>longtime</b> columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, asserted Zodiac was [...] "intriguing in its accuracy" [...] in showing the operation of a major newspaper.|$|E

Novak also played a role among many other reporters in Timothy Crouse’s seminal nonfiction book The Boys on the Bus that described reporters covering the lead-up to the 1972 Presidential election. In August 2004, The Washington Post stated that Novak might [...] "wince unto this day" [...] at his portrayal in the book.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, Seeger was {{a senior}} figure in the 1960s folk revival {{centered}} in Greenwich Village, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>longtime</b> columnist in Sing Out!, the successor to the People's Songs Bulletin, and as {{a founder of the}} topical Broadside magazine. To describe the new crop of politically committed folk singers, he coined the phrase [...] "Woody's children", alluding to his associate and traveling companion, Woody Guthrie, who by this time had become a legendary figure. This urban folk-revival movement, a continuation of the activist tradition of the 1930s and 1940s and of People's Songs, used adaptations of traditional tunes and lyrics to effect social change, a practice that goes back to the Industrial Workers of the World or Wobblies' Little Red Song Book, compiled by Swedish-born union organizer Joe Hill (1879–1915). (The Little Red Song Book had been a favorite of Woody Guthrie's, who was known to carry it around.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Positions at network O are {{frequently}} sought after {{by those who}} wish to eventually work for a television network. Indeed, many O have served as a stepping stone for television personalities at their parent networks. For example, Matt Lauer and Al Roker worked for NBC's flagship O in New York City, WNBC-TV, before becoming hosts on Today; Roker had begun his career with NBC at former O WKYC-TV in Cleveland, known as a [...] "farm station" [...] which developed talent for the larger O stations and network (although, until after it ended following Multimedia's purchase of controlling interest in the station in 1990, this strategy left WKYC <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>longtime</b> also-ran in the Cleveland market due to heavy staff turnover). Whether or not one gets a job at a network obviously depends on one's abilities, and working at an O does not guarantee a network job down the line; however, the presenter does potentially receive additional exposure to the network.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{episode in}} Season 1, titled [...] "Fenster Hall" [...] (aired March 31, 1985), was a {{failed attempt to}} create a {{spin-off}} of Punky Brewster. It was originally a one-hour episode, but was cut into two shows for syndication. This crossover episode marked the debut of Mike Fulton; T. K. Carter was the intended star of the Fenster Hall spin-off. Mike's history <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>longtime</b> resident of Fenster was explained, since he had been an orphan from birth and had been shuffled around to many foster homes before permanently staying at Fenster {{from the time he was}} seven. Now as the chief boys' counselor, Mike was saddled with helping new, tough street kid T.C. Finestra (Billy Lombardo) fit in with his group of regular charges, after an incident in which T.C. broke into and stole from the bedroom of Punky Brewster. Punky had a confrontation with T.C. after following him to a shady lair kept by street thug Blade (James LeGros), who had taken T.C. under his wing and was teaching him how to rob. It was there in which Punky learned of T.C.'s situation, and brought him home to Henry before it was decided that he would be better off at Fenster.|$|E
