5|$|After graduation, {{she moved}} to Amsterdam to {{interview}} Dutch anarchists in the Provo countercultural movement. While there, she became involved with, then married, one of the anarchists she met: Cornelius (Iwan) Dirk de Bruin. Soon after they were married, she said, de Bruin began to abuse her severely, punching <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> her, burning her with cigarettes, beating her on her legs with a wooden beam, and banging {{her head against the}} floor until he knocked her unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|In both equine social systems, excess males {{gather in}} {{bachelor}} groups. These are typically young males {{who are not}} yet ready to establish a harem or territory. With the plains zebra, the males in a bachelor group have strong bonds and have a linear dominance hierarchy. Fights between males usually occur over estrus females and involve biting <b>and</b> <b>kicking.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the game, Mario {{is portrayed}} as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his younger brother Luigi, has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City. The {{gameplay}} focuses on Mario's extermination of them by flipping them on their backs <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> them away. The original versions of Mario Bros.—the arcade version and the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System (FC/NES) version—were received positively by critics.|$|E
5|$|Jack Verge went to Sydney University in 1900 and for {{the first}} two years played fullback for the University second rugby team. In his second year, he began to be noticed by the rugby press, both for his {{defensive}} play <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> skills. In the July 1901 match between University II and Balmain II, Verge scored two tries, and was then selected to play for the New South Wales (NSW) second team.|$|E
5|$|The TNA Women's Knockout Championship was {{defended by}} Taylor Wilde against Awesome Kong and Roxxi in a Three Way match next. Raisha Saeed {{accompanied}} Kong to the ring. She also interfered {{in the contest}} by pulling Roxxi {{out of the ring}} <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> her at ringside. Roxxi later returned to the ring and attacked Kong before being pinned by Wilde with a bridging suplex pin at 5 minutes and 11 seconds. Wilde thus retained the TNA Women's Knockout Championship.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{television}} show, Live <b>and</b> <b>Kicking</b> launched a music CD, composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme. A video game called Live and Kicking: Showmaker was also created, where the user could combine elements of the show {{to create their own}} television production on a small scale. A monthly magazine was also produced, though towards the end of Live & Kickings production, the sales of the magazine dropped significantly, reflecting its loss of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and paddling <b>and</b> <b>kicking.</b> They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of Psittacosaurus were more terrestrial than others.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, Barton broke a 35-year-old pedestrian's leg {{while driving}} his car through Liverpool city centre at 2am. In {{the summer of}} 2005, Barton was sent home from a {{pre-season}} tournament in Thailand after assaulting a 15-year-old Everton supporter who had provoked Barton by verbally abusing him <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> his shin. Barton had to be restrained from attacking the boy further by teammate Richard Dunne. Barton underwent anger management therapy at the order of City manager Stuart Pearce and paid £120,000 in club fines. In the autumn of 2005, Barton began a seven-day programme of behavioural management at the Sporting Chance clinic, a charity set up to help troubled sportsmen and women.|$|E

Punches <b>and</b> <b>kicks</b> can be performed from a standing, crouching or jumping position. Punches award more points than <b>kicks</b> <b>and</b> do more damage, but their range is shorter.|$|R

5|$|Shaughnessy {{was born}} on March 6, 1892 in St. Cloud, Minnesota, the second son of Lucy Ann (Foster) and Edward Shaughnessy. He {{attended}} North St. Paul High School, and prior to college, had no athletic experience. When he attended the University of Minnesota, however, he played college football under head coach Henry L. Williams and alongside halfback Bernie Bierman. Shaughnessy considered Williams to be football's greatest teacher, and Williams considered {{him to be the}} best passer from the Midwest. Shaughnessy handled both the passing <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> duties for the team.|$|E
5|$|The deputies {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Cripple Creek itself. They arrested and imprisoned hundreds of citizens without cause. Many inhabitants of the town were seized on the street or pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten. The deputies formed a gauntlet and forced townspeople to pass through it, spitting, slapping <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> them. With Bull Hill in his possession, Gen. Brooks began detaining the deputies. By nightfall, Brooks had seized the town and corralled all of Bowers' men.|$|E
5|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} John Cena and Randy Orton for the WWE Championship. Cena had {{retained}} the title against Orton at SummerSlam. The following night on Raw, Orton demanded a rematch for the title, but his request was declined by General Manager William Regal. Orton proceeded his demands to Mr. McMahon, who {{also refused to}} give him a rematch unless he proved himself. That night, Orton interfered in Cena's match by assaulting Cena <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> Cena's father, who was at ringside, in the head. The following week, Orton was granted a title rematch against Cena at Unforgiven.|$|E

5|$|Tyrion Lannister is able {{to trick}} Lysa Arryn into {{summoning}} a court {{to listen to his}} confession, at which he confesses various misdemeanours committed during his life, but nothing about the attempt on Bran's life or Lysa's husband's death. After, Tyrion publicly demands a trial by combat, and the mercenary Bronn volunteers to fight for him. Lysa Arryn {{has no choice but to}} allow it. Bronn defeats Lysa's champion Ser Vardis Egen by tiring the heavily armored knight <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> him out the Moon Door, and Tyrion is allowed to walk free with Bronn as his escort, much to the dismay of the Tully sisters.|$|E
5|$|Biggs {{played for}} several club teams {{throughout}} his career, including England's Richmond and Welsh exile club London Welsh. On 24 December 1890, Biggs played for London Welsh in a match against his longterm club Cardiff. The London Welsh team produced a 'devastating display' to beat Cardiff {{by a single}} try. At county level he represented Glamorgan where he played alongside his brother, and later turned out for Somerset. During the 1893/94 season Biggs was made club captain of Cardiff, {{and in the same}} season he led Cardiff against the invitational team the Barbarians, not only winning the game but also scoring two tries <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> a successful conversion. The same season as he faced the Barbarians with Cardiff, Biggs was invited to join the tourists; one of four of the Biggs brothers to play for the team. The last notable club Biggs represented was Bath, captaining the senior team during the 1899–1900 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 Harold Oliver {{moved to}} Lyrup, South Australia {{and started a}} farm growing fruit. During this time, he captained the Lyrup {{football}} team. In 1909, after never previously winning a game, the Lyrup football club won the local riverland league premiership. They subsequently traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura Cultivator praised Oliver's marking <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> reporting that it {{was as good as}} anyone who had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold that he would be welcome in Melbourne to play football if he wanted to. At the end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall {{returned}} to Australia and resumed his rugby league career with St. George in the 1946 NSWRFL season {{after a two-year}} absence, starting in reserve grade. His strong performances saw him promoted to first grade and that season St. George Dragons qualified for the grand final against the Balmain Tigers. Lindwall's goalkicking abilities were not on display that day, as Balmain won the game 13–12, scoring three tries to St George's four, with Lindwall missing every kick at goal. He retired from competitive rugby {{on the advice of}} O`Reilly to concentrate on cricket. Lindwall played 31 first-grade rugby league games for St George, scoring seven tries (then worth three points) <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> 123 goals for a total of 267 career points. The narrow losses in the 1942 and 1946 grand finals prevented him from emulating Herbie Collins' unique feat of following a New South Wales Rugby League premiership victory with captaining the Australian cricket team. Lindwall's brother Jack was, {{at the time of his}} retirement, the club's leading try-scorer with 110.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George {{discusses}} breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while {{walking down the street}} with Marlene, and then hide out until she had given up on him. Although it was cut before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library.|$|E
5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals {{thousands of years ago}} from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air <b>and</b> <b>kicking</b> or stamping the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.|$|E
