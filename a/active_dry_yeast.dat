A Dissertation {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Matthew R. Waldron. Vita. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of commercially available feed additives on production variables and metabolic markers when supplemented during the periparturient period. The hypothesis was that the supplementation of feed additives throughout the periparturient period would improve production variables and metabolic markers. Feed additives investigated included a mixture of B-vitamins and <b>active</b> <b>dried</b> <b>yeast,</b> organically complexed trace minerals, and a yeast culture. For all experiments, the variables of interest included daily dry matter intake, milk yield, and feed efficiency as well as weekly body condition score, body weight, milk composition, 3. 5 % fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk (ECM), and colostrum immunoglobulin concentrations as measures of production performance. Plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and [beta]-hydroxybutyrate were examined in all experiments as markers of metabolic health. Data to support feeding the B-vitamin and <b>active</b> <b>dried</b> <b>yeast</b> mixture or the organically complexed trace minerals during the periparturient period were limited.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the influence of different methods of primary fermentation of the vine musts on the analytical and sensoric parameters of the wines produced. For this goal different wine samples were produced using <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> wine <b>yeast</b> fermentation, spontaneous fermentation and fermentation with prepared ferment that contained original cultured yeast from local wine yard. The wines were produced from three vine varieties from year 2012 and 2013. The analytical and sensoric evaluation was subsequently carried out. The result of the experiment show a good and even sensoric quality of the wines produced using the <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> wine <b>yeast</b> fermentation, yet certain uniformity is apparent. On the contrary the spontaneous fermentation shows traces of unevenness in the sensoric quality evaluation. The most important finding is that the method that produces wine using the prepared ferment is a full alternative to the methods of spontaneous or <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> wine <b>yeast</b> fermentation and that in many cases leads to even better sensoric evaluation than these two methods. The prepared ferment method has a great potential in wine making practice mainly for high quality wines that focus on the varietal character, originality, story of origin, local tradition and "terroir"...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{fermentation}} process in the Alicante region allowed us to conclude that adverse climatic conditions could be responsible for deficient wine-making with serious problems arising fermentations, usually causing incomplete fermentation. In order to avoid these problems, we selected a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, namely T 73, isolated in the same Alicante region, {{to be used to}} perform controlled fermentations. The use of selected strains in the wine-making process requires the development of characterization techniques that can clearly differentiate between the inoculated strain and the wild strains present in the musts. In order to differentiate strains present in the wine ecosystems, an extensive survey of different methods of yeast strains identification has been carried out. However, these techniques are very complex to be used in industry. For this reason, we have developed a new, simple, inexpensive and rapid method based on mitochondrial DNA restriction analysis.

40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{preparation}} techniques on the oenological properties of a yeast autolysate were investigated: enzymatic autolysis, thermolysis, {{and the combination}} of a slow freezing-defrosting and mechanical disruption were carried out on a commercial formulation of <b>active</b> <b>dry</b> <b>yeasts</b> (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The powders obtained by freeze drying, were characterized: volatile compounds were analyzed by SPME-GC with mass spectrometric (MS) and olfactometric detection (O); the release of colloids in winelike solution was studied by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Finally, the effects of the powders addition on the aroma composition of a white wine were investigated by SPME-GC-MS, SPME-GC-O, and sensory evaluation. The products obtained were quite different from each other. In particular, enzymatic autolysis led to higher contents of nonglycosilated soluble proteins in the powders and determined a higher retention of wine aroma compounds. On the contrary, thermal autolysate was richer in glycoproteins, and it was able to increase the wine aroma intensity; nevertheless, in the wines treated with such preparation, a slight yeastlike olfactory note was perceived. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R

2500|$|In winemaking, {{there are}} distinctions made between ambient yeasts which are {{naturally}} present in wine cellars, vineyards {{and on the}} grapes themselves (sometimes known as a grape's [...] "bloom" [...] or [...] "blush") and cultured yeast which are specifically isolated and inoculated for use in winemaking. The most common genera of wild yeasts found in winemaking include Candida, Klöckera/Hanseniaspora, Metschnikowiaceae, Pichia and Zygosaccharomyces. Wild yeasts can produce high-quality, unique-flavored wines; however, they are often unpredictable and may introduce less desirable traits to the wine, and can even contribute to spoilage. It {{should be noted that}} few yeast, and lactic and acetic acid bacterial colonies naturally live on the surface of grapes, but traditional wine makers, particularly in Europe, advocate use of ambient yeast as a characteristic of the region's terroir; nevertheless, many winemakers prefer to control fermentation with predictable cultured yeast. The cultured yeasts most commonly used in winemaking belong to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (also known as [...] "sugar yeast") species. Within this species are several hundred different strains of yeast that can be used during fermentation to affect the heat or vigor of the process and enhance or suppress certain flavor characteristics of the varietal. The use of different strains of yeasts is a major contributor to the diversity of wine, even among the same grape variety. Alternative, non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeasts are being used more prevalently in the industry to add greater complexity to wine. After a winery has been in operation for a number of years, few yeast strains are actively involved in the fermentation process.

40|$|In the brewing {{industry}} it is standard practice to propagate a pure yeast culture and inoculate (pitch) {{it into the}} fermentation vessel. Once fermentation is complete, yeast is recovered and reused in subsequent fermentations (known as serial repitching) until a decline in performance occurs or the required number of successive fermentations has been conducted. Propagation is currently required to initiate the entire process again, which requires additional equipment, energy, water inputs and time. It has long been proposed that <b>Active</b> <b>Dried</b> <b>Yeast</b> (ADY) offers an alternative method of yeast supply. Adoption of this innovation by the {{brewing industry}} has been low because of perceived issues with the fermentation performance of ADY, the availability of strains and hygiene concerns. In the current study the fermentation performance of ADY has been assessed with respect to viability, genomic stability, membrane integrity, yeast growth, attenuation, uptake of wort nutrients and aspects of flavour development.

The source of cell death is unclear. Mitochondrial and genomic DNA integrity was assessed using a variety of techniques and shown to be unaffected by dehydration and rehydration. In contrast membrane integrity was affected. Changes in membrane fluidity, sterol content and fitness to perform could be detected in ADY. Performance of ADY in fermentation was also impaired. A lag in cell growth, attenuation and sugar and amino acid uptake were noted. Diacetyl formation occurred more rapidly and end fermentation diacetyl levels were higher for ADY.
