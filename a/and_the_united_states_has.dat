In vitro propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds). This technology has, to a large extent, removed the incentive for collectors to travel to Sabah to collect the plant illegally, and demand for wild-collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years.|$|E

25|$|Pure {{plastics}} {{have low}} toxicity {{due to their}} insolubility in water {{and because they are}} biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens. Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols.|$|E

500|$|Denning {{writes that}} the real {{challenge}} is keeping up with technological change, and in this sense, scientific management was the key American technological advance in the 20th century. It allowed American companies to provide large numbers of jobs to semi-skilled workers through supply-chain management, hierarchies, and rule-based systems. Businesses must now adjust to well-informed consumers who disdain profiteering and wish to be [...] "delighted". A related challenge is shifting from managing semi-skilled to knowledge workers. The Economist contrasted the [...] "Great Stagnation" [...] thesis with the [...] "Great Divergence" [...] which traces the pay gap to an increasing demand for skilled workers. Timothy Noah, writing in Slate, did not share Cowen's optimism {{about the future of}} American educational attainment on the basis that President Obama [...] "is getting tough" [...] on teachers' unions. There have been many reforms implemented in the last thirty years that the unions initially opposed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> poorer outcomes than many OECD countries with stronger unions. Noah reminds us that the earlier authors were optimistic about increased third level enrollment and that has since fallen as have graduation rates. The United States remains significantly behind other advanced countries in educational outcomes offering a perverse hope for improvement.|$|E

2500|$|No agreed {{standard}} method defines which states are middle powers. Some researchers use Gross National Product (GNP) statistics to draw lists of middle powers around the world. Economically, middle powers are generally {{those that are}} not considered too [...] "big" [...] or too [...] "small", however that is defined. Economics is not always the defining factor. Under the original sense of the term, a middle power was one that had some degree of influence globally but did not dominate in any one area. [...] This usage is not universal, and some define middle power to include nations that can be regarded as regional powers. The international relations scholar Enrico Fels employs k-means clustering in order to identify six regional middle powers in Asia-Pacific based on a composite index that involves 54 indicators and covers the aggregated power base of 44 regional states. Based on a Realist ontology he conducts mixed-method research to analyse these six regional middle powers' balancing and bandwagoning strategies in order to outline whether a relational power shift between China <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>has</b> taken place {{since the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E
