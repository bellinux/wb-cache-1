5|$|Nearly 500 {{years of}} intense contact between {{speakers}} of Nahuatl <b>and</b> <b>speakers</b> of Spanish, {{combined with the}} minority status of Nahuatl and the higher prestige associated with Spanish has caused many changes in modern Nahuatl varieties, {{with large numbers of}} words borrowed from Spanish into Nahuatl, and the introduction of new syntactic constructions and grammatical categories.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates a new {{approach}} to perform simultaneous speech <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> recognition. The likelihood estimated by a speaker identification system is combined with the posterior probability estimated by the speech recognizer. So, the joint posterior probability of the pronounced word <b>and</b> the <b>speaker</b> identity is maximized. A comparison study with other standard techniques is carried out in three different applications, (1) closed set speech <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> identification, (2) open set speech <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> identification <b>and</b> (3) <b>speaker</b> quantization in speaker-independent speech recognition. 2 IDIAP–RR 04 - 23...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a recent upsurge in the {{deployment}} of emerging technologies such as speech <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> recognition which are reaching maturity. We discuss {{the details of the}} components required to build a system for audio indexing and retrieval for spoken documents using content <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> based information facilitated by speech <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> recognition. The real power of spoken document analysis is in using both content <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> information together in retrieval by combining the results. The experiments described here are in the broadcast news domain, but the underlying techniques can easily be extended to other speech-centric applications and transactions. 1...|$|R
5|$|Many {{users of}} English in the {{expanding}} circle {{use it to}} communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English. Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, <b>and</b> <b>speakers</b> of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties. Very often today a conversation in English {{anywhere in the world}} may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.|$|E
5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs <b>and</b> <b>speakers.</b> Care must be taken when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E
5|$|Seattle's {{population}} {{historically has}} been predominantly white. The 2010 census showed that Seattle {{was one of}} the whitest big cities in the country, although its proportion of white residents has been gradually declining. In 1960, whites comprised 91.6% of the city's population, while in 2010 they comprised 69.5%. According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, approximately 78.9% of residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Those who spoke Asian languages other than Indo-European languages made up 10.2% of the population, Spanish was spoken by 4.5% of the population, speakers of other Indo-European languages made up 3.9%, <b>and</b> <b>speakers</b> of other languages made up 2.5%.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new robust bi-modal audio visual speech <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> {{recognition}} system by lip-motion and speech biometrics. To increase the robustness of speech <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> recognition, we {{have proposed a}} method using speaker lip motion information extracted from video sequences with low resolution (128 × 128 pixels). In this paper we investigate a biometric system for speech recognition <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> identification based using line-motion estimation with speech information and Support Vector Machines. The acoustic and visual features are fused at the feature level showing favourable results with digit recognition being 83 % to 100 % <b>and</b> <b>speaker</b> recognition 100 % on the XM 2 VTS database. ...|$|R

5|$|Emeka Ogboh (born 1977) is a Nigerian {{sound and}} {{installation}} artist {{best known for}} his soundscapes of life in Lagos. Trained as an artist, he began working with sounds that characterize cities following an Egyptian multimedia art program. He presents unmodified field recordings from Lagos city lifefor instance, its danfo share taxi systemin gallery installations with headphones <b>and</b> <b>speakers.</b> His non-audio work uses iconography from Lagos city life. He participated in the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and 2015 Venice Biennale, and received the 2016 Bremen Böttcherstraße Art Award. His work has exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, American National Museum of African Art, Menil Collection, Casino Luxembourg, and Kiasma. Critics noted his soundscapes' chaos and complexity, and his focus on recontextualizing rather than transforming the city's sounds.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} speech on 28 February 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng {{said that the}} Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression. For instance, in 2000 it had created Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches. Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions. All public talks held indoors involving organizers <b>and</b> <b>speakers</b> who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. However, {{freedom of speech and}} expression, though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed democracy, is not unfettered. The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to race or religion, and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover <b>and</b> <b>speakers</b> used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E

5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, <b>and</b> <b>speakers</b> are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression, which is {{guaranteed}} to Singapore citizens by Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore, is essential to the concept of representative democracy. Mechanisms available for the exercise of the right include the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, Speakers' Corner, and the new media. However, Article 14 enables Parliament to restrict the right to free speech on various grounds. One of these is the protection of reputation. Critics have charged that Cabinet ministers and members of the ruling People's Action Party have used civil defamation suits against opposition politicians to inhibit their activities and exclude them from Parliament. The Government has said that there is no evidence substantiating such claims. In addition, both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government. Article 14 protects the right {{to freedom of}} assembly which is relevant to free speech as the latter is often exercised at assemblies and gatherings. Free assembly is restricted in Singapore through laws that require permits to be obtained before events are held, though an exception is made for indoor events involving organizers <b>and</b> <b>speakers</b> who are citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights <b>and</b> <b>speakers</b> in the background.|$|E
