50|$|In his career, {{he became}} {{confidential}} clerk (<b>authorised</b> <b>signatory)</b> {{and head of}} research. In 1900, he became the CEO of Bayer. Inspired by Standard Oil on a US tour, Bayer became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of German chemical industries. Duisberg {{was head of the}} supervisory board for IG Farben. He died in Leverkusen.|$|E
50|$|Hörlein succeeded Arthur Eichengrün as {{the head}} of the {{pharmaceutical}} research laboratories at Bayer in 1911. In this role he developed the soporific Luminal in 1912, an important drug in the treatment of epilepsy. In 1914 Hörlein became an <b>authorised</b> <b>signatory</b> at the company, adding a deputy directorship in 1919 before in 1921 becoming an alternate member of the managing board of the company.|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is confined}} to the formal work of the boards of the parent companies as recorded in the approved minutes of meetings at Alfa Laval AB, Atlas Copco AB and Kockums Mekaniska Verkstads AB {{and is based on}} the Companies Law applying in Sweden since 1848. The study covers the time from the establishment of the joint stock company up to the ordinary general meeting of 1980 (1979 in the case of Kockums). Swedish legislation shows a clear shift of power from the shareholders general meeting via the board of directors to the managing director and his senior managers. However, the exercise of the Law in companies studied shows, that the power was distributed even faster in practice. From {{the last decade of the}} nineteenth century a managing director took over the day-to-day running of the company from the board, although the latter did still retain much of its decisionmaking right. <b>Authorised</b> <b>signatories</b> of the company were later on no longer required to be members of the board. From the 1950 s it became a rule for the managing director’ s colleagues not on the board to participate in board meetings as rapporteurs on their respective spheres of responsibility. This dramatically increased their power to influence - not to say guide - the board' s handling of the matters discussed. This process was completed during the 1960 s in the case of Alfa and Kockums, whereas at Atlas it was not accomplished until the end of the 1970 s...|$|R
50|$|Schneider became Carl Krauch's {{assistant}} at the IG Farben plant in Leuna in 1919 and soon rose through the corporate ranks. He was appointed an <b>authorised</b> <b>signatory</b> in 1921, a director two years later and became deputy manager of the Ammoniakwerke Merseburg plant in 1924. By 1928 he had been named an alternate member of IG Farben's managing board and was made plant manager at Merseburg in 1936.|$|E
50|$|Wu was {{appointed}} to the first board of directors of New China Hong Kong Group Limited in 1992, resigning in February 1993 to serve on its Executive Committee and act as Financial Advisor thereafter until its collapse in early 1999 with HK$1.5 billion in unpaid creditors. At the same time as being Vice-Chairman of Ernst & Young, the company's auditor, Wu, {{in addition to being a}} member of the company's executive committee, was an <b>authorised</b> <b>signatory</b> to 13 of its bank accounts, had significant personal dealings with its subsidiaries and lent money to it.|$|E
50|$|Norman Barry Cass was {{a partner}} in a solicitors' firm called Lipkin Gorman. He was an <b>authorised</b> <b>signatory</b> at the firm’s Lloyds Bank account. He took out £220,000 and used it for {{gambling}} at the Playboy Club, 45 Park Lane, London which was owned by Karpnale Ltd. Between March and November 1980, the club won £154,695 of the stolen money (the rest paid back to Mr Cass in ‘winnings’). Mr Cass fled to Israel, but was brought back and sentenced to three years prison for theft in 1984. Lipkin Gorman sued the club for return of the stolen money. At the time, gambling contracts were contrary to public policy, and therefore void under the Gaming Act 1845 section 18.|$|E
50|$|The {{principles}} for resolving {{the issue as}} to whether an individual {{has the authority to}} bind the company are not special to derivatives, they are derived from traditional agency law. In essence it is necessary to examine the relevant circumstances to determine whether the individual had the actual or apparent authority to bind the company to the transaction. It is common for parties to exchange <b>authorised</b> <b>signatory</b> lists of persons who have authority to execute confirmations and refer to this in the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement. However, {{this does not mean that}} this is determinative of the authority issue, and a person not on one of these lists may have the authority to sign a confirmation. As a matter of market practice, this issue is dealt with on the understanding that institutions are responsible for their own internal authorisation matters and that any person who is held out as being able to enter into OTC derivative transactions has the apparent authority to do so.|$|E
40|$|It is {{six years}} {{now that the}} first Import Trade Fair called 2 ̆ 01 cPartners of Progress 2 ̆ 01 d has been staged in Berlin. Its {{original}} form {{was that of a}} pure aid to information, but following actual needs, it gradually changed into a commercial trade fair of the developing countries. The number of exhibitors taking part in these fairs, and the growing interest shown by more and more expert visitors, have both made it clear that this kind of trade show has gained a firm position among German trade fairs and specialised exhibitions. We have asked Dr M. Busche, <b>authorised</b> <b>signatory</b> of the Berlin Exhibition Service (Ausstallungs-Dienst Berlin: ADB), about his experiences with the import show, 2 ̆ 01 cPartners of Progress 2 ̆ 01 d, which is designed exclusively for the promotion of imports from African, Asian, and Latin American developing countries...|$|E
