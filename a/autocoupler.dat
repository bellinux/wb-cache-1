50|$|When {{built the}} MM's had half the <b>autocoupler</b> {{equipment}} fitted, but had transition hooks for compatibility purposes. These were swapped {{for the full}} automatic couplers between 1933 and 1936.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1930s, {{the wagon}} {{couplings}} were switched from hook-and-chain to <b>autocoupler</b> type. When these conversions took place, the six-wheeled vans lost their middle axles and TFM wagons were converted back to standard T design.|$|E
50|$|During the <b>Autocoupler</b> Conversion {{project of}} the 1920s, severe {{shortages}} of louvre vans occurred. As a result, 50 M vans were boarded up and reclassed to MU to fill the gap. They were used {{for all sorts of}} traffic, even for bagged wheat in 1923. The vans were all converted back to M by 1934.|$|E
5000|$|Carriage set 40X-309Y-69YZ at Castlemaine, {{recently}} {{transferred from}} Seymour. Coupled with Z vans either end, fitted with <b>autocouplers.</b>|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the late}} 1920s recoding, the class was altered to NM. Around the same time, all but the class leader had <b>autocouplers</b> fitted (1 NM was not {{converted}} until 1941).|$|R
50|$|Notably, U 1141 through U 1217 were {{constructed}} with two axles instead of three, and <b>autocouplers,</b> the Westinghouse automatic brake system and increased load of 16 tons {{were part of}} the wagons from new.|$|R
50|$|There {{were six}} of these vans built, {{numbered}} 1 to 6. They were placed into service between 1899 and 1905. Car No.1 {{may have been}} relettered from BDBD as {{it was built in}} February 1899. Car No.2 built in October 1899 was photographed lettered as N2BDBD. Note the lettering 'N2BDBD', a strong indication that the lettering was '2BDBD' and the addition of the prefix 'N' at a later date caused problems due to letter spacing. It would also indicate haste in re-lettering and the avoidance of expense in repainting all the letters. In the 1910 recoding the class was relettered to NBC. The numbers were retained. With the recoding of the six car-vans in about 1910, one new car-van was built in 1910. This was car 7. Between 1926 and 1928 the cars were converted to <b>autocoupler</b> operation. NBC 4, 5 were scrapped in 1938. NBC 3 was scrapped in 1951. NBC 7 was scrapped in 1954. NBC 2 was 'condemned' in about 1954 but survived scrapping and is now in working order at the Puffing Billy Railway. NBC 1 was sold in 1954 and remained in the Colac area as a body on private property. The body was found in 1995 and was transferred to Puffing Billy workshops at Emerald. NBC 6 is now also at the Puffing Billy Railway.|$|E
30|$|In {{longitudinal}} train dynamics, {{draft gear}} {{is the most}} important component of the <b>autocoupler.</b> The <b>autocoupler</b> with friction type draft gear is the most common wagon connection in the Australian and North American freight system [1]. Similar autocouplers with draft gear are also used in the Indian freight system and their adoption in the freight system can be traced back in the early 1960 s. Mark- 50 was adopted in 1963, RF- 361 was adopted in 1965 and SL- 76 was adopted in 1977. Being {{an important part of the}} <b>autocoupler</b> system, the draft gear serves to absorb energy generated during the normal starting and braking of the freight railway wagon system and also during different train handling conditions, thus avoiding damage and failure of the coupling system. It thus functions as a passive vibration isolator to control and absorb high amplitude forces thereby avoiding damage to laden goods. The frequency of this longitudinal force depends on the train running condition and varies continuously.|$|E
30|$|The {{longitudinal}} force that the draft gear absorbs usually {{leads to the}} failure of its components, especially, the draft pads. Garg and Dukkipati [2] specified the problems caused by {{longitudinal force}}s and attributed the failure of draft gears due to excessive longitudinal draft forces. Initial work on longitudinal train dynamics was aimed towards reducing longitudinal oscillations in passenger train. Work done in this context involved measurement and simulation of in-train forces to reduce longitudinal oscillations [3]. The relation between lateral coupler force components and wheel unloading were studied by El-Sibaie [4] and a new method was proposed for evaluating the curving stability of any freight railway car under buff and draw conditions. Chen [5] proposed a mathematical model to calculate transient responses of the coupler, whereas McClanachan et al. [6] conducted experiments to determine the occurrences of coupler impacts combined with pitching motions in the wagon body. Then these interactions were simulated using NUCARS, ADAMS/Rail and a train-wagon interaction model. Cole and Sun [7] evaluated fatigue life of <b>autocoupler</b> systems with and without self-locking features of the draft gear for three types of wagon connection coupling systems. Nasr and Mohammadi [8] studied the effect of train braking delay time on train longitudinal dynamics. They carried out simulations for three different cases of long, medium and short brake application times for three different train forward velocities.|$|E
50|$|The final {{development}} of the long U type van design, the only change made over the type 5's was {{the replacement of the}} wheel handbrake for a lever type. All of these wagons were constructed, from new, with two axles spaced 15 ft apart, <b>autocouplers</b> and the Westinghouse air brake system.|$|R
50|$|When the six-wheel louvre vans {{were being}} {{converted}} to four-wheel in 1932-1934, the opportunity {{was taken to}} convert 50, later 60 vans to bogies instead of fixed-axle. The new vans were fitted with a coupler pocket capable of being fitted with either <b>autocouplers</b> or transition hooks, though the latter was far more common.|$|R
2500|$|Multi-function {{couplers}} (MFCs) are [...] "fully automatic" [...] couplers {{that make}} all {{connections between the}} rail vehicles (mechanical, air brake, and electrical) without human intervention, in contrast to <b>autocouplers</b> which just handle the mechanical aspects. The majority of trains fitted with these types of couplers are multiple units, especially those used in mass transit operations.|$|R
50|$|QN 31 {{was fitted}} with a cement mixer and {{associated}} equipment. It appears the vehicle {{was used for the}} installation of electrical overhead masts along the suburban routes, and a photo from the late 1930s shows this modification after conversion to <b>autocouplers.</b> By the 1970s it had been converted back to the normal type.|$|R

50|$|Most {{carriages}} were {{fitted with}} automatic couplers with an implicit agreement that sets {{would not be}} separated; one of the sets in the mid-30's had drawbars fitted between its three carriages experimentally. The automatic couplers {{were expected to be}} temporary, with scharfenberg couplers expected in June 1983 to replace them and the hard-wired electrical and pneumatic links between carriages. However, a derailment in late 2011 revealed that set SN1 on the standard gauge still had <b>autocouplers</b> between the carriages.|$|R
50|$|This {{code was}} {{discovered}} by Peter J Vincent during research in 1992. It appears that during the 1930s conversion project from screw couplers to automatic couplers resulted in a short-term lack of louvre and box vans; to fill the gap, fifty M cattle wagons were converted from 1932 during their own conversion to <b>autocouplers,</b> with wooden planks and louvres used to cover the gaps over the normal cattle wagon design. The wagons were restored to their M wagon type and identity by 1934.|$|R
5000|$|However, in late March 1911 {{the wagon}} had been {{converted}} to entirely general goods use, with the partition removed and a recoding to NH 1, the [...] "H" [...] in the class being {{a reference to the}} broad-gauge H box-vans then in use. The van was allowed to carry 10 tons of general goods.It gained <b>autocouplers</b> in 1928, and was sold the scrap dealer Coulston & Hyder in 1954. By 1988, the vehicle had been found and was placed into the Museum at Menzies Creek.|$|R
50|$|Two new dining {{cars were}} built in 1927, named {{respectively}} Avoca and Hopkins. These had a similar underframe to the standard E type carriage, but the body design was a much closer match to {{the latter half of}} the Long W type carriages, using steel plates rivetted to the frame. The cars externally looked very similar to the E type Sleepers, Werribee, Indi and Ovens. However, the pair were so heavy, at over 70 tons, that they had to be placed on Tait Motor-car bogies to support the tremendous weight. Aside from the three Pullman cars, these were the heaviest items (by axle load) of rollingstock to run in Victoria, possibly until modern times. Couplings were an oddity; the two were fitted with standard screw couplings when new, but by late 1935 they were both converted to <b>autocouplers.</b> A few months later they went to transition couplings, then back to proper <b>autocouplers</b> in 1936. Inside, the cars were petitioned at about the half-way mark, with 48 seats arranged in a 2+2 with 12 tables saloon configuration. Beyond this was a counter/buffet area facing the dining area; a corridor then ran along one side of the kitchen area, with the rest of the car devoted to a kitchen and food preparation area.|$|R
