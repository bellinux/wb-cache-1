5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located {{closer to the}} site of the game, would be attracted by its proximity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> weather offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E

5|$|Outflow {{became much}} better {{organized}} as Bertha became a tropical storm, and well-defined banding features persisted {{to the north}} of the storm. Though convection waned, forecasters predicted the friction between land <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> atmosphere to redevelop more deep convection, potentially resulting in further strengthening. However, the storm failed to intensify, and Bertha made landfall near Boothville, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm early on August 5. It slowly weakened over the swampy portions of southeastern Louisiana, and degenerated to a tropical depression later on the 5th after crossing Lake Ponchartrain. Initially it was expected that a ridge of high pressure to its north would keep Bertha moving to the west and result in it slowly dissipating. However, it turned to the southwest, and reached the Gulf of Mexico again on August 7. The circulation persisted over land, and Tropical Depression Bertha quickly redeveloped convection. Though the environment was not unfavorable, its proximity to land prevented re-strengthening to tropical storm status. Though the system showed periods of increased organization as it moved southwestward, Bertha remained a weak tropical depression until making landfall on south Texas to the east of Kingsville on August 9. Bertha weakened quickly over land, and dissipated over southern Texas ten hours after making landfall.|$|E

The majority of the annual precipitation falls between late June and the middle of September, with rains fully developing along the entire peninsula by mid-June. Seoul receives approximately 126mm (5in) of precipitation during the winter (December–March), but in July alone receives approximately 383mm (14.3in). July is the wettest month in the metropolis.|$|E
25|$|The strongest part of jet streams {{should be}} in {{proximity}} where temperature gradients are the largest.

Therefore, the strongest boreal winter jet streams are observed over east coast of North America and Eurasia. Since stronger vertical shear promotes baroclinic instability, the most rapid development of extratropical cyclones (so called bombs) is also observed along the east coast of North America and Eurasia.|$|E
25|$|Located on {{the east}} coast of Canada, Nova Scotia is almost entirely {{surrounded}} by the sea, which heavily influences the climate due to oncoming Atlantic storms. Due to the ocean's moderating effect Nova Scotia has cool summers as opposed to other cities in Canada around the same latitude. Nova Scotia's maritime climate is influenced by the cold air masses passing from the centre of Canada <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Winters can be very severe, blizzards occur several times each winter. Winters are cold compared with other coastal cities on the same latitude because the direction of the Atlantic currents are going east to Europe.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{factor is the}} relief. The Bulgarian mountains and valleys act as barriers or channels for air masses, causing sharp contrasts in weather over relatively short distances. The Balkan Mountains form a barrier which effectively stops the cool air masses coming from the north <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> masses from the south. The barrier effect of the Balkan Mountains is felt throughout the country: on the average, northern Bulgaria is about one degree cooler and receives about 192mm more rain than lowlands of southern Bulgaria. The Rilo-Rhodope Massif bars the warm Mediterranean air masses and limits the Mediterranean influence to the southern valleys of the rivers Struma, Mesta, Maritsa and Tundzha, despite the close proximity of the Aegean Sea.|$|E

The year-round warm climate allows coral reefs to grow along the coasts around Kaohsiung harbor, with Shoushan mountain being a small mountain completely made up of coral reefs and calcium carbonate, while the mountainous districts in the northeast include one of the highest peaks in East Asia, Mount Yushan. Other notable natural attractions includes the Mount Banping, Lotus Lake and the Dongsha Atoll National Park, which is currently inaccessible by the public due to military occupation.|$|E
25|$|After the WSC splits {{off from}} the Norwegian Atlantic Current it begins to enter very cold {{atmospheric}} conditions. The cold atmosphere is able to cool the surface water, {{and in some instances}} this water cools so much that some of the WSC water actually sinks due to its density increase, all the while holding its salinity constant. This is one element of the formation of the Lower Arctic Intermediate Water. As the current continues to move northward and reaches the continental shelf of western Svalbard it begins to encounter sea-ice. The sea-ice melts due to the warmth of the WSC, and thus a surface layer of very freshwater begins to exist. Winds mix the freshwater <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> salty water of the WSC mix, creating some Arctic Surface Water. This Arctic Surface Water is now less dense than the Atlantic Water in the WSC and thus the WSC begins to sink underneath the Arctic Surface Water. At this point the WSC is still relatively warm and very saline. Thus, this allows the Atlantic Water in the WSC to be completely isolated from the surface waters.|$|E
