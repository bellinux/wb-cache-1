5|$|An <b>atomic</b> {{line filter}} (ALF) is an {{advanced}} optical band-pass filter {{used in the}} physical sciences for filtering electromagnetic radiation with precision, accuracy, and minimal signal strength loss. <b>Atomic</b> line filters work via the absorption or resonance lines of <b>atomic</b> vapors and so may also be designated an <b>atomic</b> resonance filter (ARF).|$|E
5|$|<b>Atomic</b> clocks are {{far more}} {{accurate}} than any previous timekeeping device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the International <b>Atomic</b> Time; a standardized civil system, Coordinated Universal Time, is based on <b>atomic</b> time.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{relative}} <b>atomic</b> mass of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant is set in the new SI, <b>atomic</b> masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of <b>atomic</b> mass units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of the relative <b>atomic</b> mass and the <b>atomic</b> mass in units of dalton.|$|E
5|$|After {{the bombings}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{a number of}} Manhattan Project {{physicists}} founded the Bulletin of the <b>Atomic</b> Scientists, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about <b>atomic</b> weapons. In {{the face of the}} destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the nuclear arms race several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and <b>atomic</b> weapons. The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international <b>atomic</b> development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E
5|$|All group 3 {{elements}} have an odd <b>atomic</b> number, {{and therefore}} few stable isotopes. Scandium has one stable isotope, and yttrium itself {{has only one}} stable isotope, 89Y, is also the only isotope that occurs naturally. However, the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even <b>atomic</b> number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 {{is thought to be}} more abundant than it otherwise would be, {{due in part to the}} s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by electron emission (neutron → proton). Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with <b>atomic</b> mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable <b>atomic</b> nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. 89Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that <b>atomic</b> bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the <b>atomic</b> bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that <b>atomic</b> bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative <b>atomic</b> mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single <b>atomic</b> layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its <b>atomic</b> spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average <b>atomic</b> mass, and its <b>atomic</b> spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E

5|$|Cartoon animal super-heroes were longer-lived. Supermouse and Mighty Mouse were {{published}} continuously {{in their own}} titles {{from the end of}} the Golden Age through the beginning of the Silver Age. <b>Atomic</b> Mouse was given his own title in 1953, lasting ten years. <b>Atomic</b> Rabbit, later named <b>Atomic</b> Bunny, was published from 1955 to 1959. In the United Kingdom, the Marvelman series was published during the interregnum between the Golden and Silver Ages, substituting for the British reprints of the Captain Marvel stories after Fawcett stopped publishing the character's adventures.|$|E
5|$|Density {{criteria}} {{range from}} above 3.5g/cm3 to above 7g/cm3. <b>Atomic</b> weight definitions {{can range from}} greater than sodium (<b>atomic</b> weight 22.98); greater than 40 (excluding s- and f-block metals, hence starting with scandium); or more than 200, i.e. from mercury onwards. <b>Atomic</b> numbers of heavy metals are generally given as greater than 20 (calcium); sometimes this is capped at 92 (uranium). Definitions based on <b>atomic</b> number have been criticised for including metals with low densities. For example, rubidium in group (column) 1 of the periodic table has an <b>atomic</b> number of 37 but a density of only 1.532g/cm3, which is below the threshold figure used by other authors. The same problem may occur with <b>atomic</b> weight based definitions.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first <b>atomic</b> bombs. In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all <b>atomic</b> nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr's and Ben Mottelson's experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission and naval research projects.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} <b>Atomic</b> Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over <b>atomic</b> development, and separated the development, production and control of <b>atomic</b> weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E
5|$|For atoms {{with low}} <b>atomic</b> numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the <b>atomic</b> number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above <b>atomic</b> number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen (H) is the {{chemical}} element with <b>atomic</b> number 1. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, nonmetallic, tasteless, highly flammable diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2.

5|$|In 1945, {{physicist}} and <b>atomic</b> scientist Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Hume Cronyn) praises {{the discovery of}} <b>atomic</b> energy, but also warns of its dangers. American scientists such as Matt Cochran (Tom Drake), working {{under the guidance of}} Dr. Enrico Fermi (Joseph Calleia) and Dr. Marré (Victor Francen), have split the atom, and essentially beaten the Germans in the race to create an <b>atomic</b> bomb. With the assistance of Albert Einstein (Ludwig Stössel), they inform President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Godfrey Tearle) that a monumental discovery has been made.|$|E
5|$|January 19: Roosevelt {{formally}} authorizes the <b>atomic</b> bomb project.|$|E
5|$|January 1: the <b>Atomic</b> Energy Act of 1946 (known as the McMahon Act) takes effect, and the Manhattan Project {{is officially}} {{turned over to}} the United States <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the same}} year Henry Moseley {{provided}} additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory. These results refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (<b>atomic)</b> number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, <b>atomic</b> number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the <b>atomic</b> nuclear charge remains the accepted <b>atomic</b> model today.|$|E
5|$|Long-range <b>atomic</b> {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal <b>atomic</b> exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range <b>atomic</b> exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
5|$|Nixon is {{assigned}} to General Leslie Groves (Brian Donlevy), who is placed {{in charge of the}} project. Groves has to bring together the scientific, industrial and defense communities to build the <b>atomic</b> bomb. In 1945, following the death of Roosevelt, the new president, Harry S. Truman (Art Baker), continues to support the <b>atomic</b> project, now moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. When refined uranium-235 is obtained, the first <b>atomic</b> bomb is built and tested successfully in the New Mexico desert. Facing stiff resistance in the Pacific War, Truman orders the use of the <b>atomic</b> bomb against Japan in July 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1949, the Australian {{government}} {{created the}} Industrial <b>Atomic</b> Energy Policy Committee, chaired by Mark Oliphant and with Baxter as a member, to advise {{government on the}} development of nuclear power in Australia. On the committee's own recommendation, it was superseded by the <b>Atomic</b> Energy Policy Committee in April 1952. This in turn was replaced by the Australian <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission (AAEC) in November. The AAEC was run by a three commissioners, with Jack Stevens as chairman, Baxter as vice-chairman and Hugh Murray from the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company as the third member.|$|E
5|$|Technetium, with <b>atomic</b> number (denoted Z) 43, is the lowest-numbered {{element in}} the {{periodic}} table of which all isotopes are radioactive. The second-lightest exclusively radioactive element, promethium, has an <b>atomic</b> number of 61. <b>Atomic</b> nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers, even when {{the total number of}} nucleons (protons + neutrons) is even, and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Atomic</b> Energy Act of 1946 {{replaced}} the wartime Manhattan Project with the <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission (AEC) on January 1, 1947. The Act also established the General Advisory Committee (GAC) within the AEC {{to provide it}} with scientific and technical advice. It was widely expected that Conant would chair the GAC, but the position went to Robert Oppenheimer, the wartime director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory that had designed and developed the first <b>atomic</b> bombs. At the same time, the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) was established to coordinate defense research, and Bush asked Conant to head its <b>atomic</b> energy subcommittee, on which Oppenheimer also served. When the new AEC chairman David E. Lilienthal raised security concerns about Oppenheimer's relationships with communists, including Oppenheimer's brother Frank Oppenheimer, his wife Kitty and his former girlfriend Jean Tatlock, Bush and Conant reassured Lilienthal that they had known about it when they had placed Oppenheimer in charge at Los Alamos in 1942. With such expressions of support, AEC issued Oppenheimer a Q clearance, granting him access to <b>atomic</b> secrets.|$|E
5|$|The Beginning or the End (1947) is an American {{docudrama}} {{film about}} the development of the <b>atomic</b> bomb in World War II, directed by Norman Taurog, starring Brian Donlevy and Hume Cronyn, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film dramatizes the creation of the <b>atomic</b> bomb in the Manhattan Project and the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|The Bohr model {{exhibits}} {{difficulty for}} atoms with <b>atomic</b> number greater than 137, as any element with an <b>atomic</b> number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be travelling faster than c, {{the speed of}} light. Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa State Board of Education {{created the}} Institute of <b>Atomic</b> Research (IAR) as a {{coordinating}} body for research throughout the Midwestern United States on 1 November 1945, with Spedding as its director. The Manhattan Project continued {{to fund the}} activities of the Ames Project, but {{with the passage of the}} <b>Atomic</b> Energy Act of 1946, responsibility passed to the newly created <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission (AEC) on 1 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|The Oddo–Harkins rule {{holds that}} {{elements}} with even <b>atomic</b> numbers {{are more common}} that those with odd <b>atomic</b> numbers, {{with the exception of}} hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd <b>atomic</b> numbers have one unpaired proton {{and are more likely to}} capture another, thus increasing their <b>atomic</b> number. In elements with even <b>atomic</b> numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd <b>atomic</b> numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even <b>atomic</b> numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals) in the Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both Big Bang nucleosynthesis and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple-alpha process, fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon, and skipping over those three elements.|$|E
5|$|The Smyth Report is {{the common}} name of an {{administrative}} history written by American physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth about the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to develop <b>atomic</b> bombs during World War II. The full title of the report is A General Account of the Development of Methods of Using <b>Atomic</b> Energy for Military Purposes. It was {{released to the public}} on August 12, 1945, just days after the <b>atomic</b> bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9.|$|E
5|$|The <b>atomic</b> radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the <b>atomic</b> number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the <b>atomic</b> radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the <b>atomic</b> radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
5|$|The first {{accurate}} <b>atomic</b> clock, a caesium standard {{based on}} a certain transition of the caesium-133 atom, was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Calibration of the caesium standard <b>atomic</b> clock {{was carried out by}} the use of the astronomical time scale ephemeris time (ET).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} is a timeline of the Manhattan Project.

5|$|The {{isotopes}} of cobalt {{range in}} <b>atomic</b> weight from 50 u (50Co) to 73 u (73Co). The primary decay mode for isotopes with <b>atomic</b> mass unit values {{less than that}} of the most abundant stable isotope, 59Co, is electron capture and the primary mode of decay for those of greater than 59 <b>atomic</b> mass units is beta decay. The primary decay products before 59Co are element 26 (iron) isotopes and the primary products after are element 28 (nickel) isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of <b>atomic</b> numbers {{to the organization}} of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood. Mendeleev's periodic tables used <b>atomic</b> weight instead of <b>atomic</b> number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. <b>Atomic</b> weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known. Substitution of <b>atomic</b> numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, and Moseley predicted (in 1913) that the only elements still missing between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72 and 75, all of which were later discovered. The sequence of <b>atomic</b> numbers is still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.|$|E
5|$|There are 35 known {{isotopes}} of molybdenum, {{ranging in}} <b>atomic</b> mass from 83 to 117, {{as well as}} four metastable nuclear isomers.
