500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E
500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Australia visited Bangladesh in April 2006 and Mortaza {{played the}} whole series. Despite coming close to winning the first Test, Bangladesh {{ultimately}} lost both Tests in the series. In the final innings {{of the first}} Test, Mortaza dropped a difficult catch off Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{who went on to}} see his side to victory with 118 not out. Habibul Bashar, the Bangladesh captain, said of the dropped catch, [...] "If he had taken it we could have seen a different situation, but I must say he tried hard <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> know that he is a whole-hearted cricketer". Bangladesh lost the following three-match ODI series 3–0.|$|E

2500|$|Video {{recordings}} by two bystanders capturing [...] Gray's arrest showed Gray, {{screaming in}} pain, being dragged {{to a police}} van by officers, and then stepping up into the van. A bystander with connections to Gray stated that the officers were previously [...] "folding" [...] Gray: one officer bent Gray's legs backwards, and another held Gray down by pressing a knee into his neck. Witnesses commented Gray [...] "couldn't walk", [...] "can't use his legs", and [...] "his leg look broke <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> dragging him like that". Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts noted from the video that, [...] "Gray stood on one leg and climbed into the van on his own." [...] The Baltimore Sun reported that another witness saw Gray being beaten with police batons.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2000 Dirty Three {{released}} another studio album, Whatever You Love, You Are which McFarlane found showed [...] "deep, rich, emotional musical vistas, and furthered the band's {{connection to}} the music and approach of jazz great John Coltrane". In 2002, Dirty Three toured Taiwan together with US indie rocker Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power) and both artists returned in 2004. Also in 2004, they gigged at the Meredith Music Festival where a rain storm threatened their set, Ellis later remembered [...] "we just went out and played like our lives depended on it ... <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> went for it; otherwise it just fell to pieces". In late 2005, Dirty Three released their seventh major album, Cinder. Although following {{in the spirit of}} Ocean Songs, it diverges from their previous works: it was their first album to feature vocals (from Marshall and from Sally Timms of The Mekons), albeit on two of nineteentracks. Its tracks are generally shorter and more concise; and instead of their usual live-in-the-studio technique they recorded each member's work individually.|$|E
