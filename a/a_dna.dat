40|$|AbstractYellow vein {{disease of}} Ageratum conyzoides {{is caused by}} <b>a</b> viral <b>DNA</b> complex {{consisting}} of the genomic component (<b>DNA</b> <b>A)</b> of the monopartite begomovirus Ageratum yellow vein virus (AYVV, family: Geminiviridae) and <b>a</b> small satellite-like <b>DNA</b> β component. AYVV <b>DNA</b> <b>A</b> is unable to induce symptoms in this host alone but can systemically infect A. conyzoides in which it accumulates to low levels. Here, we demonstrate that the yellow vein phenotype can also be produced by co-inoculating A. conyzoides with AYVV <b>DNA</b> <b>A</b> and recDNA-Aβ 17, a naturally occurring recombinant of approximately {{the same size as}} DNA β that contains sequences from both <b>DNA</b> <b>A</b> and <b>DNA</b> β. Symptoms induced by <b>DNA</b> <b>A</b> and recDNA-Aβ 17 in A. conyzoides and Nicotiana glutinosa are qualitatively similar to those associated with <b>DNA</b> <b>A</b> and <b>DNA</b> β although milder. Recombination between <b>DNA</b> <b>A</b> and <b>DNA</b> β to produce a chimera resembling recDNA-Aβ 17 was observed after whitefly transmission of the disease in A. conyzoides.

5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{adenovirus}} (<b>Ad)</b> <b>DNA</b> replication system provides an assay {{to study the}} interaction of viral and host replication proteins with the DNA template {{in the formation of}} the preinitiation complex. This initiation system requires in addition to the origin <b>DNA</b> sequences 1) <b>Ad</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase (Pol), 2) Ad preterminal protein (pTP), the covalent acceptor for protein-primed DNA replication, and 3) nuclear factor I (NFI), a host cell protein identical to the CCAAT box-binding transcription factor. The interactions of these proteins were studied by coimmunoprecipitation and <b>Ad</b> origin <b>DNA</b> binding assays. The Ad Pol can bind to origin sequences only in the presence of another protein which can be either pTP or NFI. While NFI alone can bind to its origin recognition sequence, pTP does not specifically recognize <b>DNA</b> unless <b>Ad</b> Pol is present. Thus, protein-protein interactions are necessary for the targetting of either Ad Pol or pTP to the preinitiation complex. DNA footprinting demonstrated that the <b>Ad</b> <b>DNA</b> site recognized by the pTP. Pol complex was within the first 18 bases at the end of the template which constitutes the minimal origin of replication. Mutagenesis studies have defined the Ad Pol interaction site on NFI between amino acids 68 - 150, which overlaps the DNA binding and replication activation domain of this factor. A putative zinc finger on the Ad Pol has been mutated to a product that fails to bind the Ad origin sequences but still interacts with pTP. These results indicate that both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions mediate specific recognition of the replication origin by <b>Ad</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase...|$|R
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} section of <b>a</b> <b>DNA</b> {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult.

Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E

5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of <b>a</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of <b>a</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E

5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>DNA</b> double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of <b>a</b> <b>DNA</b> helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
