500|$|Jaevion Nelson, an HIV/AIDS campaigner {{and human}} rights advocate, also {{published}} {{an article on the}} subject in The Gleaner. He noted that his initial reaction was to question why Jones had gone to the dance party and why he was not satisfied in attending Jamaica's underground gay parties. He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in [...] "the culture of violence" [...] by which a victim is blamed for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on [...] "rebuilding this great nation on the principles of inclusivity, love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever". Also in The Gleaner, Sheila Veléz Martínez, <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Pittsburgh, condemned the murder as [...] "alarming evidence" [...] of the high rates of homophobia in Jamaican society.|$|E

He introduces an alternative to John Rawls's social primary goods that might be called natural primary goods: heritable mental and physical capacities and dispositions that are valued across a range of projects and pursuits. He suggests that reprogenetic technologies like embryo selection, cellular surgery, and human genetic engineering, which aim to enhance [...] "general purpose" [...] traits in offspring are less like childrearing practices a liberal government leaves to the discretion of parents than like practices the state makes compulsory.|$|E

2500|$|In {{her final}} address as vicereine, at Christmas, 1989, some of Sauvé's words were {{perceived}} as veiled warning about {{the failure of the}} Meech Lake Accord and she was criticised for this suspected breach of neutrality. The Premier of Newfoundland at the time, Clyde Wells, said it was [...] "inappropriate for the Crown to be intruding in political affairs that way" [...] and Bill Dawson, <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Western Ontario, described Sauvé's use of the word pact as [...] "injudicious." [...] This was a subject on which Sauvé and the Queen agreed; Elizabeth II had also publicly expressed on October 22 and 23, 1987 her personal support for the accord and received criticism from its opponents. Sauvé, though, always held that she had been speaking about Canadian unity in general and not the Meech Lake Accord in particular, or any side of the debate around it.|$|E
