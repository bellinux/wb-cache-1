5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time,</b> they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time</b> he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E
5|$|Blue and Red Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password that allows the player to resume the game <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time</b> with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E

5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time,</b> and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E

5|$|The {{infection}} {{has been}} preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization in {{the first day of}} life if possible. Two or three more doses are required <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time</b> for full effect. This vaccine works about 95% of the time. About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006. It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection. During an initial infection, care is based on the symptoms that a person has. In those who develop chronic disease, antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful; however, these drugs are expensive. Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds and ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers {{have evolved}} a mutualistic relationship. The flowers have nectar {{suited to the}} birds' diet, their color suits the birds' vision and their shape fits that of the birds' bills. The {{blooming}} times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds' breeding seasons. The floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species. These flowers {{also tend to be}} more ornate, complex, and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts. It is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first, and ornithophilous species diverged <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> There is not much scientific support for instances of the reverse of this divergence: from ornithophily to insect pollination. The diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species, and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species {{can be attributed to the}} direction of the shift in pollinator preference.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} theory, {{proposed by}} the Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner, suggests that the term Ostarrîchi is taken from a Slavic toponym 'Ostravica' meaning 'pointed hill', taking its popular meaning of 'Eastern realm' <b>at</b> <b>a</b> much <b>later</b> <b>time.</b> [...] This theory was rejected as untenable by Austrian linguist Heinz-Dieter Pohl.|$|R
5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{develops}} its narrative thread {{through the}} actions of its player-controlled protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa. Viewed from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical action-adventure fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering or buying items. In keeping with his ninja persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or running across water. The game world {{is made up of}} several distinct regions, most of which are connected via the city of Tairon, which functions as a hub. Access to these regions are obtained by fighting enemies, finding keys, or solving puzzles, inspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda video games. Dragon busts scattered throughout the regions provide the means to save player progress, permitting gameplay to be resumed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

Beginning with the Class of 2008 on June 7, 2008, a ceremony has been conducted to formally induct the inductees. There were no inductees in 2007 due to the planning of an international expansion to the NWA. On June 7, 2008, the Class of 2008 was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Ric Flair, a member of the Class of 2008 and a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) employee {{at the time of the}} ceremony, was inducted on October 4, 2008 after his WWE contract had expired; his WWE contract prevented him from appearing in other organizations.

Archer and Phlox, while wearing {{environmental}} suits, escort Tucker and Sato to Sickbay for treatment. Sato soon goes into cardiac-arrest, and Archer removes his gloves and helmet to assist her, but she cannot be resuscitated. They then administer a dose of radiation to Tucker, but that too is ineffective. Phlox then leaves to resume work from the Bridge. Suddenly, Tucker and Sato are reanimated by the aliens, whowhile possessing the crewmenexplain the situation to a surprised Archer, who then makes an impassioned speech on behalf of his crew. The aliens decide to modify their procedures, choosing to resurrect and cure the infected crew members, when they previously would have left them to die. The aliens erase the encounter from the crew's memory. Archer orders a warning beacon to be placed above the planet, and the aliens leave to begin planning first contact with more advanced humans <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Napoleon I of France {{arrived at}} Schönbrunn Palace {{to play the}} Turk. According to an {{eyewitness}} report, Mälzel took responsibility {{for the construction of}} the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon {{before the start of the}} match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> <b>time,</b> playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.|$|E
