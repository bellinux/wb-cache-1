40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{investigate}} the relationship between English language learning classroom anxiety and students' English language <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> result. For this purpose 210 grade 12 (twelve) students {{were randomly selected from}} Jimma Preparatory School. A self reporting questionnaire i. e. Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS), developed by Horwitz, Horwitz and Cope (1986), consisted of 33 items, was administered to measure the level of foreign language classroom anxiety of the students. The students' first semester English mid term exam result was used to determine the relationship between English language classroom anxiety and English language <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> result. Furthermore, descriptive statistics to determine anxiety level, t-test to find out significance difference between males and females students anxiety level and achievement and Pearson's Moment Correlation Coefficient to determine relationship between anxiety and <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> result were used to test the research problems. The result of the data analysis indicated that most of the students were found to be anxious. With respect to sex no significance difference was observed between males and females on their foreign language classroom anxiety level. The study further confirmed that there was no significant negative relationship between students' English language classroom anxiety and English language <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> result at the significance level of O. 01. The study also investigated that there was <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> result variation among the subjects of the study with respect to their anxiety level.

25|$|The {{restructuring}} {{has been}} credited with improvements. To better allocate resources, Fenty and Rhee significantly reduced the school system's central administrative staff and closed 23 schools with low enrollments. After 2007, student <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> {{at the secondary level}} reportedly rose 14points in reading and 17points in math. Student SAT scores rose 27points in 2010. Graduation rates rose each year since 2007, and 72 percent of District students took the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT), which functions as a practice test for college bound students. Fenty's administration had also taken on a major, five-year maintenance and construction effort to improve school buildings by 2014. Fenty and Rhee successfully negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Washington Teachers Union that establishes a system of performance-based teacher compensation.|$|E
25|$|The SAT rose in {{prominence}} after World War II due {{to several}} factors. Machine-based scoring of multiple-choice tests taken by pencil {{had made it}} possible to rapidly process the exams. The G.I. Bill produced an influx of millions of veterans into higher education. The formation of the Educational Testing Service (ETS) also {{played a significant role in}} the expansion of the SAT beyond the roughly fifty colleges that made up the College Board at the time. The ETS was formed in 1947 by the College Board, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the American Council on Education, to consolidate respectively the operations of the SAT, the GRE, and the <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> developed by Ben Wood for use with Conant's scholarship exams. The new organization was to be philosophically grounded in the concepts of open-minded, scientific research in testing with no doctrine to sell and with an eye toward public service. The ETS was chartered after the death of Brigham, who had opposed the creation of such an entity. Brigham felt that the interests of a consolidated testing agency would be more aligned with sales or marketing than with research into the science of testing. It has been argued that the interest of the ETS in expanding the SAT in order to support its operations aligned with the desire of public college and university faculties to have smaller, diversified, and more academic student bodies as a means to increase research activities. In 1951, about 80,000 SATs were taken; in 1961, about 800,000; and by 1971, about 1.5 million SATs were being taken each year.|$|E

Learners’ language {{ability and}} achievement can be assessed by many different methods. An increasing number of language programs have been using alternative assessments along with teacher grades and formal tests. Self-assessment can {{also serve as a}} measure of learners’ language ability. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship of students’ selfassessment with teachers’ estimates of their students’ <b>achievement</b> and <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> results. The relationship between the teachers’ estimates and the <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> was also examined. The criterion validity of the self-assessment test, as a function of its correlation with the external measures of the students’ language ability, ie., the teachers’ estimates and the <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> scores, was determined. Additionally, the influence of the students’ gender and achievement (indicated by their test scores) on their selfassessment behaviour was explored. Two questionnaires were used to elicit the perceived assessments of the students’ language abilities: one for the students' self-assessment, and the other for teachers’ estimates of the students’ language <b>achievement.</b> The <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> scores served as a third measure of the students’ language skills. The data were analysed by using Pearson Product Moment correlation to establish the relationship between the three methods of assessment. T-tests and Pearson Product Moment correlation were used to find out the effect of the students’ gender and achievement on their self-assessment behaviour. The results showed that there were only weak correlations between the students’ self-assessment and the other two measures, namely, the <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> and the teachers’ assessment. The correlations between the teachers’ estimates and the <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> were higher, but still low for assessment purposes. In this context, for example, vocabulary showed virtually no correlations between the <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> scores and the two subjective measures of the students’ language ability, ie., selfassessment and teachers’ estimates. No effect of gender on the students’ self-assessment behaviour was found. However, a strong relationship between the students’ achievement, as indicated by their test scores, and their self-assessment behaviour was observed. Better students (those with higher test scores) tended to be less overevaluative of their language abilities compared with their weaker peers (those with lower test scores). The study suggests that students’ self-assessment may display a low criterion validity, defined as a function of its correlation with <b>achievement</b> <b>test</b> scores. Teachers’ estimates of their students’ language achievement may have a weak relationship with the students’ test performance. The study also suggests that vocabulary may be the hardest skill to self-assess. Nurov, AvazkhonM. S...|$|R
