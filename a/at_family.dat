5|$|DNA {{analysis}} from 16S rRNA sequences has supported a hypothesis, originally suggested by Cleveland and colleagues in 1934, that these insects are most {{closely related to}} wood-eating cockroaches (genus Cryptocercus, the woodroach). This earlier conclusion had been based on the similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in the wood-eating cockroaches to those in certain species of termites regarded as living fossils. In the 1960s additional evidence supporting that hypothesis emerged when F.A. McKittrick noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and Cryptocercus nymphs. These similarities have led some authors to propose that termites be reclassified as a single family, the Termitidae, within the order Blattodea, which contains cockroaches. Other researchers advocate the more conservative measure of retaining the termites as the Termitoidae, an epifamily within the cockroach order, which preserves the classification of termites <b>at</b> <b>family</b> level and below.|$|E

He also spent much time singing in choirs and in media commercials, and recorded his first album {{at the age of}} seven. His first leading role in a professional theatre production was at 12years of age in the musical version of Rubber Tarzan, a popular Danish children's novel by Ole Lund Kirkegaard (1940–1979). His voice broke two weeks after the musical's last performance, and he did not sing for the next few years.|$|E

40|$|Marriage {{serves as}} the {{important}} means for the big family to strengthen and expand their power. In the Japanese colonial era, besides the huge wealth, the Lin <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Wufeng also enjoyed extremely high reputation for their involvement in political and social movements. During that time, it was the topic worthy of attention that which families they had united by marriage and what standards they stuck to. This article focuses on the marriage network of the Lin <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Wufeng based on diaries and interview recordings {{of members of the}} Lin family such as Lin Hsien-Tang, Yang Shui-Hsin and Chen Ling, etc. According to the preliminary studies, the marriage objects of the Lin <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Wufeng in the Japanese colonial era include: firstly, political and social movement partners, such as Yang Tzu-Pei <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Wu Chi, Yang Chao-Chia <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Qatgshui, Chang Huan-Kui <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Daya, Lin Kuan-Min <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Chiayi;secondly, renowned <b>families</b> in central regions, such as Tsai Lien-Fang <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Qingshui, Wu Luan-Chi <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Taichung, the Lv <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Yuyun Mansion, Yang Chi-Chen <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Changhua, etc.;thirdly, Christian families, such as Kao Chang and Liu Jui-Shan <b>families</b> <b>at</b> Tainan;fourthly, the Japanese family. Among them, those married Christians and the Japanese are mostly the younger generation who had received modern education. It reveals that the original marriage circle tended to expand over time. In conclusion, the marriage objects of the Lin <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Wufeng mostly belong to the renowned leadership in central Taiwan with certain assets and social status. The frequent intermarriage brings both families closer, but such a good match for marriage can't necessarily guarantee happiness. Several un happy marriages {{can be seen in the}} Lin <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Wufeng. However, the Lin <b>family</b> <b>at</b> Wufeng didn't attach absolute importance to the so-called good match. For example, Lin Hsien-Tang paid more attention to the personality and health of his daughter-in-law and son-in-law than to their family background, which revealed his open mind. 婚姻是大家族鞏固和拓展權勢的重要手段。日治時期霧峰林家除了財勢傲人外，由於投身政治、社會運動，在民間亦具有極高的聲望。當此之時，霧峰林家與哪些家族締結姻親，其選取標準為何，實為一個值得關注的課題。本文乃利用林獻堂、楊水心、陳岺等霧峰林家成員的日記和訪談紀錄，描繪出霧峰林家的婚姻網絡。 根據初步的研究，日治時期霧峰林家的聯姻對象包括：（一）政治和社會運動夥伴，包括梧棲楊子培家族、清水楊肇嘉家族、大雅張煥珪家族、嘉義林寬敏家族；（二）中部名門大族，包括清水蔡蓮舫家族、臺中吳鸞旂家族、筱雲山莊呂家、彰化楊吉臣家族等等；（三）基督教家族，包括臺南高長家族、臺南劉瑞山家族；（四）日本人家族。其中，與基督徒和日本人通婚者，多為林家受過新式教育的年輕一代，顯示隨著時間演變，原本的婚姻圈有擴大的現象。 總結而言，霧峰林家的聯姻對象多為臺灣中部知名的社會領導階層，具有一定的資產和社會地位。由於大家族間彼此通婚頻繁，常有親上加親的現象，但是此種門當戶對的婚姻，卻並非幸福的保證，霧峰林家即有幾起不幸婚姻的案例。 不過，霧峰林家並非絕對拘泥於門當戶對，例如林獻堂對於媳婦、女婿的人品和健康的重視，勝過家世，顯示其觀念有較為開明的一面...|$|R
