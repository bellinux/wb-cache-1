500|$|On February 21, 1989, former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey filed {{a lawsuit}} against Orion Pictures, {{claiming}} defamation and invasion of privacy. The lawsuit, filed at a United States district court in Meridian, Mississippi, asked for $8 million in damages. Rainey, who was the county sheriff {{at the time of the}} 1964 murders, alleged that the filmmakers of Mississippi Burning had portrayed him in an unfavorable light with the fictional character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain). [...] "Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is referring to me," [...] he stated. [...] "What they said happened <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> to me certainly wasn't right and something ought to be done about it." [...] Rainey's lawsuit was unsuccessful; he dropped the suit after Orion's team of lawyers threatened to prove that the film was based on fact, and that Rainey was indeed suspected in the 1964 murders.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, a {{study found}} that when dogs and their owners interact, {{extended}} eye contact (mutual gaze) increases oxytocin levels in both the dog and its owner. As oxytocin {{is known for its}} role in maternal bonding, it is considered likely that this effect has supported the coevolution of human-dog bonding. One observer has stated, [...] "The dog could have arisen only from animals predisposed to human society by lack of fear, attentiveness, curiosity, necessity, and recognition of advantage gained through collaboration....the humans and wolves involved in the conversion were sentient, observant beings constantly making decisions about how they lived <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> based on the perceived ability to obtain at a given time and place what they needed to survive and thrive. They were social animals willing, even eager, to join forces with another animal to merge their sense of group with the others' sense and create an expanded super-group that was beneficial to both in multiple ways. They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined. Powerful emotions were in play that many observers today refer to as love – boundless, unquestioning love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nine {{people were}} killed while {{watching}} the World Cup in a cafe, and 8 members of a family died that Israel has said were inadvertently killed. A Golani soldier interviewed about his operations inside Gaza said they often could not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters because some Hamas operatives dressed in plainclothes and the night vision goggles made everything look green. An IDF spokesperson said that Hamas [...] "deploys in residential areas, creating rocket launch sites, command and control centers, and other positions {{deep in the heart}} of urban areas. By doing so, Hamas chooses the battleground where the IDF is forced to operate." [...] The highest-ranking U.S. military officer, Army General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that [...] "Israel went to extraordinary lengths to limit collateral damage and civilian casualties". Later in his speech he said, [...] "the Pentagon three months ago sent a 'lessons-learned team' of senior officers and non-commissioned officers to work with the IDF to see what could be learned from the Gaza operation, to include the measures they took to prevent civilian casualties <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> with tunneling." [...] Col. Richard Kemp told The Observer [...] "IDF has taken greater steps than any other army in the history of warfare to minimise harm to civilians in a combat zone" ...|$|E
2500|$|If she {{was allowed}} no overt {{political}} role, Eleanor {{was a highly}} intelligent and cultured woman and found other satisfying outlets for her energies. [...] She was an active patroness of literature, maintaining the only royal scriptorium known to have existed {{at the time in}} Northern Europe, with scribes and at least one illuminator to copy books for her. Some of the works produced were apparently vernacular romances and saints' lives, but Eleanor's tastes ranged far more widely than that and were not limited to the products of her own writing office. The number and variety of new works written for her show that her interests were broad and sophisticated. In the 1260s she commissioned the production of the Douce Apocalypse. [...] She has also been credibly linked to the Trinity Apocalypse, although the question of whether she commissioned it, or simply owned an apocalypse which influenced its production, remains a matter of debate. On Crusade in 1272, she had De Re Militari by Vegetius translated for Edward. [...] After she succeeded her mother as countess of Ponthieu in 1279, a romance was written for her about the life of a supposed 9th century count of Ponthieu. She commissioned an Arthurian romance with a Northumbrian theme, possibly for the marriage of the Northumbrian lord John de Vescy, who married a close friend and relation of hers. In the 1280s, Archbishop Peckham wrote a theological work for her to explain what angels were <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> She almost certainly commissioned the Alphonso Psalter, now in the British Library, and is also suspected to be the commissioner of the Bird Psalter which also bears the arms of Alphonso and his prospective wife. In January 1286 she thanked the abbot of Cerne for lending her a book—possibly a treatise on chess known to have been written at Cerne in the late thirteenth century—and her accounts reveal her in 1290 corresponding with an Oxford master about one of her books. There is also evidence suggesting that she exchanged books with her brother Alfonso X.|$|E
