5|$|Allen {{was born}} with a {{deformed}} left <b>arm</b> <b>from</b> the effects of a rare object, known as Innocence. Abandoned by his parents, he was raised in a circus and meets clown Mana Walker (who adopts him when his contract with the circus expires). When Mana dies, Allen tries to resurrect him through Millennium Earl. Mana, revived as a demon known as an Akuma, cuts Allen's left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakens as an anti-Akuma weapon, later called , and destroys Mana. His left eye allows him to see the souls of Akuma. Exorcist General Cross Marian soon adopts Allen as a disciple.|$|E

5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>from</b> the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire {{superseded}} the Hurricane {{to become}} the backbone of RAF Fighter Command, and saw action in the European, Mediterranean, Pacific, and South-East Asian theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>from</b> 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original airframe {{was designed to be}} powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030hp (768kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, Rolls-Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2,340hp (1,745kW). As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its service life.|$|E
5|$|Glorious {{could carry}} up to 48 aircraft; when first recommissioned, she carried Fairey Flycatcher fighters, Blackburn Dart and Blackburn Ripon torpedo bombers, and Fairey IIIF {{reconnaissance}} planes of the Fleet Air <b>Arm.</b> <b>From</b> 1933 until Glorious {{returned to the}} United Kingdom in April 1940, aside from a period when refitting in the mid-1930s, she carried 802 Squadron which flew a mixture of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters, until re-equipping with a dozen Gloster Sea Gladiators in May 1939. 812 and 823 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions. They flew the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and as well as Fairey IIIF and Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. When Glorious recommissioned after her refit in 1935, 825 Squadron was embarked, initially with Fairey IIIFs, but the squadron converted to Fairey Swordfish in May 1936.|$|E

On December 11, 1947, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Red Embree. To begin the 1948 Cleveland Indians season, Clark was in a crowded outfield position battle, with Larry Doby, Thurman Tucker, and Wally Judnich fighting for playing time, but Clark was noted as the most interesting to watch by The Sporting News due to owner Bill Veeck's high regard for him. The only weakness noted in his game was a sore <b>arm</b> <b>from</b> the previous season, to which Clark responded that reading the newspaper was the first time he noticed anything about a bad arm.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the October meeting, JG50 was disbanded and its {{personnel}} absorbed into I./Jagdgeschwader 301, a Wilde Sau night-fighter unit. While operational, JG 50 had claimed 45 Allied four-engined bombers. Graf was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) and on 11 November, appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG11, when Mader was transferred to JG54 in the Leningrad sector. Aside from Grislawski, who was kept on as Staka (the squadron commander) of 1./ JG1, he managed to take his soccer players and friends with him. Sunday 20 February marked the start of ”Big Week” – six consecutive days of concentrated bombing by the USAAF designed to overwhelm the German defences. JG11 was heavily involved and Graf shot down a B-24 Liberator for his 208th victory on the 24 February. His 209th aerial victory, west of Berlin on 6 March, was over another B-24 Liberator, of the 453d Bombardment Group. It was actually an Herausschuss (separation shot) – a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from its combat box and which the Luftwaffe counted as an aerial victory. On 29 March, Graf shot down two P-51 Mustangs that were making a fighter sweep ahead of their bomber stream. Chased and harried {{by the rest of}} their squadron, he tried to ram another before bailing out. Landing heavily, he broke both knees and fractured his arm. These would prove to be his final air victories. Prompt attention from the JG11 medic saved Graf from losing his <b>arm.</b> <b>From</b> April to early July he spent time recovering in a hospital in his home-town of Engen. On June 24, he married Jobst, whom he had been seeing over the past year.|$|E

25|$|Upper {{extremity}} casts {{are those}} which encase the arm, wrist, and/or hand. A long arm cast encases the <b>arm</b> <b>from</b> the hand to about 2inches below the arm pit, leaving the fingers and thumbs free. A short arm cast, in contrast, stops {{just below the}} elbow. Both varieties may, depending on the injury and the doctor's decision, include one or more fingers or the thumb, in which case it is called a finger spica or thumb spica cast.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the stock delivery, an arm ball is delivered with rolling the fingers {{down the back of}} the ball on release. This means the ball has backspin on it, and it does not turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on {{in the direction of the}} <b>arm,</b> <b>from</b> which it derives its name. However, by keeping the seam upright, the bowler can also hope to obtain some outswing away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.|$|E
