5|$|Before {{broadcasting}} began, the BBC considered airing {{the show}} on <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers {{were less likely to}} watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that Spooks would boost its timeslot. However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays. The series began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One during the 9 to 10pm timeslot, and continued on every Monday night until 17 June 2002, {{with the exception of the}} fourth episode, which was viewed on Tuesday 4 June starting at 10pm, due to an overrun of the coverage of Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. The episodes were also repeated on the digital channel BBC Choice. In the US, the first series aired in mid-2003 on A. However, each episode had approximately ten minutes edited out to accommodate for advert breaks. The DVD release of the series in America contained the uncut episodes. The first series was later repeated on BBC America, alongside the second series starting in June 2007.|$|E

5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night</b> and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E

25|$|Anderson cameoed as MacGyver in {{what seemed}} to be <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live {{advertisement}} parody featuring the show's recurring character MacGruber (portrayed by Will Forte), but was rather a real commercial for both Saturday Night Live and Pepsi, in which the titular character becomes obsessed with the soft drink.

The sophistication is surface deep: you can imagine him in Times Square on <b>a</b> <b>Saturday</b> <b>night,</b> sulky, defiant, out of his depth, not quite certain how he wants to spend the evening.|$|E
