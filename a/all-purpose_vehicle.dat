In One Car Too Far former British Special Forces {{operative}} and an American car junkie are dropped into incredible landscapes and forced {{to work together to}} survive and ultimately escape to safety. The twist, they will have to take a small red car with them. It's the perfect combination as one knows how to drive and the other knows how to survive. With no proper roads and no real supplies, the two must rely on instinct and expertise alone to make it out. From the treacherous slopes and near-freezing temperatures of a mountain top, to the wet, dense vegetation of the rainforest, they use whatever supplies they can find to turn a regular car into an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> to get them over, under and through just about any obstacle in their way.|$|E
5000|$|... "However, {{as part of}} the {{backlash}} against the women's movement, opposition quickly organized against Title IX. Worried about how it would affect men's athletics, legislators and collegiate sports officials became concerned and looked for ways to limit its influence. One argument was that revenue-producing sports such as college football should be exempted from Title IX compliance. Another was that in order for schools and colleges to comply, they would have to cut men's sports such as wrestling. Others argued that federal legislation was not the way to achieve equality or even parity. Finally, conservative opponents of women's rights believed that feminists used Title IX as an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> to advance their agenda in the schools. Since 1975, there have been twenty court challenges to Title IX in an attempt to whittle down greater gender equity in all fields of education—mirroring {{the ups and downs of}} the women's movement at large. According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, female students received 1.3 million fewer opportunities to participate in high school athletics than their male peers in the 2006-2007 school years. Yet as a result of Title IX, women have benefited from involvement in amateur and professional sports and, in turn, sports are more exciting with their participation." ...|$|E

25|$|Farming {{and fishing}} {{are the two}} main industries. Major {{products}} include rice, corn, sugarcane, and tilapia. Pampanga is the tilapia capital of the country because of its high production reaching 214,210.12 metric tons in 2015. In addition to farming and fishing, the province supports thriving cottage industries that specialize in wood carving, furniture making, guitars and handicrafts. Every Christmas season, the province of Pampanga, especially {{in the capital city}} of San Fernando becomes the center of a thriving industry centered on handcrafted lighted lanterns called parols that display a kaleidoscope of light and color. Other industries include its casket industry and the manufacturing of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the municipality of Santo Tomas.|$|R

We have investigated haptic force displays for transmitting feedback from vehicular services to the driving person with vibro-tactile elements, integrated into the car seat and backrest. A haptic display would be implicit perceivable, passive in its attentiveness, and display only private messages. Empirical studies regarding reaction times for the different modalities vision, sound, and touch, as well as age- and gender-dependent evaluations have been conducted, with the aim to identify general conditions for a <b>all-purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> interaction system and to justify the usage of haptic feedback. Experimental data have been acquired in a simulated driving environment in order to guarantee safety for test persons, repeatability of the experiment itself, and similar conditions for each test run...|$|E

40|$|During 1990, {{numerous}} {{questions were}} raised regarding {{the ability of}} the current shuttle orbiter to provide reliable, on demand support of the planned space station. Besides being plagued by reliability problems, the shuttle lacks the ability to launch some of the heavy payloads required for future space exploration, and is too expensive to operate as a mere passenger ferry to orbit. Therefore, additional launch systems are required to complement the shuttle in a more robust and capable Space Transportation System. In December 1990, the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Future of the U. S. Space Program, advised NASA of the risks of becoming too dependent on the space shuttle as an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Furthermore, the committee felt that reducing the number of shuttle missions would prolong the life of the existing fleet. In their suggestions, the board members strongly advocated the establishment of a fleet of unmanned, heavy lift launch vehicles (HLLV's) to support the space station and other payload-intensive enterprises. Another committee recommendation was that a space station crew rotation/rescue vehicle be developed {{as an alternative to the}} shuttle, or as a contingency if the shuttle is not available. The committee emphasized that this vehicle be designed for use as a personnel carrier, not a cargo carrier. This recommendation was made to avoid building another version of the existing shuttle, which is not ideally suited as a passenger vehicle only. The objective of this project was to design both a Personnel Launch System (PLS) and a family of HLLV's that provide low cost and efficient operation in missions not suited for the shuttle...|$|E

40|$|The lunar {{construction}} {{utility vehicle}} (LCUV) is an <b>all-purpose</b> construction <b>vehicle</b> which will {{aid in the}} robotic assembly of a lunar outpost. The LCUV will have the following capabilities: (1) must be self supporting including repairs; (2) must offload itself from a lunar lander; (3) must be telerobotic and semi-autonomous; (4) {{must be able to}} transport one space station common module; (5) must allow for man-rated operation; and (6) must be able to move lunar regolith for site preparation. This study recommends the use of an elastic tracked vehicle. Detailed material analyses of most of the LCUV components were accomplished. The body frame, made of pinned truss elements, was stress analyzed using NASTRAN. A track connection system was developed; however, kinematic and stress analyses are still required. This design recommends the use of hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells for power. Thermal control {{has proven to be a}} problem which may be the most challenging technically. A tentative solution has been proposed which utilizes an onboard and towable radiator. Detailed study of the heat dissipation requirements is needed to finalize radiator sizing. Preliminary work on a man-rated cabin has begun; however, this is not required during the first mission phase of the LCUV. Finally, still in the conceptual phases, are the communication, navigation and mechanical arm systems...|$|R
