One of the anti-tank vehicles opened fire, after receiving permission, <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> believed was an Iraqi tank. Instead, the missile destroyed a friendly LAV-AT a few hundred meters in front of it. Despite this loss, the platoon continued forward and soon opened fire on the Iraqi tanks with the LAV-25s' autocannons. The fire could not penetrate the tanks' armor, but did damage their optics and prevented the tanks from fighting back effectively.|$|E

The Al Wefaq political party {{said that the}} sentences were hindering efforts at dialogue and damaging the country's international reputation. It rejected the appeal sentence {{and said they were}} contradictory to solving the crisis. The Bahraini Press Association described the verdict as [...] "unfair and outrageous" [...] and [...] "marred by abuses and violations of all legal and human rights standards". Human rights lawyer Mohamed al-Tajer said the appeal verdict was [...] "shocking" [...] and that [...] "he judge dismissed the appeal". In an op-ed in Al Wasat, Kassim Hussain argued that the most remembered words about the case of Bahrain Thirteen would be Ibrahim Sharif's words: [...] "These [...] trials are trials of ideas".|$|E

Oliphant became a harsh critic of nuclear weapons {{and a member of the}} Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, saying, [...] "I, right from the beginning, have been terribly worried by the existence of nuclear weapons and very much against their use." [...] His wartime work would have earned him a Presidential Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm, but the Australian government vetoed this honour, as government policy at the time was not to confer honours on civilians.|$|E

[...] Jack Foley of IndieLondon rated it 2.5 out of five. Foley felt the death of Porter in the first episode was [...] "striking" [...] since Armitage was the [...] "main reason for watching." [...] The reviewer also {{believed that}} while the first series [...] "offered a keen mix of Spooks and 24 that expertly blended top-drawer action with some emotional complexity and intrigue," [...] the second series [...] "already feels inferior to both by virtue of the fact that its brains appear to lie in its pants, or blown from Porter's head."

[...] Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "the product of a first-rate lineup," [...] and praised the album's diversity, saying, [...] "The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist." [...] Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the album an [...] "essential" [...] rating, and said, [...] "KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, [...] "it would be nice to hear [...] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more", and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, [...] "KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best." [...] Liz Armstrong of the Daily Herald thought the guest contributors added significant differences to their individual songs.|$|E

After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Guardian {{published}} the story, the Chicago Police provided a statement saying, without specifics, {{that there is}} nothing improper taking place <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> called the “sensitive” location, home to undercover units.

[...] Kevin Cowherd {{said that in the}} book, Rakoff [...] "makes a strong bid for the title of Most Neurotic Man on the Planet, and the results are absolutely hilarious – when they're not achingly revealing and tinged with sadness." [...] Max Magee called the collection a [...] "meta-article in which he talks about the particulars and relative merits of his assignment as he embarks on that assignment" [...] and that [...] "the reader feels invited in for a behind the scenes look <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to be a disaffected, overly-qualified, under-ambitious journalist as he takes on his fluffy assignments."
