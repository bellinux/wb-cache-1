5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement.

It discusses the characteristics of teaching as <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>craft</b> <b>and</b> critiques the move towards standardisation and conformity in favour of originality, creativity and innovation. It suggests that to see teaching as art is more holistic, satisfying and transformative than to see it as craft.

5|$|Though <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement.|$|E

The separation of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>craft</b> in LC, in N and TT respectively, compared to their collocation in LC’s contemporaries, Dewey Decimal Classification and Cutter’s Expansive Classification, suggests divergent views of the arts within librarianship, illuminating American views on the relative definitions of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>craft</b> from the mid-nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries...|$|R
