This was because their site is spread over two council boundaries and Wansbeck Council approved the scheme, but Castle Morpeth refused. An appeal hearing {{was given in}} April 2008, and permission was eventually granted in January 2009 {{for the construction of}} up to 13 turbines, producing 30MW of electricity.|$|E

25|$|Mahanadi Coalfields Limited, a {{subsidiary}} of Coal India Limited located at Sambalpur, produced 100.28million tonnes of coal and had a profit before tax during 2010–2011 at Rs 4039.30crore. The smelter set up by Indal in 1959 at Hirakud was the country’s second <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelter</b> operating on grid power sourced from the hydro power station of the Hirakud Dam. It {{was the first in}} India to adopt clean coal combustion technology that uses a circulating fluidised bed, which is considered environmentally friendly. Currently the smelter has a capacity of 213,000 tpa, and provides employment to around 1700 persons.|$|E
25|$|While many {{hydroelectric}} projects supply public electricity networks, {{some are}} created to serve specific industrial enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built {{to provide the}} substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants, for example. The Grand Coulee Dam switched to support Alcoa aluminium in Bellingham, Washington, United States for American World War II airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In Suriname, the Brokopondo Reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the Alcoa aluminium industry. New Zealand's Manapouri Power Station was constructed to supply electricity to the <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelter</b> at Tiwai Point.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Alcan {{had applied}} for {{planning}} permission {{for the construction}} of a new <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelter</b> in Northumberland at Lynemouth. Later that year, Alcan was granted the permission and site preparation would soon begin. However, to meet the electric demand of the new smelter, a power station would also be needed to be built. Therefore, Lynemouth Power Station was constructed only [...] from the <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelter.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lynemouth Power Station is a {{coal and}} biomass fired power station which {{provides}} electricity for the UK National Grid. Until March 2012, {{it was the}} main source of electricity for the nearby Alcan Lynemouth <b>Aluminium</b> <b>Smelter.</b> [...] It is located on the coast of Northumberland, north east of the town of Ashington in north east England. The station has stood as a landmark on the Northumberland coast since it opened in 1972, and has been privately owned by aluminium company Rio Tinto Alcan throughout its operation until December 2013, when RWE npower took over. In January 2016 it has been acquired by Energetický a průmyslový holding.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{visit to}} the station by Prime Minister Gordon Brown on 3 July 2009, it became {{apparent}} that Rio Tinto Alcan were hoping to be able to demonstrate Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology at the station in the future, using [...] "pre-combustion" [...] CCS technology. This would have involved treating the coal prior to burning so that less CO2 was produced, with any remaining CO2 being pumped under the North Sea into an aquifer. However, due to the economic climate, Rio Tinto did not commit the funding for the project themselves, and did not secure any of the required £1billion European Union funding available for demonstration of CCS technology. In November 2009 it was announced that a variety of energy experts were preparing for the £1billion bid to the Government for investment. The plans included a pipeline into the North Sea, and the upgrading of one of the station's generating sets from 140MW to around 375MW, to safeguard the supply of electricity to the <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelter.</b>|$|E
50|$|In March 2010 it was {{announced}} that the operators of Loy Yang A power station (Loy Yang Power) had signed a contract with the smelter operators for the supply of electricity to power <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelters</b> at Portland and Point Henry until 2036, the existing power contracts expired in 2014.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Tom Campbell, {{the then}} chief {{executive}} of majority owner Pacific Aluminium, said that the smelter was amongst the top 5% of the world's 250 <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelters</b> worldwide in terms of low emissions. In 2007, 1.97 tonnes of carbon dioxide was released for every tonne of aluminium produced.|$|R
50|$|Although the Port of Launceston is {{now used}} {{very little in}} {{comparison}} to the past and the SeaCat Tasmania ferry no longer docks at George Town, the river still is used for shipping, with light and heavy industries at George Town including <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelters</b> as well as commercial boat cruises.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2011, 55 022 was {{chartered}} by GB Railfreight for bauxite freight working between North Blyth and the Lynemouth <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelter.</b> This charter {{was scheduled}} to last from April to July. From May 2013 to November 2015, 55 022 was chartered by GBRF to transfer ScotRail EMU's for refurbishment. These included the entire fleet of s, which were moved between Yoker and Kilmarnock. The route taken, partially to prevent false fire alarms in underground tunnels caused by the Deltic engine's emissions, takes the train as far as Craigendoran on the north bank of the Clyde before turning round toward Kilmarnock.|$|E
2500|$|The {{container}} traffic {{has continued to}} expand and a new expanding trade in timber developed in parallel but the greatly reduced labour needs of these trades saw the town's population contract. Controversial attempts to site an <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelter</b> at [...] Aramoana {{at the mouth of}} the harbour in 1975 and 1980 didn't succeed. The Otago Harbour Board, established in 1874, was replaced by a quasi-autonomous local government entity, Port Otago Ltd, in 1988. The 1913 Port Chalmers Old Identities Society's collection was transferred to the old Post Office building and reopened as the Port Chalmers Museum in 1987, and has since been renamed the Regional Maritime Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{industry}} {{is restricted to}} Holyhead (Caergybi), which until 30 September 2009 supported an <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelter,</b> and the Amlwch area, once a major copper mining town. Nearby {{is the site of}} the former Wylfa Nuclear Power Station and a former bromine extraction plant. With construction starting in 1963, the two Wylfa reactors began producing electricity in 1971. One reactor was decommissioned in 2012 and the other in 2015. The site remains a strong possibility for a replacement reactor, planned by Horizon, a subsidiary of Hitachi, to start production in the 2020s. The replacement has been enthusiastically endorsed by Anglesey Council and Welsh Assembly members, but protesters have raised doubts about the economic and safety claims made for the plant.|$|E
50|$|The company {{operates}} three <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelters</b> in the US, {{and one in}} Iceland. Construction of a fifth smelter in Iceland {{has been}} halted since 2009. All Century's operations produce primary aluminium, that is, aluminium from ore, rather than from aluminum scrap. In 2014, the company produced 881,000 metric tons of aluminium.|$|R
50|$|In March 2010 it was {{announced}} that the operators of Loy Yang A (Loy Yang Power) signed a contract with Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals Australia for the supply of electricity to power <b>aluminium</b> <b>smelters</b> at Portland and Point Henry until 2036.
