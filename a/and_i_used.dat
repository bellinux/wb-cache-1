500|$|Julian Lennon {{discovered}} that [...] "Hey Jude" [...] {{had been written}} for him almost 20 years after McCartney composed the song. He recalled of his and McCartney's relationship: [...] "Paul <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going {{and there seems to}} be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad." [...] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time: [...] "He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else. He is collecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like." ...|$|E
500|$|A short {{part that}} Chastain had filmed {{opposite}} Ben Affleck in Terrence Malick's To the Wonder (2012) was edited {{out of the}} final film, and due to scheduling conflicts, she {{dropped out of the}} action films Oblivion and Iron Man 3 (both 2013). She instead made her Broadway debut in a revival of the 1947 play The Heiress, playing the role of Catherine Sloper, a naive young girl who transforms into a powerful woman. Chastain was initially reluctant to accept the role fearing the high anxiety she had faced during her early stage performances. She ultimately agreed to the part after finding a connection to Sloper, saying: [...] "she’s painfully uncomfortable <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to be that". The production was staged at the Walter Kerr Theatre from November 2012 to February 2013. Brantley was disappointed with Chastain's performance, saying that she was [...] "oversignaling the thoughts within" [...] and that her delivery of dialogue was sometimes flat.|$|E

500|$|Moon's {{arrival in}} the Who changed the {{dynamics}} of the group. Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moon's temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. [...] "We used to fight regularly," [...] remembered Moon in later years. [...] "John [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to have fights– it wasn't very serious, it was more of an emotional spur-of-the moment thing." [...] Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: [...] "We really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music," [...] he said in a later interview. Although Townshend described him as a [...] "completely different person to anyone I've ever met," [...] the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moon's drumming style affected the band's musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moon's lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.|$|E
500|$|McCartney became {{interested}} in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England. In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted {{in his hometown of}} Liverpool. McCartney said, [...] "I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.|$|E

500|$|... "I Care" [...] {{comprised}} 75 {{tracks in}} total: 35 {{for the music}} and 40 for the vocals. According to Swivel, the main challenge in mixing [...] "I Care" [...] was hand‑aligning every single drum shot as it was time-consuming. He said, [...] "It's super‑monotonous, but it's the best way I can do it. If you Beat Detective the drums to the grid, it's never perfect." [...] As the layering of the drums had to be right on the millisecond, Swivel did one kick and snare at a time. This helped him ensure that the kicks line up with the programmed drums, hence preventing any phase inversion. Accordingly, each drum punched through as strongly as the last. The inspiration for the main drum sound on [...] "I Care" [...] came to Swivel at around four {{o'clock in the morning}} during a mixing session. He took a large plate sound from Avid’s D‑Verb plug‑in, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6kHz, and sent it through an SSL channel strip with a gate on it, setting the release time to 0.6 seconds. He said, [...] "It's a really basic plug‑in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> a very 80s‑sounding gated reverb." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the season}} reinventing the series again, {{composer}} Bear McCreary expanded {{the sound of}} the score [...] "in a big way". In addition to introducing new themes for the characters of Lash and Rosalind Price, McCreary made some changes to the orchestra: [...] "To represent Lash, I brought in larger percussion: merciless pounding taikos that I digitally compressed and distorted. This new, mangled percussion sound is horrific, and will become increasingly important as the season progresses." [...] McCreary also brought in trombones [...] "to get the scariest sound possible," [...] which resulted in the recording space being reconfigured when they were recorded. For Price, her scenes with Coulson [...] "give the series the feeling of a dense political thriller...I really leaned into that, musically. I introduce light acoustic percussion, mostly egg shakers, to give the pulsing synths a softer edge. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> an acoustic piano to play the [...] "Rosalind Theme" [...] at key moments in her scenes...her music is meant to add intrigue and suspicion, and simultaneously allow us to have some fun with their witty banter." [...] For [...] "Maveth", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{has also}} {{influenced}} numerous music artists. Spice Girls member Melanie C said [...] "Madonna {{was doing the}} girl power thing {{a long time before}} the Spice Girls... 'Express Yourself' is one of the routines that I know <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to really like doing that one because it is where she shows her bra and holds her crotch." [...] In 2010, singer Christina Aguilera paid tribute to [...] "Express Yourself" [...] with the music video of her single, [...] "Not Myself Tonight". She commented [...] "One of my favorite videos ever is 'Express Yourself' by Madonna which came across as really strong and empowering which I always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality... I love the direct reference I made to Madonna with the eye glass moment and the smoke and stairs. I was paying tribute to a very strong woman who has paved the way before." [...] James Montgomery from MTV deemed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the primary influence of Aguilera's video with scenes like Aguilera displaying a monocle, standing atop a flight of stairs and crawling across the floor while pouring a black liquid over herself. Similarities were also noted between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and singer Lady Gaga's 2011 single [...] "Born This Way" [...] both in subject matter and composition.|$|E

Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story.

500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?"

[...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'.
