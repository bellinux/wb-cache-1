500|$|When the {{legislation}} that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the American Medical Association (AMA) warning that such legislation would {{mean the end of}} freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, [...] "we will awake to find that we have socialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free." [...] He also joined the National Rifle Association (NRA) and would become a lifetime member.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2009, Bentley {{revealed}} to the fan site The Bad Religion Page that the band was expected {{to go into the}} studio on April 26, 2010, to start recording their new album. He stated that a few songs for the album had been written and [...] "it feels like the songwriting is picking up momentum. Baker {{said he was going to}} drive up to Graffin's, Brooks <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do some demos with Brett, so we have a pretty good jump." [...] According to Brett's Twitter, Bad Religion is aiming for a fall release of the new album. In January 2010, Bentley revealed that Bad Religion would record their new album at a studio in Pasadena, California with Joe Barresi, who engineered 2004's The Empire Strikes First and produced its 2007 follow-up New Maps of Hell. Despite the statement made by Bentley about entering the studio in April, he noted that the recording date was now May 1. On April 6, 2010, Bentley revealed in an interview with KROQ's Kevin and Bean that the date on which the band would record their new album was May 6.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} by Wood's friend, psychic Criswell: [...] "Greetings my friends! We are all {{interested in the}} future, For that is where you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to spend the rest}} of our lives! ...". (This line appears in the narration for the General Motors' [...] "Futurama" [...] ride and its accompanying film, To New Horizons, that were part of the 1939 New York World's Fair—years before Criswell's own television program.) At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP-13) television series, Criswell Predicts. The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show, but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early televangelists. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as [...] "my friends", as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line is likely to derive from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction, [...] "Future events such as these will affect you in the future", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.|$|E
