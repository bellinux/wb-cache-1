By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show the {{structure}} of cognitive and emotional patterns of a teacher which regulates educational activities, and to suggest a work for becoming <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his or <b>her</b> own cognitive and emotional patterns. Each teacher has his or her own cognitive and emotional patterns as the result of experiences and theoretical studies in his or her work for a long time. The patterns produce the relational system that directs educational activities of a teacher and regulates them on the whole. A teacher, however, isn't always <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> educational self-concept. It is also difficult for him or <b>her</b> to be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the whole picture. It is necessary for a teacher to begin by becoming <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his or <b>her</b> own educational self-concept that regulates educational practices, and then to transform it independently in order to expand his or her practical competences. Consequently, the teacher is motivated to study theoretically to transform it. Supervision can support the process that a teacher will become <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his or <b>her</b> own educational selfconcept through a programmed work...|$|R

In February 1812, Rivoli departed Venice for the first time, destined for Pola on her maiden voyage. Waiting for Rivoli was the British HMS Victorious, commanded by John Talbot, who chased Rivoli and captured her in a four-hour battle in which both sides suffered heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

Lexie meets Meredith for the first time, but is demoralized when she becomes <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> apparent discomfort. Meredith and Shepherd encounter difficulty in being broken up, realizing that their mutual romantic feelings are an impediment in their attempt at having separate lives.|$|E

He plans to acquire Kid's special gift from Lucca—a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger. With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that he shall achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history.

It is also circumstantially revealed that Magil is in fact Magus, Schala's wayward brother who searched for her after battling Lavos in Chrono Trigger. Once the distortion subsides, an army from Porre—a large nation in search of the Frozen Flame—storms the mansion. Lynx withdraws as Kid, Serge, and Magil flee.
