5|$|Christian Collett (1771–1833), a {{graduate}} of the Mining Academy at Kongsberg, designed the splendid Ulefoss manor, built between 1802 and 1807 by sawmill owner Niels Aall. This {{is one of the few}} brick houses in Norway, boasting a palladian layout, a central cupola, and <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> colonnade. Collett designed several other manors and town houses.|$|E
5|$|Designed by architects Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop {{who were}} both World War I veterans, the Shrine is in <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> style, being {{based on the}} Tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus and the Parthenon in Athens.

5|$|Located near Alpha is R Muscae, <b>a</b> <b>Classical</b> Cepheid {{variable}} {{ranging from}} apparent magnitude 5.93 to 6.73 over 7.5days. It is a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F7Ib and G2Ib, located around 2037light-years away. S Muscae is likewise <b>a</b> <b>Classical</b> Cepheid, a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F6Ib and G0Ib and magnitudes 5.89 to 6.49 {{over a period}} of 9.66days. A luminous star around 5.9times as massive as the Sun, it is a binary star with a blue-white main sequence star companion likely to be of spectral type B3V to B5V with a mass of just over 5solar masses, one of the hottest and brightest companions of a Cepheid known. The two stars orbit each other every 505days.|$|E
5|$|Much of Fauré's piano {{music is}} {{difficult}} to play, but is rarely virtuosic in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> restraint and understatement.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{have many}} {{applications}} in technology.

5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E
5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the renovation of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>{{classical}}</b> singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She {{explained that}} {{in the early days of}} Nightwish, it was difficult to combine classical technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter {{and the use of the}} refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E
5|$|Association {{football}} in {{itself does not}} have <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> history. Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The modern rules of association football {{are based on the}} mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of {{football in}} England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.|$|E

5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> republic.|$|E
5|$|Faryl {{was fairly}} well {{received}} by critics, who praised Smith's performances and Cohen's production. However, criticism {{was directed at}} {{the use of the}} orchestra and at the song choices. As one of the ten best-selling classical albums in the UK in 2009, Faryl was nominated for <b>a</b> <b>Classical</b> BRIT Award in the album of the year category, but lost to Only Men Aloud's Band of Brothers. In 2013, the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry.|$|E
5|$|Her {{philosophical}} views {{also find}} {{mention in the}} Chandogya Upanishad. Gargi, as Brahmavadini, composed several hymns in Rigveda (in X 39.

5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom {{and throughout the}} rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian became <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> language that was usually reserved for reading and writing in hieroglyphs. For the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian remained the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Waller went to New York City to be a tutor, {{but left}} after {{three or four}} weeks. This {{was the last time}} in his life that he was paid as a teacher but he still opened and funded some schools. He opened <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> school in Bloomsburg, which was built in 1839, and he contributed $3500 to it. Shortly after {{arriving}} in Bloomsburg, he organized a singing school and also created a Bible class in 1839. The class continued until after his death. He helped to open Bloomsburg's State Normal School. He was appointed a trustee of Lafayette College in 1849 by the Synod of Philadelphia. He held that position until 1879. He was also on Lafayette College's Ways and Means committee and helped stop the college from closing in 1852. In 1856, Waller helped convert <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> school into the Bloomsburg Literary Institute and served as one of the nine initial trustees. He resigned from being a trustee in 1866 after a dispute about where to set up a new building for the institute. Despite resigning from the trustees, he helped conduct the opening ceremony of the institute's new building on April 3, 1867.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, Osip Berkman {{was granted}} the right, as a {{successful}} businessman, {{to move from the}} Pale of Settlement to which Jews were generally restricted in the Russian Empire. The family moved to Saint Petersburg, a city previously off-limits to Jews. There, Ovsei adopted the more Russian name Alexander; he was known among family and friends as Sasha, a diminutive for Alexander. The Berkmans lived comfortably, with servants and a summer house. Berkman attended the gymnasium, where he received <b>a</b> <b>classical</b> education with the youth of Saint Petersburg's elite.|$|E
