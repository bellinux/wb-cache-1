5000|$|Osteolathyrism is a {{collagen}} cross-linking deficiency {{brought on}} by dietary over-reliance on the seeds of Lathyrus sativus or grass pea, a legume often grown as a famine crop in Asia and East Africa. [...] Other members of the genus are also known to cause the disease, including L. sylvestris, L. cicera, and L. clymenum. L. sativus grows well under famine conditions, often severe drought, where it is cultivated. [...] The condition results in damage to bone and mesenchymal connective tissues. It is seen in people in combination with neurolathyrism and angiolathyrism in areas where famine demands reliance on a crop with known detrimental effects. It occurs in cattle and horses with diets overreliant upon the grass pea. Osteolathyrism {{is caused by a}} variety of osteolathyrogenic compounds, specifically excitatory <b>amino-compounds.</b> The most widely-studied of these compounds is beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), which exerts its deleterious effect by an unknown yet potently irreversible mechanism. Other instigators are ureides, semicarbazides and thiosemicarbazides, which are believed to chelate the prosthetic Cu(II)-bipyridine cofactor complex in the enzyme lysyl oxidase.|$|E

Taking the hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene as a model reaction, Pd/Al 2 O 3 promoted the exclusive production of nitrobenzene and aniline, i. e. hydrodechlorination with subsequent -NO 2 group reduction prevailed.

40|$|From {{these results}} it is {{permissible}} {{to draw the}} following conclusions which {{may be used to}} explain certain phenomena associated especially with the onset of acute pancreatitis. 1. The sudden marked collapse of acute pancreatitis has as its most important cause a toxin or toxins derived from broken down pancreatic tissue. This toxin or toxins seem to be most powerful in the stage of degradation just after the disappearance of the biuret reaction and are probably of the nature of aromatic and <b>amino-compounds.</b> 2. There are various contributing factors of toxic action as peptone and trypsin, but these are to be regarded as of secondary importance. 3. Mechanical irritation as stretching of the peritoneum and irritation of the caeliac plexus is a secondary cause. 4. The glycerine produced through the action of steapsin cannot be regarded as an important cause of collapse...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{studying}} of melanoidin formation regularities at interaction of D-glucose and D-xylose with p-amino benzoic acid (PABA) in acidic ethanolic media have been presented; {{features of the}} chosen threefold systems are, firstly, existence of the low-active <b>amino-compound</b> of benzene series, secondly, presence of catalytic amounts of the biogenic metal. Regularities of melanoidins structure formation from similar systems are almost not studied, {{at the same time}} some important biological properties are predicted for them that demands research of reactions' kinetics and development of techniques of their directional synthesis. Studying has been carried out by synthetic methods in total with a sample drawing technique with UV-Vis-spectrophotometry filing and engaging of FTIR-spectroscopy. Based on electronic spectra analysis more intensive melanoidin formation in case of reaction from D-xylose has been shown, this can be bound to steric hindrance and to ability of aldopentoses to give more reactionary capable intermediates in comparison with aldohexoses. The accelerating role of copper (II) ions as the complexing center catalyzing both formation and degradation of the intermediate products at different reaction stages has been confirmed, {{at the same time the}} accelerating action is considerably shown since copper ion concentrations about 60 mg/l, but Cu(II) chelation degree by final products is low. The effect of solvent has been noted, in particular the influence of ethanol on nature of amino-carbonyl interactions manifested in strengthening of carbohydrates tendency to re-cyclization, it also probably accelerates melanoidin formation. The data obtained have shown the percent of carbohydrates direct destruction (caramelization) in the presented conditions is insignificant, that allows developing based on the present researches target synthetic techniques for melanoidin products' preparation...|$|R
30|$|Of {{the metal}} {{nanoparticles}} {{discussed in this}} review, the greatest emphasis {{will be given to}} gold nanoparticles [14, 19, 54, 69, 73 – 82] and then silver, cobalt and nickel nanoparticles [37]. Compared to other types of nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, particularly the noble metal nanoparticles, easily form various stable nanostructures, are non-toxic and able to bind different targeting molecules. In particular, gold nanoparticles are easily modified with alkanethiols forming a chemical bond between gold and sulfur, while silver nanoparticles react with <b>amino-compounds</b> due to the formation of silver–nitrogen bond. This surface chemistry provides diverse ways for functionalizing through conjugation of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, and synthetic nucleic acids such as locked nucleic acids [LNAs], peptide nucleic acids [PNAs] etc.), (poly)peptides or cellular ligands; e.g. thiocitic acid–polyethylene glycol–folate gold conjugates developed for targeting of cells with folate receptors [74]. The noble metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver have strong, size-dependent and shape-dependent optical properties with an absorbance of surface plasmon resonance. Thus different colors of the nanoparticles can be prepared from the same bulk metal by making nanoparticles of different sizes or shapes.|$|E
40|$|Shredded wheat moulded by an isolate of Penicillium aurantiogriseum {{elicited}} progressive histopathological {{changes at}} the rat renal cortico-medullary junction during 5 days of dosing, when incorporated into diet as a 20 % component. The changes of acute tubular necrosis and regeneration were seen in the P 3 segment of the nephron. In rats exposed to contaminated diet for 5 days the histopathological changes regressed in severity by about one-half within a further 4 days on normal diet and by 7 days the tubular epithelium was nearly normal. A partially purified fraction of an alcohol extract, selected by preparative high-voltage electrophoresis and anion exchange and notably rich in <b>amino-compounds,</b> was typically nephrotoxic when given in diet over 4 days. Acute marked tubular necrosis also occurred when the same fraction was given intraperitoneally over a similar period. The acute histological changes provide a rapid bioassay for this Penicillium nephrotoxicity and facilitate {{the search for the}} toxic metabolite(s). The cumulative expression of necrosis and repair over only a few days in tubular epithelium suggests that chronic exposure will elicit a more complex pathology which might serve as an experimental model for the idiopathic Balkan endemic nephropathy...|$|E
40|$|Isocyanates, aminoisocyanates and amines were {{quantified}} {{from the}} combustion of 24 different materials or products typically found in buildings. Small-scale combustion experiments {{were conducted in}} the cone calorimeter, where generally well-ventilated combustion conditions are attained. Measurements were further made in two different full-scale experiments. Isocyanates and <b>amino-compounds</b> were sampled using an impinger-filter sampling system with a reagent solution of di-n-butylamine in toluene. Filter and impinger solution were analysed separately using LC-MS technique. Further the particulate distribution in the smoke gases was determined by impactor technique, and selected gaseous compounds quantified by FTIR. It {{was found in the}} small-scale that isocyanates were produced from the majority of the materials tested. The highest concentration was found for glass wool insulation, and further high concentrations were found for PUR products, particleboard, nitrile rubber and melamine. Lower concentrations were found for wood and cable-products. Amino-isocyanates and amines were generally found from PUR products only. The distribution of isocyanates between the particulate- and fluid phases varied for the different materials and a tendency to enrichment of particles was seen for some of the materials. Further, when comparing the potential health hazard between isocyanates and other major fire gases (based on NIOSH IDLH-values) it was found that isocyanates in several cases represented the greatest hazard...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} cleaner {{route for}} the production of aromatic <b>amino-compounds</b> under mild reaction conditions (P = 1 atm; 393 K ≤ T ≤ 573 K) via the continuous gas phase reduction of aromatic nitro derivates has been investigated over (oxide and/or carbon) supported Au, Ag, Pd, Ni, Ni-Pd, Au-Pd and Au-Ni catalysts. Taking the hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene as a model reaction, Pd/Al 2 O 3 promoted the exclusive production of nitrobenzene and aniline, i. e. hydrodechlorination with subsequent -NO 2 group reduction prevailed. In contrast, p-chloroaniline was the only product detected over a series of supported Ni catalysts. This {{is the first time that}} such product exclusivity has been achieved in gas phase operation. The synthesis of bimetallic Pd-Ni/Al 2 O 3 (prepared via co-impregnation) proved effective to enhance catalytic activity while maintaining 100 % selective -NO 2 reduction, a result ascribed to bimetallic particle formation as established by TPR, H 2 chemisorption and XRD analyses. Nevertheless, the three systems (supported Pd, Ni and Pd-Ni) suffered a loss of activity with time-on-stream. Monometallic Au catalysts promoted the exclusive and time invariant formation of p-chloroaniline. The incorporation of Au (as a modifier) with Pd via reductive deposition to form Au-Pd/Al 2 O 3 (Pd/Au= 10 mol/mol) did not influence catalytic performance, which was equivalent to that delivered by Pd/Al 2 O 3, i. e. aniline was the predominant product. On the other hand, the inclusion of Pd (as a promoter) with Au (at Au/Pd≥ 20) via co-impregnation and/or co-deposition precipitation resulted in increased hydrogenation rate while retaining exclusivity to pchloroaniline, an effect resulting from a surface Pd-Au synergism demonstrated by DRIFTS analysis. With the goal of elevating the catalytic activity of Au, the possible role of the oxide (Al 2 O 3 vs. TiO 2) support to modify catalytic response was considered. Au/TiO 2 delivered a higher specific rate that was attributed to a combination of smaller Au particle size (with higher number of defects) and possible p-chloronitrobenzene activation via interaction(s) with TiO 2 surface oxygen vacancies. This work was extended to decouple the individual contribution of each factor by (i) considering a series of oxide supports that exhibited a range of acid-base and redox surface properties, i. e. Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 and CeO 2 and (ii) controlling the Au particle size using two synthesis methods (deposition-precipitation and impregnation). The results demonstrated that specific activity increased with decreasing particle size (from 9 to 3 nm), regardless of the nature of the support. Furthermore, in the case of Au/Fe 2 O 3, XRD and TPR analyses have established that Au can promote the partial reduction of the iii support (from α-Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4), an effect more pronounced for smaller Au particles (< 5 nm) where H 2 -TPD suggests the participation of spillover hydrogen in this reduction step. A similar effect was also found for the TiO 2 allotropic phase transition (from anatase to rutile), which can occur at lower temperatures due to the presence of Au, as demonstrated by DRS UV-vis, XRD and BET measurements. Having established that supported Au is effective in promoting the exclusive reduction of p-chloronitrobenzene to p-chloroaniline, hydrogenation selectivity was proved further by considering the reduction of m-dinitrobenzene. The reaction products, i. e. m-nitroanline (partial -NO 2 reduction) and m-phenylenediamine (complete -NO 2 reduction) are both high value intermediates in the fine chemical industry but existing routes can not achieve high selectivity to either product. It is shown that the nature of the oxide support (for TiO 2 -rutile, TiO 2 -anatase, Al 2 O 3, CeO 2, Fe 2 O 3) does not have a direct effect on the rate of nitro-group reduction, which is controlled by Au particle size where a mean size of 5 nm was found to be critical in that with larger particles, nitrogroup reduction rate was structure insensitive. In contrast, the nature of the support has a direct effect on the selectivity response. Au/TiO 2 and Au/Fe 2 O 3 promoted the exclusive hydrogenation of m-dinitrobenzene to m-nitroaniline, Au/CeO 2 delivered mphenylenediamine as the sole product and Au/Al 2 O 3 generated a mixture of both products. This response can be accounted for on the basis of a modification to the electronic character of the Au nanoclusters induced by the acid-base Lewis properties of the support that impacts on the adsorption/activation of m-dinitrobenzene. A similar alteration of the electronic nature of Au can also be induced by alteration of the Au particle size or the introduction of a second metal (Ni). Taking the same reaction over Au/Al 2 O 3, Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Au-Ni/Al 2 O 3, it is established that it is possible to control product composition in terms of partial (over Au) or complete nitro-group reduction (over Ni) or a combination of both (over Au-Ni), which can be attributed to a surface Au-Ni synergism as suggested by XPS and EDX mapping measurements. In order to assess the impact of annealing treatment on catalytic response, the analysis was extended to the preparation and application of an Au-Ni/Al 2 O 3 alloy, formation of which is demonstrated by XRD, DRS UV-Vis and HRTEM. While alumina supported bimetallic and alloy both promoted the formation of both m-nitroaniline and mphenylenediamine via a predominantly stepwise reduction mechanism, the annealed (alloy) system delivered rate constants up to two orders of magnitude lower. In the final section of this thesis, the catalytic behaviour of supported (TiO 2) Au and Ag is iv compared in the selective hydrogenation of a series of para-substituted nitroarenes. While both catalysts promoted the exclusive nitro-group reduction, Ag/TiO 2 delivered lower reaction rates. The reaction mechanism has been probed by adopting the Hammett approach, where the linear correlation and positive slopes (higher for Au than Ag) associated with the Hammett plots are consistent with an electron withdrawing substituent activation effect, i. e. nucleophilic attack and a more effective reactant activation over Au/TiO 2. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate, for the first time, that catalytic hydrogenation over gold-based catalysts in continuous flow gas operation is a viable, clean high throughput route to aromatic amines. The findings of this thesis show that Au on reducible supports with dAu < 5 nm is the optimum monometallic formulation while -NO 2 group reduction rate and/or selectivity can be controlled (or tuned) by (i) changing the acid-base Lewis character of the support, (ii) modifying Au dispersion or (iii) incorporation of Pd or Ni as promotors. This work represents a critical advancement in the sustainable production of high value fine chemicals.
