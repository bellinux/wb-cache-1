40|$|Song {{translation}} {{is one of}} the most difficult forms of translation (Susam-Sarajeva, 2008). In addition to the semantic code, translators have to take account of prosodic, poetic, rhythmic, and audial codes, to name but a few. Di Giovanni (2008) and Chaume (2012) add to this list the visual code, which is not only prevalent in film or musical, but also in popular music (Kaindl, 2005) and other live performance music genres (Low, 2005). The combination of all these factors contribute to establish some exceedingly severe limitations for song translators. 	Despite that, however, it is a surprisingly well-established fact that audiovisual translation in general, <b>and</b> <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> in particular, are relatively new and usually ignored areas of research (Franzon, 2008; Mateo, 2008; Susam-Sarajeva, 2008; Siitonen, 2014). Susam-Sarajeva, in the introduction to her 2008 special issue of The Translator, explains that one of the reasons of this is the relative difficulty and craftsmanship that song translation requires, as song translators should not only be near-fluent in both languages, but also have an extensive knowledge of music or drama theory. Another reason is that the field is somewhat outside the borders of traditional translation studies. A third objection may be that in song translation, the borders between translation, adaptation, and rewriting are not as clear-cut as in most other forms of translation. 	Whatever the exact reasons, however, to date only three major collections seem to have been published on the subject: Songs and Significance, a book of collected articles edited by Gorlée (2005); the aforementioned special issue of The Translator dedicated to music (Susam-Sarajeva, 2008); and Music, Text and Translation, a text book edited by Minors (2013) with chapters by different translation scholars active in the field. This is not to say that there are no other sources, or that the field was only established in 2005 (indeed, articles on the subject have been appearing since the early 20 th century [Gorlée, 2005; Kaindl, 2005]), but research has traditionally been quite sparse...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to compare the Dutch and Italian <b>translations</b> of the <b>songs</b> from the Disney movie Frozen (2013). The field of <b>song</b> <b>translation,</b> <b>and</b> musical <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> in particular, has been {{underdeveloped}} and underresearched compared to other areas in translation. For this reason, the author decided to compare the translations of the original English songs, focusing on elements such as word count, grammar, humour, use of abstract vs concrete language, exaggeration and culture. This thesis first examines the research and studies done {{on the subject of}} <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> over the years. In a second stage, the lyrics from the original movie are compared to the Dutch and Italian translations, with special focus on the elements listed above. The results of the author’s research show that the Dutch translation is truer to the original English source text, whereas the Italian translation differs in areas such as concrete language, humour and word count. The author recommends further research on multiple other musicals, and the comparison between English, Dutch and Italian translation of the musical songs in particular, {{in order to be able}} to fully support this conclusion...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{looks into}} the {{practice}} of <b>song</b> <b>translation,</b> which occupies a peripheral position in translation studies (TS) despite its commonplace occurrence and {{significant impact on the}} global spread of songs. Foreign songs enjoy enormous appeal in China, where different methods have been adopted to translate them with the aim of enhancing listeners’ full reception. In particular, the practice of writing Chinese lyrics anew and setting them to the foreign tunes regardless of the semantic relationship between the source text (ST) and the target text (TT) has proliferated over the past decades. Some translated songs capture the gist of the original lyrics omitting minor details whereas some sever their relations with the original. This blurs the boundaries between translation, adaptation and rewriting lyrics. Another noticeable phenomenon is the emergence of self-organising communities, whose involvement in translating <b>song</b> lyrics <b>and</b> circulating subtitled music videos (MVs) cannot be overlooked in today’s digital landscape. <b>Song</b> <b>translation</b> can be understood as a field with its own “rules of the game” and exchange of different forms of capital following a Bourdieusian perspective. Adopting a case study methodology, the thesis investigates the particular field of <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> with special reference to the translation practices of a veteran song translator named Xue Fan 薛范, online amateur translators, and a professional lyricist from Hong Kong called Albert Leung 林夕. These case studies have been conducted for providing an in-depth analysis of China’s <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> activities through time and the dynamics of the power relations in the field. To translate a song from one language and culture into another invariably involves the losses and gains of certain elements, given the song’s semiotic richness. Against this backdrop, the thesis attempts to examine how the interplay of different meaning-making modes in a song has been dealt with by different agents under various circumstances through close examination of the relationship between STs and TTs. This will allow {{a better understanding of the}} production, circulation <b>and</b> reception of <b>song</b> <b>translations</b> in respective historical, ideological and social contexts. It is hoped that the thesis can provide new insights into our understanding of ‘translation’ in relation to music, and further shed light on how translation evolves at the convergence of music and technology in the globalisation era...|$|R

In 1621 the Ilocano translation of Bukaneg was printed in the Augustinian Convent of Manila.

Further, it examines the intentions that generate these translations and seeks to analyze the finished products in the light of these motivations. Do musical groups translate their work in order to expand their horizons and explore another culture, or do they do so primarily to expand the fan base and generate more revenue? And what methods are used to deal with all the inherent restrictions of <b>song</b> <b>translation?</b> What does the finished product tell the listener about the intention of the translation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Song</b> <b>translation</b> is a {{relatively}} under-researched field in Translation Studies (Susam-Sarajeva, 2008, p. 187). Most studies that do exist revolve around singability (Low, 2003; Stopar 2016), singability and rhyme (Low, 2008), or fidelity to the source text (Franzon 2005). The combination of <b>song</b> <b>translation</b> theory <b>and</b> metaphor theory, however, is a virtually unresearched combination of fields. Low (2017) states: “[s]ong lyrics are often rich in metaphor” and he recommends that song translators, more than 'regular' translators, should “attempt to maintain the richness of metaphor” (p. 34). This thesis analyses three songs from musicals that have been translated from English to Dutch. These musicals are of different genres and for different audiences, to include the influence that these factors might have had on the choices of the translators. The musicals {{used in this study}} are drama musical Les Misérables (E: 1985; D: 1991), animated film musical Anastasia (1997) and romantic comedy musical Hairspray (E: 1988; D: 2003). Using the MIPVU (Metaphor Identification Procedure VU University Amsterdam [Steen et al., 2010]), this thesis analyses the metaphors in the three songs, in both the English source text and the Dutch target text. Subsequently, it attempts to establish how the translators dealt with the metaphors, and, ultimately, to see whether the fact that the target texts are singable <b>translations</b> of a <b>song</b> had any influence on the choices of the translator. This is endeavoured by answering two questions. Firstly, can the translations of the metaphors in songs be analysed by means of Newmark's (1981) and Schäffner's (2004) categorizations of procedures used in metaphor translation? Secondly, can singularities be explained through Low's pentathlon principle (2005) for <b>song</b> <b>translation...</b>|$|R
