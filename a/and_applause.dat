5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, <b>and</b> <b>applause</b> was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relative importance}} of invited <b>and</b> uninvited <b>applause,</b> 15 speeches delivered by the leaders of the three principal British political parties to their annual party conferences (1996 - 2000) were analyzed. Each incidence of applause was coded along three dimensions (invited/uninvited, presence/absence of rhetorical devices, and synchronous/asynchronous with speech). The results provided strong support for the distinction between invited <b>and</b> uninvited <b>applause.</b> Applause invited through rhetorical devices was significantly more likely to be synchronous than asynchronous with speech, whereas uninvited applause was almost exclusively asynchronous; however, uninvited applause occurred more often in the presence of rhetorical devices than in their absence. The implications of these results for the concepts of invited <b>and</b> uninvited <b>applause</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|According to Atkinson (e. g. 1983, 1984 a, 1984 b), {{a limited}} range of rhetorical devices are {{consistently}} used by political speakers to invite audience applause. A detailed review is presented of the research literature relevant to Atkinson's analysis, including a series of evaluative studies conducted by the author. From this review, {{it is argued that}} Atkinson overestimated the role of rhetorical devices in inviting <b>applause</b> <b>and</b> underestimated the significance of other features, such as asynchronous applause, speech delivery, speech content <b>and</b> uninvited <b>applause.</b> To integrate these features, a re-conceptualisation is presented of how audience applause occurs in political speeches, based on a fundamental distinction between invited <b>and</b> uninvited <b>applause...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Opening Ceremony {{culminated in}} the end of the torch relay, a {{tradition}} begun when Berlin hosted the games in 1936. Before the torch came into the stadium, a three rings arose {{from the center of the}} stadium that simulated a globe. This segment preceding the torch's arrival honored the first global torch relay that was begun by Athens 2004. Actors, suspended on cables, started rising out of the crowd and ran towards the globe, carrying glowing sticks meant to simulate the Olympic torch. On the globe, the names of the cities which the torch visited were projected, and this segment ended with all the torchbearers floating mid-air coming together at the globe. After this segment ended, the lights were dimmed, and the sound of the heartbeat accompanied by thunderous cheers <b>and</b> <b>applause</b> met the torch's final arrival to the Olympic Stadium.|$|E

Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying [...] "Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are the pictures that seem so complete and in every way satisfactory." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1879, J. C. Williamson {{acquired}} the exclusive performing rights to Pinafore in Australia and New Zealand. His first production earned public and critical acclaim. Williamson played Sir Joseph, and his wife, Maggie Moore played Josephine.

Williamson's company continued to produce Pinafore in Australia, New Zealand and on tour into the 1960s with much success. As Williamson said, [...] "If you need money, then put on G". Meanwhile, Pinafore continued to garner praise outside Britain. The 1950s Danish version in Copenhagen, for example, was revived repeatedly, playing for well over 100performances to [...] "packed houses". Translations into German, Yiddish and many other languages, and professional productions in places as remote as Samarkand in Uzbekistan have been successful.|$|E
500|$|At Pembroke, Johnson {{made many}} friends, but {{neglected}} {{many of the}} mandatory lectures, and ignored calls for poems. He did complete one poem, {{the first of his}} tutorial exercises, on which he spent comparable time, and which provoked surprise <b>and</b> <b>applause.</b> He was later asked by his tutor to produce a Latin translation of Alexander Pope's Messiah as a Christmas exercise. Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. Although the poem brought him praise, it did not bring the material benefit he had hoped for. The poem was brought to Pope's attention; according to Sir John Hawkins, Pope claimed that he could not tell if it was the original or not. However, Johnson's friend John Taylor dismissed this [...] "praise" [...] because Johnson's father had already published the translation before Johnson sent a copy to Pope, and Pope could have been remarking about it being a duplication of the published edition.|$|E
