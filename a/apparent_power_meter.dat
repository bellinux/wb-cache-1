40|$|Abstract—Power meters are {{critical}} for submetering loads in residential and commercial settings, but high installation cost and complexity hamper their broader adoption. Recent approaches address installation burdens by proposing non-invasive meters that easily clip onto a wire, or stick onto a circuit breaker, to perform contactless metering. Unfortunately, these designs require regular maintenance (e. g. battery replacement) or reduce measurement accuracy (e. g. work poorly with non-unity power factors). This paper presents Gemini, a new design point in the <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> space. Gemini addresses the drawbacks of prior approaches by decoupling and distributing the AC voltage and current measurement acquisitions, and recombining them wirelessly using a low-bandwidth approach, to offer non-invasive real, reactive, and <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> <b>metering.</b> Battery maintenance is eliminated by using an energy-harvesting design that enables the <b>meter</b> to <b>power</b> itself using a current transformer. Accuracy is substantially improved over other non-invasive meters by virtualizing the voltage channel—effectively allowing the <b>meter</b> to calculate <b>power</b> {{as if it could}} directly measure voltage (since true power requires sample-by-sample multiplication of current and voltage measurements acquired with tight timing constraints). Collectively, these improvements result in a new design point that meters resistive loads with 0. 6 W average error and a range of reactive and switching loads with 2. 2 W average error—matching commercial, mains-powered solutions.

40|$|AC <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> {{require both}} {{voltage and current}} to be sampled {{concurrently}} to obtain real, reactive, and <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> Typically, the two measurements are taken in close physical proximity and fed into a single <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> device. In this paper, we explore the viability of decoupling the voltage and current channels, and placing them in physically disparate locations. Such decoupling could ease the installation of metering infrastructure and enable new sensing scenarios. However, decoupling the voltage and current channels raises a new question: how should they be recombined? Of the various approaches, we propose the voltage channel be virtualized: a voltage sensor measures the voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase, typically near the root of a circuit branch. The extracted phase is time-stamped relative to a global clock and disseminated wirelessly, along with the magnitude and frequency measurements, to <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> throughout the network. The <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> synthesize a suitably scaled replica of the voltage waveform locally, based on the parameters reported by the voltage sensor, and combine it with locally-measured current readings. This paper demonstrates – through empirical characterization of the line voltages, a proof-of-concept <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> implementation, and house-scale evaluation – that the design holds promise and offers substantially lower measurement errors than other distributed <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> approaches for non-resistive loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} between registered active power and spent unregistered power represents the losses at power grid. This paper treats {{problems related to}} losses caused by nonlinear loads connected to the power grid. In recent years the load profile of power consumers turned from energy-waster linear to energysaver but non-linear loads. The main cause of the losses appears {{due to the lack}} of adequate measurement equipment. Namely, common household <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> register only active energy, while <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> for industrial application register reactive energy as well. This approach does not follow the change of the enduser profile. Tendency of improving energy efficiency brought wide use of switching mode regulators and replace old incandescent light bulb with new energy saving lamps (CFL - compact fluorescent lamp, LED bulb). Therefore, the number of non-linear load drastically increased. Registering only active component of power at consumer’s side does not depict the real profile of the consumption. Therefore, in this paper we analyse and quantify the effects of nonlinear loads at power losses. As a result we suggest an efficient method for measuring the distortion component of power. The method relays on low-cost upgrade of commercial electronic <b>power</b> <b>meters.</b> The presented results of measurements on small non-linear loads confirm the proposed technique. Besides, they prove the importance of measuring all components of <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> and justified their use in billing policy.

25|$|The {{power factor}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of real <b>power</b> to <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> As power is {{transferred}} along a transmission line, it does not consist purely of real power that can do work once transferred to the load, but rather consists of a combination of real and reactive <b>power,</b> called <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> The power factor describes the amount of real power transmitted along a transmission line relative to the total <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> flowing in the line.|$|R
