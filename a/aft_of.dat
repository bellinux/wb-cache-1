5|$|They mounted two 17.7-inch (450-mm) {{submerged}} torpedo tubes, one on {{each side}} <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> 'X' barbette, for which twelve torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|A single High Angle Control System {{director}} was fitted {{on the island}} and another on an elevated mount on the former flying-off deck. Two pom-pom directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore and <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the island.|$|E
5|$|The ships mounted four 10-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in twin-gun turrets {{fore and}} <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure. The guns could fire both solid shot and {{explosive}} shells. They were mounted on carriages that used hydraulic jacks to elevate and depress the guns.|$|E

5|$|Belfasts {{aviation}} capability {{was provided}} by two catapult-launched Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplanes. These could be launched from a D1H catapult mounted <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the forward superstructure, and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted {{on either side of}} the forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the Fleet Air Arm's HMS Belfast Flight of 700 Naval Air Squadron, were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the funnel.|$|E
5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open her bottom. She {{instantly}} broke in two just <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the mainmast. The funnel went over the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated {{for a few minutes}} before sinking.|$|E

5|$|Two 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 {{guns were}} mounted in barbettes {{on the upper}} deck, one gun at the forward corner of the battery, with the {{remaining}} six 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. Eight 138-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns were on the upper deck, fore and <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the barbettes, and on the battery deck.|$|E

5|$|She {{was armed}} with eight 38cm (15in) guns {{arranged}} in four twin gun turrets: two superfiring turret pairs fore and <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure. Baden {{and her sister}} Bayern were the first German warships to feature guns of this caliber; earlier battleships carried either 28 or 30.5cm (11 or 12inch) guns. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 15cm (5.9in) guns, six 8.8cm (3.45in) guns and five 60cm (23.6in) underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. Upon commissioning, she carried a crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The main {{armament}} of the Bristol {{class was}} two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were {{mounted on the}} centreline fore and <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in waist mountings. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were fitted, while two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. This armament was considered rather too light for ships of this size by the Royal Navy, while the waist guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.|$|E

5|$|The main {{armament}} of the Drake class {{consisted of}} two breech-loading (BL) 9.2-inch (234mm) Mk X guns in single turrets, one each fore and <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure. Her secondary armament of sixteen BL 6-inch (152mm) Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the lower deck and were only usable in calm weather. A dozen quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder (76mm) 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Two additional 12-pounder 8-cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore. The ships also carried three 3-pounder (47mm) Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450mm) torpedo tubes.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four 30-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk I–IV guns in two twin gun turrets, one each fore and <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure. Each gun was {{provided}} with 80 shells per gun. Hoods secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre 6-inch Mk I-III guns mounted in casemates in the superstructure. A major {{problem with the}} four of these guns mounted on the upper deck {{was that they were}} mounted low in the ship and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather. They were removed as useless in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and {{were divided into}} nine watertight compartments, with a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull. Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and Albatross had different bows; Nautilus received a clipper bow, while Albatross had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle that extended {{to the base of the}} main mast, while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the fore mast.|$|E

5|$|They were {{intended}} to carry a number of boats aboard, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, two pinnaces, two yawls, and two dinghies. The ships were also to be equipped with a double catapult mounted between the two funnels, and four Arado Ar 196 seaplanes for maritime reconnaissance. The aircraft were stored in a main hangar just <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the forward funnel, along with two smaller hangars, {{one on each side}} of the rear funnel.|$|E
5|$|After a {{farewell}} {{visit from the}} Eastern Fleet commander, Admiral Sir James Somerville on 12 January 1943, Illustrious sailed for home the next day. She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January and continued on to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters, {{as well as the}} Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light antiaircraft armament was augmented, and two new arrestor wires were fitted <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her postrefit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Australia carried eight BL 12-inch Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; {{the largest}} guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted {{fore and aft}} on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, {{one on each side}} <b>aft</b> <b>of</b> 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
