5|$|Heavy metal is {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics, and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal's origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums. Most of the pioneers in the field were British; the first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like Blue Öyster Cult, KISS, and Aerosmith. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> by bands such as Mötley Crüe and Ratt; this was glam metal, a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like Bon Jovi, became international stars. The band Guns N' Roses rose to fame {{near the end of}} the decade with an image that was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{only the}} more {{accessible}} and larger islands remain inhabited. Currently, fewer than 90 remain inhabited. The Southern Uplands are essentially rural in nature <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> by agriculture and forestry. Because of housing problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh, five new towns were designated between 1947 and 1966. They are East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld, Livingston, and Irvine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} century the Scots and Picts {{combined}} under the House of Alpin {{to form a}} single Kingdom of Alba, with a Pictish base <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> by Gaelic culture. After the reign of King David I in the twelfth century, the Scottish monarchs are best described as Scoto-Norman, preferring French culture to native Scottish culture. Alexander II and his son Alexander III, were able to regain {{the remainder of the}} western seaboard, cumulating the Treaty of Perth with Norway in 1266.|$|E

5|$|No {{effort to}} depict vampires in popular fiction was as {{influential}} or as definitive as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism {{as a disease}} of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 104 athletes won medals for their NOCs, but the athletes from Norway and Finland stood out <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> the Games, winning 17 and 11 medals, respectively. The United States and Great Britain {{tied for third}} place in the count of total medals, with four each. Athletes from 10 of the 16 {{participating}} NOCs won at least one medal; eight won at least one gold medal. Many of the athletes who won these medals had already returned to their home countries {{by the time the}} medals were awarded, on 5 February, and other participants from their countries had to take the medals to the winning athletes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1982–83 season, Akram Salman was {{appointed}} as the team's new manager. Al-Talaba started {{the season with}} confidence having won the league {{in the last two}} seasons, but finished in second place, only one point behind the league leaders, Salahaddin. Salahaddin were undefeated in the league while Al-Talaba had a single loss, by 2–0 loss to Al-Sinaa {{in the second round of}} matches. The championship was decided in the last match of the season when Al-Talaba met Salahaddin with only one point between them, so Salahaddin needed a win or a draw to secure the title. Al-Talaba scored first <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> the match until, in the last thirty minutes, Salahaddin managed to equalise. The score remained 1–1, which won Salahaddin the championship for the first time in their history. Hussein Saeed was the top goalscorer with 17 goals, eight goals ahead of another Al-Talaba player, Rahim Hameed.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool's {{chances of}} winning a third {{successive}} European Cup were ended with defeat to Nottingham Forest in the First Round. However they opened the league campaign with six straight wins <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> the league by finishing eight points clear of second-placed Forest, scoring 85 goals and conceding just 16 in the process. His goal against Derby County on 24 February won him Match of the Days Goal of the Season award. Writing in his autobiography, Paisley named the 1978–79 team as the best championship team he had been associated with during his 40 years with the club. Manchester United again denied them the {{chance to win the}} Double however, as United knocked Liverpool out of the semi-finals of the FA Cup following a replay at Goodison Park. Liverpool also lost the 1978 European Super Cup, following a 4–3 aggregate defeat to Anderlecht.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{initially}} emphasised racial {{reconciliation and}} he was keen to build {{a good relationship with}} white Zimbabweans. He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property. He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government, met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity. With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved {{during the early years of}} Mugabe's regime. In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{caused the}} South Melbourne {{coaching}} staff concern when he fractured two fingers in a match against Hawthorn {{two weeks before}} the final series. Normally this type of injury would require a player to miss six weeks of football but Nash, who kicked six goals in the match, missed just one week, returned for South's Semi-Final win against Richmond and was considered Best on Ground in South Melbourne's 1933 premiership win. In the Grand Final Nash played at centre-half-back, took thirteen marks and had twenty-nine kicks <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> play.|$|E

5|$|Nauru {{and nearby}} Ocean Island were {{important}} sources of phosphate for Australian and New Zealand fertilizer production and {{played an important}} role on both countries agriculture industries at the time of World War II. The Melbourne-based British Phosphate Commission (BPC) managed the extraction and export of phosphate from the islands <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> all aspects of Nauruan life. During the year ending 30June 1940, the BPC shipped almost a million tons of phosphate from Nauru and about half that amount from Ocean Island using its fleet of four vessels (Triadic, Triaster, Triona and Trienza) and chartered merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffes {{target was}} the Marfee heights which lay behind Sedan {{to the south}} east. They {{contained}} the fortified artillery positions <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> the approaches to the strategic and operational depths beyond Sedan and the Meuse. The Luftwaffe was two hours late in appearing but the effort made was considerable. The attacks were made in Gruppe (group) strength and against the line of maximum resistance along the enemy gun line. To restrict enemy movements and communications, German fighters swept the area to cut land-lines and strafe fortifications, with some shooting of radio antennae off command posts. The attacks isolated the forward defence lines. Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 struck first {{in the morning of}} 13 May. In just five hours, 500 Ju 87 sorties had been flown.|$|E
5|$|The Spurs {{qualified}} for the 1998 NBA Playoffs as the fifth seed, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns coach Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds and replicating the performance in Game 2, contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns. However, the Spurs lost {{in the second round}} to the eventual Western Conference Champions Utah Jazz. In this series, Duncan was pitted against Hall-of-Fame power forward Karl Malone. Duncan outscored Malone {{in the first two games}} which the Spurs lost, but as the series progressed, the more experienced Malone shut Duncan down on defense <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> on offense, outscoring the young power forward in Games 3 to 5 18–10, 34–22 and 24–14 respectively.|$|E

5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 defines Svalbard as all islands, islets and skerries from 74° to 81° north latitude, {{and from}} 10° to 35° east longitude. The land area is , <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> by {{the island of}} Spitsbergen, which {{constitutes}} {{more than half the}} archipelago, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya. All settlements are located on Spitsbergen, except the meteorological outposts on Bjørnøya and Hopen. The Norwegian state took possession of all unclaimed land, or 95.2% of the archipelago, at the time the Svalbard Treaty entered into force; Store Norske owns 4%, Arktikugol owns 0.4%, while other private owners hold 0.4%.|$|E
5|$|The {{evergreen}} {{forests in}} Wayanad mark the transition zone between {{the northern and}} southern ecologic regions of the Western Ghats. The southern ecologic regions are generally wetter and more species-rich. At lower elevations are the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, with Cullenia the characteristic tree genus, accompanied by teak, dipterocarps, and other trees. The moist forests transition to the drier South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests, which lie in its rain shadow to the east. Above 1,000 meters are the South Western Ghats montane rain forests, also cooler and wetter than the surrounding lowland forests, <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> by evergreen trees, although some montane grasslands and stunted forests {{can be found at the}} highest elevations. The South Western Ghats montane rain forests are the most species-rich ecologic region in peninsular India; eighty percent of the flowering plant species of the entire Western Ghats range are found in this ecologic region.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the ARVN central column was to advance down {{the valley of the}} Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} flat area of brush interspersed with patches of jungle <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Jeff Hardy. MVP quickly beat down Hardy <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> {{early in the}} match. Hardy tried {{to come back with}} a mule kick from the corner, but MVP moved out of the way, leading Hardy to crash the mat face first. MVP {{controlled}} most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in the corner. With the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved out of the way. MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing the Whisper in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{wildlife}} on Ford Island {{is likely}} {{very similar to}} that on Naval Station Pearl Harbor. Wildlife is sparse <b>and</b> <b>dominated</b> by invasive species such as the house mouse, mongoose, brown rat, black rat, house sparrow, Java sparrow and common mynah. An endangered owl, the endemic pueo (a subspecies of the short-eared owl), has been seen hunting on the island. Nearly all the plant life on the island is non-native, including edible cacti from California introduced in the late 1700s by Francisco de Paula Marín. The island's harbor was important to ancient Hawaiians for its ample supply of fish, including mullet, milkfish and Hawaiian anchovy. The National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service oversee and administer the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument battlefields at Pearl Harbor and Ford Island.|$|E
