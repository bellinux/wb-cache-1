Many lines during scenes of Joan's trial are taken verbatim from Joan's real trial transcript.

5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts.

River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard <b>among</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E

5|$|By June 1863, Ohio {{had not yet}} fielded an African American combat unit, but Ohio {{blacks were}} being {{recruited}} for service in the regiments of other states. Beaty enlisted from Cincinnati on June 7, 1863 for a three-year term of service in the Union Army; he was <b>among</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of men recruited for a Massachusetts regiment. He joined as a private but was promoted to sergeant only two days later. He was placed {{in charge of a}} squad of forty-seven other recruits and ordered to report to Columbus, Ohio, from where they would be sent to Boston. Upon arriving in Columbus on June 15, however, they learned that the Massachusetts regiments were full and unable to accept their service. The Governor of Ohio, David Tod, immediately requested permission from the Department of War to form an Ohio regiment of African Americans. Permission was granted, and on June 17, Beaty and his squad became the first members of the 127th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, later re-designated the 5th United States Colored Troops. After three months of recruitment and organization in Camp Delaware, on the Olentangy River outside of Delaware, Ohio, the unit set out for Virginia.|$|E

After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.|$|E
