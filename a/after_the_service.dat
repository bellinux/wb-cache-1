The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and the Marquess of Bute were among those who pledged donations sufficient to allow the restoration work to continue immediately. The cathedral was extensively restored, the tower rebuilt and a spire added. Much of the restoration work was completed by local architect John Prichard between 1843 and 1869. A triptych by Dante Gabriel Rossetti was designed {{for use as a}} reredos, and a new stained glass window, Shipwreck of St Paul, was designed by Ford Madox Brown. Sir Edward Burne-Jones designed the porcelain panels Six Days of Creation in St Dyfrig's Chapel.|$|E

5|$|After {{lying in}} state for thirty-four {{hours in the}} Capitol rotunda, a state funeral service was {{conducted}} at the Washington National Cathedral on June 11, the day when President George W. Bush declared a national day of mourning. Later that day, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> Reagan's casket was transported back to California for interment at the Reagan Presidential Library. The state funeral was executed by the Military District of Washington (MDW) {{and was the first}} since that of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973. Richard Nixon, who presided over Johnson's funeral, declined to have a state funeral in 1994. Reagan was the first U.S. former president to die in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E

King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading {{for half an hour}} to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.|$|E

5|$|The {{ritual is}} {{the central part of}} the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the {{beginning}} of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, holy water may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of basil into a bowl with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.|$|E
