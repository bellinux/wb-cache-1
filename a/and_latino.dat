Founded by Mr. Hugo Morales, because of the rapidly growing population of Hispanics <b>and</b> <b>Latinos</b> in the US, the organization is an invaluable resource to the Hispanic/Latino community of California. There are 38.8 million Hispanics <b>and</b> <b>Latinos</b> in the U.S., who represent a population growth in excess of 10% in two years.

Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school.

Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{not until}} the 1980s after years of protest from the Chicano {{movement}} the United States government created the term Hispanic to classify all peoples who come from Spanish-speaking countries.
