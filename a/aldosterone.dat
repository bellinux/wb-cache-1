5|$|This {{layer is}} the main site for {{production}} of <b>aldosterone,</b> a mineralocorticoid, {{by the action of}} the enzyme <b>aldosterone</b> synthase. <b>Aldosterone</b> {{plays an important role in}} the long-term regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} <b>aldosterone,</b> a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, <b>aldosterone</b> acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. <b>Aldosterone</b> is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to <b>aldosterone</b> receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of <b>aldosterone</b> production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of <b>aldosterone</b> in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Mineralocorticoids such as <b>aldosterone</b> {{regulate}} salt ("mineral") {{balance and}} blood volume.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} (also known as suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones including adrenaline and the steroids <b>aldosterone</b> and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The adrenal cortex itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E
5|$|When the zona glomerulosa {{produces}} excess <b>aldosterone,</b> {{the result}} is primary aldosteronism. Causes for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia (excessive tissue growth) of the glands, or aldosterone-producing adenomas (a condition called Conn's syndrome). Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, increasing potassium depletion and sodium retention.|$|E
5|$|Mineralocorticoid {{secretion}} {{is regulated}} mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), {{the concentration of}} potassium, {{and to a lesser}} extent the concentration of ACTH. Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of <b>aldosterone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an <b>aldosterone</b> antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, {{and some}} DNAs are transported through the pore {{complexes}} {{in a process}} mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and <b>aldosterone,</b> {{as well as other}} small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; {{in the absence of a}} ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} {{produces}} three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as <b>aldosterone)</b> {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.|$|E
25|$|Hyperaldosteronism is {{abnormally}} {{increased levels}} of <b>aldosterone,</b> while hypoaldosteronism is abnormally decreased levels of <b>aldosterone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Normal <b>aldosterone</b> level can be {{attributed}} to the fact that <b>aldosterone</b> is independent of hypothalamus-pituitary axis feedback system, being mainly controlled by the level of serum potassium. Because of the normal <b>aldosterone</b> level, hypertension is not expected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aldosterone</b> is a {{function}} of the inverse of the sodium intake as sensed via osmotic pressure. The slope of the response of <b>aldosterone</b> to serum potassium is almost independent of sodium intake. <b>Aldosterone</b> is increased at low sodium intakes, but the rate of increase of plasma <b>aldosterone</b> as potassium rises in the serum is not much lower at high sodium intakes than it is at low. Thus, the potassium is strongly regulated at all sodium intakes by <b>aldosterone</b> when the supply of potassium is adequate, which it usually is in primitive diets.|$|E
25|$|Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a {{pituitary}} peptide, {{also has}} some stimulating effect on <b>aldosterone,</b> probably by stimulating the formation of deoxycorticosterone, a precursor of <b>aldosterone.</b> <b>Aldosterone</b> is increased by blood loss, pregnancy, and possibly by further circumstances such as physical exertion, endotoxin shock, and burns.|$|E
25|$|A {{measurement}} of <b>aldosterone</b> in blood may be termed a plasma <b>aldosterone</b> concentration (PAC), {{which may be}} compared to plasma renin activity (PRA) as an aldosterone-to-renin ratio.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aldosterone</b> release: This {{steroid hormone}} is {{released}} from the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin II or high serum potassium levels. <b>Aldosterone</b> stimulates sodium retention and potassium excretion by the kidneys. Since sodium is the main ion that determines the amount of fluid in the blood vessels by osmosis, <b>aldosterone</b> will increase fluid retention, and indirectly, arterial pressure.|$|E
25|$|The primary mineralocorticoid, <b>aldosterone,</b> is {{produced}} in the adrenocortical zona glomerulosa {{by the action of}} the enzyme <b>aldosterone</b> synthase (also known as CYP11B2). <b>Aldosterone</b> is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure. <b>Aldosterone</b> effects on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct). Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon, and sweat glands to <b>aldosterone</b> receptor stimulation. Although sustained production of <b>aldosterone</b> requires persistent calcium entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry. However, mouse zona glomerulosa cells within adrenal slices spontaneously generate membrane potential oscillations of low periodicity; this innate electrical excitability of zona glomerulosa cells provides a platform for the production of a recurrent Ca2+ channels signal that can be controlled by angiotensin II and extracellular potassium, the 2 major regulators of <b>aldosterone</b> production. Angiotensin II originates from plasmatic angiotensin I after the conversion of angiotensinogen by renin produced by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney.|$|E
25|$|An ACTH {{stimulation}} {{test for}} <b>aldosterone</b> {{can help in}} determining the cause of hypoaldosteronism, with a low <b>aldosterone</b> response indicating a primary hypoaldosteronism of the adrenals, while a large response indicating a secondary hypoaldosteronism.|$|E
25|$|The <b>aldosterone</b> {{production}} is also affected to one extent or another by nervous control, which integrates the inverse of carotid artery pressure, pain, posture, and probably emotion (anxiety, fear, and hostility) (including surgical stress). Anxiety increases <b>aldosterone,</b> {{which must have}} evolved {{because of the time}} delay involved in migration of <b>aldosterone</b> into the cell nucleus. Thus, there is an advantage to an animal's anticipating a future need from interaction with a predator, since too high a serum content of potassium has very adverse effects on nervous transmission.|$|E
25|$|Since salt {{restriction}} is {{the basic}} concept in treatment, and <b>aldosterone</b> {{is one of the}} hormones that acts to increase salt retention, a medication that counteracts <b>aldosterone</b> should be sought. Spironolactone (or other distal-tubule diuretics such as triamterene or amiloride) is the drug of choice since they block the <b>aldosterone</b> receptor in the collecting tubule. This choice has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. Diuretics for ascites should be dosed once per day. Generally, the starting dose is oral spironolactone 100nbsp&mg/day (max 400nbsp&mg/day).|$|E
25|$|The {{secretion}} of <b>aldosterone</b> has a diurnal rhythm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aldosterone</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Simpson and Tait in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Reduces <b>aldosterone</b> {{secretion}} by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex.|$|E
25|$|Serum {{potassium}} concentrations are {{the most}} potent stimulator of <b>aldosterone</b> secretion.|$|E
25|$|Note: <b>aldosterone</b> synthase {{is absent}} in other {{sections}} of the adrenal gland.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aldosterone,</b> {{probably}} acting through mineralocorticoid receptors, may positively influence neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus.|$|E
25|$|Salt {{restriction}} {{is often}} necessary, as cirrhosis leads to accumulation of salt (sodium retention). Diuretics {{may be necessary}} to suppress ascites. Diuretic options for inpatient treatment include <b>aldosterone</b> antagonists (spironolactone) and loop diuretics. <b>Aldosterone</b> antagonists are preferred for people who can take oral medications and are not in need of an urgent volume reduction. Loop diuretics can be added as additional therapy.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the RAS is {{targeted}} pharmacologically by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The <b>aldosterone</b> system is directly targeted by spironolactone, an <b>aldosterone</b> antagonist. The fluid retention may be targeted by diuretics; the antihypertensive effect of diuretics {{is due to}} its effect on blood volume. Generally, the baroreceptor reflex is not targeted in hypertension because if blocked, individuals may suffer from orthostatic hypotension and fainting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aldosterone</b> further {{increases}} the Na+ and H2O reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aldosterone</b> upregulates {{expression}} of NCC in the distal convoluted tubule chronically and its activity acutely.|$|E
25|$|Although {{sustained}} {{production of}} <b>aldosterone</b> requires persistent calcium entry through low-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages {{that are too}} hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry. However, mouse zona glomerulosa cells within adrenal slices spontaneously generate membrane potential oscillations of low periodicity; this innate electrical excitability of zona glomerulosa cells provides a platform {{for the production of}} a recurrent Ca2+ channels signal that can be controlled by angiotensin II and extracellular potassium, the 2 major regulators of <b>aldosterone</b> production. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been detected in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, which suggests that Ca2+ channel blockers may directly influence the adrenocortical biosynthesis of <b>aldosterone</b> in vivo.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin II also causes an {{increase}} in the release of <b>aldosterone</b> from the adrenal glands.|$|E
25|$|Hyperkalemia (high {{concentration}} of potassium in the blood) is another possible complication of treatment with an ACE inhibitor {{due to its}} effect on <b>aldosterone.</b> Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in <b>aldosterone</b> levels. Since <b>aldosterone</b> is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an ACE inhibitor. Hyperkalemia may decrease the velocity of impulse conduction in the nerves and muscles, including cardiac tissues. This leads to cardiac dysfunction and neuromuscular consequences, such as muscle weakness, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and others. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors {{who are at risk}} of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aldosterone</b> stimulates Na+ {{and water}} {{reabsorption}} from the gut, salivary and sweat glands {{in exchange for}} K+.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin is {{involved}} in regulating <b>aldosterone</b> and is the core regulation. Angiotensin II acts synergistically with potassium, and the potassium feedback is virtually inoperative when no angiotensin II is present. A {{small portion of the}} regulation resulting from angiotensin II must take place indirectly from decreased blood flow through the liver due to constriction of capillaries. When the blood flow decreases so does the destruction of <b>aldosterone</b> by liver enzymes.|$|E
25|$|By {{blocking}} the calcium signal on adrenal cortex cells, they directly reduce <b>aldosterone</b> production, which correlates to lower blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{cause and}} other factors, hyperaldosteronism {{can be treated}} by surgery and/or medically, such as by <b>aldosterone</b> antagonists.|$|E
