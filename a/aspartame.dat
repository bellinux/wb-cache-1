5|$|Low-calorie sugars and {{artificial}} sweeteners are often made of maltodextrin with added sweeteners. Maltodextrin is an easily digestible synthetic polysaccharide consisting of short chains of glucose molecules and {{is made by}} the partial hydrolysis of starch. The added sweeteners are often <b>aspartame,</b> saccharin, stevia, or sucralose.|$|E
5|$|Many {{chemical}} reactions involving hydrochloric acid are {{applied in the}} production of food, food ingredients, and food additives. Typical products include <b>aspartame,</b> fructose, citric acid, lysine, hydrolyzed vegetable protein as food enhancer, and in gelatin production. Food-grade (extra-pure) hydrochloric acid can be applied when needed for the final product.|$|E
5|$|The food {{industry}} {{is also a}} major consumer of amino acids, in particular, glutamic acid, which {{is used as a}} flavor enhancer, and <b>aspartame</b> (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie artificial sweetener. Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aspartame</b> {{is rapidly}} hydrolyzed {{in the small}} intestines. Even with {{ingestion}} of very high doses of <b>aspartame</b> (over 200mg/kg), no <b>aspartame</b> {{is found in the}} blood due to the rapid breakdown. Upon ingestion, <b>aspartame</b> breaks down into residual components, including aspartic acid, phenylalanine, methanol, in ratio of 4:5:1 by mass and further breakdown products including formaldehyde and formic acid. Human studies show that formic acid is excreted faster than it is formed after ingestion of <b>aspartame.</b> In some fruit juices, higher concentrations of methanol can be found than the amount produced from <b>aspartame</b> in beverages.|$|E
25|$|Many {{aspects of}} {{industrial}} synthesis of <b>aspartame</b> were established by Ajinomoto. In 2004, {{the market for}} <b>aspartame,</b> in which Ajinomoto, the world's largest <b>aspartame</b> manufacturer, had a 40 percent share, was 14,000 metric tons a year, and consumption of the product was rising by 2 percent a year. Ajinomoto acquired its <b>aspartame</b> business in 2000 from Monsanto for $67M.|$|E
25|$|Because sucralose, unlike <b>aspartame,</b> {{retains its}} {{sweetness}} after being heated, and {{has at least}} twice the shelf life of <b>aspartame,</b> {{it has become more}} popular as an ingredient. This, along with differences in marketing and changing consumer preferences, caused <b>aspartame</b> to lose market share to sucralose. In 2004, <b>aspartame</b> traded at about $30/kg and sucralose, which is roughly three times sweeter by weight, at around $300/kg.|$|E
25|$|Reviews have {{analyzed}} {{studies which}} {{have looked at}} the consumption of <b>aspartame</b> in countries worldwide, including the United States, countries in Europe, and Australia, among others. These reviews have found that even the high levels of intake of <b>aspartame,</b> studied across multiple countries and different methods of measuring <b>aspartame</b> consumption, are well below the ADI for safe consumption of <b>aspartame.</b> Reviews have also found that populations that are believed to be especially high consumers of <b>aspartame</b> such as children and diabetics are below the ADI for safe consumption, even considering extreme worst-case scenario calculations of consumption.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aspartame</b> was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company. Schlatter had synthesized <b>aspartame</b> as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone gastrin, for use in assessing an anti-ulcer drug candidate. He discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with <b>aspartame,</b> to lift {{up a piece of}} paper. Torunn Atteraas Garin participated in the development of <b>aspartame</b> as an artificial sweetener.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the FDA {{convened a}} Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) {{consisting}} of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between <b>aspartame</b> and brain cancer. The PBOI concluded <b>aspartame</b> {{does not cause}} brain damage, but it recommended against approving <b>aspartame</b> at that time, citing unanswered questions about cancer in laboratory rats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aspartame</b> is {{the name}} for an artificial, non-saccharide sweetener, aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester; that is, a methyl ester of the {{dipeptide}} of the amino acidsaspartic acid and phenylalanine. <b>Aspartame</b> was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company. Schlatter had synthesized <b>aspartame</b> {{in the course of}} producing an anti-ulcer drug candidate.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} {{existing}} scientific {{evidence indicates that}} <b>aspartame</b> is safe at current levels of consumption as a non-nutritive sweetener. Reviews conducted by regulatory agencies decades after <b>aspartame</b> was first approved have supported its continued availability.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} peptides, <b>aspartame</b> may hydrolyze (break down) into its {{constituent}} amino acids {{under conditions of}} elevated temperature or high pH. This makes <b>aspartame</b> undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of <b>aspartame</b> under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in maltodextrin. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on pH. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its half-life is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its half-life {{is only a few}} days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where <b>aspartame</b> is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as syrups for fountain beverages, <b>aspartame</b> is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as saccharin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aspartame</b> is a {{methyl ester}} of the {{dipeptide}} {{of the natural}} amino acids L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. Under strongly acidic or alkaline conditions, <b>aspartame</b> may generate methanol by hydrolysis. Under more severe conditions, the peptide bonds are also hydrolyzed, resulting in free amino acids.|$|E
25|$|Reviews by {{governmental}} {{regulatory bodies}} have found <b>aspartame</b> safe for consumption at current levels. <b>Aspartame</b> has been deemed safe {{for human consumption}} by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the UK Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Health Canada.|$|E
25|$|Reviews {{have found}} no {{association}} between <b>aspartame</b> and cancer. These reviews have looked at numerous carcinogenicity studies in animals, epidemiologic studies in humans, {{as well as in}} vitro genotoxicity studies. These studies {{have found no}} significant evidence that <b>aspartame</b> causes cancer in animals, damages the genome, or causes cancer in humans at doses currently used. This position is supported by multiple regulatory agencies like the FDA and EFSA as well as scientific bodies such as the National Cancer Institute. <b>Aspartame</b> did not show any DNA-damaging properties either.|$|E
25|$|Concern about {{possible}} carcinogenic properties of <b>aspartame</b> was originally raised and popularized {{in the mainstream}} media by John Olney in the 1970s and again in 1996 by suggesting that <b>aspartame</b> may be related to brain tumors. Reviews have found that these concerns were flawed, due to reliance on the ecological fallacy and the purported mechanism of causing tumors being unlikely to actually cause cancer. Independent agencies such as the FDA and National Cancer Institute have reanalyzed multiple studies based on these worries and found no association between <b>aspartame</b> and brain cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety of}} <b>aspartame</b> {{has been studied}} since its discovery. <b>Aspartame</b> {{is one of the}} most rigorously tested food ingredients. As of 2017 {{evidence}} does not support a benefit for weight loss or in diabetes with some data finding an association with weight gain and heart disease risks.|$|E
25|$|Phenylalanine {{is one of}} the {{essential}} amino acids and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life. Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from <b>aspartame</b> for those without phenylketonuria center largely on hypothetical changes in neurotransmitter levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters {{to each other in the}} blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns, and while high doses of <b>aspartame</b> consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in toxicity studies to suggest <b>aspartame</b> can adversely affect neuronal function. Like methanol, common foods in the typical diet, such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from <b>aspartame</b> consumption.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{foods that}} contain <b>aspartame</b> are legally {{required}} by the country to list the substance among the product's ingredients and include {{a measure of the}} amount of <b>aspartame</b> per serving. As well, labels must state that the product contains phenylalanine â€“ this is usually in the order of ingredients, contained in brackets.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{allegations}} {{have been}} made via the Internet and in consumer magazines purporting neurotoxic effects of <b>aspartame</b> leading to neurological or psychiatric symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and mood changes. Review of the biochemistry of <b>aspartame</b> has {{found no evidence that}} the doses consumed would plausibly lead to neurotoxic effects.|$|E
25|$|Initially, <b>aspartame</b> was {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1974; however, problems with Searle's safety testing program, including testing of <b>aspartame,</b> were discovered subsequently. The approval was rescinded the following year; but, after outside reviews of the problematic tests and additional testing, final approval was granted in 1981. Because allegations of conflicts of interest marred the FDA's approval of <b>aspartame,</b> the U.S. Government Accountability Office reviewed the actions of involved officials in 1986 and the approval process in 1987; neither the allegations of conflict of interest nor problems in the final approval process were substantiated.|$|E
25|$|Descriptive {{analyses}} of solutions containing <b>aspartame</b> report a sweet aftertaste {{as well as}} bitter and off-flavor aftertastes. In products such as powdered beverages, the amine in <b>aspartame</b> can undergo a Maillard reaction with the aldehyde groups present in certain aroma compounds. The ensuing loss of both flavor and sweetness can be prevented by protecting the aldehyde as an acetal.|$|E
25|$|Comprehensive reviews {{have not}} found any {{evidence}} for <b>aspartame</b> as a cause for these symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, Ajinomoto {{announced}} a new brand name for its <b>aspartame</b> sweetener â€“ AminoSweet.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study done}} in 1979, the effect of <b>aspartame</b> {{ingestion}} on blood and milk amino acid levels in lactating women was tested. In this study, six women from the ages of 20 to 29 with established lactation were studied after oral administration of <b>aspartame</b> or lactose (50mg/kg body weight) in a random order, {{with the intent to}} study the differences in breast milk between the two. The study resulted with the conclusion that <b>aspartame</b> administration at 50mg/kg body weight has a small effect upon the milk aspartate levels; and, although a small increase in aspartate time-effect scores was noted over the four-hour postabsorptive period, no significant difference was noted over the entire 24-hour watching period.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Monsanto Company bought G.D.Searle, and the <b>aspartame</b> {{business}} {{became a}} separate Monsanto subsidiary, the NutraSweet Company. In March 2000, Monsanto {{sold it to}} J.W. Childs Equity Partners II L.P. European use patents on <b>aspartame</b> expired starting in 1987, and the U.S. patent expired in 1992. Since then, the company has competed for market share with other manufacturers, including Ajinomoto, Merisant and the Holland Sweetener Company.|$|E
25|$|Since December 1998, {{a widely}} {{circulated}} email hoax has cited <b>aspartame</b> {{as the cause}} of numerous diseases.|$|E
25|$|Aspartic acid (aspartate) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common amino acids in the typical diet. As with {{methanol}} and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from <b>aspartame</b> is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, <b>aspartame</b> provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid. There has been some speculation that <b>aspartame,</b> in conjunction with other amino acids like glutamate, may lead to excitotoxicity, inflicting damage on brain and nerve cells. However, clinical studies have shown no signs of neurotoxic effects, and studies of metabolism suggest it is not possible to ingest enough aspartic acid and glutamate through food and drink to levels that would be expected to be toxic.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>aspartame,</b> {{acesulfame}} potassium is stable under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, {{allowing it to}} be used as a food additive in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as <b>aspartame</b> or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} {{calories}} {{in a piece}} of 5 gum. The gum contains <b>aspartame</b> (with phenylalanine), acesulfame-potassium, soy lecithin, sorbitol, mannitol and other sweeteners.|$|E
25|$|Two 2017 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis found that <b>aspartame</b> consumption had no {{significant effect on}} variables related to obesity and diabetes. Nonnutritive sweeteners appear linked with increased weight.|$|E
25|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} (Ace-K) is 200 times {{sweeter than}} sucrose (common sugar), {{as sweet as}} <b>aspartame,</b> about two thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually <b>aspartame</b> or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the trade}} names Equal, NutraSweet, and Canderel, <b>aspartame</b> is an {{ingredient}} in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, instant coffees, topping mixes, wine coolers and yogurt. It is provided as a table condiment in some countries. <b>Aspartame</b> is less suitable for baking than other sweeteners, because it breaks down when heated and loses {{much of its}} sweetness.|$|E
25|$|The {{perceived}} {{sweetness of}} <b>aspartame</b> (and other sweet substances like acesulfame K) in humans {{is due to}} its binding of the heterodimer G-protein coupled receptor formed by the proteins TAS1R2 and TAS1R3.|$|E
25|$|Aftertastes arise after {{food has}} been swallowed. An aftertaste can {{differ from the}} food it follows. Medicines and tablets may also have a {{lingering}} aftertaste, as they can contain certain artificial flavor compounds, such as <b>aspartame</b> (artificial sweetener).|$|E
