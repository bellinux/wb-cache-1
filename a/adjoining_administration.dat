5000|$|White Pass & Yukon Route Railway Broadway Depot. Corner of 2nd Avenue and Broadway. Now {{serving as}} the park's Visitors Center and Headquarters, the depot was the first {{building}} the railway built for this purpose, completed in December 1898. The structure served this purpose {{at least until the}} 1950s. However, together with the <b>adjoining</b> <b>administration</b> building and the railway itself, these were taken over by the U.S. Army Railway Operating Battalion from 1942 to 1946 to supply construction of the Alaska Highway, the first land route to Alaska, then under construction in adjoining British Columbia and Yukon Territory as part of the war effort. It was the only commercial railway in the United States taken over for this purpose. The building was transferred to NPS in 1976 with restoration completed in 1984, returning its appearance to the 1908-1915 time period.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{enduring}} symbol of Murphy's administration is Duquesne University's chapel. The Gothic Revival chapel was constructed in brick to match the <b>adjoining</b> the <b>Administration</b> Building; it was begun in 1893, but not finished until 1904. Murphy personally secured the relics of the martyred saint Romulus for placement under the high altar.|$|R

5000|$|Although Callahan was {{hand-picked}} for {{the position}} by Hehir, Duquesne historian Joseph Rishel calls Callahan [...] "an unfortunate choice". The onset of the Great Depression had {{a negative impact on}} the university's fortunes, and Callahan's impersonal and rigid administrative attitude only exacerbated the crisis. Moreover, he was uninterested in day-to-day decision making, instead outsourcing authority to the deans of the individual schools, who operated with virtual autonomy. He habitually took two-month [...] "sabbaticals", even {{in the middle of the}} school year, and did not associate with the other Spiritan priests living on campus—he chose instead to live in a private apartment he had constructed <b>adjoining</b> the <b>Administration</b> Building. His inflexible attitude was summed up by one of his confrères in the congregation: [...] "Father Callahan was the one man I knew who never had a doubt".|$|R
