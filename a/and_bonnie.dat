5|$|Greenwald {{was born}} in 1977 to Rick <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> Greenwald. She has two brothers. Growing up, Greenwald {{had no plans to}} be a wrestler, but she was {{interested}} in appearing on American Gladiators. She trained to be a powerlifter from age 14 to age 18, and at age 14, she broke the Minnesota state powerlifting record (75pounds) for her age group by lifting 100pounds. She also trained as a gymnast. Later, she began wrestling for fun, not because she wanted to be on TV.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 ACC Championship Game {{kicked off}} at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida on December 2, 2006. The game was {{broadcast}} on ABC, {{and earned a}} 4.0 television rating. This figure was down slightly from the previous year's game, which earned a 5.1 rating. Brad Nessler, Bob Griese, Paul Maguire, <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> Bernstein were selected to announce the game.|$|E
5|$|The feature was {{directed}} by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae. Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprised their roles, <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> Hunt voiced a new character. New voice cast included Dave Foley, Sean Hayes, Julia Sweeney, Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina, Peter Sohn, Charlie Day, Joel Murray, Nathan Fillion, Aubrey Plaza, Tyler Labine, John Kransinski, Bill Hader, Bobby Moynihan, and Beth Behrs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast and Lathan, actor Bob Gunton, voice actor Julius Sharpe, and actress Jennifer Tilly, who portrayed the sheriff, warden, UPS Guy <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> Swanson, respectively, guest starred in the episode.

Recurring cast members Adam West, and Patrick Warburton also appeared in the episode, portraying the characters of Adam West and Joe Swanson, respectively. Bob Gunton's voicing of the warden is probably a nod to his most famous role, that of the warden in the film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E

Upset by this, Peter takes Stewie to train at the local gymnasium. A trainer notices Stewie struggling with barbells and offers steroids. Peter injects the drugs into Stewie, who becomes incredibly buff and develops an aggressive personality, much to the horror of his family. Stewie becomes tormenting towards Brian. As time passes, Stewie's drugs gradually wear off, much to his shock. His skin becomes incredibly loose and flabby. Stewie jumps out of his bedroom window to avoid Brian's wrath, only to have his loosened skin help him glide to safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} organized steadily {{that evening}} {{and into the}} morning of September18. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie and it began to move slowly to the northeast. Like most storms that develop in higher latitudes, Bonnie was embedded in a larger-scale cyclonic circulation at first, which minimized shear (allowing it to develop) and provided weak steering currents. The low shear allowed Bonnie to rapidly develop and a small but well-defined eye formed late that morning. The storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day while meandering in the open ocean. The intensification rate slowed down after becoming a hurricane. In addition, Bonnie began to slowly move more to the northeast on September19 as steering currents slowly developed. Bonnie strengthened into a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale that morning as well, peaking at 105mph (165km/h) with a 970mbar central pressure. The general track and intensity maintained itself throughout the day and into September20, when the eye became less distinct <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> weakened slightly, although remaining a Category2 hurricane. Early on September21, the eye became better defined once again <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> restrengthened slightly while continuing its slow northeast motion. That afternoon, the storm gradually strengthened some more and reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h) and a central pressure of 965mbar, just under Category3 intensity. Bonnie maintained its strength through the evening and into the early morning of September 22, when it began to weaken very gradually and level off. Bonnie also began to turn more eastward at that point before it became held up by a blocking mid-latitude ridge of high pressure, which stalled the motion.|$|E
5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E

5|$|A soft {{opening weekend}} {{was held for}} the media and {{reserved}} guests, starting on May 28, 2010. The park had two opening ceremonies that took place on June 16 and on June 18, 2010. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter's grand opening ceremony took place on June 16 with book series author J. K. Rowling, and film series actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, James and Oliver Phelps <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> Wright, as well as Universal Orlando Resort officials, and representatives from the media. The ceremony, which was produced by Universal Orlando Events Production in conjunction with Thinkwell Group, concluded with a fireworks display and a performance by the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by original series' composer John Williams. On June 18, the second ceremony took place, which officially opened the Wizarding World of Harry Potter to the public. NBC's Today Show and The Weather Channel broadcast segments live from the park.|$|E
5|$|A year passes. Peter {{has begun}} dating again, some dates being a Stickman <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie,</b> but has talked Joe into posing as Lois {{from time to}} time so that her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie {{indirectly}} reveals to Brian that he killed Lois. Disturbed and angered, Brian vows to bring him to justice. Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of his crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' trash and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the guests}} arrive, they then begin eating their meal, when {{suddenly}} another guest {{arrives at the}} door. It is revealed to be Kevin Swanson, the son of Joe <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> Swanson, whom they had presumed had died fighting {{in the war in}} Iraq. Overjoyed, they ask why the army had reported that he had died in action. Kevin then tells them a story that he was in a coma following a bomb that had been placed inside a turkey during Thanksgiving years before. Later, while having dessert, Kevin voices his distaste of the war, and reveals several inconsistencies about his time in Iraq. Kevin then tells his father that he had actually gone A.W.O.L., and because most of his unit was killed in the bombing but he miraculously survived, he faked his own death in order to leave the war and return home. Angered by his son's confession, Joe arrests him for the crime of desertion and handcuffs him {{with the rest of the}} family criticizing him for lying about being a war hero.|$|E

5|$|The remnant {{circulation}} {{continued to}} move slowly and erratically as it emerged {{off the coast}} on May31, before accelerating east-northeastwards and reintensifying slightly. Amidst light wind shear and high sea surface temperatures (SSTs), organization improved as convection persisted near the center, <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> regenerated into a tropical depression at 00:00UTC on June2. The next day, despite worsening conditions, a burst of convection around the center led to Bonnie once again being declared a tropical storm, simultaneously attaining a new minimum pressure of 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg). Increasing northwesterly shear and cooling SSTs soon became evident as the LLCC became exposed to the west, however Bonnie continued to maintain tropical storm strength. On the afternoon of June4, Bonnie began to succumb to the unfavorable conditions, and the storm weakened into a tropical depression. Early the next day, Bonnie degenerated once more into a post-tropical cyclone as it tracked east-southeastward over the Atlantic Ocean. The storm eventually transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on June7, and eventually dissipated south-southwest of the Azores, just after 18:00UTC on June9.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Radcliffe {{confirmed}} {{he would}} return as Harry Potter in May 2005, with Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom), <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> Wright (Ginny Weasley) confirmed to return in November 2005. In February 2006, Helen McCrorywas cast as Bellatrix Lestrange, but dropped out due to her pregnancy. In May 2006, Helena Bonham Carter was cast in her place. Ralph Fiennes reprises his role as Lord Voldemort. British television director David Yates was chosen to direct the film after Goblet of Fire director Newell, as well as Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Guillermo del Toro, Matthew Vaughn and Mira Nair, turned down offers. Kloves, the screenwriter of the first four Harry Potter films, had other commitments and Michael Goldenberg, who had been considered for screenwriter of the series' first film, filled in to write the script. Principal photography began on 7 February 2006, and concluded {{at the start of}} December 2006. Filming was put on a two-month hiatus starting in May 2006 so Radcliffe could sit his A/S Levels and Watson could sit her GCSE exams.Live-action filming took place in England and Scotland for exterior locations and at Leavesden Film Studios for interior locations. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had itsworldpremiere on 28 June 2007 in Tokyo, Japan, and a UK premiere on 3 July 2007 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 12 July,and the United States on 11 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakening}} trend ended {{early on}} September26 <b>and</b> <b>Bonnie</b> regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection re-established itself. Bonnie continued its change in direction, {{turning to the}} southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high-shear environment. It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm, and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September28. During that period, Bonnie actually strengthened back into a high-end tropical storm. Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charley's path towards the Azores thereafter. The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear, although it only weakened slightly on September29 as it accelerated towards the northeast. The storm crossed over the Azores on September30 as a strong tropical storm with 65mph (100km/h) winds. After that, Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon, {{just east of the}} Azores. The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop, actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating. It dissipated on October2.|$|E
