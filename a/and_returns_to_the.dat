5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E

5|$|The case, and {{the earlier}} Tinker v.

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is sexually mature at {{one to three}} years of age, but in healthy populations they breed after {{two to three years}} of age. A pair mates for life <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.|$|E

5|$|Beyond this interchange, {{the route}} comes to two-way toll plaza {{and has a}} U-turn ramp from the {{southbound}} direction to the northbound direction intended to provide southbound motorists access to MD 695A. This ramp, known as MD 695C, also provides access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A by way of Authority Drive. After this, the route ascends onto the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carries I-695 over the lower Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River. Unlike the Fort McHenry or Harbor Tunnels, HAZMAT trucks are allowed to cross the Key Bridge. After crossing the Patapsco River over the bridge the route touches down within the Baltimore city limits and continues west past Thoms Cove through Hawkins Point's industrial areas. It comes to an interchange with Quarantine Road, which provides access to MD 173, south of Curtis Bay. By this point, the route’s signage changes from northsouth to eastwest. Past this interchange, the Baltimore Beltway continues west <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Curtis Creek drawbridges.|$|E

5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victim's body with the man.

5|$|In Schenectady County, Schoharie Creek {{breaks from}} NY30A <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} of NY30 as it intersects U.S. Route20 (US20) in Esperance. From Esperance northward, the creek becomes roughly equidistant from both NY30 and NY30A as all three entities cross into Montgomery County. Near the northeastern {{corner of the}} county, NY30 enters the city of Amsterdam. The route meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY5S via separate interchanges before heading downhill as a four-lane divided highway approaching the Mohawk River (here part of the Erie Canal). Historically, the bridge over the river was a straight line to Market Street, which is visible as one approaches northbound. Segments of downtown Market Street remain in use today. With the 1977 creation of the Amsterdam Mall, NY30, together with NY5 and NY67, were re-routed onto splits. After the splits rejoin, NY30 continues on Market Street and leaves the city and, for all purposes, the county.|$|E
