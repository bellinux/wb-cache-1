5|$|Gimmick! {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} {{and a lack}} of interest at release. Distributors were more interested in games for the new 16-bit systems, so Sakai found difficulty in getting the game localized outside Japan. Sunsoft of <b>America</b> <b>did</b> not approve of the game for a North American release due to its quirky character design. Ultimately, the only distributor that imported the game was Swedish distributor Bergsala, which released it in 1993 in small quantities across the Scandinavian market. Critics both praised and criticized the game for its challenging difficulty, and some thought the game was designed exclusively for children due to its character design. In retrospective reviews, Gimmick! has received more praise, even seeing a re-release in Japan in 2002 for the PlayStation.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from his {{director and the}} exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen), who {{points out that the}} original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North <b>America</b> <b>did</b> not prove any such thing, but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.|$|E

The Recording Industry Association of <b>America</b> <b>did</b> not institute its gold record certification program until 1958, by which point Crosby's record sales were barely a blip. Before that, gold records were awarded by an artist's own record company. Universal Music, current owner of Crosby's Decca catalog, has never requested RIAA certification for any of his hit singles.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{cellulose}} acetate, {{the material}} {{used to create}} Lego bricks, {{was replaced by the}} more stable acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS plastic), which is still used today. ABS is non-toxic, is less prone to discolouration and warping, and is more resistant to heat, acids, salt, and other chemicals. Samsonite manufacturing in North <b>America</b> <b>did</b> not switch at the same time, and still used some degree of cellulose acetate in its Lego products.|$|E

25|$|While most of European or Caucasian {{migration}} into Mexico was Spanish {{during the}} colonial period, in the 19th and 20th centuries European and European derived populations from North and South <b>America</b> <b>did</b> immigrate to the country. However, at its height, the total immigrant population in Mexico never exceeded {{twenty percent of the}} total. Many of these immigrants came with money to invest or ties to allow them to become prominent in business and other aspects of Mexican society. However, due to government restrictions, many of them left the country in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the {{trustees}} of Columbia University rescinded Arming Americas Bancroft Prize, {{the first such}} action {{in the history of}} the prize. Alfred A. Knopf, publisher of Arming <b>America,</b> <b>did</b> not renew Bellesiles' contract, and the National Endowment for the Humanities withdrew its name from a fellowship that the Newberry Library had granted Bellesiles. In 2003, Arming America was republished in a revised and amended edition by Soft Skull Press. Bellesiles continued to defend the book's credibility and thesis, arguing that roughly three-quarters of the original book remained unchallenged.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} non-state actors {{resulted}} in a lower value placed on sovereignty in the 18th and 19th centuries, which further {{reduced the number of}} civil wars. For example, the pirates of the Barbary Coast were recognized as de facto states because of their military power. The Barbary pirates thus had no need to rebel against the Ottoman Empire – their nominal state government – to gain recognition of their sovereignty. Conversely, states such as Virginia and Massachusetts in the United States of <b>America</b> <b>did</b> not have sovereign status, but had significant political and economic independence coupled with weak federal control, reducing the incentive to secede.|$|E

25|$|Between 1920 and 1924, Ivogün toured {{twice in}} the United States on her own, and {{developed}} a large following there. The couple toured there widely together between December 1924 and late February 1925, when, after Willem Mengelberg had failed to persuade Erb to sing the St Matthew Passion in New York City, amid press sensations offering to 'buy' the performance, Erb left Maria to complete her tour and went home. He had to deliver Matthew Passions twice each in Munich, Elberfeld, Dortmund, Hagen, Cologne and Haarlem, all between 22 March and 13 April. <b>America</b> <b>did</b> not suit Erb as it suited Ivogün, and although their partnership continued for several years, they began to go their separate ways.|$|E
25|$|In {{the process}} of {{screening}} the Cleveland morning program as a creative source, ABC also began looking at another local show, Good Morning!, which was produced by Boston ABC affiliate WCVB-TV. Good Morning! was very similar in format to The Morning Exchange, but with a lesser emphasis on news and weather. In fact, once the revamped ABC morning show took to the air late in 1975 under the title Good Morning America, WCVB station manager Bob Bennett accused ABC entertainment president Fred Silverman of deliberately stealing the title of Good Morning!; no legal cease and desist action was finalized against ABC in the matter, however. The launch of Good Morning <b>America</b> <b>did</b> result in the Boston morning show changing its name—to Good Day!.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} in North <b>America</b> <b>did</b> nothing {{to shake the}} common Whig belief that America was to be won by defeating France in Europe. However, the failure at Quebec was somewhat compensated by Marlborough's final victory in the field. Anne's Captain-General {{no longer had the}} influence he enjoyed under the Godolphin ministry: his wife's relationship with the Queen had ended acrimoniously and he was now under the influence of Harley, now the Earl of Oxford and Lord High Treasurer. Nevertheless, Marlborough still commanded the Anglo-Dutch forces in northern France, and in August he outmanoeuvred Villars and crossed the formidable Ne Plus Ultra lines, before capturing Bouchain on 12 September. The campaign was not decisive, however. Arras, Cambrai, Le Quesnoy, and Landrecies still stood between the Duke and Paris, and it would take at least one more campaign to secure their capitulation.|$|E

25|$|In Hawaii, the {{population}} of Oahu wiped itself out, but civilization still exists on the Big Island of Hawaii. The island produces coffee, a rare commodity in post-Change North America. Prince Edward Island also survived relatively intact, becoming {{a part of the}} British Empire, compared to most of the heavily populated sections of eastern Canadaalong the Saint Lawrence Seaway, such as Toronto and Montreal, which also became a Death Zone. Mexico and Central America, including the Caribbean, were almost completely depopulated by overlapping Death Zones. South America adapted to post-Change life much as North <b>America</b> <b>did,</b> with rural areas far from large cities maintaining much of their population and adapting to the new laws of nature. Chocolate was imported from the Caribbean Sea, but only after trade routes were reestablished by settler populations from the south and from the British Empire. By 2050, Britain laid claim to the east coast of North America and Jamaican merchants traded in British ports.|$|E
25|$|After Mexico {{hosted the}} 1970 FIFA World Cup, the league tournament format was changed in {{response}} to the championship's disputed winners, hence the Liguilla (play-offs) format was started. The first play-off final was in 1971 between Toluca and América, leaders of Groups 1 and 2, respectively. After a 0–0 draw in Toluca, América obtained their second league title after winning the second-leg 2–0 at the Estadio Azteca. The following season saw América eliminated from the playoffs by Cruz Azul. América would defeat Cruz Azul the 1973 Copa México final. A few years followed in which <b>América</b> <b>did</b> not qualify for the playoffs. They finished in first place during the 1975–1976 season, and defeated Tecos UAG and Union de Curtidores in the quarter-finals and semi-finals to reach the final against Universidad de Guadalajara. América won the championship after beating UDG in the Jalisco Stadium 3–0 and 1–0 at the Estadio Azteca. They also won the Campeón de Campeones title by beating Tigres UANL 2–0.|$|E

500|$|In February 1991, the Raëlian Church {{modified}} their symbol. The official reason given was {{a request}} from the Elohim to change the symbol {{in order to help}} in negotiations with Israel for the building of the Extraterrestrial Embassy to greet the anticipated Elohim space vessels, although the country continued to deny their request. In 2005, the Israeli Raëlian Guide Kobi Drori stated that the Lebanese government was discussing proposals by the Raëlian movement to build their interplanetary embassy in Lebanon. However, one condition was that the Raëlians not display their logo on top of the building because it mixes a swastika and a Star of David. According to Drori, the Raëlians involved declined this offer, as they wished to keep the symbol as it was. [...] From 1991 to 2007, the official Raëlian symbol in Europe and <b>America</b> <b>did</b> not have the original swastika, but Raël, founder and leader of the Raëlian Movement decided to make the original symbol, the Star of David intertwined with a swastika, the only official symbol of the Raelian Movement worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{traveled}} to Rome, Georgia and {{appeared at the}} downtown Holiday Inn in November 1987.

[...] Paul went on to compare his Libertarian ideology to the mindset of the founding fathers. The next month, vice presidential nominee Andre Marrou {{traveled to}} Texas and discussed the Paul campaign's prospects. He opined that the ticket could possibly win 2 to 12 million votes in the following year's election, and that Paul might win if Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson were selected as the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, respectively. He explained that <b>America</b> <b>did</b> not want a preacher as president. Since the chance that either of those candidates would be named as their party's representative seemed unlikely, by this point in the election one of the campaign's priorities was securing a place on the ballot, which they had done in 20 of the 50 states.|$|E
