25|$|In Christianity, God the Father's {{relationship}} with humanity is as <b>a</b> <b>father</b> <b>to</b> children—in a previously unheard-of sense—and {{not just as}} the creator and nurturer of creation, and the provider for his children, his people.

To Christians, God the Father's {{relationship with}} humanity is that of Creator and created beings, and in that respect he {{is the father of}} all. The New Testament says, in this sense, that the very idea of family, wherever it appears, derives its name from God the Father, and thus God himself is the model of the family.|$|E
