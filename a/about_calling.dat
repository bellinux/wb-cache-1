25|$|Several Eskimo peoples had {{beliefs in}} usage of amulets, {{formulae}} (spells, charms). Furthermore, several peoples living in {{more or less}} isolated groups (including many Eskimo ones) understand natural phenomena on a personal level: there are imagined beings resembling to human but differing as well. As for Sirenik Eskimos, {{in one of their}} tales, we find the motif of the effective calling of natural phenomena for help in danger: an eagle is pursuing people on the ice, and a woman begins to talk <b>about</b> <b>calling</b> wind and frost, then at once the river freezes in, and the eagle freezes onto the ice.|$|E

25|$|Boyd {{received}} substantial {{media attention}} during his deep {{run on the}} 2003 World Series of Poker Main Event, where he finished in 12th place. He {{was involved in a}} key hand late in the tournament with Chris Moneymaker. Boyd held KQ and Moneymaker had pocket 3s. After the 9 2 5 flop had missed Boyd, Moneymaker bet $100,000, and Dutch forced him all-in on a bluff. Moneymaker thought for a while <b>about</b> <b>calling,</b> but eventually did put his tournament life on the line. Boyd did not improve on his over cards and was left with a very small stack. Boyd would go down in 12th place not long after the hand, and Moneymaker would go on to win the tournament. Shortly after this, he founded a group of young poker players called The Crew that achieved notable success. In addition to playing poker professionally, Boyd attempted to establish another online poker room which charged players a monthly membership fee rather than rake in order to play. Boyd's new endeavor would not materialize.|$|E

25|$|During these rallies, Erdoğan mainly went <b>about</b> <b>calling</b> for {{a presidential}} system and criticising the opposition, with many thus {{claiming}} that he had broken the terms of his office. Implicitly calling on voters to elect 400 AKP MPs, he criticised the opposition parties for their promises to {{raise the minimum wage}} on May Day, though it also became evident that he didn't know how much it was himself. He also criticised the main opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for questioning his faith in the Quran and also criticised MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli for his calls for the resignation of Mehmet Görmez, the head of the Presidency of Religious Affairs. On 28 May, he made a statement criticising HDP's party lists, claiming 'we don't put forward transgender candidates!' His perceived reference to the AKP as 'we' was seen as an open disregard for neutrality. The CHP, MHP and HDP submitted formal complaints against Erdoğan's involvement in the political process on numerous occasions, but the Supreme Electoral Council refused to call off Erdoğan's rallies or issue him a warning.|$|E

[...] Following the success of Dune II, Sperry believed that [...] "it was time to build the ultimate RTS" [...] with an original intellectual property. He later said that he was [...] "fanatical <b>about</b> <b>calling</b> the game 'Command & Conquer'," [...] because he believed that the title was an ideal summary of the gameplay.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the general}} public, the parity of zero {{can be a}} source of confusion. In {{reaction}} time experiments, most people are slower to identify 0 as even than 2, 4, 6, or 8. Some students of mathematics—and some teachers—think that zero is odd, or both even and odd, or neither. Researchers in mathematics education propose that these misconceptions can become learning opportunities. Studying equalities like [...] can address students' doubts <b>about</b> <b>calling</b> 0 a number and using it in arithmetic. Class discussions can lead students to appreciate the basic principles of mathematical reasoning, such as the importance of definitions. Evaluating the parity of this exceptional number is an early example of a pervasive theme in mathematics: the abstraction of a familiar concept to an unfamiliar setting.|$|E
500|$|A papal {{election}} {{could bring}} {{a dramatic change}} of fortune for a cardinal-nephew, often bringing the former favorites into conflict with the new Pope. For example, Prospero Colonna and Francisco de Borja were excommunicated, and Carlo Carafa was executed. The papal conclave, May 1605, {{is one example of}} a conclave where a candidate (Antonmaria Sauli) was defeated because enough other cardinals were convinced of the need for [...] "a Pope willing to punish the cardinal-nephews for robbing the papacy". A cardinal-nephew was also a potential threat to any future pontiff; for example, Ludovisi came to lead the opposition against Pope Urban VIII (1623–1644), even talking <b>about</b> <b>calling</b> a council against the Pope (which never occurred as Ludovisi died in 1632) because [...] "no one else had the standing to confront Urban's titanic temper".|$|E
500|$|Hewett {{played all}} three matches of the 1895 Scarborough Festival; {{he opened the}} innings for the MCC against Yorkshire, and then captained the South in their loss against the North. In the third match, Hewett was named captain of an England XI, a {{compliment}} for the former Somerset captain. However, rain meant that the start was delayed. Unlike {{a couple of years}} earlier, Hewett was happy to ignore the puddles in the field and start the match at the scheduled time. The umpires disagreed with him, and the crowd, wanting cricket, blamed Hewett for the delay and lack of sport. When he belatedly led his side onto the field, the spectators threw insults at him until the Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, shouted [...] "Keep quiet or I'll think <b>about</b> <b>calling</b> the game off". Hewett did not bother with such threats, and left the field, got changed and departed from the ground, taking no further part in the game. Fred Spofforth replaced him in the match which the England side went on to win by nine wickets.|$|E

500|$|Francis Galton (1822–1911) was {{a pioneer}} in {{investigating}} both eminent human achievement and mental testing. In his book Hereditary Genius, writing before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose near' genius or genius" [...] as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford–Binet test. By 1926, Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called Genetic Studies of Genius, which he conducted {{for the rest of}} his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman's, wrote a whole book, The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses, published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds, Cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius. By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford–Binet test, Terman no longer used the term [...] "genius" [...] as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test. In 1939, Wechsler specifically commented that [...] "we are rather hesitant <b>about</b> <b>calling</b> a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score." ...|$|E

2500|$|These reports transmuted the {{depiction}} of the believers who practiced calling on {{the name of the}} Lord from being law-abiding citizens to being a dangerous sect that was violently anti-government. Such a characterization seems to have been without justification.

Witness Lee’s speaking <b>about</b> <b>calling</b> on the Lord never sanctioned the type of disorderly behavior attributed to [...] "the Shouters sect," [...] and the more extreme characterizations of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee as counterrevolutionary are contradicted by statements of both men that the church should have no participation in politics and Christians should submit to whatever government rules their country.|$|E
