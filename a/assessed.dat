3000|$|Based on the second-order CFA, {{the figure}} above reveals how LAK {{explains}} its constructs (<b>assessing</b> reading, <b>assessing</b> listening, <b>assessing</b> writing, <b>assessing</b> speaking) {{in terms of}} their variance. Firstly, standardized path coefficients were reported as [...]. 98 for <b>assessing</b> listening, [...]. 99 for <b>assessing</b> reading, [...]. 89 for <b>assessing</b> writing, and [...]. 98 for <b>assessing</b> speaking. That means, one standard deviation change in LAK (1.000) would lead to 0.994 standard deviation change in <b>assessing</b> reading, [...]. 986 standard deviation change in <b>assessing</b> listening, [...]. 891 standard deviation change in <b>assessing</b> writing, and [...]. 981 standard deviation change in <b>assessing</b> speaking, all of which are good indicators of variance explanation. In addition to this, the error variance values were found as [...]. 027 for <b>assessing</b> listening, [...]. 013 for <b>assessing</b> reading, [...]. 206 for <b>assessing</b> writing, and [...]. 038 for <b>assessing</b> speaking. In other words, these values mean that LAK explains 97 % variance of <b>assessing</b> listening, 98 % variance of <b>assessing</b> reading, 80 % variance of <b>assessing</b> writing, and almost 96 % variance of <b>assessing</b> speaking. In short, as all these values suggest, the model presents a perfect model-data fit in terms of explaining LAK and its constructs.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} use psychometric {{instruments}} to <b>assess</b> a multidimensional construct, we may decompose it in dimensions and, {{in order to}} <b>assess</b> each dimension, develop a set of items, so one may <b>assess</b> the construct as a whole, by <b>assessing</b> its dimensions. In this scenario, the content analysis of items aims to verify if the developed items are <b>assessing</b> the dimension they are supposed to. In the content analysis process, it is customary to request the judgement of specialists in the studied construct about the dimension that the developed items <b>assess,</b> what makes it a subjective process as it relies upon the personal opinion of the specialists. This paper aims to develop a nonparametric statistical approach to the content analysis of items in order to present a practical method to <b>assess</b> {{the consistency of the}} content analysis process, by the development of a statistical test that seeks to determine if all the specialists have the same capability to judge the items. A simulation study is conducted to <b>assess</b> the consistency of the test and it is applied to a real validation process...|$|R

40|$|Creativity {{is crucial}} for {{designing}} products and enabling innovation. <b>Assessing</b> creativity can help identify innovative designers and products, and support improvement of both.

This research proposes a new method for <b>assessing</b> the creativity of products as a function of their novelty and usefulness. We develop individual methods for <b>assessing</b> novelty and usefulness of products. and then combine these into a method for <b>assessing</b> creativity of products. The proposed methods have been evaluated by benchmarking them, and other methods available from literature, against the collective, intuitive assessment of product creativity of experienced designers.
