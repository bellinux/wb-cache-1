5|$|Eventually the police, {{assisted}} by appeals from the players {{for the crowd}} to calm, were able to manoeuvre the spectators to just beyond the touchline, and the game began approximately 45 minutes late, while fans stood <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the pitch.|$|E
5|$|It {{played host to}} one One Day International {{during the}} 1983 Cricket World Cup, the group stage match between India and Zimbabwe in which Kapil Dev made a score of 175 not out. The Nevill Ground is known for having {{rhododendron}} bushes <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{reverse is}} plain and is inscribed [...] "PRESENTED BY" [...] <b>around</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>perimeter,</b> [...] "HIS EXCELLENCY", [...] "SIR H.G. SMITH BART C.G.B." [...] and [...] "TO" [...] in three {{lines in the}} centre, with open space for private naming, and [...] "FOR GALLANTRY IN <b>THE</b> FIELD" [...] <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>perimeter.</b>|$|R

5|$|Located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the BWCAW are six ranger stations: in Cook, Aurora, Ely, Isabella, Tofte and Grand Marais. The two nearby {{communities}} with most visitor services are Ely and Grand Marais. Several historic roads {{such as the}} Gunflint Trail, Echo Trail (County Road116) and Fernberg Road (County Road18) allow access to many wilderness entry points.|$|E
5|$|Nowitzki averages {{just over}} one block {{per game and}} never made an All-Defense Team. However, playing more <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> took him out of {{position}} where a typical power forward would be detracted from his overall defensive stats. Despite rarely blocking shots, he is ranked 8th in active players for defensive win shares as of July 2014.|$|E
5|$|Several {{main roads}} run <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of Hyde Park. Park Lane {{is part of}} the London Inner Ring Road and the London Congestion Charge zone boundary. The A4, a major road through West London, runs along the southeastern edge of the park, while the A5, a major road to Milton Keynes and the Midlands runs {{northwest}} from Marble Arch.|$|E
5000|$|Walking / jogging path {{estimated}} 1.8 mi <b>around</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>perimeter</b> of <b>the</b> park ...|$|R
5000|$|Car - There is some parking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> park <b>perimeter,</b> in {{particular}} along Victoria Park Drive North.|$|R
5000|$|Hiking on trails {{throughout}} the park; the 1.25 mi Dorothy Stegmann trail <b>around</b> <b>the</b> park’s <b>perimeter</b> is fully wheelchair accessible.|$|R
5|$|The {{shopping}} {{levels in}} the Clal Building are exceptionally large, with space for stores and a cinema. Stores are situated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of a large, central atrium. Originally the atrium was open-air, but weather damage forced planners to install a semi-transparent roof. Several banks of elevators access upper-floor offices.|$|E
5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E
5|$|At Parken Stadium, {{where the}} final {{was to be}} played, the police erected iron fencing outside to {{separate}} the Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution. UEFA also requested that fences be put up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the pitch. The riots did not spread to the stadium, although there {{was an attempt to}} pull down the fences by fans heading towards the Arsenal area of the stadium before police stopped them.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Victorian obverse of the Distinguished Conduct Medal shows a Trophy of Arms, {{incorporating a}} central shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms, without any inscription, as also {{seen on the}} early Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. From 1902, after the accession of King Edward VII, the effigy of the reigning monarch replaced the trophy of arms, with the respective titles of <b>the</b> monarchs inscribed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dogs and cyclists are {{permitted}} outside the visitor centre and along a specially marked 6 km circular route <b>around</b> <b>the</b> reserve's <b>perimeter.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} the {{reservoir}} is often extremely busy {{with members of}} the public coming for picnics and walks <b>around</b> <b>the</b> reservoir's <b>perimeter</b> path.|$|R
5|$|Started in 1743 and {{originally}} {{known as}} Temple Park, Castle Park is located {{to the south}} of the castle. Its original name derived from the Knights Templar, who used to own a manor in Warwick. Houses <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the park were demolished and the land they stood on incorporated into the park. Attempts to make profits from the park in the late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping sheep.|$|E
5|$|The fences <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of {{the ground}} {{fronting}} the terracing (which were to prevent fans, notably hooligans, running onto the pitch) were removed immediately post Hillsborough, {{in time for the}} rearranged league fixture with Liverpool. The Everton match versus Luton Town in May 1991 was the final time that Gwladys Street allowed standing spectators. Seats were installed in the Paddock, while the Lower Gwladys Street was later completely rebuilt to accommodate seating with new concrete steps.|$|E
5|$|Before 1914, a cycling track ran <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of {{the pitch}} where regular cycling {{meetings}} were hosted {{as well as}} athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was in use for {{the final of the}} Olympic football tournament.|$|E

5000|$|The obverse shows a crowned and veiled effigy of Queen Victoria, facing left, {{with the}} legend [...] "VICTORIA REGINA ET IMPERATRIX" [...] <b>around</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>perimeter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The obverse shows King Edward VII, in Field Marshal's {{uniform and}} facing left, with the legend [...] "EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR" [...] <b>around</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>perimeter.</b>|$|R
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover {{that it was just}} as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E
5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E
50|$|A teahouse, a {{campground}} for tourists, {{and horse}} stables {{were built in}} the park in the 1920s. A four-mile-long pedestrian promenade was constructed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> park <b>perimeter</b> in 1935.|$|R
50|$|Bonriki International Airport is {{currently}} undergoing an upgrade program to bring airport security up to IATA standards - {{this includes the}} construction of a fence <b>around</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>perimeter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its {{first stage}} (which took 18 months) was the Twin Rivers Diversion Scheme, {{diverting}} the Longford River and the Duke of Northumberland's River <b>around</b> <b>the</b> western <b>perimeter</b> of <b>the</b> airport, and realigning the A3044 dual carriageway and <b>the</b> Western <b>Perimeter</b> Road.|$|R
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain {{in order to make}} him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E
5|$|After {{deciding}} not {{to renew}} the lease on the Four Acres, Albion moved to their fifth ground, Stoney Lane, {{in time for the}} 1885–86 season. The ground was located close to the Plough and Harrow public house, which served as the club's headquarters at the time. Albion took out an initial seven-year lease on the Stoney Lane site, paying an annual rent of £28 to its owner, a local undertaker named Mr Webb. The pitch was returfed and levelled, with ashes spread <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter,</b> and a wooden grandstand was built that {{came to be known as}} 'Noah's Ark'. The ground cost £370 to build, a sum that was offset by a number of friendly matches that took place early in the season.|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} {{barricades}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Euromaidan <b>perimeter</b> was {{increased in the}} places where {{none of them were}} before (Prorizna street, Horodetskyi street, the stairs descend from the October Palace).|$|R
50|$|The Ooty Municipal Market {{has been}} {{previously}} {{considered to be a}} model market of India. Events like Market shows were held in the market premises years ago. It features 1500 permanent sales outlets and 500 temporary outlets. The market is visited by 3,500 to 4,000 people on a typical weekday and between 4000 to 5000 people on weekends. During the summer tourist season in Ooty, the average number of visitors per day is more than 5000. It has 15 gates <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeters</b> for access to visitors.|$|R
