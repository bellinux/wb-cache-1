25|$|The {{system is}} highly {{adaptable}} because of somatic hypermutation (a process of accelerated somatic mutations), and V(D)J recombination (an irreversible genetic recombination of <b>antigen</b> <b>receptor</b> gene segments). This mechanism allows {{a small number}} of genes to generate a vast number of different antigen receptors, which are then uniquely expressed on each individual lymphocyte. Since the gene rearrangement leads to an irreversible change in the DNA of each cell, all progeny (offspring) of that cell inherit genes that encode the same receptor specificity, including the memory B cells and memory T cells that are the keys to long-lived specific immunity.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} T cells is {{their ability to}} {{discriminate}} between healthy and abnormal (e.g. infected or cancerous) cells in the body. Healthy cells typically express {{a large number of}} self derived pMHC on their cell surface and although the T cell <b>antigen</b> <b>receptor</b> can interact with at least a subset of these self pMHC, the T cell generally ignores these healthy cells. However, when these very same cells contain even minute quantities of pathogen derived pMHC, T cells are able to become activated and initiate immune responses. The ability of T cells to ignore healthy cells but respond when these same cells contain pathogen (or cancer) derived pMHC is known as antigen discrimination. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this process are controversial.|$|E
40|$|Repertoire of {{an immune}} system {{is a set of}} <b>antigen</b> <b>receptors</b> each having a unique {{specificity}} to bind an antigen. In many vertebrate species, <b>antigen</b> <b>receptors</b> are produced via combinatorial arrangements of DNA segments in specialized immune cells. Due to this molecular mechanism, repertoire of vertebrate species is potentially very large. The diversity of repertoire is thought to guarantee recognition of most ill-causing micro!organisms. In invertebrate species however, similar editing of DNA segments has not been demonstrated to take place. Immune system of invertebrate species therefore seems to operate in a distinct manner from that of vertebrate species. Using an evolutionary model in which organisms struggle to fight infections, we attempt to understand why some species use a more diverse set of <b>antigen</b> <b>receptors</b> than others. Individuals in our model either use somatic DNA recombination to produce <b>antigen</b> <b>receptors</b> (as in vertebrates) or do not use such a mechanism (as in invertebrates). We found that individuals having an invertebrate!like immune system came to employ only a few <b>antigen</b> <b>receptors</b> to recognize a set of pathogens whereas those with a vertebrate!like immune system use a larger set of more specific <b>antigen</b> <b>receptors</b> to recognize the same set of pathogens. Our interpretation of this finding is that because the genetics of the immune system imposed different constraints on the evolutionary process, two distinct recognition strategies have been adapted by these species...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the first example of retroviral transduction of an immunological effector molecule has led us to reconsider the possible importance of cell surface receptors {{of the immune system}} in leukaemia development. <b>Antigen</b> <b>receptors</b> on lymphoid cells not only bind external ligands but are crucial in the control of cellular proliferation. The concept of autocrine stimulation in oncogenesis is already well established and we see no reason to exclude the possibility of analogous mechanism operating through <b>antigen</b> <b>receptors.</b> At present, we are investigating the oncogenic function of the retrovirus (FeLV-T 17) carrying a T-cell receptor gene (v-tcr). In addressing the general concept of oncogenesis by ligand/receptor interactions in the immune system we face the problem of the diversity and, for T-cell <b>antigen</b> <b>receptors,</b> the complex nature of receptor-ligand interaction. Nevertheless, the implications of the model encourage us to continue to search for new experimental tools and approaches to the question...|$|R
25|$|Plasmodium vivax {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in tropical countries, but is absent or rare in a large region in West and Central Africa, as recently confirmed by PCR species typing. This gap in distribution {{has been attributed to}} the lack of expression of the Duffy <b>antigen</b> <b>receptor</b> for chemokines (DARC) on the red cells of many sub-Saharan Africans. Duffy negative individuals are homozygous for a DARC allele, carrying a single nucleotide mutation (DARC 46 T → C), which impairs promoter activity by disrupting a binding site for the hGATA1 erythroid lineage transcription factor. In widely cited in vitro and in vivo studies, Miller et al. reported that the Duffy blood group is the receptor for P. vivax and that the absence of the Duffy blood group on red cells is the resistance factor to P. vivax in persons of African descent. This has become a well-known example of innate resistance to an infectious agent because of the absence of a receptor for the agent on target cells.|$|E
2500|$|Myriad receptors are {{produced}} {{through a process}} known as clonal selection. [...] According to the clonal selection theory, at birth, an animal randomly generates a vast diversity of lymphocytes (each bearing a unique <b>antigen</b> <b>receptor)</b> from information encoded in a small family of genes. To generate each unique <b>antigen</b> <b>receptor,</b> these genes have undergone a process called V(D)J recombination, or combinatorial diversification, in which one gene segment recombines with other gene segments to form a single unique gene. This assembly process generates the enormous diversity of receptors and antibodies, before the body ever encounters antigens, and enables the immune system to respond to an almost unlimited diversity of antigens. Throughout an animal's lifetime, lymphocytes that can react against the antigens an animal actually encounters are selected for action—directed against anything that expresses that antigen.|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{expression}} regulation for IL-2 can be {{on multiple}} levels or by different ways.

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP contains an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains, and thus belongs to receptor type PTP. This gene is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. This PTP has been shown to be an essential regulator of T- and B-cell <b>antigen</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling. It functions through either direct interaction with components of the <b>antigen</b> <b>receptor</b> complexes or by activating various Src family kinases required for the <b>antigen</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling. This PTP also suppresses JAK kinases, and, thus, functions as a negative regulator of cytokine receptor signaling. Four alternatively spliced transcripts variants of this gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported.|$|E
