5|$|Enron's auditor firm, <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen,</b> {{was accused}} of {{applying}} reckless standards in its audits because of {{a conflict of interest}} over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2002, Enron {{dismissed}} <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> as its auditor, citing its accounting {{advice and}} the destruction of documents. Andersen countered that it had already ended its relationship with the company when Enron became bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{capitalized}} the Raptors, and, in {{a manner}} similar to the accounting employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Arthur</b> Edward <b>Andersen</b> {{was born}} in Plano, Illinois. John William and Mary Aabye <b>Andersen,</b> <b>Arthur</b> Andersen’s parents, had immigrated to the United States from Norway in 1881. Andersen was left on his own {{at the age of}} 16 {{after the death of his}} parents. In 1917, after {{attending}} courses at night while working full-time, he graduated from the Kellogg School at Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree in business.|$|R
5|$|The Enron scandal, publicized in October 2001, {{eventually}} led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen,</b> {{which was one of the}} five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world. In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{was formed}} in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he {{developed}} a staff of executives that – {{by the use of}} accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> to ignore the issues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 37 {{accountants}} attended the meeting, and {{among them were}} practitioners as William B. Castenholz, Stephen Gilman, Harry Dudley Greeley, and Clinton H.

5|$|Many {{executives}} at Enron were indicted {{for a variety}} of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen,</b> was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{there was}} {{increasing}} tension between Andersen Consulting and <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen.</b> Andersen Consulting was paying <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> up to 15% of its profits each year (a {{provision of the}} 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent), {{while at the same}} time <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen.</b> Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen.</b> As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2billion) to <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen,</b> and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.|$|E

500|$|From the 1980s to {{the present}} there have been {{multiple}} accounting scandals that were widely reported on {{by the media and}} resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of creative accounting, misleading financial analysis, as well as bribery. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including Nugan Hand Bank, Phar-Mor, WorldCom, and AIG. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved Enron, a multinational company, that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen,</b> an accounting firm considered one of the [...] "Big Five", signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements. When the unethical activities were reported, not only did Enron dissolve but <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> also went out of business. Enron's shareholders lost $25billion {{as a result of the}} company's bankruptcy. Although only a fraction of Arthur Anderson's employees were involved with the scandal, the closure of the firm resulted in the loss of 85,000 jobs.|$|E
500|$|On August 15, Sherron Watkins, vice {{president}} for corporate development, sent an anonymous letter to Lay warning him about the company's accounting practices.

[...] Watkins contacted a friend who worked for <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> and he drafted a memorandum to give to the audit partners about the points she raised. On August 22, Watkins met individually with Lay and gave him a six-page letter further explaining Enron's accounting issues. Lay questioned her as to whether she had told anyone outside of the company and then vowed to have the company's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, review the issues, although she argued that using the law firm would present a conflict of interest. Lay consulted with other executives, and although they wanted to dismiss Watkins (as Texas law did not protect company whistleblowers), they decided against it to prevent a lawsuit. On October 15, Vinson & Elkins announced that Enron had done nothing wrong in its accounting practices as Andersen had approved each issue.|$|E
500|$|The {{accounts}} of Olympus were audited in the 1990s by the Japanese affiliate of then 'big five' accounting firm <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> until the latter collapsed in 2002, when KPMG Azsa became its auditor. KPMG remained the auditor up until 2009, {{after which the}} Ernst & Young ShinNihon (E) took over. At no point were any major issues signalled by the company's auditors; The Financial Times (FT) reported that KPMG had raised some questions when the firm audited Olympus, but audit reports were always unqualified, and E signed off on [...] "clean" [...] audit reports in 2010 and 2011. According to an email sent by former chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa that Michael Woodford made public, Olympus had replaced KPMG with E after the former expressed disagreement with the accounting treatment of the Gyrus acquisition. The FT queried why, this being the case, KPMG had {{signed off on the}} 2009 accounts. Tsutomu Okubo raised a question in the upper house of the Diet as to why the auditors apparently failed to stop the cover-up; the Japanese Institute of Certified Accountants said that it would look into the auditors' role.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a further}} effort to take {{advantage}} of economies of scale, PW and <b>Arthur</b> <b>Andersen</b> discussed a merger in 1989 but the negotiations failed mainly because of conflicts of interest such as Andersen's strong commercial links with IBM and PW's audit of IBM as well as the radically different cultures of the two firms.
