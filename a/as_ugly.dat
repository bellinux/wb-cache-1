5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a long}} history of {{interaction}} with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the former, the species is mostly regarded <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the Physiologus, where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 {{documentary}} America the Beautiful explores how {{the fashion}} and beauty industries {{are contributing to}} the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses {{a wide range of}} topics like plastic surgery, dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young middle-school aged girls were portrayed {{in the beginning of the}} film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> increase, the number of body image issues also increase.|$|E

25|$|During her marriage, Mary {{became known}} for her {{literary}} endeavours and also for her performances in several masques. In 1605 she danced at the Whitehall Banqueting House in The Masque of Blackness, which was designed by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones. Mary Wroth joined the Queen and her friends in the production; all of whom painted their skin black to portray Ethiopian nymphs who called themselves the 'twelve daughters of Niger'. The masque was very successful {{and was the first}} in a long series of similar court entertainments. The ‘twelve daughters of Niger’ also appeared in The Masque of Beauty in 1608, also designed by Jonson and Jones. However, despite the success there were some less than favorable reviews, some referring to the women's portrayal of the daughters of Niger <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> and unconvincing.|$|E

25|$|In British 00 scale (similar to H0 scale) models the 'tension lock' coupler {{developed}} by Tri-ang is standard. This {{is similar in}} operation to the meatchopper type of coupling. Remote uncoupling is possible by using a sprung ramp between the rails. The design of the hooks is such that the couplings will not uncouple when under tension (instead depressing the ramp). When the train is pushed over the ramp, it will lift the coupling hooks as the train passes over. By halting the train over the ramp, it is split at this point. While it works well, it is often seen <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> and obtrusive (although smaller designs are available, these are not always fully compatible with other models) and many British modellers prefer to retrofit either Kadee types or working hook and chain couplings.|$|E
500|$|Like {{several other}} Miyazaki films, Howl's Moving Castle {{reflects}} the director's love of flying. Sequences {{in the film}} include both several aircraft of inventive design, as well as Howl transforming into a bird. Miyazaki examines flight as a theme most directly in the later film The Wind Rises. Miyazaki stated that he was attracted to military aircraft as a child, but that he grew to detest them because of the destructive purpose {{for which they are}} created. Thus Howl's Moving Castle contains images both of aircraft shown as harmless, and large military craft depicted <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> and destructive. Cavallaro writes that Miyazaki wants to [...] "portray flight as an object of admiration and awe," [...] but that he is not [...] " [...] to its abuse by unscrupulous strategists and rulers." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{encouragement}} to keep Indigenous languages alive {{was present in}} some schools, a key tactic used to assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian society was to suppress Indigenous languages and culture. Many students spoke the language of their families fluently when they first entered residential schools. Teachers responded by strictly prohibiting {{the use of these}} languages despite many students having little or no understanding of English or French. The practice of traditional and spiritual activities including the Potlatch and Sun Dance were also banned. Some survivors reported being strapped or forced to eat soap when they were caught speaking their own language. [...] The inability to communicate was further affected by their families' inabilities to speak English or French. Upon leaving residential school some survivors felt ashamed for being Indigenous as they were made to view their traditional identities <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> and dirty.|$|E

Daniel Licht {{who has worked on}} the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for the episode. After the previous episode [...] "Letting Go" [...] aired on Sunday April 3, the normal timeslot of a Tuesday was resumed for this episode. Actor Tony Plana (best known for his role in Ugly Betty, Resurrection Blvd and more recently Desperate Housewives) guest starred in the episode as Armando Rosas. Yaya DaCosta, runner up of America's Next Top Model, Cycle 3 appeared as Holly Bennett and Tobias Segal starred as Sean Wilcox. Playing more minor roles were; Edoardo Ballerini as Jeremy Nicholls, Zach McGowan as Vincent Stone and Charise Castro Smith as this episode's victim, Elena Rosas. This episode was originally meant to mark the first appearance of Joan Hunt (Joanna Cassidy), Megan's mother, however for unknown reasons, her debut episode was changed to the sixth episode of the first season, [...] "Society Hill".|$|E
500|$|While South Carolina {{was known}} for legendary hard-knuckled {{political}} consultant Lee Atwater and rough elections, this had been more: Michael Graham, a native writer, radio host, and political operative, would say [...] "I have worked on hundreds of campaigns in South Carolina, and I've never seen anything <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> as that campaign." [...] In subsequent years there would be persistent accounts trying to tie the anti-McCain smears {{to high levels of}} the Bush campaign: the 2003 book [...] would use it to build up their [...] "evil genius" [...] depiction of Bush chief strategist Karl Rove, while a 2008 PBS NOW program showed a local political consultant stating that Warren Tompkins, a Lee Atwater protégé and then Bush chief strategist for the state, was responsible. In contrast, in 2004 National Reviews Byron York would try to debunk many of the South Carolina smear reports as unfounded legend. [...] McCain's campaign manager said in 2004 they never found out where the smear attacks came from, while McCain himself never doubted their existence.|$|E
500|$|The breeds of toy spaniel often rivalled the Pug in {{popularity}} as lapdogs for ladies. The disadvantage of the breeds of toy spaniel was that their long coats required constant grooming. By 1830, the toy spaniel had changed somewhat from the dogs of Charles II's day. William Youatt in his 1845 study, The Dog, was not enamoured of the changes: [...] "The King Charles's breed {{of the present}} day is materially altered for the worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> and prominent as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its former size, and has an expression of stupidity with which {{the character of the}} dog too accurately corresponds." [...] Youatt did concede that the breed's long ears, coat and colouring were attractive. Due to the fashion of the period, the toy spaniels were crossed with Pugs {{to reduce the size of}} their noses and then selectively bred to reduce it further. By doing this, the dog's sense of smell was impaired, and according to 19th century writers, this caused the varieties of toy spaniel to be removed from participation in field sports. Blunt-Lytton proposed that the red and white Blenheim Spaniels always had the shorter nose now seen in the modern King Charles.|$|E

50|$|Early on, the {{representation}} of Aesop <b>as</b> an <b>ugly</b> slave emerged. The later tradition which makes Aesop a black African resulted in depictions ranging from 17th-century engravings to a television portrayal by a black comedian. In general, beginning in the 20th century, plays have shown Aesop as a slave, but not ugly, while movies and television shows (such as The Bullwinkle Show) have depicted him <b>as</b> neither <b>ugly</b> nor a slave.|$|R

500|$|Many reviewers {{commented on}} the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, [...] "Eminem's music {{contains}} more than {{its fair share of}} misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing [...] "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that [...] "the wife-killing jokes of [...] "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is [...] "sophomoric and uninspired" [...] at times, Eminem's [...] "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least {{a breath of fresh air}} in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas." [...] Mike Rubin of Spin noted that [...] "his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> as they actually are." [...] Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that [...] "Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Instead, he argues, this {{development}} has been artificially frozen in an [...] "intermediate" [...] state by the standardisation of Dutch pronunciation in the 16th century, where lowered diphthongs found in rural dialects were perceived <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> by the educated classes and accordingly declared substandard. Now, however, in his opinion, the newly affluent and independent women can afford to let that natural development take place in their speech.

2500|$|In {{her second}} volume of visionary theology, {{composed}} between 1158 and 1163, {{after she had}} moved her community of nuns into independence at the Rupertsberg in Bingen, Hildegard tackled the moral life {{in the form of}} dramatic confrontations between the virtues and the vices. She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, Ordo Virtutum, and the [...] "Book of the Rewards of Life" [...] takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted <b>as</b> <b>ugly</b> and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in our defense, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.|$|E

Huysmans wrote: [...] "The terrible reality of this statuette evidently produces uneasiness in the spectators; all their notions about sculpture, about those cold inanimate whitenesses ... are here overturned. The fact is that with his first attempt Monsieur Degas has revolutionized the traditions of sculpture as he has long since shaken the conventions of painting." ...|$|E
