5|$|Casting {{the role}} of Dimitri gave All My Children difficulty. The series' casting director, Judy Blye Wilson, tested between fifteen and twenty actors, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find the right actor for the job. Wilson then learned that the former Dynasty star, Michael Nader was {{available}} and suggested the show offer him the part.|$|E
5|$|In December 1939, Centaur {{underwent}} a minor refit in Hong Kong, with a supercharger {{and a new}} propeller fitted to the engine. The supercharger broke down in April 1942, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be repaired because of equipment shortages and restricted dockyard access caused by World War II.|$|E

50|$|The {{registration}} {{rules were}} somewhat restrictive; for instance government employees <b>and</b> non-government employees <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{belong to the}} same union or even to unions affiliated with each other, <b>and</b> union funds <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be used for political purposes. Under these rules the GLU's were un-registerable <b>and</b> therefore <b>could</b> <b>not</b> operate legally.|$|R
60|$|THE {{year that}} {{followed}} was the saddest Christie had ever known, for she suffered {{a sort of}} poverty which {{is more difficult to}} bear than actual want, since money cannot lighten it, and the rarest charity alone can minister to it. Her heart was empty <b>and</b> she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> fill it; her soul was hungry <b>and</b> she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> feed it; life was cold and dark <b>and</b> she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> warm <b>and</b> brighten it, for she knew not where to go.|$|R

On September 24, Armstrong signed with Astana.|$|E
5|$|Troops of the KAR {{launched}} a tentative attack on Mbombwe on 25 January but the engagement proved inconclusive.

5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> change its course.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E

5|$|After {{considering}} the changed circumstances, the Archbishop of Goa, by a provision issued on 20 February 1795, appointed Minguel José Louis Mendes interim vicar {{of the four}} sub-districts of Mangalore, Barcoor, Onore and Moolki. Some other priests also came to Canara with the new vicar. Those from Goa retained their old prejudices <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> accept the rule of Tipu, openly advocating rebellion against him, writing offensive letters and making offensive speeches. As a result, in 1797, the brief repite enjoyed by the Christians ceased and their persecution recommenced.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} as Hershey's {{assistant}} coach, Mann accepted a job as head coach of ECHL's Bakersfield Condors on June 21. Mann had reinterviewed for his position with the Bears and felt it went well, but said he faced a deadline to accept the Bakersfield job <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> turn it down. Ryan Mougenel was signed as Mann's replacement on July 5. He had previously worked with Haviland, when Mougenel was alternate captain on and Haviland was {{head coach of the}} ECHL's Atlantic City Boardwalk Bullies in 2002–03, the year the team won the Kelly Cup.|$|E
5|$|After his acclamation, Maximian was {{dispatched}} {{to fight the}} rebel Bagaudae, insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly. By 2 November, he had only reached Civitas Iovia (Botivo, near Ptuj, Slovenia). In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of Sarmatians who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover their lost lands or grant them pasturage rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, {{but was unable to}} secure a complete victory. The nomadic pressures of the European Plain remained <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be solved by a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have to be fought again.|$|E

5|$|After the riots, Bishop Kenrick {{ended his}} efforts to {{influence}} the public education system and began encouraging the creation of Catholic schools, with 17 being founded by 1860. The friars of the Church of St. Augustine sued the city of Philadelphia for not providing the church with adequate protection, claiming $80,000 in damages. The city argued that the friars could not claim their civil rights were violated, as the Order of St. Augustine was a foreign organization under the Pope. Furthermore, the city argued that the friars took a vow of poverty <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be property owners. The Augustinians ended up proving the Order was incorporated in 1804 and was awarded $45,000. The church was rebuilt in 1848.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E

5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German {{authorities}} {{had intended to}} put the 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> and would not participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason {{thought he would be}} shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E
5|$|At 11:45, Armide {{surrendered}} to Centaur, followed 15 minutes later by Minerve. Both ships had suffered heavy damage and {{casualties in the}} unequal engagement <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hope to continue their resistance {{with the rest of}} the British squadron rapidly approaching. To the north, Infatigable had failed to outrun Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade. With three ships lost and the other three long disappeared to the south, Soleil determined to flee westwards, hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaurs sails was sufficient to prevent her pursuit. However, Gloire had also been damaged <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars. With his ship undamaged, Lukin was able to easily catch the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14:30, combat continuing for half an hour before Soleil surrendered, his frigate badly damaged. To the south, Windsor Castle had proven far too slow to catch the smaller French ships, which had easily outrun the second rate and escaped.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 6 April, the JNA {{launched}} a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupreška Vrata, leaving {{the bulk of}} the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the force at the plateau. The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks. The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company, which quickly pushed through the defensive positions, bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo. In contrast, the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres was overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> track which units it had at its disposal—even losing track of units physically near the command post.|$|E
