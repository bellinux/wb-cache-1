5|$|By {{calling a}} federal referendum, {{a group of}} {{citizens}} may challenge a law passed by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal law.|$|E
5|$|As well as rugby sevens, {{baseball}} and softball, which were {{dropped from the}} Olympic programme in 2005, karate, squash, golf and roller sports (inline speed skating) were all seeking {{to be included in}} the 2016 games and leaders of the seven sports made formal presentations to the IOC executive board in June 2009. A new system was in place at this session in which a sport now needs only <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rather than the two-thirds majority that was required before.|$|E
50|$|The last Dáil with <b>a</b> single-party <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> {{government}} was in 1977. Minority governments {{have been relatively}} common in the short history of the Dáil, making up 14 of the 32 governments (44%) formed since the Dáil was founded.|$|R
40|$|This paper formulates <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} the selection of an optimum "relative unanimity” collective decision rule. The approach is first to identify the benefits of moving from <b>a</b> rule of <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> towards <b>a</b> rule of full unanimity. Then, the costs of moving from <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule towards unanimity are identified. Finally, the issue of an optimal decision rule is mathematically solved. ...|$|R
50|$|The opposition, which {{includes}} Hezbollah, Amal and the Free Patriotic Movement, demanded {{the formation of}} a national unity cabinet and warned that <b>an</b> election by <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> would result in {{the formation of a}} shadow cabinet.|$|R
5|$|In early November, about 50 players renewed {{talks of}} union {{decertification}} if the union went lower than 52.5% of BRI or agreed to additional restrictions on contracts, salary-cap exceptions, or free agency. Decertifying {{would require that}} 30% of the union—about 130 players—sign a petition, allowing an election {{under the auspices of}} the NLRB by all NBPA members to decertify with <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority.</b> The NLRB traditionally does not consider a decertification petition while a charge is pending, such as the NBPA's unfair labor practice charges filed in August.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Polk {{narrowly}} defeated Clay, who opposed annexation. Lame-duck President Tyler organized a joint House–Senate {{vote on the}} Texas treaty which passed, requiring only <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority.</b> he signed a bill of annexation on March 1, With President Polk's support, the Texas annexation treaty {{was approved by the}} Texas Republic in 1845. A bill to admit Texas as the 28th state of the Union was signed by Polk on December 29, 1845.|$|E
5|$|Of the 42,617 Wildrose members {{eligible}} {{to vote on}} July 22, 2017, there was a 57 per cent turnout with 23,466 voters (95%) in favour of the agreement and 1,132 (5%) against, clearing the 75% threshold required by the party's constitution. The Progressive Conservative membership also approved the agreement {{by a margin of}} 95% to 5%. With a turnout of 55% of eligible members, 25,692 PC members voted yes and 1,344 voted no with 24 spoiled ballots; the party's constitution required <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> of its membership to approve the merger.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide an {{analysis}} of the Commission's proposal of so called double <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule (when to pass <b>a</b> decision <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> of Member States {{and at the same time}} <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> of total population has to be reached) for the voting in the Council of Ministers of the EU. In our evaluation we are using an a priori voting power methodology to measure an influence of the Member States before and after extension of the EU. In the closing part of the paper we shortly compare the double <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule to the compromise approved by the 2000 Nice Summit of the EU.

50|$|Article 79 {{states the}} Basic Law may be amended by an {{absolute}} two-thirds {{majority of the}} Bundestag along with <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> two-thirds <b>majority</b> of the Bundesrat. Such a vote may not remove any of the principles underlying articles 1 to 20, {{as defined by the}} eternity clause, but may clarify, extend or refine those principles.|$|R
40|$|We analyze how {{different}} rules for exiting <b>an</b> alliance (<b>simple</b> <b>majority,</b> unanimity or unanimity with side payments) {{will affect the}} formation of strategic alliances. We find that no alliance structure is contractually stable under the <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule. Once unanimous consent is required, asymmetric alliance structures consisting of two alliances are contractually stable. In addition, the grand alliance which is the efficient structure is stable. Allowing for side payments to compensate former partners improves efficiency. Finally, we show that different rules of exit may coexist in different alliances in the long run...|$|R
5|$|Political parties {{gather in}} the National Assembly, which {{consists}} of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly {{has the power to}} enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the Prime Minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements. The president serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto by <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> vote of all members of parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm had mostly {{advisory}} powers, {{although it}} could legislate on some strictly local matters, such as communal self-government and spending of some local taxes. It could opine legal acts {{relevant to the}} Grand Duchy. Its deputies {{had the right to}} file petitions and complaints to the King of Prussia, who could consent or reject (as was often the case) the Sejm proposals. Proposals from and to the King required a two-thirds majority; other proposals required <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bill {{then goes}} through a third reading. At this stage, only {{amendments}} not of a material character may {{be made to the}} bill. The minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill. The bill is then put to the vote. In most cases, <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E
50|$|In July 2008, NRP was one {{of three}} minor parties which opposed an {{amendment}} of the interim constitution, enabling the formation of <b>a</b> government by <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> in the Constituent Assembly.

50|$|On March 8, private emails {{dating back}} to February 28 were released. These emails showed that Governor Walker had tried to {{negotiate}} with Democratic legislators, even proposing to allow some collective bargaining rights. However, after failing to reach a compromise with Democratic legislators, the Republican Senate legislators removed certain fiscal provisions from the bill, allowing it to be passed by <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> senate <b>majority.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{president}} {{has the power to}} declare war, to grant pardon and to conclude agreements of peace, alliance, and participation in international organizations; upon the request of the government <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> parliamentary <b>majority</b> is required to ratify such actions, agreements, or treaties. An absolute or a three-fifths majority is required in exceptional cases (for example, the accession into the EU needed a 3/5 majority).|$|R
5|$|Voting in Singapore is compulsory. Any citizen above 21 {{years of}} age who is not disqualified by the factors in section 6 of the Parliamentary Elections Act is {{required}} to vote in person. There is no constitutional provision stipulating any qualifications for voters, and as the Act is an ordinary piece of legislation the disqualifying factors may be changed by <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> (more than 50%) of votes in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority,</b> but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|Denver has {{a strong}} mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or veto any {{ordinances}} or resolutions approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, {{is responsible for the}} city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. However, the council can override the mayor's veto with a nine out of thirteen member vote, and the city budget must be approved and can be changed by <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} Commission {{could make a}} {{proposal}} {{in a way that}} removed the requirement for a qualified majority. For example, the Anti-Dumping Advisory Committee (ADAC) could approve a proposal to impose tariffs based on <b>a</b> <b>simple,</b> unweighted <b>majority,</b> but overturning it would have required a qualified majority because this meant voting against a Commission proposal. This greatly increased the power of small member states in such circumstances.|$|R
50|$|Each town sent {{a number}} of delegates equal {{to the number of}} representatives held in the Assembly. The {{convention}} convened in Hartford on August 26, 1818. As one of the first orders of business, a twenty-four man committee was appointed to prepare a draft constitution. The very next day, the committee returned with the Preamble and Bill of Rights. Their speed was not due to ingenuity. The draft was borrowed almost verbatim from the constitution that Mississippi had created a year earlier in 1817. After the remainder of the constitution was drafted, the convention approved the document by a two-to-one margin on September 16, 1818. The voters were given three weeks to consider the proposed constitution. A vote was held on October 5. A small majority cast their ballots in favor of the constitution, with the resolution passing 13,918 to 12,364. The ultimate vote proved the importance of requiring only <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority’s</b> approval, for <b>a</b> sixty or eighty percent requirement would not have been met.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose {{minority}} voting as a scheme that can partially protect individuals from the risk of repeated exploitation. We consider a committee that meets twice to decide about projects including a first-period project that may have long-lasting impact. In the first period, <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> open <b>majority</b> voting scheme takes place. Voting splits the committee into three groups: voting winners, voting losers, and absentees. Under minority voting, only voting losers retain their voting rights in the second period. We show {{that as soon as}} absolute risk aversion exceeds a threshold value, minority voting is superior to repeated application of the <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule.

5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Singapore {{is defined}} by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore to mean the Executive branch of government, which is made up of the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. Although the President acts in her {{personal}} discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, her role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, that generally directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> in each general election.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm had {{the right}} to vote on civil, {{administrative}} and legal issues; <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> was required to pass laws. With permission from the king, it could vote on matters related to the fiscal system and the military. It {{had the right}} to control government officials, and could prepare reviews and reports on them to present to the king. It had legislative competences in court and administrative law. It could issue laws on currency, taxation and budget, deal with issues related to military conscription (such as its size), and amend the constitution. It had no legislative initiative, as that belong only to the king; however, the Sejm could issue petitions to the monarch with proposed legislation.|$|E
50|$|Each year a {{convention}} is attended {{by all the}} pastors within the denomination. It is during this convention that all matters concerning the denomination are voted upon. <b>A</b> <b>simple</b> two-thirds <b>majority</b> decides any decisions upon the voting table. Every fourth convention, a vote is cast for who will serve as President and Vice-President of the denomination for the next term, as well as District Superintendents. There are no limit {{to the amount of}} terms that may be served.|$|R
25|$|Rather than {{voting for}} one {{candidate}} by marking an “x” on their ballots, electors would rank their {{choices for the}} candidates running in their constituency by placing numbers next to {{the names of the}} candidates on the ballot. If a candidate received <b>an</b> absolute <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> of votes, that candidate would be elected. If not, the candidate with the least number of votes was dropped and the second choices were allocated among the remaining candidates. This procedure would be repeated until a candidate received a majority of votes.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} conference can make decisions if {{at least half}} of the voters are present. For the elections of the steering committee and the executive board, <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> casting of <b>majority</b> vote is sufficient for the decision. For amendments to the statutes a two-thirds majority is required.|$|R
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{military}} tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles, who believed that a civil court should have presided; but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force {{at the time in}} the District of Columbia. (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan, the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) Only <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, {{the governor is}} still much weaker than those of other states. He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are {{under the control of the}} cabinet.|$|E
5|$|During the state's early history, vetoes were seldom {{employed}} by governors primarily {{because they were}} seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>majority.</b> Governor James Whitcomb {{was the first to}} make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session. Roger Branigin, who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly. Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden. Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the recent}} proposals, {{submitted}} by the President of the European Commission Romano Prodi in January 2000, addresses the voting rule reform in the Council of Ministers of the EU.
