40|$|The work {{describes}} a {{comparative study of}} aerodynamic characteristics of an aircraft wing model with and without surface modifications to it. The surface modifications that are considered here are outward dimples on the wing model. In the present study, results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis are presented showing variance in lift and drag of modified wing models at different angle of attacks. Dimples on the surface aircraft wing model doesn‟t affect much the pressure drag since it‟s already aerodynamic in shape but it can affect the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stall.</b> This project verifies if the dimples that reduce a golf ball's drag, can also increase an airplane's critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stall.</b> Dimples delay the boundary layer separation by creating more turbulence over the surface. The airfoil profile considered here is NACA- 0018 with uniform cross-section throughout the length of airfoil. Subsonic flows are considered for the study. The CAD model is prepared in CatiaV 5 R 18 and simulations are carried out in Comsol 3. 4 and Comsol 4. 0. The overall aim {{of the study is}} improved maneuverability and performance of an aircraft. The results justify the increase in the overall lift and reduction in drag of the aircraft, also change of stall angle with different surface modifications on the wing model is observed...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of a new wing for the ECO 1 general aviation aircraft.   A new wing for this aircraft is hoped to provide better high-lift performance and a higher maximum angle of attack.   To this end, using computational fluid dynamics with the SST k-ω turbulence model, this study explores modifying the wing profile and augmenting the wings with winglets, a feature not commonly used in general aviation.   Using the CFD tool Fluent, two-dimensional simulations on variations of the Osquavia aerofoil indicate that both the slimmer and the elongated variants will provide for a greater maximum coefficient of lift and a higher stall angle.   The three-dimensional CFD analysis predict that the winglets will decrease the overall drag in high lift-coefficient flight conditions without greatly penalising performance in the cruise condition.   The addition of winglets are also shown to provide a higher <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> and improve flow across the control surfaces at high angles of attack...|$|E

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{analysis on}} the DLR-F 11 high lift configuration model has been performed on the supercomputing grid infrastructure SCoPE of the University of Naples ???Federico II???. The model geometry is representative of a wide-body commercial aircraft, which experimental investigations at high Reynolds number have been performed at the European Transonic Wind-tunnel (ETW) for the 2 nd AIAA High Lift Prediction Workshop. The commercial CAE package Star-CCM+ {{has been used to}} solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Inviscid, viscous incompressible, and compressible analyses have been performed with mesh refinement. The inviscid calculations have been used to assess how far is the eulerian prediction from experimental data. Viscous and compressible calculations have been realized using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model at 0. 175 Mach number and 15. 1 million Reynolds number. Results show that the simple Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model can predict quite accurately the stall and post-stall behaviour, getting the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> and underestimating the maximum lift coefficient by less than 5 %.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{change in}} aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil by applying certain surface modifications {{in form of}} dimples [1]. At first surface modification that is considered here is hexagonal dimples on the wing model. A comparative study showing variance in lift and drag of modified airfoil model at different angle of attacks is done. The surface modification which is being considered in the given study are dimples of hexagonal shapes. Till now these have been ignored because dimples help in reduction of pressure drag. In case of aerodynamic bodies pressure drag is very little compared to bluff bodies. An airfoil is an aerodynamic body so dimples do not affect to its drag much at zero angle of attack, {{but as soon as}} airfoil attains some angle of attack, wake formation starts due to boundary layer separation. Application dimples on aircraft wing model works in same manner as vortex generators. They create turbulence which delays the boundary layer separation and reduces the wake and thereby reducing the pressure drag. This also assists in Lift of the aircraft. Most importantly this can be quite effective at different the angle of attacks and also can change <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stall</b> to a great extent. A stall is a condition in aerodynamics and aviation where the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point such that the lift begins to decrease [2]. The angle at which it occurs is called the critical angle of attack or <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stall.</b> The results were in agreement that dimples on the surface aircraft wing model does not affect the pressure drag much since it is already aerodynamic in shape but it can affect its aerodynamics when the airfoil is at different angle of attacks. This project verifies if the dimples that reduce a golf ball's drag, can also alter flow dynamics around airfoil for better aerodynamic efficiency. Dimples delay the boundary layer separation by creating more turbulence over the surface thus reducing the wake formation. This in turn reduces drag drastically [2]. The airfoil profile considered in the present study is NACA- 4415 with uniform cross-section throughout the length of airfoil. Subsonic flows are considered for the study. For design purpose solid works software is used. Two different models without dimples and with hexagonal dimples has been constructed. All the models are prepared by wood and the experiments are conducted using 100 × 100 × 100 cm subsonic wind tunnel. From the experimental investigations it has been observed that the flow separation on the airfoil can be delayed by using hexagonal dimples on the upper surface. Flow separation occurs at 12 ° angle of attack in the regular surface. But for surface having hexagonal dimples it occurs at 16 ° angle of attack. That indicates the surface having hexagonal dimples successfully controls the flow separation and increases the lift force of an airfoil...|$|E

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} {{currently}} the fastest-growing renewable source of energy in India; India is a key market for the wind industry, presenting substantial opportunities for both the international and domestic players.

40|$|The {{streamline}} blade has {{advantages of}} not only the pressure drop but the aerodynamic noise since the flow attaches to the blade surface. However, the flow has a relatively large deviation angle to the blade even if the fan is driven at the vicinity of maximum efficiency point. On such a case, the broadband noise becomes {{a major issue in}} the aerodynamic noise. The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify the influence of the separated flow of a streamline blade on the broadband noise with sufficiently large angle of attack than <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>stall.</b> The influence of blade thickness and angle of attack on the noise was experimented by the wind tunnel with NACA series blade. The broadband noise relates to the following overall noise characteristics; the noise level of NACA 0008 is larger than the NACA 0018 in the vicinity of angle of attack 10 °, the noise level of NACA 0008 from 10 °to 20 ° decreases and the level of NACA 0008 from 20 °to 40 ° increases. In the vicinity of angle of attack 10 °, the sound source of the broadband noise is influenced by the frequency of vortex shedding. The flow in the angle of attack 20 ° separated from leading edge of the blade. The velocity fluctuation in velocity shear layer in rear side is smaller than the velocity fluctuation at the separation point of the angle of attack 10 °. The velocity fluctuation formed in the wake of NACA 0008 in angle of attack 40 ° is larger than that of 20 °. In the case of angle of attack 40 °, the velocity fluctuation of the shear layer by the convection velocity of vortex street increased due to increase of the shear stress in the wake...|$|E
