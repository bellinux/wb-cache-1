5|$|The {{author of}} the Bhikshuka Upanishad is unknown, as is its date of composition. It was {{probably}} composed in the late medieval to modern era, most likely in the 14th or 15th century. The text has ancient roots, as its contents are identical in key details to chapter 4 of the Ashrama Upanishad, which is dated to about the 3rd century CE. Both texts mention four types of mendicants with nearly identical life styles. The two texts have a few minor differences. The much older Ashrama Upanishad, for example, mentions that each type <b>aspires</b> <b>to</b> know their self (Atman) for liberation, while the Bhikshuka specifies that they seek this liberation through a yogic path.|$|E
