5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> only for short periods of the year.|$|E
5|$|Despite the ROM citing lowered {{attendance}} figures, {{proponents of}} the planetarium have alleged that the Conservative Ontario provincial government of the time, led by Mike Harris, was looking for an instant <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> $600,000 cut to the ROM's operating budget. No succeeding provincial government has shown an interest in reversing this decision.|$|E

In Britain, the BBFC {{requested}} cuts to stabbing sounds <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.|$|E

5|$|Quasars (/ˈkweɪzɑr/) or quasi-stellar radio {{sources are}} the most {{energetic}} and distant members of a class of objects called active galactic nuclei (AGN). Quasars are extremely luminous and were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy, including radio waves <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> light, {{that appeared to be}} similar to stars, rather than extended sources similar to galaxies. Their luminosity can be 100 times greater than that of the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|The five {{brightest}} stars are all reddish in hue. Shading the others at apparent magnitude 3.8 is Alpha Apodis, an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the luminosity of the Sun. Marginally fainter is Gamma Apodis, another ageing giant star. Delta Apodis {{is a double}} star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> with the naked eye. Two star systems {{have been found to}} have planets.|$|E
5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous {{cell carcinoma}}, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to all clear cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H stained <b>and</b> <b>visible,</b> distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.|$|E
5|$|Close to Gamma Corvi <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> in {{the same}} {{binocular}} field is R Corvi, a long period (Mira) variable star. It ranges in brightness from a magnitude of 6.7 to 14.4 with a period of approximately 317 days. TT Corvi is a semiregular variable red giant of spectral type M3III and apparent magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant. It is around 993 times as luminous as the Sun. TU Corvi is a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars {{that have been used}} as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. It varies by 0.025 of a magnitude around apparent magnitude 6.53 over 59 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Disrupted by {{mountains}} once again, Gustav never regained {{its former}} strength. Briefly traveling over a warm eddy of the Gulf Stream's loop current it encountered moderate wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures. Fluctuations in its internal structure <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> appearance did not counter the storm's general weakening trend, and Hurricane Gustav made its final landfall as a Category2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana on September 1. Moving inland, the storm quickly weakened but persisted {{as a significant}} tropical depression until it was adsorbed by a frontal boundary on September 5.|$|E

5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian and gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockett– who may be based on Noël Coward– she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E
5|$|Many {{immigrants}} have established themselves in Brabrand, Hasle and Viby, where {{the percentage of}} inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000. This has resulted in several 'especially vulnerable residential areas' (a.k.a. ghettos), with Gellerup as the most notable neighbourhood. In Brabrand and Gellerup, two-thirds of the population now have a non-Danish ethnic background. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> part of the city's daily life and contribute many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including Bazar Vest, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E

5|$|RAF Handforth was a {{large and}} {{important}} storage facility that contributed directly to the war effort. The site stretched from the centre of Handforth village, through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford. The industrial estate Adlington Park in Woodford/Poynton was a dispersed site of RAF Handforth. Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged, but its villagers knew {{the extent of the}} war, mainly due to the large <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> presence of the RAF and could hear the sounds of air-raids on Manchester.|$|E
5|$|The Cottingley Fairies {{appear in}} a series of five {{photographs}} taken by Elsie Wright (1901–88) and Frances Griffiths (1907–86), two young cousins who lived in Cottingley, near Bradford in England. In 1917, when the first two photographs were taken, Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9. The pictures {{came to the attention of}} writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who used them to illustrate an article on fairies he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of The Strand Magazine. Doyle, as a spiritualist, was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear <b>and</b> <b>visible</b> evidence of psychic phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, but others believed they had been faked.|$|E
5|$|The MCU Park, home park of the Brooklyn Cyclones, {{is located}} {{slightly}} to the west.
