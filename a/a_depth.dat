5|$|The June 2011 Christchurch {{earthquake}} was {{a shallow}} magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake that occurred on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST (02:20 UTC).

5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded at <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E

5|$|When powdery, snow drifts {{with the}} wind from the {{location}} where it originally fell, forming deposits with <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of several meters in isolated locations.

5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} {{framework for}} analyzing games with incomplete information models players {{as if they}} have <b>an</b> infinite <b>depth</b> of reasoning, which is not always consistent with experimental evidence. This paper generalizes the type spaces of Harsanyi (1967 - 1968) so that players can have <b>a</b> finite <b>depth</b> of reasoning. We do this restricting the set of events that a player of <b>a</b> finite <b>depth</b> can reason about. This approach allows us to extend the Bayesian-Nash equilibrium concept to environments with players with <b>a</b> finite <b>depth</b> of reasoning. We demonstrate that the standard approach of modeling beliefs with Harsanyi type spaces fails to capture the equilibrium behavior of players with <b>a</b> finite <b>depth,</b> at least in some games. Consequently, the standard approach cannot be used to describe the equilibrium behavior of players with <b>a</b> finite <b>depth</b> in general...|$|R

5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent.

The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical cyclone, Charley brought heavy {{rainfall}} and strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom, causing at least 11deaths. In Ireland, the rainfall set records for 24-hour totals, including {{an accumulation of}} more than 7.8in (200mm) which set {{the record for the}} greatest daily rainfall total in the country. In the country, the rainfall caused widespread flooding, causing two rivers to exceed their banks. In the Dublin area, 451buildings were flooded, some up to <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 8ft (2.4m). In the United Kingdom, the storm flooded rivers and brought down trees and power lines.|$|E
5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
