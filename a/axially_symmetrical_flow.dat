40|$|The {{present report}} {{concerns}} {{a method of}} computing the velocity and pressure distributions on bodies of revolution in <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> <b>flow</b> in the subsonic range. The differential equation for the velocity potential Phi of a compressible fluid motion is linearized tn the conventional manner, and then put in the form Delta(Phi) = 0 by affine transformation. The quantity Phi represents the velocity potential of a fictitious incompressible flow, for which a constant superposition of sources by sections is secured by a method patterned after von Karman which must comply with the boundary condition delta(phi) /delta(n) = 0 at the originally specified contour. This requirement yields for the "pseudo-stream function" psi a differential equation which must be fulfilled for as many points on the contour as source lengths are assumed. In this manner, the problem of defining the still unknown source intensities is reduced to the solution of an inhomogeneous equation system. The pressure distribution is then determined {{with the aid of}} Bernoulli's equation and adiabatic equation of state. Lastly, the pressure distributions in compressible and incompressible medium are compared on a model problem...|$|E
40|$|Context. The {{presence}} of the moat flow around sunspots is intimately linked to the mere existence of sunspots. Aims. We characterize the moat flow (MF) and Evershed flow (EF) in sunspots to enhance our knowledge of sunspot structures and photospheric flow properties. Methods. We calibrated HMI synoptic Doppler maps and used them to analyze 3 h time averages of 31 circular, stable, and fully developed sunspots at heliocentric angles of some 50 ^∘. Assuming <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> <b>flow</b> fields, we infer the azimuthally averaged horizontal velocity component of the MF and EF from 51 velocity maps. We studied the MF properties (velocity and extension) and elaborate on how these components depend on sunspot parameters (sunspot size and EF velocity). To explore the weekly and monthly evolution of MFs, we compare spots rotating from the eastern to western limbs and spots that reappear on the eastern limb. Results. Our calibration procedure of HMI Doppler maps yields reliable and consistent results. In 3 h averages, we find the MF decreases on average from some 1000 ± 200 m/s just outside the spot boundary to 500 m/s after an additional 4 Mm. The average MF extension lies at 9. 2 ± 5 Mm, where the velocity drops below some 180 m/s. Neither the MF velocity nor its extension depend significantly on the sunspot size or EF velocity. But, the EF velocity does show {{a tendency to be}} enhanced with sunspot size. On a time scale of a week and a month, we find decreasing MF extensions and a tendency for the MF velocity to increase for strongly decaying sunspots, whereas the changing EF velocity has no impact on the MF. Conclusions. On 3 h averages, the EF velocity scales with the size of sunspots, while the MF properties show no significant correlation with the EF or with the sunspot size. This we interpret as a hint that the physical origins of EF and MF are distinct. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, 1 table; appendix: 3 pages, 2 figures, 1 table; accepted by A&...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{procedure}} {{to calculate the}} spatial fiber length in discontinuously reinforced composites from data of conventional metallographical images is developed. The method {{is based on the}} following three assumptions: first, the measured length of a reinforcing fiber in a metallographical picture is a projection of the actual fiber length; second, the alignment of short fibers is <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> (for example, extruded composites in which the extrusion direction is a symmetry axis for the orientation of reinforcing fibers); third, for a representative number of fibers, the dependence of the projected length with the corresponding projected angle, along a given sample direction, is known. Either analytical or numerical solution can be found depending on the specific dependence of the projected length with the projected angle. This procedure has been applied to real 6061 Al- 15 vol%SiCw composites obtained by a powder metallurgical route in which the final step for materials consolidation was extrusion of powder blends at different temperatures.

40|$|In the {{traditional}} metal forming product development paradigm, product design is generally based on heuristic know-how and experience, which are basically acquired through {{many years of}} practice. This kind of product design paradigm is of more trial-and-error than in-depth scientific calculation and analysis. Product defect prediction and quality assurance is, thus, a nontrivial issue in this product development paradigm. With the aid of finite element (FE) simulation, deformation-related defects can be predicted and analyzed. In this paper, flow-induced folding defect in forging of <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> flanged components is systematically investigated. A FE model to study the root-cause of the defect based on the material flow behavior is developed and a defect formation mechanism is revealed. The variation of material flow behavior with the changes of part geometry parameters is investigated extensively. Based on the simulation results, the parameter variation characteristics and the sensitivity of each parameter to folding defect avoidance are identified. Using industrial components as case studies, {{the efficiency of the}} proposed defect avoidance approach is verified. The approach is further proven to be able to provide practical guidelines for the design of defect-free <b>axially</b> <b>symmetrical</b> flanged components.
