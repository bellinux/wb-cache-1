5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} <b>are</b> <b>recognized,</b> {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas.

Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E

5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia.

In this classification 324 families <b>are</b> <b>recognized</b> as valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, with or without a fossil record.
