25|$|Along with Bob Simpson, {{he formed}} an opening {{partnership}} that {{was regarded as}} one of the finest in Test history. Lawry was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Lawry was known for his peculiar stance. He had little bend in his knees, and as a result batted with a stoop over his bat. He used his long reach to blunt spin bowling. He played with a very straight bat, combining well-organised defence with a somewhat limited range of strokes, marked by an efficiency of placement and an unusually heavy reliance on the hook shot. His strengths were regarded as his composure and intense concentration which powered a relentless single-mindedness. His defiant style was accentuated by his habit of tugging on his cap after every ball, as though starting afresh. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be got out <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room'. Lawry was also a left-hander during his winter baseball recreation, which equipped him with a powerful throwing arm.|$|E

Anarchy? Someone has to be responsible." [...] Prior to the 2005 general election, Gallagher stated that he was still supporting the Labour government partly because of his concern that [...] "Phil Collins is threatening to come back and live here.

[...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E

The track was originally considered {{to be part of the}} re-release edition of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna.

Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have." ...|$|E

2500|$|On paper Australia had a sound batting line up; Bill Lawry (47.15), Ian Redpath (43.45), Keith Stackpole (37.42), Doug Walters (48.26), Ian Chappell (42.42), Greg Chappell (53.86), wicket-keeper Rod Marsh (26.51) and all-rounder Kerry O'Keeffe (25.76). None {{of these}} {{failed in the}} series, but the state batsmen who were called up {{to fill in the}} gaps were not capable of facing the English bowling attack. Although they batted out a draw in four of the Tests they {{collapsed}} twice in the second innings of the Sydney Tests, the only wicket that did not favour the bat. Bill Lawry was a dour left-handed opening batsman with tremendous concentration who was once unfairly described as [...] "a corpse with pads on". He failed to make a century, but still made 324 runs (40.50) and carried his bat through the Australian debacle at Sydney. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be got out <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room'. Keith Stackpole was a heavily built opening batsman perfectly capable of hitting the ball round the ground, he made 627 runs (52.25) and two centuries in the series, but had the benefit of five [...] "lives" [...] from the umpires. Ian Redpath was another opening batsman, but tall and ungainly, making 497 safe runs (49.70) at his own slow pace, [...] "I liked bowling to him least of all" [...] Snow wrote, [...] "a real nuisance batsman". Greg Chappell said he was one of only two players he knew who would kill to get into the Australian Test team. The other was wicket-keeper Rod Marsh who was chosen for his batting skills rather than his glovemanship. Despite being right-handed in everything else he batted left-handed and was a very powerful hitter of the ball. The entertaining Doug Walters made 205 not out for New South Wales against the tourists and 112 in the First Test, but had developed a distaste for fast bowling in South Africa and John Snow took advantage of his cavalier play by feeding him short balls on the off-stump with a pair of gully fielders. Ian Chappell would later say [...] "three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me"., as a result of working on his hook shot after his encounters with John Snow, but he still made 452 runs (37.66) and two fighting centuries in the series. His younger brother Greg would be regarded as the best Australian batsmen for decades, but in this series was limited to leg-side play and could not hope to match his famous maiden Test century in the later games.|$|E
