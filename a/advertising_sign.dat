5|$|It is a {{piece of}} public art, an <b>advertising</b> <b>sign,</b> a retail kiosk selling {{newspapers}} and hot food, as well as a bus shelter. It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship, although it is meant to symbolise man's harmony with the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council's ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare's public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village.|$|E
5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an <b>advertising</b> <b>sign,</b> as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{roadside}} advertising {{has become a major}} and rapidly expanding industry. Until the last decade, the extent of roadside <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> along rural roads has been strongly restricted in Scandinavian countries, mostly for safety reasons and aesthetic considerations. But growing pressure on road authorities caused by significant financial interests has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> along rural roads. The signs are placed at roadsides with the purpose of capturing and keeping driver attention. When the driver’s attention is captured, resulting in long eye glances in large horizontal angles away from the road, the time available for driver’s response to avoid a crash if something unexpected occurs is reduced. In this perspective, it is relevant to ask whether roadside <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> influence driver attention {{to such an extent that}} it affects road safety. With the purpose of investigating, if and how, roadside <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> affect road safety a literature study followed by empirical studies has been carried out. The empirical studies were made by using an instrumented car equipped with a camera system to track eye movements, GPS for registration of speed behaviour, and laser scanner for measurement of distances to other road users. Registration data verifies whether the driver is looking at the <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> and the number of glances, - including glance duration and glance angles. Those measurements are related to driving speed and distances to other road users and thereby critical situations are detected. The overall results of the empirical studies show that <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> do affect driver attention to the extent that road safety is compromised...|$|R

As such, all <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> are rateable either as separate tenements or by adding their value to the “host” tenements at which they are situated.|$|R

2500|$|Emma Koehler {{vowed not to}} let {{the brewery}} go under. [...] In late 1919, the San Antonio Brewing Association changed its name to Alamo Industries (1919–1921) and began {{operations}} to comply with Prohibition laws. [...] Times were tough for the brewery and its employees, but the facility stayed open by continuing to produce a near beer called [...] "La Perla", bottling soft drinks, dry cleaning, operating a small <b>advertising</b> <b>sign</b> division, running a small auto repair shop, and entering the commercial ice and creamery businesses. [...] Being so diverse brought in cash for the company, but it also meant Alamo Industries was not particularly good in any one area. [...] As a result, Alamo Industries reorganized their product lines. [...] The company changed its name to the Alamo Foods Company (1921–1933) and shifted products toward the food specialty. [...] The sections for auto repair, dry cleaning, and advertising were closed or sold off to third parties.|$|E

60|$|Uncle John {{had secured}} {{considerable}} information from Mr. Watson, and this {{enabled him to}} act comprehensively. The <b>advertising</b> <b>sign</b> business {{in this part of}} the state was controlled by two firms, who contracted directly with the advertisers and then had the signs painted upon spaces secured from the farmers by their wide-awake agents. These signs were contracted for by the year, but the firms controlling the spaces always inserted protective clauses that provided for the removal of any sign when certain conditions required such removal. In such cases a rebate was allowed to the advertiser. This protective clause was absolutely necessary in case of fire, alteration or removal of buildings or destruction of fences and sign-boards by weather or the requirements of the owners. It was this saving clause in the contracts of which Uncle John had decided to take advantage. The contracting sign painters were merely in the business to make money.|$|E

40|$|In {{this note}} a {{qualitative}} answer {{is given to}} the question whether placing <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> along motorways has an influence on traffic safety. It can be stated in general that especially the circumstances in which the driving task has to be performed are important for the possible effect of roadside advertising on traffic safety. To a certain degree drivers are well able to determine whether they pay attention to advertising. Confusion between <b>advertising</b> and traffic <b>signs</b> or other traffic signals should be prevented as much as possible. From the traffic safety point of view, it is important to develop a norm that determines to what degree distraction caused by <b>advertising</b> <b>signs</b> along roads can be. The assumption signs along roads can be. The assumption is that the longer roadside advertising holds the road user attention, the greater the chance of seeing traffic-relevant objects either too late or not at all...|$|R
