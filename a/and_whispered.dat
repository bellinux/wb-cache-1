25|$|On 23 October 2016, while Mourinho's Manchester United was {{trailing}} 4–0 against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte waved up {{the home}} crowd, {{urging them to}} make more noise to support the team. At {{the end of the}} match, Mourinho shook Conte's hand <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> into his ear, with media reports claiming Mourinho had accused Conte of trying to humiliate United with his actions. Both managers refused to confirm or deny the report, but Conte refuted claims {{that he was trying to}} antagonise Mourinho. Chelsea midfielder Pedro supported Conte, claiming Mourinho's reaction was out of context.|$|E

25|$|Nafshi's {{force of}} five tanks at Bunker 107 {{was the first}} to report the new Syrian attack. Given the small size of his force, Nafshi's {{position}} was vulnerable when faced with this heavy attack, and his tank's turret was damaged. He decided to allow the T-62s to close in on {{in order to reduce the}} Syrian advantages of numbers and night-vision. Close to 22:00, the Syrians approached within 450 meters of the bunker. He hit two tanks <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> commands through his microphone. After four minutes, 25 Syrian tanks were destroyed and their attack disturbed. Nafshi's force suffered no casualties. Most of the Syrian artillery fire fell on the Israeli units in the north. Kahalani warned his men to remain on the lookout for antitank squads.|$|E

25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

500|$|Catch Thirtythree is one 47-minute song {{divided into}} 13 sections. It is more mid-tempo guitar riff based, {{and a more}} {{straightforward}} and experimental full-length album than Chaosphere or Nothing. Nick Terry of Decibel Magazine describes the album as a four-movement symphony. Some songs still use Meshuggah's [...] "familiar template combining harsh vocals and nightmarish melodies over coarse, mechanically advancing, oddball tempos", while others explore ambient sounds and quieter dynamics. The first part of Catch Thirtythree centers around two simple riffs. In the song [...] "In Death - Is Death", the band uses a combination of noise and silence, which is {{in contrast with the}} atypical melodies on [...] "Dehumanization". On [...] "Mind's Mirrors", Meshuggah used electronics, programming and [...] "robotic voices". [...] "Shed" [...] incorporates tribal percussion <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> vocals.|$|E

Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, [...] "Tell my mother I die for my country." [...] Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> his last words as he gazed at them: [...] "Useless... useless." [...] He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.|$|E
500|$|... "Satin Chic" [...] is a disco {{song with}} glam rock and cabaret influences, similar to early Elton John. Cited by Goldfrapp and Gregory as their {{favourite}} song on Supernature, it was remixed by The Flaming Lips, and issued as a limited-edition single on 4 September 2006. The 10th track, [...] "Time Out from the World", features an orchestra <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> vocals by Goldfrapp. Critics liked the song, writing {{that it was}} an [...] "exception to the prevailing style of Supernature" [...] due to its [...] "haunting, yet glamorous, atmospherics". The album's closing track and second single [...] "Number 1" [...] is about the importance and meanings of relationships. The song, which is based around a synth and bass arrangement, reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart.|$|E

500|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was {{presented}} with the lyrics for [...] "Soliloquy" [...] on a five-foot long sheet of paper—the piece ran nearly eight minutes. [...] Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he {{felt that they were}} never fully addressed. [...] At some point during rehearsals, Molnár came to see what they had done to his play. [...] There are a number of variations on the story. [...] As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Molnár {{in the rear of the}} theatre <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> the news to his partner. [...] Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. [...] At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Molnár. [...] Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, [...] "What you have done is so beautiful. [...] And you know what I like best? [...] The ending!" [...] Hammerstein wrote that Molnár became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.|$|E
500|$|Roy, who {{had taught}} Cho in Introduction to Poetry the {{previous}} year, {{described him as}} [...] "an intelligent man," [...] and {{that he seemed to}} be an awkward, lonely and insecure student who never took off his sunglasses, even indoors. She described Cho's behavior as [...] "arrogant" [...] and [...] "obnoxious" [...] at times, and that she tried several different ways to help him. Roy declined to comment on Cho's writings, saying only in general that they [...] "seemed very angry." [...] She added that Cho, when called on in class, would take 20 seconds to answer questions, <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> his response. He also took cell phone pictures of her in class. After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. However, she soon became concerned for her safety, and told her assistant that she would use the name of a dead professor as a duress code, in order to alert the assistant to call security. After Roy notified authorities of Cho's behavior, she urged Cho to seek counseling, but to her knowledge, Cho never followed through with the request, in spite of his insistence to the contrary.|$|E
500|$|In the summer, the privations of the captivity, {{including}} their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. According to some accounts, {{at one point}} Anastasia became so upset about the locked, painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get fresh air. A sentry reportedly saw her and fired, narrowly missing her. She did not try again. On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, [...] "Something has happened to them in there." [...] But the next day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> to them when the guards weren't watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, {{the head of the}} detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.|$|E

[...] Elan noted that the composition of [...] "Hurt" [...] {{was similar to that}} of Lewis's cover of [...] "Run", writing [...] "there's an awful lot of layered build up to the chorus before a full band and orchestra come in during the second verse." [...] However, Elan concluded her review saying that although she appears not to know the legacy of the song, Lewis sounds [...] "pretty". Katherine St. Asaph for PopDust described Lewis's interpretation of [...] "Hurt" [...] as being formulaic like a [...] "template", writing that it is something that American Idol and The X Factor winners and contestants seem do when covering a song. St. Asaph continued to explain her opinions with regard to Lewis and [...] "Hurt", writing [...] "For Leona, that's big notes in bigger arrangements, with a couple hushed sections for contrast." [...] She was also skeptical of Lewis's emotive abilities, writing [...] "Either she knows that quiet-to-loud arrangements <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> vocals can simulate gravitas pretty well regardless of whether you’re thinking of pain or grocery lists, or she’s genuinely feeling something that comes out in her voice." ...|$|E

The prosecution levelled {{an indictment}} of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany {{of works of art}} and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the Nacht und Nebel (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be [...] "in the sense of the indictment not guilty". The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defencethe first to be presentedlasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946. Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, shaking his head, or laughing. He constantly took notes <b>and</b> <b>whispered</b> with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of Hess, who was seated beside him. During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony. Göring told American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn that the court was [...] "stupid" [...] to try [...] "little fellows" [...] like Funk and Kaltenbrunner instead of letting Göring take all the blame on himself. He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.|$|E

Dr. Eugene Botkin and Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated them by telling them the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.|$|E
