5|$|Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) {{until the}} female lays eggs {{at the start}} of the nesting season, which is around the {{beginning}} of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to await the moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous clutch, replacement clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> have a brood of ducklings.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> are currently on medication.|$|E

After finding {{themselves}} mysteriously trapped inside the Elder Tale game world, Shiroe and his fellow Adventurers have struggled for nearly six months to adjust to their new reality. During this time they managed to restore order to their city of Akihabara as well as defend the People of the Land from the goblin invasion at Zantleaf.

25|$|Most of Hindemith's music {{employs a}} unique {{system that is}} tonal but non-diatonic. Like most tonal music, it is centred on a tonic and modulates from one tonal centre to another, but it uses all 12 notes freely {{rather than relying on}} a scale picked as a subset of these notes. Hindemith even rewrote some of his music after {{developing}} this system. One of the key features of his system is that he ranks all musical intervals of the 12-tone equally tempered scale from the most consonant to the most dissonant. He classifies chords in six categories, on the basis of how dissonant they are, whether or not they contain a tritone, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> clearly suggest a root or tonal centre. Hindemith's philosophy also encompassed melodyâ€”he strove for melodies that do not clearly outline major or minor triads.|$|E

J.

The paper claimed that GM soybeans have lower levels of the antioxidant glutathione {{and higher levels of}} [...] cancer-causing formaldehyde, making the modified soybean substantially different, contrary to previous safety assessments. The publication led to sensational headlines from opponents of GM foods. Shortly after publication, he embarked on a speaking tour of the US. At the National Press Club, he said that genetic modification had [...] "fundamentally modified the metabolic system of the soy" [...] disrupting the [...] "beautiful way of detoxifying [...] " [...] present in non-GM soy.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{critical}} discussion of conclusions drawn from clinical and observational work, <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> actually support tenets of attachment theory. For example, Skuse based criticism of a basic tenet of attachment theory {{on the work of}} Anna Freud with children from Theresienstadt, who apparently developed relatively normally in spite of serious deprivation during their early years. This discussion concluded from Freud's case and from some other studies of extreme deprivation that there is an excellent prognosis for children with this background, unless there are biological or genetic risk factors. The psychoanalyst Margaret Mahler interpreted ambivalent or aggressive behaviour of toddlers toward their mothers as a normal part of development, not as evidence of poor attachment history.|$|E

2500|$|As for fielding a {{possible}} winner, the Army has over 1.1 million armed personnel, approximately half are front-line combat brigades. If a new carbine was selected, the Army would see 500,000 purchased for infantry brigade combat teams (IBCT), and the existing and improved M4s given to support troops to replace their M16s. If the improved M4 {{turned out to}} be the winner and the new carbine program scrapped, then the IBCTs will likely be fitted with the improved M4s, and the existing M4s would again be given to support troops to replace their M16s. On November 17, 2011 the US Marine Corps announced they will not participate or adopt any new weapon which may or may not come out of the competition. The USMC said they will continue to use standard M4s and M16A4s. They did mention they are considering upgrading the M16A4. However, General Jim Amos said on April 16, 2013 that the Marines were watching the Army program <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> would join was [...] "yet to be seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within these larger classifications, {{the vine}} {{training}} {{system may be}} further distinguished by the canopy such as whether it is free (like goblet) or constrained by shoot positioning along wires (such as VSP trellising) and whether it includes a single curtain (Guyot) or double (Lyre). For cordon and many other spur trained systems, they {{could be described as}} unilateral (utilizing only 1 arm or cordon) or bilateral with both arms extending from the trunk. Two other classifications, based on trellising, are whether or not the vine is [...] "staked" [...] with an external support structure and the number of wires used in the trellising. Vines may be individual staked either permanently, as many vineyards along the bank of the Rhone Valley which are at risk of wind damage, or temporarily as some young vines are to provide extra support. Within a trellis system fruiting canes and young shoots are attached to wires strung out across the rows. The number of wires used (one, two, three) <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> are movable (such as the Scott Henry) will influence the size of the canopy and the yield.|$|E
2500|$|Under these stresses, {{the crew}} {{continued}} their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were {{tuned to the}} two Non-Directional Beacons (NDBs) present at the field, and the autopilot {{was set up to}} use waypoints from the Flight Management System (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, [...] "Well, generally it's absolute shit here," [...] and that, [...] "(we) were lucky to land at the last moment." [...] The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was , but told PLF 101, [...] "you might try...(to make an approach)." [...] The crew of PLF 101 acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual flight mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to PLF 101 concerning their distance from the runway <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> were on the glidepath. The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the airplane was on the glidepath when it was not.|$|E

2500|$|GM (Genetically modified) grains are {{not allowed}} in South Australia, where some grain {{producers}} have called for the moratorium to be lifted. [...] They argue the GM technology would help them tackle weeds and other pests, and that farmers {{should be able to}} choose how they run their enterprises <b>and</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> wanted to grow the 'premium products' described by Leon Bignell, the South Australian (SA) Agriculture Minister. Producers have also said their GM-free grain is not translating to higher profits. Bignell conceded more work needed to be done to market produce as GM-free but said he was confident producers would see higher financial returns in the near future. [...] In March 2015, Bignell told farmers they should not use GM but should instead rely upon what he called [...] 'God's gifts'. [...] He said the [...] "amazing" [...] results of the Government's 'New Horizons' [...] soil improvement program [...] "prove," [...] in his view, that grain producers [...] "do not need genetic modification technology." [...] He said that [...] "Instead of using the top five centimetres of the soil, you go down to 50cm or even deeper. You put clay in it when it's needed, you put organic matter where it's needed as well." [...] Bignell said the trials had strengthened his view that South Australia should maintain a moratorium on GM technology, which he said gave the state's produce a [...] "market edge". [...] Bignell also said he believed results of the New Horizons program could be replicated in all grain growing areas of the state. Bignell added that [...] "If you look at GM and the promises around increases of about seven per cent in yields, why would you go for seven per cent when you can get 50 to 100 per cent increases in yield without having to use genetically modified seeds?" ...|$|E
