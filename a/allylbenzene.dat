F.; Hager, L. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 817 - 818). We have used Q-band continuous wave and pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to study the CPO heme in situ following inactivation with <b>allylbenzene,</b> using samples prepared in natural isotopic abundance, with N- 15 -labeled enzyme, and with <b>allylbenzene</b> labeled with H- 2 or C- 13 in specific vinylic positions. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of the inactivated enzyme is dominated by a low-spin ferric signal (g(1, 2, 3) = 2. 32, 2. 16, 1. 95). N- 14,N- 15 ENDOR examination of allylbenzene-inactivated CPO reveals that three nitrogens of the heme are similar, but the fourth nitrogen is markedly different, suggesting that a single pyrrole ring has been covalently modified at the unique nitrogen. These studies also reveal {{the orientation of the}} g tensor relative to the heme. C- 13 ENDOR of allylbenzene-inactivated CPO with C- 13 -labeled <b>allylbenzene</b> shows that the C- 1 and C- 2 carbons of <b>allylbenzene</b> are covalently connected to the heme system. H- 1,H- 2 ENDOR plus mass analysis of CPO heme after inactivation with deuterated <b>allylbenzene</b> show that all three vinylic protons are retained in the heme adduct.

Such ligands increase selectivity by limiting rotation around the P−Ru bond and by specifically directing the steric bulk of the phosphine substituents toward the selectivity-inducing thiolate ligand. In particular, DFT calculations predicted that o-(dialkylphosphino) phenolate ligands should improve selectivity and activity compared to 4.
