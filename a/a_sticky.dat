5|$|The {{following}} year, {{having been}} appointed Bradman's vice-captain, McCabe {{had a successful}} Ashes series in 193637. McCabe scored 76, 28, 23, 83 and 46 in the lead-up, but started the series poorly; he made 51 in the first innings but managed only seven as Australia was caught out on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket {{on the final day}} and were bowled out for 58 to lose the First Test in Brisbane by 322 runs. He then made a duck as Australia was again caught on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> by a thunderstorm during the first innings of the Second Test in Sydney. He made 93 in the second innings but Australia was unable to overcome the first innings deficit of 346 after being forced to follow on and fell to an innings defeat.|$|E

5|$|The {{light was}} again poor {{on the fourth}} day, but England did not appeal against it. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} to erase the deficit and build a lead, to force Australia to chase a target on an erratic surface if a shower came later and turned the pitch into <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket. Bradman thought that rain might come, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensive leg theory so England {{would not be in}} the lead should <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket arise. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, {{the light}} was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E

In this ant-fungus mutualism, both species depend on each other for survival. The ant Allomerus decemarticulatus has evolved a three-way association with the host plant, Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), and <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> fungus which is used to trap their insect prey.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's {{performances}} were rewarded with selection for an Australian XI in a tour match against the England cricket {{team at the}} start of the 1954–55 season. However, the match was curtailed by rain and Harvey was not able to exhibit his talents on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket highly difficult for batting. Listed at No. 4, Harvey came in after the dismissal of his brother and made seven in his only innings. As a result, Ray was not chosen for the Test team alongside his brother during the season.|$|E
5|$|He {{was rewarded}} with {{selection}} for {{four of the five}} Tests against India, making his debut on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket in the First Test in Brisbane. taking 2/17 as India fell for 58 in the first innings and 1/11 in the second as India fell for 98 following on, resulting in an innings defeat. Johnston's first Test wicket was Hemu Adhikari and he was not required to bat.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus pustulatus resembles H.agathosmus and has {{a similar}} almond odor. However, the fruit bodies of H.pustulatus are smaller, and it {{produces}} larger spores (11–14µm long). Hygrophorus occidentalis, which grows under conifers or oak, has <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> stem and less pronounced almond odor. Hygrophorus marzuolus is also similar in appearance, but it lacks a distinctive odor, and has smaller spores than H.agathamosus.|$|E
50|$|Mastic is {{a natural}} resin that runs down when a mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus) is cut. Originally mastic is sun-dried into pieces of brittle, {{resulting}} in producing translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright natural white and opaque gummy substance. The flavour is bitter at first, but after some chewing, it releases a refreshing, Mediterranean-maple-syrup-like flavour, however it has <b>a</b> <b>stickier</b> texture than maple syrup.|$|R
50|$|Payesh is also {{regarded}} as an auspicious food and generally associated with annaprashana (weaning ritual of an infant) and Janmatithi (birthday) in a Bengali household. It is called kheer in Bengali if milk is used in a significantly greater amount than rice. The people of West Bengal and Bangladesh prepare payesh with gurh, ketaki, glutinous rice, vermicelli, semolina and coconut milk, {{and the result is}} <b>a</b> <b>stickier</b> and creamier dessert.|$|R

5|$|Woodfull had an {{opportunity}} to inflict more blows on the tourists as Victoria played them for the second time ahead of the final Test. While his state was unable to force a result, Woodfull continued his strong form with 44 and 73 not out. The Australian captain finished the season with a duck from the opening ball of the fifth Test, bowled after failing to offer a shot, but Australia won by an innings an 72 runs in the equivalent of a single day's play on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 12 in a {{total of}} 80 as Australia were caught on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket, Fingleton then made 73 in the second innings of the Second Test in Sydney, one of few Australians to resist as the home side fell to an innings defeat after being forced to follow on. Australia were facing a dilemma in the Third Test in Melbourne. The home team scored 200, Fingleton {{contributing}} 38, before rain caused <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket and England declared at 9/76. However, Australia still had to bat on the treacherous surface, captain Bradman reshuffled the batting lineup, putting the bowlers in first and Fingleton and himself in at Nos. 6 and 7 to save them for more favourable batting conditions. The bowlers managed to survive {{to the end of the}} day's play and the wicket improved overnight. The pair came together with the score at 5/97 and made a Test record sixth-wicket partnership of 346, with Fingleton making 136. It turned the Test and saw Australia ended at 564. The hosts bowled England out for 323 to win the match by 365 runs and prevent England from taking an unassailable 3–0 lead. Fingleton did not pass 20 in his last three innings of the series, as Australia won the remaining two matches to win the series. Fingleton ended with 398 runs at 44.22 in the Tests, and 631 runs at 33.21 overall.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the finger spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm {{orthodox}} spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings. On <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket that played {{into the hands of the}} Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in his new role as a slow bowler.|$|E

5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton {{became the}} first player to score centuries in four {{consecutive}} Test innings when he scored 100 in the first innings of the First Test at Brisbane, reaching the mileston on 7 December. He top-scored as Australia replied to England's 358 with 234. Fingleton's feats was later equalled by Alan Melville, (whose four centuries were scored on either side of World War II) and surpassed by the West Indian, Everton Weekes in 1948–49. Fingleton's run ended in the second innings, falling for a golden duck as Australia were skittled for 58 on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket and crushed by 322 runs.|$|E
5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming <b>a</b> <b>sticky,</b> honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

5|$|In {{some cases}} of Batesian-Wallacian mimicry, {{the model is}} a sexually {{receptive}} female, which provides a strong attractive effect on males. Some spiders use chemical rather than visual means to ensnare prey. Female bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora lure male moth-flies (Diptera, true flies, but resembling moths) by producing analogues of the moth species' sex pheromones. Each species of spider appears to specialize in a particular species of prey in the family Psychodidae. Juveniles use their front pair of legs to capture prey, such as flies. Older spiders use a different strategy however, swinging <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> ball known as a bolas suspended by a silk thread at moths. But both old and juvenile are able to lure prey via this olfactory signal; even young spiderlings {{have been shown to}} attract prey species.|$|E
5|$|Johnston took 2/21 in {{the first}} innings of the First Test against South Africa at Johannesburg and the hosts were forced to follow on. He took 6/44 {{including}} the last three wickets in the second innings, his career best innings figures in Test cricket, helping Australia take an innings victory and a 1–0 series lead. He removed Owen Wynne and Jack Cheetham in both innings. After going wicketless {{in the first}} innings, he took three wickets in the Second Test victory at Cape Town. He then took 11 wickets {{in the next two}} tour games, including 6/20 against Border. Johnston was more prominent in the Third Test at Durban with match figures of 8/114 as Australia took the series 3–0. South Africa had reached 2/242 in their first innings when Johnston removed their captain Dudley Nourse, precipitating a loss of 8/69 on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket as the hosts were bowled out for 311. He ended with 4/75. Australia then collapsed for 75 on <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> wicket and South Africa had a lead of 321 when they had reached 2/85 in their second innings. Johnston then removed John Nel and Billy Wade without further addition to the score, sparking a collapse of 8/14 that saw the home team all out for 99. Johnston ended with 4/39 and Australia went on to reach the victory target. On an erratic surface, six of his victims were bowled or lbw.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays <b>a</b> <b>sticky</b> silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
