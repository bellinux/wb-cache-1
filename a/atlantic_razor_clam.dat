40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} design of a {{fluidized}} bed test setup for testing digging kinematics of RoboClam, a burrowing device based on <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Razor</b> <b>Clams.</b> This test bed allows for in-lab testing in an environment covered by water, eliminating the need to test in the mud flats where <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> live. Between each RoboClam test, water is pumped through a distributor plate, which suspends and fluidizes the glass bead media, leading to redistribution of the substrate and unpacking. The new fluidized bed system has two key improvements over the current system. It improves the redistribution that is needed between each test to reset the substrate. Before each test it also unpacks the beads, which prevents packing over time created by the current vibration redistribution system that causes changes to the soil mechanics. This system will enable continued testing of the current RoboClam device and facilitate the development of the next generation burrowing device. by Daniel Scott Dorsch. Thesis (S. B.)

The wetland was {{registered}} as the 1099 th Ramsar site. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Solen spp.) is an important species in the sandbars which are a part of this wetland. Fisherman has harvested <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> for generating income more than 2 generations. Due to the previous studies, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population has decreased through the time. The objective of this study aims to explore possible sustainable management policies for Don Hoi Lord by using Companion Modelling approach (ComMod). The approach mainly consists of Agent-based simulation model (ABM) and participatory simulation workshop with stakeholders involvement. To achieve the aim of the study, there are 3 parts including: 1) ecological study of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population and its environmental factors especially sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) between June 2008 - May 2009; 2) socio-economic study to understand fisherman harvesting behavior and <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> market mechanism; and 3) ABM development from field study finding and test the management scenarios with the ABM. Moreover, the ABM was used in participatory simulation workshop to validate the ABM and to exchange and discuss on <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> sustainable management. The results from ecological study showed that <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population was in crisis due to the decreasing of population. Mean density of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> was 0. 51 ± 0. 30 clam/m 2 which has been the lowest record among previous scientific studies since 1982. In addition, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> density had negative correlation with %organic matter in soil sediment and particulate sediment in water column (p < 0. 05) but it was not correlated with POC. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> market is being driven by a trader who buys all <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> from a fisherman and processed <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> as clam meat before distributing to market. The trader set <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> buying price from fisherman independently based on their <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> stock and a current market demand. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> demand usually was increased during weekend and, presently the trader distributing processed <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> to a restaurant and a merchant in fresh market. Regarding fisherman, there were 2 factors affected fisherman's decision to harvest <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> firstly the density of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> and secondly <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> price. Due to the low <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> density, fisherman had to harvest on other species instead of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> but <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> is still the first priority. The ABM development was done by added i-stage distribution model and re-calibrated until the simulation model represented system behavior. Then, the management scenarios were tested with the ABM and it was found that reserved zoning accompany with quota system was the best scenario for sustaining <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population. Next, spatial interface of the ABM was upgraded based on socio-economic finding and the upgraded ABM was used in participatory simulation workshop with stakeholders. The workshop can be a forum for discussion among stakeholders by using ABM as mediator and stakeholders in the workshop which could share their representations for collective agreement to achieve the goal. Finally, the whole process of ComMod at Don Hoi Lord by communicating and coworking between researcher and stakeholders in the field study could help them instituted the group to working on sustainable management by implementing a reserved or forbidden zone on the sandbar at Don Hoi Lord.

40|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Ensis directus) reduces {{burrowing}} drag {{by using}} motions of its shell to fluidize {{a thin layer}} of substrate around its body. We have developed RoboClam, a robot that digs using the same mechanisms as Ensis, to explore how localized fluidization burrowing can be extended to engineering applications. In this work we present burrowing performance results of RoboClam in two distinctly different substrates: ideally granular 1 mm soda lime glass beads and cohesive ocean mudflat soil. Using a genetic algorithm to optimize RoboClam’s kinematics, the machine was able to burrow in both substrates with a power law relationship between digging energy and depth of n = 1. 17. Pushing through static soil has a theoretical energy-depth power law of n = 2, which means that Ensis-inspired burrowing motions can provide exponentially higher energy efficiency. We propose a theoretical constitutive model that describes how a fluidized region should form around a contracting body in virtually any type of saturated soil. The model predicts fluidization to be a relatively local effect, extending only two to three characteristic lengths away from the body, depending on friction angle and coefficient of lateral earth pressure, two commonly measured soil parameters.

RoboClam technology, which is based on the digging mechanics of razor clams, may be valuable for subsea applications that could benefit from efficient burrowing, such as anchoring, mine detonation, and cable laying. We directly visualize the movement of soil grains during the contraction of RoboClam, using a novel index-matching technique along with particle tracking. We show that the size of the failure zone around contracting RoboClam can be theoretically predicted from the substrate and pore fluid properties, provided that the timescale of contraction is sufficiently large.

Needle valves were used on the robot's pneumatic control system to vary its expansion and contraction times in a series of tests, then each test was analyzed to determine to what extent soil fluidization occurred. It was found that the theoretical minimum contraction time is an appropriate boundary and the theoretical maximum contraction time is a loose boundary on tests that will result in soil fluidization.

By measuring soil deformations around burrowing E. directus, we have found the animal reduces drag by contracting its valves to initially fail, and then fluidize, the surrounding substrate. The characteristic contraction time to achieve fluidization can be calculated directly from soil properties. The geometry of the fluidized zone is dictated by two commonly-measured geotechnical parameters: coefficient of lateral earth pressure and friction angle. Calculations using full ranges for both parameters indicate that the fluidized zone is a local effect, occurring between 1 – 5 body radii away from the animal. The energy associated with motion through fluidized substrate—characterized by a depth-independent density and viscosity—scales linearly with depth. In contrast, moving through static soil requires energy that scales with depth squared. For E. directus, this translates to a 10 X reduction in the energy required to reach observed burrow depths. For engineers, localized fluidization offers a mechanically simple and purely kinematic method to dramatically reduce energy costs associated with digging.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this thesis is to generate compact, lightweight, low-energy, reversible, and dynamic burrowing systems for use in subsea applications such as anchoring, oil recovery, underwater cable installation, mine detonation, and sensor placement. As many organisms have evolved to embed themselves within undersea substrates, unsurprisingly, nature has provided a viable basis for a novel, efficient burrowing technology. This work centers around understanding the burrowing mechanisms of Ensis directus, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> which was discovered to burrow by using motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding substrate. Moving through fluidized, rather than static, soil reduces drag forces to a level within the animal's strength capabilities and results in burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth, rather than depth squared. As Ensis contracts its valves, the resulting stress imbalance within the soil creates a failure surface around the clam, within which particles can freely move and fluidize, and outside of which the soil remains static. Theoretical derivations and experimental results demonstrate that the location of the failure surface can be predicted using only two parameters commonly measured in geotechnical surveys: coefficient of lateral earth pressure and friction angle. To explore the feasibility of transferring localized fluidization burrowing into engineering applications, RoboClam, a robot that burrows using the same mechanisms as Ensis, was designed, constructed, and tested. Experimental data show the machine is able to match the animal's linear burrowing energy versus depth relationship and achieve localized fluidization in both granular and cohesive substrates. by Amos Greene Winter, V.

40|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> Ensis directus, burrows {{underwater}} {{by expanding}} and contracting its valves to fluidize the surrounding soil. Its digging method uses {{an order of magnitude}} less energy than would be needed to push the clam directly into soil, which could be useful in engineering applications such as anchoring and sensor placement. The first chapter of this thesis presents the theoretical basis for the timescales necessary to achieve such efficient digging and gives design parameters for a device to validate the timescales. It then uses RoboClam, a robot designed to imitate the razor clam's movements, to test the design rules. It was found that the minimum contraction time is the most critical timescale for efficient digging, and that efficient expansion times vary more widely. The results of this chapter can be used as design rules for other robot architectures for efficient digging, optimized for the size scale and soil type of the specific application. The second chapter of this thesis examines whether it would be theoretically possible to use the same E. directus-inspired method to dig into dry soil, for applications such as sensor placement. The stress state of the soil around the robot was analyzed, and a target stress state for dry soil digging was found. Then, the two possible modes of soil collapse were investigated and used to determine how quickly the robot would have to contract to achieve the target stress state. It was found that for most dry soils, a RoboClam-like device would have to contract in 0. 02 seconds, a speed slightly faster than the current robot is capable of, but still within the realm of possibility for a similar machine. These results suggest that the biomimetic approach successfully used by RoboClam to dig into submerged soil could feasibly be used to dig into dry soil as well. by Monica Isava. Thesis: S.

A participatory modelling approach was used, including (a) agent-based modelling (ABM) and (b) role-playing games (RPG). First, an individual-state distribution model of the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population was designed and calibrated to synthesise knowledge. Two RPG sessions supported by this biological model were organised to initiate collective learning and promote discussion among stakeholders. After playing with the baseline scenario showing the actual harvesting situation, discussions led to the definition of alternative scenarios for clam management such as establishment and rotation of zones closed for harvesting, and quota systems. These scenarios developed during the RPG sessions were more deeply investigated with an agent-based model that included fishermen agents and the individual-state distribution model of the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population. Simulations of different scenarios (reserve, quota and combination of reserve and quota) were produced to enable better informed discussion between different stakeholders. Stakeholders have acknowledged that management through rotating reserves is not efficient if the duration of reserves is too short. They have realised that the efficiency of reserves is hard to assess without better data on clam recruitment. They have also explored another management option which is the quota system. In the final stage, the local participatory process was endorsed by the incumbent regional policy-making actor. Unfortunately, because of rapid administrative rotation the project abruptly lost support. This unexpected event emphasises the need for continuous monitoring of all actors entering and/or leaving the system, which can radically change the interactions among them and, therefore, the whole management context.
