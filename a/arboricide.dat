60|$|There {{may be a}} {{distinct}} gain to justice in permitting a witness to say whatever he wants to say. If he {{is telling the truth}} he will not contradict himself; if he is lying the more rope he is given the more surely he will entangle himself. To the service of that end defendants and prisoners should, I think, be compelled to testify and denied the advantage of declining to answer, for silence is the refuge of guilt In endeavoring by austere means to make an accused person incriminate himself the French judge logically applies the same principle that a parent uses with a suspected child. When the Grandfather of His Country arraigned the wee George Washington for <b>arboricide</b> the accused was not carefully instructed that he need not answer if a truthful answer would tend to convict him. If he had refused to answer he would indubitably have been lambasted until he did answer, as right richly he would have deserved to be.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the STREK project was to propose silvicultural methods able to increase forest production, especially in logged-over areas, The area RKL 1 which was logged 15 years ago was the most suitable zone to implement those trials. This study aims to describe the silvicultural treatments undertaken in RKL 1. Two different treatments were applied in addition to the control: the first treatment was a liberation thinning carried out systematically in the plot with a removal of 30 % of the basal area involving the non-commercial species with dbh = 20 cm. The second silvicultural treatment was a two-fold intervention: (i) a liberation thinning focused around selected potential crop trees (PCT) characterised by an extraction of non-commercial species with dbh = 20 cm located within a circle of a constant 10 m diameter centred on the PCT; and (ii) an extraction of the same non-commercial species group with dbh = 40 cm outside the 10 m circles. The efficiency of the <b>arboricide</b> on the trees three years after treatment is given...|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} have been employed to clear or kill woody plants in savannas. Early pastoralists used felling and girdling, {{the removal of}} a ring of bark and sapwood, {{as a means of}} clearing land. In the 1950s <b>arboricides</b> suitable for stem injection were developed. War-surplus heavy machinery was made available, and these were used for either pushing timber, or for pulling using a chain and ball strung between two machines. These two new methods of timber control, along with the introduction and widespread adoption of several new pasture grasses and legumes promoted a resurgence in tree clearing. The 1980s also saw the release of soil-applied <b>arboricides,</b> notably tebuthiuron, that could be utilised without cutting and injecting each individual tree.|$|R
40|$|Production of {{adequate}} supplies {{of food and}} fiber currently requires that pesticides be used to limit crop losses from insects, pathogens, weeds and other pests. The term pesticide refers to a large number ofchemical compounds. Pesticides include acaricides, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, nematicides, algicides, <b>arboricides,</b> zoocides, and many more...|$|R
5|$|Between 1950 and 1952, {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test <b>arboricides</b> and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and endothall (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952â€“53, the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of tsetse fly.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Within the savannas of the {{southern}} Kalahari, land use practices can change habitat structure profoundly, so that rangelands either became densely wooden through bush thickening or are cleared completely using <b>arboricides</b> or manual tree felling and bush clearance, or are at some stage in between. Demands for the wood of camelthorn trees (Acacia reioloba), (the largest tree species growing on semi-arid and arid Kalahari sands) for firewood has also impacted habitat structure. Large trees are important in the Kalahari ecosystem because they provide shade, nesting and foraging sites for birds and mammals, as well as microhabitats that facilitate {{the existence of a}} suite of subcanopy plants. Indeed, large A. erioloba tress have been mooted as a context-depend keystones species, important to other biota and ecological prcesess. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the importance of A. erioloba to biodiversity, focusing on plants and birds...|$|R
