In addition, cooling and heating bills can be significantly lowered with <b>air</b> <b>sealing</b> and duct sealing. <b>Air</b> <b>sealing</b> reduces the outdoor air that penetrates a building, and duct sealing prevents attic or basement air from entering ducts and lessening the heating/cooling systemâ€™s efficiency.

50|$|The mill is {{pressurized}} and the air-tightness is {{ensured by}} plenum chambers around the rotating trunnion filled with pressurized <b>seal</b> <b>air.</b> Bleeding <b>seal</b> <b>air</b> from plenum chamber to the mill maintains separation between pulverized fuel in the Mill {{and the outside}} atmosphere. Inadequacy or absence of <b>seal</b> <b>air</b> will allow escape of pulverized fuel into atmosphere. On the other hand, an excess of <b>seal</b> <b>air</b> leaking into mill will affect the mill outlet temperature. As such the <b>seal</b> <b>air</b> is controlled by a local control damper maintaining just sufficient differential pressure for sealing.|$|R

50|$|The S6 {{respirator}} provided {{protection to}} the face, eyes, lung and throat of the wearer against all known chemical agents of that time. The filter of the respirator did not filter out carbon dioxide. The S6 features an innovative <b>air</b> <b>seal</b> around {{the inside of}} the face piece to improve the fit and comfort of the mask; a tap inside the nose cup was to allow the equalisation of pressure inside the <b>air</b> <b>seal,</b> in different climatic conditions. The wearers natural body heat would then warm the trapped air to inflate the <b>air</b> <b>seal,</b> thus getting a better seal around the face. The mask could also be made to benefit left-handed people, where the filter canister is positioned on the right of the face mask instead of the left. The location of the filter on the left or right side of the mask was to allow the rifle to be shouldered, aimed and fired correctly.|$|R
50|$|A deep energy {{retrofit}} combines {{energy efficiency}} {{measures such as}} energy efficient equipment, <b>air</b> <b>sealing,</b> moisture management, controlled ventilation, insulation, and solar control so that dramatic energy savings are achieved alongside optimal building performance.|$|E
50|$|Correct {{attention}} to <b>air</b> <b>sealing</b> measures and consideration of vapor transfer mechanisms {{are important for}} the optimal function of bulk insulators. Air infiltration can allow convective heat transfer or condensation formation, both of which may degrade the performance of an insulation.|$|E

50|$|Light-density {{open-cell}} SPF {{is commonly}} known as half-pound foam. It is a semi-rigid material with a sponge-like appearance that expands during installation and creates small, open cells that are filled with carbon dioxide. Due to its ability to expand during the application process, it fills cracks, crevices and voids and adheres to irregular surfaces or substrates to form an <b>air</b> <b>sealing</b> insulation.|$|E

5000|$|Systems {{thinking}} {{is required for}} these kinds of retrofits, where highly efficient windows are [...] "tuned" [...] to their orientation, and mechanical systems and heat recovery ventilation units are sized and integrated with how the walls, roof and basement are being <b>air</b> <b>sealed,</b> moisture-managed and insulated.|$|R
50|$|As furnace {{efficiency}} gets higher, appropriate matching {{of equipment}} size to distribution system capacity and building load becomes more critical to optimizing equipment ability to maximize efficient operation. Installing much lower output high-efficiency replacement equipment offers opportunity for comfort and savings gains, but improving the building envelope through <b>air</b> <b>sealing</b> and adding more insulation, advanced windows, etc., should be explored concurrently or before replacement equipment design stage. The passive house approach produces superinsulated buildings that approach zero net energy consumption. Improving the building envelope {{can also be}} cheaper than replacing a furnace or air conditioner.|$|E
50|$|Convective heat transfer: Heat {{which is}} created {{elsewhere}} that is transported {{by means of}} a fluid, such as water or in our case air. Spray foam insulation's most important attribute is the ability to air seal creating a custom airtight envelope within the building structure. The added benefit to <b>air</b> <b>sealing</b> is the ability to block convective heat transfer from interior to exterior during heating months and vice versa during cooling months, as the heat cannot escape through gaps in the buildings envelope without the aid of air movement from infiltration as a means of transport.|$|E

50|$|Durability, good {{interior}} {{air quality}} and energy efficiency are attained by sound building science practices. In a deep energy retrofit, filling a wall cavity with effective insulation also requires careful consideration {{of how that}} wall will dry if moisture does happen to get past its skin. Using very high R-value insulation systems on {{the exterior of the}} building enclosure is often one of the hallmarks of a deep energy retrofit. Where exactly the dewpoint will fall in (or out) of those thickened wallsâ€”and in what climate zoneâ€”becomes crucial. Careful detailing, flashing and <b>air</b> <b>sealing</b> of windows and other building penetrations is also key to a successful deep energy retrofit.|$|E
5000|$|The Kurians created these vampiric monsters that stalk the night, {{selecting}} victims {{for their}} insatiable masters. Each Reaper {{is an extension}} of its master, and when it pierces the heart of a victim with its long, flexible tongue to drain the unfortunate's blood, its connection to the Kurian controller transfers the vital aura. The Reapers are nigh-unstoppable; not only garbed in bullet-resistant cloaks but also possessing superhuman speed, agility, strength and resilience. Their blood is a powerful coagulant when exposed to <b>air,</b> <b>sealing</b> wounds almost instantly, and the bones of a Reaper are hard enough to deflect most bullets. The most terrifying aspect of the Reaper, however, is its ability to stalk prey by sensing out [...] "lifesign", the energy given off by a living being. The greater the emotional distress of the target, the easier it is for the Reapers to find them.|$|E
50|$|Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) is a {{means of}} {{financing}} energy efficiency upgrades or renewable energy installations for residential, commercial and industrial property owners. Depending on state legislation, PACE can be used to finance building envelope energy efficiency improvements like insulation and <b>air</b> <b>sealing,</b> cool roofs, water efficiency products, seismic retrofits, and hurricane preparedness measures. Examples of energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades range from adding more attic insulation to installing rooftop solar panels for residential projects and chillers, boilers, LED lighting and roofing for commercial projects. In areas with PACE legislation in place, governments offer a specific bond to investors {{or in the case of}} the open-market model, private lenders provide financing to the building owners to put towards an energy retrofit. The loans are repaid over the selected term (over the course of somewhere between 5 and 25 years) via an annual assessment on their property tax bill. PACE bonds can be municipal financing districts, state agencies or finance companies and the proceeds can be used to retrofit both commercial and residential properties. One of the most notable characteristics of PACE programs is that the loan is attached to the property rather than an individual.|$|E

50|$|Phenolic {{injection}} foam: Such as Tripolymer R-5.1 {{per inch}} (ASTM-C-177). Known for its <b>air</b> <b>sealing</b> abilities. Tripolymer {{can be installed}} in wall cavities that have fiberglass and cellulose in them. Non-hazardous. Not restricted by depth of application. Fire resistant - flame spread 5, smoke spread 0 (ASTM-E-84) - will not smoke at all upon direct contact with flame and is a two-hour firewall at a 3.5 in, or normal 2 Ã— 4 in stud wall, application per ASTM E-199. Great for sound deadening, STC 53 (ASTM E413-73); does not echo like other foams. Environmentally friendly. Non-expansive (good for existing homes where interior sheathing is in place). Fully sustainable: Consists of phenolic, a foaming agent, and air. Blown with air (no CFCs, HCFCs or other harmful blowing agents). Nontoxic, even during application. Does not shrink or settle. Zero VOC emission. Chemically inert (no known symptoms of exposure per MSDS). Insect resistant. Mold Proof. Insoluble in water. Disadvantages: Like all foams, it is more expensive than conventional fiber insulations when only comparing sq ft pricing. When you compare price to R value per sq ft the price is about the same.|$|E
