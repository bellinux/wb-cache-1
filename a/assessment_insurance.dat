40|$|There {{are much}} more {{publications}} in open literature {{on the topic of}} linguistic variables as compared with Computing With Words (CWW). This paper intends to change that situation by demonstrating the feasibility of a working system. In order to accomplish this goal, a very focused example of an insurance evaluation system, no matter how rudimentary, is presented. Lotfi A. Zadeh has persistently stressed the importance of CWW for a contemporary society and he is absolutely right on target. We have proceeded our project, taking the advantage of the previously established works of Chen, Hsieh and Wang, such as linguistic logic, uncertainty numbers modeling, fuzzifications and defuzzifications schemes, etc. Basically, the Linguistic Evaluating System (LES), consists of Linguistic Descriptions Evaluating Algorithm (LDEA), Linguistic Descriptions Base (LDB), and Fuzzy Knowledge Base (FKB). The previously published works on linguistic methodology and linguistic logic make it possible to develop our LDEA. This main algorithm intends to appraise the linguistic descriptions based upon the newly proposed preferred evaluation rules. In addition, the measuring evaluations of the linguistic descriptions, which have been based on the innovative combination of different IF-THEN fuzzy rules, which in term has been based upon the use of the linguistic distance measurements, reflected the preference of a humane expert. If then, only then, the desired user friendly applications of the essential thrust of risk <b>assessment</b> required for <b>insurance</b> industry has been finally realized.

40|$|We have {{utilized}} the dataset of questionnaires answered by 582 SMEs in UK, {{to investigate the}} determinants of the conduct of risk assessment and attitudes towards the importance of insurance. These are shaped as H 1 and H 2, which were tested by running probit regression. It then improves the understanding of their relationship in H 3 by first time adopting the bivariate probit approach in this context. For both models, the results specify an inverted U-shaped relation between the risk assessment/insurance and sizes of SMEs. Meanwhile, we also verify that SMEs emphases on health and safety issues {{are more willing to}} apply risk <b>assessment</b> and <b>insurance</b> policy. Another contribution is the introduction of two psychological factors, and we find that people working for dream business are more likely to consider risk assessment to protect their jobs; however, people who joined in setting up the business are less willing to purchase insurance. Moreover, under the model of insurance, we prove two significant factors that undervaluing insurance [...] the expensive premium and lack of specified knowledge about the insurance coverage. The model also obtains a remarkable connection between the threats of debts and the importance of insurance. It reinforces the idea that corporate demand for insurance is determined by the constraints on liquidity and the potential probability of ruin. Finally, H 3 proves tentative evidence suggesting a positive link between risk <b>assessment</b> and <b>insurance</b> at the level of 90 %.
