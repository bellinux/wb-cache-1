The {{only part of the}} sensor that contacts the liquid is a bubble tube which is chemically compatible with the material whose level is to be measured. Since the point of measurement has no electrical components, the technique is a good choice for classified “Hazardous Areas”. The control portion of the system can be located safely away, with the pneumatic plumbing isolating the hazardous from the safe area. <b>Air</b> <b>bubbler</b> systems are a good choice for open tanks at atmospheric pressure and can be built so that high-pressure air is routed through a bypass valve to dislodge solids that may clog the bubble tube. The technique is inherently “self-cleaning”. It is highly recommended for liquid level measurement applications where ultrasonic, float or microwave techniques have proved undependable. The system will require constant supply of air during measurement. The end of the tube should be above certain height to avoid sludge from clogging the tube.|$|E

Typically hidden away in digestive tracts, they have been found around the globe, including from Idaho. With sampling from Spring of 2016 we add to data from collections of aquatic insects for a longer term study of “gut fungi” from Dry Creek, near Boise. Field sampling employs a kick sampling technique, with hosts maintained alive in an aquarium with an <b>air</b> <b>bubbler</b> at a controlled temperature.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Achalasia cardia is {{characterized}} by failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax in response to swallowing and by an absence of peristalsis in the esophageal body. Absence of a gastric <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> is a well known radiological finding. Pneumatic balloon dilatation results in reappearance of the gastric bubble. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 43 -year-old Indian man with achalasia cardia whose chest X-ray at the time of presentation showed an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> in the gastric region causing a diagnostic quandary. Successful dilatation of the lower esophageal sphincter resulted in the appearance of another <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> in the gastric region. Proper analysis showed that the first bubble was actually a colonic <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> of the splenic flexure and the appearance of the second bubble was the anticipated gastric <b>air</b> <b>bubble.</b> Conclusion In patients presenting with achalasia cardia, a colonic <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> may be seen in the gastric region causing diagnostic difficulty.

40|$|The Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management is {{supporting}} R&D for the conceptual {{design of the}} Plutonium Disposition Project at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, SC to reduce the attractiveness of plutonium scrap by fabricating a durable plutonium oxide glass form and immobilizing this form within the high-level waste glass prepared in the Defense Waste Processing Facility. A glass formulation was developed {{that is capable of}} incorporating large amounts of actinides as well as accommodating many impurities that may be associated with impure Pu feed streams. The basis for the glass formulation was derived from commercial glasses that had high lanthanide loadings. A development effort led to a Lanthanide BoroSilicate (LaBS) glass that accommodated significant quantities of actinides, tolerated impurities associated with the actinide feed streams and could be processed using established melter technologies. A Cylindrical Induction Melter (CIM) was used for vitrification of the Pu LaBS glass. Induction melting for the immobilization of americium and curium (Am/Cm) in a glass matrix was first demonstrated in 1997. The induction melting system was developed to vitrify a non-radioactive Am/Cm simulant combined with a glass frit. Most of the development of the melter itself was completed as part of that work. This same melter system used for Am/Cm was used for the current work. The CIM system used consisted of a 5 inch (12. 7 cm) diameter inductively heated platinum-rhodium (Pt-Rh) containment vessel with a control system and offgas characterization. Scrap plutonium can contain numerous impurities including significant amounts of chlorides, fluorides, sodium, potassium, lead, gallium, chromium, and nickel. Smaller amounts of additional elements can also be present. The amount of chlorides present is unusually high for a melter feed. In commercial applications {{there is no reason to}} have chloride at such high concentrations. Because the melter operates at 1400 - 1475 C, many of the impurities present are extremely volatile. An alternative being considered is to pre-treat the impure PuO{sub 2 } by water washing to remove the soluble salts, which would significantly reduce the melter emissions. The disadvantage of the washing alternative is the criticality concerns of using water with plutonium. In this paper, the testing that has been conducted at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to demonstrate induction melting of impure plutonium simulants will be described. The work described concentrates on quantification of the gaseous and particulate emissions from the induction melter. The Pt-Rh melter vessel is a cylinder with a conical bottom and a tubular drain as shown in Figure 1. A 5 -inch (12. 7 cm) diameter CIM was used for all of the emissions tests. A 6 -inch (15. 24 cm) diameter CIM, which is the size of the full-scale melter, has since been constructed for further testing. The 5 -inch CIM is heated by three induction coils: one for the 5 inch cylinder, one for the conical section, and one for the 1 / 4 -inch (6. 35 mm) drain tube. The 6 -inch CIM is similar except the cylinder heater extends lower and also heats the cone. The induction heating system is manufactured by Ameritherm{trademark}. The heating system is controlled by a PC to maintain a specific heat up profile and then maintain a constant energy input that maintains a constant temperature. The CIM is operated in batch mode where the plutonium simulant and the glass-forming frit are first thoroughly mixed in an attrittor mill, then added to the melter. Hafnium oxide (HfO{sub 2 }) is used as a simulant for the radioactive PuO{sub 2 }. The melter is heated until the mixture begins to melt at about 1100 C, then completely melts at about 1400 - 1450 C. This temperature is maintained for about three hours. While the temperature is maintained at {approx} 1400 C, an <b>air</b> <b>bubbler</b> is normally used to promote mixing of the glass-forming frit and the waste simulant...|$|E

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> {{entrainment}} {{is defined}} as the exchange of air between the atmosphere and flowing water. Also called self-aeration, the continuous exchange between air and water is most important for the biological and chemical equilibrium on our planet. <b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment is observed in chemical, coastal, hydraulic, mechanical and nuclear engineering applications {{as well as in the}} natural environment such as waterfalls, mountain streams and river rapids, and breaking waves on the ocean surface. The resulting "white waters " provide some spectacular effects. The entrainment of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> may be localised at a flow discontinuity or continuous along an air-water free-surface: i. e., singular and interfacial aeration respectively. At a flow singularity, the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are entrained locally at the impinging perimeter and advected in a region of high turbulent shear stresses. The interfacial aeration is the <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment process along an air-water interface which is parallel to the flow direction.

40|$|The {{potential}} of textured hydrophobic surfaces to provide substantial drag reduction has {{been attributed to}} the presence of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> trapped on the surface cavities. In this paper, we present results on water flow past a textured hydrophobic surface, while systematically varying the absolute pressure close to the surface. Trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> on the surface are directly visualized, along with simultaneous pressure drop measurements across the surface in a microchannel configuration. We find that varying the absolute pressure within the channel greatly influences the trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> behavior, causing a consequent effect on the pressure drop (drag). When the absolute pressure within the channel is maintained below atmospheric pressure, we find that the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> grow in size, merge and eventually detach from the surface. This growth and subsequent merging of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> leads to a substantial increase in the pressure drop. On the other hand, a pressure above the atmospheric pressure within the channel leads to gradual shrinkage and eventual disappearance of trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> We find that in this case, <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> do cause reduction in the pressure drop with the minimum pressure drop (or maximum drag reduction) occurring when the bubbles are flush with the surface. These results show that the trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> dynamics and the pressure drop across a textured hydrophobic microchannel are very significantly dependent on the absolute pressure within the channel. The results obtained hold important implications toward achieving sustained drag reduction in microfluidic applications...|$|R

Particle detachment decreased linearly with increasing <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> velocity and decreasing liquid/vapour interfacial tension, regardless of the collector surface properties. However, particle detachment from hydrophilic, positively charged surfaces [3 -(2 -aminoethylamino) propyldimethoxysilane-coated glass, water contact angle 33 degrees] was most sensitive to variations in <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> velocity and liquid/vapour interfacial tension, while detachment from hydrophobic, negatively charged surfaces (dimethyldichlorosilane-coated glass, water contact angle 96 degrees) was affected least. The influence of <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> velocity was predominantly through the bubble/particle contact time, which needs to be long enough to allow sufficient thinning of the liquid film between the bubble and the particle for the detachment forces to become effective. On the hydrophobic collector surfaces, this thinning is assisted by a nearly spontaneous de-wetting of the collector surface, therewith decreasing the influence of other factors, such as <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> velocity or liquid/vapour interfacial tension. Upon multiple passages of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> approximately 80 % of the particles were eventually detached, regardless of {{the properties of the}} collector surfaces, illustrating that the probabilities of detachment by multiple <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> passages are additive...|$|R

In this study the single-scattering properties of inhomogeneous ice crystals containing <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are investigated. Specifically, a computational model based on an improved geometric-optics method (IGOM) has been developed to simulate the scattering of light by randomly oriented hexagonal ice crystals containing spherical or spheroidal <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> A combination of the ray-tracing technique and the Monte Carlo method is used. The effect of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> within ice crystals is to smooth the phase functions, diminish the 22 deg and 46 deg halo peaks, and substantially reduce the backscatter relative to bubble-free particles. These features vary with the number, sizes, locations and shapes of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> within ice crystals. Moreover, the asymmetry factors of inhomogeneous ice crystals decrease as the volume of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> increases. Cloud reflectance lookup tables were generated at wavelengths 0. 65 m and 2. 13 m with different air-bubble conditions to examine the impact of the bubbles on retrieving ice cloud optical thickness and effective particle size. The reflectances simulated for inhomogeneous ice crystals are slightly larger than those computed for homogenous ice crystals at a wavelength of 0. 65 microns. Thus, the retrieved cloud optical thicknesses are reduced by employing inhomogeneous ice cloud models. At a wavelength of 2. 13 microns, including <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in ice cloud models may also increase the reflectance.

Chord length data show a wide range of <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> sizes and overall the experimental results suggest strong interactions between the entrained <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and the momentum transfer mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{blemishes}} on the isochromatic fringe pattern in a stressed photoelastic model {{made from a}} "defective" photoelastic material such as an amine-hardened epoxy resin (Araldite CY 230 -HY 951) was examined. Mottling decidedly distorted the fringe pattern while the entrapped <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> did not. The possibility of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> causing perforations was very remote considering {{the size of the}} <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> vis-a-vis the specimen thickness for a 2 -dimensional analysis which was quite often not < 3 mm. Similar results were obtained with single-edge-notch specimens...|$|R

5000|$|Air pocket releaf: Without supports, {{printing}} {{parts with}} a flat surface and holes in the geometry may create <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> As the part prints, these air pockets can cause voids in the model. The support structures, in this case, create pathways through which the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> could escape.|$|R
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> {{entrainment}} in open channels {{is called}} 'white waters'. It is observed in supercritical turbulent flows. The <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> diffusion process is analysed both analytically and experimentally in uniform equilibrium flows. The {{solution of the}} diffusion equation is compared with model and prototype data. The {{results indicate that the}} turbulent diffusivity is of the same order of magnitude as the momentum transfer coefficient (i. e. eddy viscosity.). However Dt/νT is larger on models than on prototype, suggesting that model investigations might not reproduce accurately the <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> diffusion process...|$|R
40|$|The main {{mechanisms}} of air entrainment by breaking waves are spilling breakers and plunging breakers. With plunging breakers, the entrainment of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> {{is caused by}} the top of the wave forming a plunging jet and entraining air when it impacts the water in front of the wave. The potential for <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment is much greater than the spilling wave type. New experiments were performed in a two-dimensional wave basin. The breaking process was investigated with a high-speed video camera. The results provide new information on the breaking point characteristics, the jet impact conditions and the energy dissipation process. The entrainment of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> is detailed. And the rate of energy dissipation by plunging breakers is estimated. The interactions between <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment and energy dissipation mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
