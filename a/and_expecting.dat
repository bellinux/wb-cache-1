5|$|In August 1522, Martim Afonso de Melo Coutinho {{arrived at}} Tuen Mun with three ships, {{unaware of the}} {{conflict}} <b>and</b> <b>expecting</b> to meet with Chinese officials on establishing consent for a Portuguese trade base in China. Two of his ships were captured in a surprise Chinese attack, while the survivors escaped back to Portugal on the third ship (see Second Battle of Tamao). These encounters and others with the Portuguese brought the first breech-loading culverins into China, mentioned even by the philosopher and scholar-official Wang Yangming in 1519 when he suppressed Zhu Chenhao's rebellion in Jiangxi.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} value-at-risk (VaR) <b>and</b> <b>expected</b> {{shortfall}} under market stress. Assuming that the multivariate extreme value distribution represents asset returns under market stress, we simulate asset returns with this distribution. With these simulated asset returns, we examine whether market stress affects {{the properties of}} VaR <b>and</b> <b>expected</b> shortfall. Our findings are as follows. First, VaR <b>and</b> <b>expected</b> shortfall may underestimate the risk of securities with fat- tailed properties and a high potential for large losses. Second, VaR <b>and</b> <b>expected</b> shortfall may both disregard the tail dependence of asset returns. Third, expected shortfall has {{less of a problem}} in disregarding the fat tails and the tail dependence than VaR does. ...|$|R
5|$|The film's {{release was}} {{previously}} set for December 5, but hoping {{to gain a}} competitive edge amid a crowded playing field, Focus Features shifted the release date to November 1, believing the new date was ideal to launch a platform release in the awards season, <b>and</b> <b>expecting</b> to do a wide release for 5-day Thanksgiving weekend (November 27 – December 1). Because the film was an awards contender, Focus set the date in November for an Oscars strategy like that for 2013 Oscar winner Argo, which was released in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line <b>and,</b> <b>expecting</b> to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E

Pete is often deliberately insensitive towards Adam, which Thomson attributes to Pete thinking Adam is jealous of his achievements. In Series 2, Pete has an affair with co-worker Amy. It upsets his marriage to Jenny and by Series 3 they are separated. At the beginning of Series 4, they are back together <b>and</b> <b>expecting</b> a second child. After Jenny miscarries, she leaves Pete and takes little Adam with her. Pete has a rebound relationship with Jo, and marries her {{at the end of}} Series 4.

5|$|Nelson gave chase, {{but after}} {{arriving}} in the Caribbean, spent June in a fruitless search for the fleet. Villeneuve had briefly cruised around the islands before heading back to Europe, in contravention of Napoleon's orders. The returning French fleet was intercepted by a British fleet under Sir Robert Calder and engaged in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, but managed to reach Ferrol with only minor losses. Nelson returned to Gibraltar {{at the end of}} July, and travelled from there to England, dismayed at his failure to bring the French to battle <b>and</b> <b>expecting</b> to be censured. To his surprise he was given a rapturous reception from crowds who had gathered to view his arrival, while senior British officials congratulated him for sustaining the close pursuit and credited him with saving the West Indies from a French invasion. Nelson stayed briefly in London, where he was cheered wherever he went, before visiting Merton to see Emma, arriving in late August. He entertained a number of his friends and relations there over the coming month, and began plans for a grand engagement with the enemy fleet, one that would surprise his foes by forcing a pell-mell battle on them.|$|E

25|$|A Polabian prince {{was known}} as a knes. His power was {{relatively}} greater in Slavic society than those of Danish or Swedish kings in their kingdoms, although it was not absolute. He was the general leader of his tribe and was foremost among its nobles, holding much of the forested hinterland <b>and</b> <b>expecting</b> reverence from his warriors.

However, his army experienced a major defeat at the Battle of Bicocca prior to the conclave. In any case, the three French cardinals were ordered by Francis I to rush to Rome.|$|E

25|$|Guidons {{are also}} used in recruit {{training}} to identify individual platoons. First and second phase platoons have a gold background with their four-digit platoon number in scarlet, while third phase platoons have a scarlet background with gold lettering and trim. The guidon is used {{as an aid to}} instilling unit identity and pride, representing the platoon. Some drill instructors will test that pride by attempting to dishonor the guidon <b>and</b> <b>expecting</b> the recruits to intervene. Also, the recruit assigned to carry it, the guide, is treated as the most senior recruit of the platoon, and uses the guidon to marks the line of advance in close-quarters drill.|$|E

On 8 February 1808, Meleager was off Santiago de Cuba when she sent her boats, with 41 men, {{to capture the}} French felucca-rigged {{privateer}} Renard. She was armed with one long 6-pounder gun and many muskets, and had a crew of 47 men. The boat party took her without loss {{even though she was}} perfectly prepared <b>and</b> <b>expecting</b> to be attacked by the boats, given that Meleager had chased her.

25|$|Flying faster {{means that}} the {{aircraft}} passes through the range of a gun more rapidly, {{reducing the number of}} rounds a particular gun can fire at that aircraft. Flying at higher altitudes has a similar effect, as it requires larger shells to reach those altitudes, and this typically results in slower firing rates for a variety of practical reasons. Aircraft using jet engines basically double the speed and altitude of conventional designs, so limiting the number of shells that the chance of hitting the bomber essentially dropped to zero. As early as 1942, German flak commanders were keenly aware of the problem, <b>and</b> <b>expecting</b> to face jet bombers, they began a missile development program to supplant their guns.|$|E
