5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>from</b> the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E

5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>from</b> Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E
5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, {{he would be able}} to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>from</b> the author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E

At college, she sees the massive presidential {{campaign}} staged by Cook and JJ (Ollie Barbieri). She launches her own campaign to rival Cook, but finds that most of her classmates' support is for Cook's anarchist ideas. She is doubly humiliated {{in front of the}} form when Cook ridicules her and Emily subsequently stands up for her. She flees to Kieran for comfort but leaves him, shocked and disgusted, when he kisses her.

5|$|The party {{continues}} {{to travel to}} the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots. The group discovers a device that contains the alien, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who is revealed to have been helping Giygas all along. After defeating him in a fight, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness — human emotions — and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>from</b> Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.|$|E

The sketch was released on a 1985 Saturday Night Live compilation VHS that featured The Best of John Belushi, and re-released with the same title in DVD format in 2011. In his book Metapop author Michael Dunne called the comedic bit among the most well-known of all Saturday Night Live routines. The Chicago Sun-Times {{referred to it as}} an intelligent satire of Star Trek. The Los Angeles Times placed the parody among the program's top ten sketches of all-time. On the series' 40th anniversary, Tulsa World listed the sketch as one of the television show's most iconic.|$|E
