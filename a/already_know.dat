5|$|The {{second step}} is a Teach/Learn session where the {{instructor}} begins to present information {{based on what}} the participants don't <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> This is usually prefixed with a written statement describing in behavioral terms the objectives that the participant will complete during the session. The instructor may utilize more advanced members to help less skilled members. The instructor often tries to elicit information from the participants' experience by asking questions.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England {{to visit}} {{the leaders of the}} Chartists, a socialist {{movement}} in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842 to August 1844. Not only did Engels <b>already</b> <b>know</b> the English language, he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders. Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers. Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the council took place on 21 March 1148 at Reims Cathedral on a Sunday. Eugene and his attendants had arrived in Reims by 9 March. The main {{business}} of the council was the debate {{on a number of}} canons, or rules, for the church that would be announced. Most of these were not new decrees, having been promulgated by Eugene's predecessor at the councils of Reims in 1131 and at the Lateran council of 1139. All of the proposed canons were approved, except for one on clerical attire which was opposed by Rainald of Dassel and other German ecclesiastics. This canon had prohibited cloaks made of fur. Another canon condemning clerical marriage was greeted with amusement, as the council members felt that all clergy should <b>already</b> <b>know</b> that marriage was forbidden to them.|$|E

5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they <b>already</b> <b>know</b> to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

25|$|Foreign {{citizens}} and stateless students are enrolled {{on the same}} principle as Serbian citizens are.

25|$|Further explanation: Speakers who {{use this}} {{intonation}} pattern {{do not do}} so categorically, but instead also end many questions with a rising pitch. Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes/no questions for which they already are quite sure of the answer. So, a speaker uttering the above example is simply confirming what they think they <b>already</b> <b>know,</b> that yes, the person they're talking to is painting his/her garage.|$|E
25|$|Often {{described}} as the opposite of déjà vu, jamais vu involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing {{that he or she}} has been in the situation before. Jamais vu is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> Jamais vu is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Bottom-up approach: Once we {{formulate}} {{the solution}} to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we <b>already</b> <b>know</b> the values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42.|$|E

25|$|As Part Two begins, it {{is assumed}} that the literate classes of Spain have all read {{the first part of the}} story. Cervantes's meta-fictional device was to make even the {{characters}} in the story familiar with the publication of Part One, as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person, they <b>already</b> <b>know</b> their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of Part One) that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.|$|E
25|$|The International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) {{was founded}} in 1924 by Alice Vanderbilt Morris; like the earlier Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language, its mission was to study {{language}} problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. Interlingua, published in 1951, was primarily the work of Alexander Gode, though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including André Martinet, and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano's Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen's Novial, von Walh's Occidental (Interlingue), and the Academy's Idiom Neutral. Like Occidental, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who <b>already</b> <b>know</b> a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Occidental, though still less than in any natural language.|$|E
25|$|Wandering {{alone in}} the forest, the empress (she is given no name in this romance) lies tired and {{exhausted}} at a spring one evening and falls asleep. In the morning, as the dawn chorus begins, an ape suddenly emerges from the forest and steals away one of her babies. Then a lioness appears and takes away the other in its mouth. The woman is distraught! She assumes that she is being punished for her sins and undertakes to journey to the Holy Land, so she travels to the Aegean Sea and takes a ship bound for Jerusalem. On the way, the crew stop at an island to take on fresh water and encounter a lioness suckling a human baby. The empress goes ashore and finds her own baby being treated by the lioness as her cub (a griffin – we <b>already</b> <b>know</b> – had snatched away the lioness shortly after it stole the child {{and took it to}} this island, where the lioness had killed it). The empress returns to the ship with her child and the lioness follows. They all arrive in Jerusalem where the King recognises the lady for who she is, names her little boy Octavian and allows her to stay, with her child and her lioness, in wealth and comfort.|$|E
