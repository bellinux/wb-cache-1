5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was <b>also</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E

5|$|Worms Armageddon was {{originally}} intended to be an expansion pack to Worms 2, but it was eventually developed as a standalone game. It {{was intended to be}} the last game of the Worms franchise, but Andy Davidson, the creator of Worms, felt that it needed more content before being released, leading to the development of Worms World Party. It was <b>also</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be released under the name Wormageddon, but Team17 changed the name to Worms Armageddon because of close similarities to {{the name of the game}} Carmageddon. It was released initially for PCs in 1999 in Europe and on 31 May 1999 in North America and has since been ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation on 30 November 1999, Game Boy Color on 19 January 2000, and Nintendo 64 on 30 March 2000. The Nintendo 64 version is one of the first Nintendo 64 games to feature a terrain editor and generator. A Macintosh version was being developed by MacSoft, but it has since been cancelled. Worms Armageddon was produced by Martyn Brown and composed by Bjørn Lynne, Karl Morton was the game's lead programmer, and Dan Cartwright was the game's lead artist.|$|E

25|$|The Capacity Enhancement Program has a {{much larger}} scope and is {{considering}} more drastic ways to increase runway capacity. On December 30, 2010, a 13-year $5.2 billion project that would have extended the two main runways and added one new runway {{was passed by the}} FAA.

The project was <b>also</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> relocate the UPS facility and redevelop cargo city, the cargo complex at PHL. The redesigned UPS facility would have required demolition of several houses of nearby Tinicum Township. But after much resistance by the residents of those homes, an agreement was made to keep the homes and expand the airport elsewhere. The new project will now cost $6.4 billion.|$|E
25|$|The two leads, Hansard and Irglová, {{are both}} {{professional}} musicians. Director Carney, former bassist for Hansard's band The Frames, had asked his long-time friend to share busker anecdotes and compose songs for the film, but had intended the male lead {{to be played}} by actor Cillian Murphy, who was an almost-signed rock musician before turning to acting. Murphy was <b>also</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of the}} film's producers. But Murphy declined the prospect of acting opposite non-actor Irglová (then 17 years old) and also felt that he hadn't the vocal capabilities to belt out Hansard's octave-leaping songs, so he pulled out, as did the film's other producers along with their financial resources. Carney then turned to songwriter Hansard, who'd previously done only one acting job, a supporting role as guitarist Outspan Foster in the 1991 ensemble film The Commitments, the story of a Dublin soul music cover band. Hansard was initially reluctant, fearing that he wouldn't be able to pull it off, but after stipulating that he had to be fully involved in the filmmaking process and that it be low-budget and intimate, he agreed.|$|E
