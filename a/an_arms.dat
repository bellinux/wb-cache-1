5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon was in <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, {{and the same}} serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> race against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, 1985, Israel sent 96 American-made TOW {{missiles}} to Iran through <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar. Subsequently, on September 14, 1985, 408 more TOW missiles were delivered. On September 15, 1985, following the second delivery, Reverend Benjamin Weir {{was released by}} his captors, the Islamic Jihad Organization.|$|E
5|$|The International is a 2009 German–American {{political}} thriller drama film {{directed by}} Tom Tykwer. The film follows an Interpol agent and an American district attorney who investigate corruption within the IBBC, a fictional merchant bank based in Luxembourg. It serves organized crime and corrupt governments as a banker and as <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> broker. The bank's ruthless managers assassinate potential threats including their own employees.|$|E
50|$|The {{ranks of}} Marshal of <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> and Chief Marshal of <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> {{were used in}} five Soviet {{military}} branches (the Air Force, Artillery, Tank Forces, Engineer Forces, and Signal Forces). These ranks were established in 1943. Marshal of <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> was equivalent to General of the Army.|$|R

50|$|Herbert's successor, in 1792, was Lieutenant John Tucker. Placentia {{was rated}} as <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> sloop, {{and then as}} <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> ship. In 1794 Lieutenant Alexander Shippard (or Sheppard) assumed command.|$|R
5|$|Bond {{returns to}} Bratislava {{to track down}} the cellist, Kara Milovy. He determines that Koskov's entire {{defection}} was staged, and that Kara is actually Koskov's girlfriend. Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskov's and persuades her to accompany him to Vienna, supposedly to be reunited with him. They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB, crossing over the border into Austria. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} area around the Bastille {{developed}} further. Early modern Paris continued to grow, {{and by the end of}} the century it had around 250,000 inhabitants and was one of the most populous cities in Europe, though still largely contained within its old city walls – open countryside remained beyond the Bastille. The Arsenal, a large military-industrial complex tasked with the production of cannons and other weapons for the royal armies, was established to the south of the Bastille by Francis I, and substantially expanded under Charles IX. <b>An</b> <b>arms</b> depot was later built above the Porte Saint-Antoine, all making the Bastille part of a major military centre.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, his widow, Elizabeth, had an Episcopal church {{designed}} by Edward Tuckerman Potter {{built as a}} memorial to Samuel Colt and the three children they lost. The church's architecture contains guns and gun-smithing tools sculpted in marble to commemorate Colt's life as <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> maker. In 1896 a parish house {{was built on the}} site as a memorial to their son, Caldwell who died in 1894. In 1975 the Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|Later in the day, 19 KLA {{fighters were}} wounded when the VJ shelled <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> {{smuggling}} route {{near the site}} of the ambush. They were evacuated by Albanian border guards and airlifted to receive treatment in the country's capital, Tirana. Albanian officials later alleged that two of the mortar rounds fired by Yugoslav troops had landed inside Albania, sparking further tension between the two countries. That afternoon, KLA militants attacked a Yugoslav border patrol, wounding another soldier.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February 1988, The Observer {{published}} an article naming Mardas as <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> dealer, but printed an apology on 30 April 1989. After an article on 18 September 1988 ("Joan's Secret Lover"), and another a week later, The People newspaper was taken to court by Mardas, who won £75,000 in damages. The Daily Mail {{published an}} apology and gave an undisclosed sum in damages on 16 January 2004, after an article on 11 June 2003, which accused Mardas of dealings that would later resurface in his claim against The New York Times in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War. Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting {{that it could have been}} the explosion of <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} community made repeated unsuccessful attempts {{to end the}} fighting. Both sides violated ceasefires, often within hours. Calls by some European Community members for the Western European Union to intervene militarily were vetoed by the United Kingdom. Instead, a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington {{to find a way}} to end the conflict. The United Nations (UN) imposed <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> embargo on all of the Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under Security Council Resolution 713, but this was ineffective, in part because the JNA had no need to import weapons. The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|The various rebel {{movements}} eventually {{succeeded in}} ousting the government altogether {{in the ensuing}} civil war that reached a climax in January 1991. Amid the chaos that surrounded Barre's flight from the capital, {{the remnants of the}} Somali National Armed Forces dissolved. In 1992, the 15-member Security Council imposed <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> embargo via United Nations Security Council Resolution 733 in order to stop the flow of weapons to feuding militia groups. Much equipment was left in situ, deteriorating, and was sometimes discovered and photographed by intervention forces in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
50|$|International law recognizes a {{right of}} self-defence, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) affirmed in the Nicaragua Case {{on the use of}} force. Some {{commentators}} believe that the effect of Article 51 is only to preserve this right when <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack occurs, and that other acts of self-defence are banned by article 2(4). The more widely held opinion is that article 51 acknowledges this general right, and proceeds to lay down procedures for the specific situation when <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack does occur. Under the latter interpretation, the legitimate use of self-defence in situations when <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack has not actually occurred is still permitted. It is also to be noted that not every act of violence will constitute <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack. The ICJ has tried to clarify, in the Nicaragua case, what level of force is necessary to qualify as <b>an</b> <b>armed</b> attack.|$|R
50|$|Thus {{there is}} still a right of {{self-defence}} under customary international law, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) affirmed in the Nicaragua Case on the use of force.

5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying {{that he would be}} guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted <b>an</b> <b>Arms</b> and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1958, {{outer space}} {{has been the}} subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> {{grant of}} <b>arms</b> is {{distinguished}} from both <b>a</b> confirmation of <b>arms</b> and <b>a</b> registration of <b>arms.</b> <b>A</b> grant of <b>arms</b> confers <b>a</b> new right, whereas <b>a</b> confirmation of <b>arms</b> confirms <b>an</b> existing right; and <b>a</b> registration of <b>arms</b> is <b>a</b> record {{which does not}} purport to create or confirm any legal right.|$|R

5|$|Early in development, it {{was decided}} that the Jaguar should be offered for export. In 1969, while still in the {{prototype}} stage of development, formal approaches had been made to Switzerland, India, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale. Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar, but these plans failed {{in part because of the}} high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition. Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not transfer into orders. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead firmed up for F1s. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s.|$|E

The skin of Danzig's body also becomes translucent after he dies. When forensics comes on the scene, Olivia and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) appear and take the agent's body without revealing their intentions. Lincoln follows Olivia to the lab, where he is introduced to the Fringe division. Despite Olivia attempting to keep Lincoln away, he continues to follow the investigation as they discover another victim killed in a similar manner. From a witness, they learn about {{the appearance of the}} killer, but are unable to identify him by name.|$|E
5|$|Hawke {{starred in}} the 2005 action thriller Assault on Precinct 13, a loose remake of John Carpenter's 1976 film of the same title, with an updated plot. The film {{received}} ambivalent reviews; some critics praised the dark swift feel of the film, while others compared it unfavorably to John Carpenter's original. Hawke also appeared that year in the political crime thriller Lord of War, playing an Interpol agent chasing <b>an</b> <b>arms</b> dealer played by Nicolas Cage. In 2006, Hawke was cast in a supporting role in Fast Food Nation, directed by Richard Linklater based on Eric Schlosser's best-selling 2001 book. The same year Hawke directed his second feature, The Hottest State, based on his eponymous 1996 novel. The film was released in August 2007 to a tepid reception.|$|E
