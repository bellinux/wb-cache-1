5|$|According to Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Ricberht murdered Eorpwald of East Anglia {{in about}} 627, shortly after Eorpwald succeeded his father Rædwald as king and had then been baptised as a Christian. Following Eorpwald's death, Ricberht {{may have become}} king, <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> is not {{mentioned}} by Bede or any contemporary commentator. East Anglia then reverted to paganism for three years, before Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded jointly as kings of East Anglia and ended the kingdom's brief period of apostasy.|$|E
5|$|An older feast, {{held by the}} {{fishermen}} {{towards the end of}} December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There is <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run {{against the backdrop of the}} Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing stingrays and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi assumed a more conciliatory attitude following his defeat. On the other side, Habré also found himself vulnerable, as the French {{feared that the}} attack on Maatan as-Sarrah was only {{the first stage of}} a general offensive into Libya proper, <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> France was not disposed to tolerate. As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury {{took charge}} at Los Alamos at a {{difficult}} time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor {{and there was}} <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell's programme, {{assisted}} by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, {{was not merely}} against the clergy {{and the power of}} Rome. He persuaded Henry that safety from political alliances that Rome might attempt to bring together lay in negotiations with the German Lutheran princes. There also seemed to be <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E

5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although there is <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, {{it is also possible that}} they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, James Mangold {{stated that}} with the {{introduction}} of Laura / X-23 in Logan, there is <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the character will appear in future films. Later that month, Kinberg said that a film for Laura Kinney / X-23 is in development. By October of the same year, it was announced that script is being co-written by Craig Kyle and James Mangold; creator of the character, and director of The Wolverine and Logan, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> {{he or she may}} be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal {{plaintiff}} in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing {{on the part of the}} individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E

5|$|The Singapore Stone is a {{fragment}} of a large sandstone slab which originally stood {{at the mouth of}} the Singapore River. The large slab, which is believed to date back to at least the 13th century and possibly as early as the 10th or 11th century, bore an undeciphered inscription. Recent theories suggest that the inscription is either in Old Javanese or in Sanskrit, which suggested <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the island was an extension of the Majapahit civilisation in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{projected}} {{attack on}} Aouzou never took place, as {{the dimensions of}} the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear that the attack on the Libyan base was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> France was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.|$|E
5|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred during}} filming. On the first, seven bullet holes were shot {{into one of}} the trucks used during production. On the second, the cast and crew were driving from the set, and a pedestrian was shot in the neck outside a supermarket. The ambulance took 35–45 minutes to arrive, and waited a further 35–45 minutes for the police to arrive. The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there was <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> rival gangmembers would shoot at the paramedics for trying to resuscitate the victim.|$|E

5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E
5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted that there was <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{detected}} in New Zealand {{in the port}} of Timaru, South Island in 2002. This was the first incident of C.mutica being reported in the southern hemisphere. Since then, more well-established populations of C.mutica {{have been found in}} Port Lyttelton in 2006, and in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington Harbour in 2007. Additional specimens were also recovered from the hulls of vessels in other ports, though they did not seem to have established colonies in the ports themselves. Genetic studies of the New Zealand populations suggests <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> these were secondarily introduced from non-native populations of C.mutica in the Atlantic through ballast water in the sea chests of international shipping.|$|E

5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Liza was {{the third}} {{hurricane}} of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from {{an area of the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 28 and reaching tropical storm strength in the same day, Liza meandered generally westward over the Pacific Ocean, reaching hurricane strength on August 29 while far from land. It maintained that intensity until September 2, when the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, but avoided tropical depression status despite the presentation seen by an Air Force reconnaissance plane. After weakening, the storm moved northwestward, weakening to a depression on September 4, when it began a turn to the east. There is <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the depression completed a small loop between the downgrade and its dissipation on September 6.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1995, the band {{underwent}} changes on the business side. Manager Ron Lafitte was hired by EMI Records and essentially disbanded his management company. Megadeth later signed with ESP Management and hired Bud Prager, a previous manager of Foreigner and Bad Company, to be the band's new creative manager. As with Max Norman before him, Prager {{would go on to}} be highly influential in shaping the direction of the band. In an interview for Hard Rock Examiner, Mustaine revealed that there is <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> Megadeth are going to perform the album in its entirety in 2014, honoring the 20-year anniversary of the record's release.|$|E
