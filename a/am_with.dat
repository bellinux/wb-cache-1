5|$|The Austrian troops {{advanced}} from Alessandria eastwards {{across the}} Bormida river by two bridges debouching {{in a narrow}} bend of the river (the river being not easily crossed elsewhere). Poor Austrian staff work prevented any rapid development of their attack and the entire army had to file through a narrow bridgehead.

5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 <b>a.m.,</b> <b>with</b> Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E

5|$|After {{the third}} {{counter-insurgency}} operation, {{a battalion of}} the Croatian Home Guard was stationed on Mrakovica, a peak in Kozara. Stojanović ordered an attack by five companies of the 2nd Krajina Detachment on the battalion, which began on 5December 1941 at 5:30 am. The battle ended by 9:30 <b>am</b> <b>with</b> a decisive victory to the Partisans. They lost five men, while 78 Home Guards were killed and around 200 were captured. The Partisans seized 155 rifles, 12 light and 6 heavy machine guns, 4 mortars, 120 mortar rounds, and 19,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The last action of the 2nd Krajina Detachment under Stojanović's command was the battle of Turjak. Four companies of the detachment attacked and captured the village on 16December 1941, taking 134 Home Guards prisoner. Letters written by the Home Guards to their families revealed their extremely low morale. The capture of Turjak opened up the district of Gradiška to the Kozara Partisans. The Home Guards retreated from Podgradci without significant resistance. Soon, most of the district was under Partisan control and Stojanović's detachment controlled most of Mount Kozara and the surrounding Potkozarje region.|$|E
