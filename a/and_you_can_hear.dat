500|$|The song {{starts with}} an {{electric}} guitar riff comparable {{to the music of}} English alternative rock band Oasis. The chords harmonize with each other, continuing for 22 seconds. The techno melody then begins, consisting of a main synth sound oscillating on the primary musical note, with the EQ moving between the bass and the treble. The [...] "restless" [...] beat is accompanied by a rock-inspired chord riff, with Madonna's pitch being higher than the other tracks from the album. While recording, Orbit kept [...] "Ray of Light" [...] a semitone higher than the singer's limit, resulting in a strain added to the vocals. [...] "She got frustrated when we were recording but you want that bit of edge with singers, that thing of reaching. You can't fake it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> it when she cracks it on the record," [...] he recalled. Before the final chorus there is a synth solo again, reminiscent of a 1970s pro-rock record. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, this was a link to the origin of the song from [...] "Sepheryn".|$|E
500|$|Life is Good {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 30 reviews. Kevin Perry of NME called it [...] "a grimy, back-to-basics return to form", while Pitchforks Jayson Greene said Nas had [...] "settled gracefully into strengths", Slant Magazines Manan Desai said Nas sounded [...] "inspired" [...] and praised the album's [...] "narrative unity" [...] as [...] "a wide-angle {{look of the}} artist as a grown man." [...] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club deemed Nas' lyrics [...] "beautifully expressed" [...] and the music just [...] "as thoughtful". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "thoughtful, fierce, honest and – most important – heavy-duty work" [...] and stated, [...] "Nas has gotten better at rolling with the punches – <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> it in every verse". Carl Chery from XXL said it is [...] "arguably Nas' best LP since Stillmatic" [...] and asserted, [...] "At this juncture—21 years and 10 solo albums in—no other MC has ever rhymed at such a high level this deep into their career." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{played his}} trumpet sparsely {{throughout}} the concert, often sounding {{obscured by the}} rhythm section. His presence on Agharta reflected what John Szwed called [...] "the feel and shape of a musician's late work, an egoless music that precedes its creator's death". Drawing on Theodor W. Adorno's commentary of Ludwig van Beethoven's late works, Szwed said [...] "the disappearance of the musician into the work is a bow to mortality. It was as if Miles were testifying to all {{that he had been}} witness to for the past thirty years, both terrifying and joyful." [...] After Lucas' first and only solo of the show climaxed the [...] "Ife" [...] segment, Davis introduced [...] "Wili (= For Dave)" [...] with a few organ chords, culminating in Cosey's final solo and a trumpet passage by Davis, which Paul Tingen characterized as plaintive and introspective. According to him, live music shows typically developed toward reaching a final climax, but Davis' concerts [...] "often dissolved into entropy". On Agharta, Tingen said, a [...] "deep sadness" [...] hung over the music as the energy of the [...] "Wili (= For Dave)" [...] piece [...] "slowly drained away" [...] to the record's fade out. The Japanese CD edition ended with nine more minutes of atmospheric feedback, percussion, and synthesizer sounds. Tingen wrote that {{by the time of the}} second concert, the band's level of energy had diminished significantly, and Davis sounded particularly absent. As Mtume recalled, [...] "he became ill in the evening, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the difference in the energy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cheryl {{has named}} Britney Spears and Beyoncé {{as a few}} of her inspirations, {{performance}} and fashion-wise. She spoke on the reason Beyoncé was an influence on her, saying, [...] "I love Beyoncé, I just think she is such a beautiful person inside and out, apart from what she does on the stage which is obviously incredible and aspiration. I just like her as a woman. She's empowering." [...] She has cited Lisa [...] "Left Eye"' Lopes, a former member of American band TLC, as another influence saying, [...] "I wanted to be [...] – I used to wear baggy jeans and Timberlands like a tomboy." [...] Other influences she has cited are Rihanna, whom she described as [...] "a perfect pop star", and Mary J. Blige, saying, [...] "Mary's voice sounds so grown up <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> that she has experienced a lot in her life, her songs help me with every heartache." [...] Cheryl has influenced other artists, including Selena Gomez.|$|E
2500|$|When the Arvizo {{family and}} Jackson were on good terms, their mother, Janet, {{allegedly}} encouraged {{her children to}} call Jackson [...] "Daddy." [...] Janet, who also went by the names Janet Ventura and Janet Jackson, was identified as the most problematic of the prosecution witnesses. Besides her credibility issues, her behavior in the courtroom was widely criticized. Roger Friedman reported, [...] "it's pretty clear that she's mentally ill in some way" [...] and that [...] "when she first starts testifying, she's very sedate, and as time goes by, and possibly medication wears off, she becomes crazier and crazier, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> people in the courtroom saying 'here it comes.'" [...] On a few occasions, the courtroom erupted in laughter over her answers. After the trial, jurors criticized her habit of snapping her fingers and staring at them. She was often unresponsive even to the prosecution, was defensive over seemingly small issues, and was admonished by the judge for arguing. [...] She used repeated catchphrases such as, [...] "It's burned inside my memory," [...] and [...] "Money doesn't buy happiness." [...] She often answered questions with tangential speeches addressed directly to the jury, the press, or the defendant. [...] Defense attorney Tom Mesereau refused to object to her rambling and emotional diatribes, which resulted in prosecutor Sneddon repeatedly objecting to his own witness's answers. It was also revealed that Janet Arvizo had enrolled all three of her children in acting classes and had accused a JC Penney security guard of sexually molesting her in 1998. In February 2006, Janet Arvizo was convicted of welfare fraud for failing to report the $150,000 civil settlement in that case. She was sentenced to 150 {{hours of community service}} and an $8,600 fine.|$|E
2500|$|Queen {{said she}} {{released}} Sentimiento in March around her birthday {{as a gift}} to herself because it [...] "represents my growth as a woman and my soul". Sentimiento was released on March 27, 2007. A platinum edition of the CD was released on November 20, 2007. It was announced in July 2007 that the platinum edition would be a fourth-quarter release. Queen described the platinum re-release as a [...] "double record". She explained that [...] "one of them is a CD with six new tracks and others themes," [...] while the second is a DVD [...] "where you can see pictures and music videos, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> my family talking about me and who I am. The audience will see that I am a normal woman and my favorite pastime is not sailing on a yacht, but being close to my people". Both versions were re-released digitally on December 9, 2011 by Univision Records. On August 26, 2012, the album was released digitally in France. Queen performed the lead single, [...] "Que Lloren" [...] at the 2007 Latin Grammy Awards ceremony, dressed as [...] "geisha—well, the reggaetón version of a geisha—and was surrounded by a Japanese masked ensemble," [...] according to Tijana Ilich, who selected it as the cleverest act of the night. She performed [...] "En Que Fallamos" [...] on Don Francisco Presenta on Univision in August 2007. Queen then embarked on the [...] "Sentimiento World Tour" [...] in late 2007. In 2008, Queen released a live album entitled Ivy Queen 2008 World Tour LIVE!, which was recorded during one of her concerts at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico on November 30, 2007. Among the songs performed were [...] "Que Lloren", [...] "En Que Fallamos", [...] "Corazón Anestesiado", [...] "Reza Por Mi", [...] "Dime Si Recuerdas", [...] "Pobre Corazón" [...] and [...] "Sentimientos", among other songs and collaborations previous recorded for other albums.|$|E

I went exploring there this morning. It's an enormous place, with hot-houses and things, and there's the cunningest farm at one end with a stable yard full of puppies that just tear the heart out of you, they're so sweet.

I felt like crying, I believe, or dancing, or jumping clean over the Nelson Column. I was like a fellow caught up out of Hell and flung down into the dandiest part of Heaven. Then I spotted for a hansom with a spanking horse. 'A shilling for yourself if you're there in twenty minutes!' said I to the jarvey.

[...] "Il y a de l'eau," [...] people have said, with an emphasis, as if that settled the question, which, for a French mind, I am rather led to think it does. And Grez, when we get there, is indeed a place worthy of some praise. It lies out of the forest, a cluster of houses, with an old bridge, an old castle in ruin, and a quaint old church. The inn garden descends in terraces to the river; stableyard, kailyard, orchard, and a space of lawn, fringed with rushes and embellished with a green arbour. On the opposite bank there is a reach of English-looking plain, set thickly with willows and poplars. And between the two lies the river, clear and deep, and full of reeds and floating lilies. Water-plants cluster about the starlings of the long low bridge, and stand half-way up upon the piers in green luxuriance. They catch the dipped oar with long antennæ, and chequer the slimy bottom with the shadow of their leaves. And the river wanders hither and thither among the islets, and is smothered and broken up by the reeds, like an old building in the lithe, hardy arms of the climbing ivy. You may watch the box where the good man of the inn keeps fish alive for his kitchen, one oily ripple following another {{over the top of}} the yellow deal. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> a splashing and a prattle of voices from the shed under the old kirk, where the village women wash and wash all day among the fish and water-lilies. It seems as if linen washed there should be specially cool and sweet.|$|E
