The movement aims for general reforms in the political scene and achieving some of those procedures and guarantees necessitates the <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> 76, 77, and 88 of the constitution as soon as possible.

40|$|In their development, some {{countries}} have implemented electronic notarial deeds in their national legal system, {{especially in the}} need for the guarantee of the authenticity in electronic information. The provision which regulates authentic deeds is in UUJN (Notarial Act) and in the Civil Code which indicates that the use of notarial deeds and the drawing up authentic deeds are difficult to be implemented since there is no change in the understanding of authentic deeds stipulated in the notarial Act and in Law on ITE. The result of the research showed that the drawing up electronic deeds had become the beachhead of legal ground. For example, Article 15, paragraph 3 of UUJN and Article 17 of UUPT, include registration of electronic fiduciary deeds, registration of Notary electronically, <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> of association of legal entity, etc. The obstacles of drawing up electronic deeds are influenced by some factors such as legal substance, legal structure, and legal culture...|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} part of {{the debate}} on the reasons for the integration thrust in the 1980 s is based on the not always precise differentiation between statements on the origins of political initiatives, the corresponding agenda setting, the mediation of interests and thus the transformation of the initiative and its adoption. This is shown with the often undifferentiated use of the terms ‘ 1992 Initiative’, ‘EC reform’, ‘Single European Act’ (SEA), etc. Furthermore, the origins of political initiatives and the prerequisites for their success (or failure) are often imprecisely distinguished from each other. This chapter chronologically and logically follows chapter 1 in that it reconstructs the process of the construction of a successful package deal, the Luxembourg package, by making reference to the analysis of the causal factors of the integration relaunch. The Luxembourg package is hereby defined as the entirety of the agreements on the insertion or <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> in the EC treaties, as they were formulated during the intergovernmental conference in 1985, which together form the Single Act and which were adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1986. The first section presents some theoretical considerations on the conditions for success of a package deal. The following section describes important integration projects and processes for forming alliances. The first six months in 1984 are seen as the ‘take-off’ phase for the SEA. The Commission's changing role, its actual ‘rebirth’ {{as a result of an}} altered situation and as a precondition for the creation of a negotiation package, is then discussed...|$|E
