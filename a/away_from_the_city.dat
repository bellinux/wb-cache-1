5|$|Three {{industrial}} zones {{were placed}} {{adjacent to the}} port {{in the northern part}} of the city, taking into account the prevailing southern winds which take air pollution <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The plan had its problems, however, including asymmetric growth of upscale and poorer neighborhoods and the long-time lack of a main business and administrative center.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, {{after the}} city's {{residents}} had endured {{a spike in}} crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. In downtown Fairbanks, overcrowding, traffic problems, and drunken rambunctiousness caused by pipeline workers pushed businesses to move into malls built away from downtown. New commercial centers like Gavora Mall, Bentley Mall, and others <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> center drove the construction of freeways that bypassed downtown Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered too far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed {{to be made by}} ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the reunification}} of Jerusalem in 1967, the city {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, weaning customers <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The advent of television precipitated the closure {{of most of the}} Triangle's cinemas. The Zion Cinema closed in 1972 and was demolished. In its place, a high-rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel (on the upper floors) and a branch of Bank Hapoalim (on the lower floors) was erected.|$|E
5|$|Fulfordgate {{was located}} in the {{south-east}} of York, <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre. It was a large distance from York railway station, while the tram service to Fulford only had one track, and the loop system for tramcars passing each other further restricted the service. During the ground's existence, bus routes had not been fully developed and car ownership was not yet become common; {{it was not easy}} for the majority of supporters to reach.|$|E

5|$|Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people. This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more people moved <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> each year than moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number {{but not enough to}} offset the losses due to migration.|$|E

5|$|Chile, {{facing the}} Pacific Ocean, {{has a large}} British presence. Over 50,000 British {{immigrants}} settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes Province, especially {{in the city of}} Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Strait of Magellan. Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> or back to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the reunification}} of Jerusalem in 1967, the city {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, drawing customers <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged, and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and Haredi Jews who did not patronize the Triangle. The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants, dollar stores, and money changers. The advent of television precipitated the closure {{of most of the}} Triangle's cinemas.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly {{from one to another}} and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are {{the focal point of the}} neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{designed}} as part of Pentonville, a new suburb <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> and became a local hub for manufacturing in the area. There was some debate over the final route of the road; the original plan to run straight through fields owned by the Skinners Company and the New River Company was rejected in favour of the route further north via Battle Bridge. As it was always {{intended to be a}} main road, a coach service began in 1798 between Paddington and Bank but was quickly withdrawn. The road was turnpiked in 1830 and renamed Pentonville Road after landowner Henry Penton in 1857. Until 1882, the upkeep of the road was paid by the local parish, paying a ground rent to Penton's estate for the disused toll house at No.274.|$|E
5|$|The {{urban area}} has a {{population}} density of 3035/km2 (7,864/mi²), while the rural and suburban areas have a density of 355.5/km2 (920/mi²). The rural areas <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> tend to be scarcely populated, becoming denser near it. During the summer the resident population in the city triples; this seasonal movement from neighbouring cities {{is due to the}} draw of the beach and 29.9% of homes had seasonal use in 2001, the highest in Greater Porto. Póvoa de Varzim is the youngest city in the region with a birth rate of 13.665 and mortality rate of 8.330. Unlike other urban areas of greater Porto, it is not a satellite city. Significant commuting occurs only with Vila do Conde, an urban expansion area of Póvoa since the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|A more {{coherent}} Walter explains that, {{according to}} the Observer September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled {{back in time to}} take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an antimatter device to wipe out the Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find the equipment to free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's hand for an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of licorice, a telltale sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as a necklace.|$|E
5|$|Much of the city's {{housing stock}} was damaged during the war. The {{wreckage}} was cleared {{in an attempt}} {{to improve the quality of}} dwellings after the war, though before permanent accommodation could be built, Portsmouth City Council built prefabs for those who had lost their homes. Between 1945 and 1947, more than 700 prefab houses were constructed– some were erected over bomb sites. The first permanent houses were built <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre to new developments such as Paulsgrove and Leigh Park, with construction of council estates in Paulsgrove being completed in 1953. In Leigh Park, the first housing estates were completed in 1949, though building work in the area continued until 1974. Developers still occasionally find unexploded bombs in the area, such as on the site of the destroyed Hippodrome theatre in 1984. Despite improvements made by the city council to build new accommodation, a survey made in 1955 concluded that 7000 houses in Portsmouth were unfit for human habitation. Following a controversial decision, a whole section of central Portsmouth, including Landport, Somerstown and Buckland, was demolished and replaced by council housing during the 1960s and early 1970s. The success of the project and the quality of the 70s homes are debatable.|$|E
