5000|$|According to Erik Sakkov, {{board member}} of Tallinn Airport, the future plans include {{expanding}} the runway by 600-700 metres to serve regular long-haul flights, also building of a brand-new taxiway, new storage facilities, a new point-to-point terminal and expansion of the existing passenger terminal, so it can serve arriving and departing passengers on two different levels. On 21 February 2013 the environmental impact assessment of the airport development project started. The project includes the runway lengthening by 720 metres, installation of the ILS Category II equipment, also lengthening of the existing northern taxiway {{till the end of}} the expanded runway, constructing of a whole new taxiway and a new apron area on the southern side of the <b>airport,</b> <b>installation</b> of the new perimeter security systems and constructing of an engine test facility and dedicated snow storage and de-icing areas. Among other benefits the extension would enable planes to fly higher above the city of Tallinn by moving threshold of the runway further from Lake Ülemiste, thus reducing noise level.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, all <b>airport</b> <b>installations</b> were {{dismantled}} in 1919.|$|R
50|$|Nordholz Naval Airbase {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{airports}} in Germany, dating to 17 December 1912. Construction of the <b>airport</b> <b>installations</b> started a year later and was finished in 1914.|$|R

5000|$|In 1939 the Italian Government of Benito Mussolini {{was granted}} {{authorization}} by the Portuguese colonial government to begin construction on a transit airport to service its flights flying between Europe and South America. Very simple pre-fabricated facilities were built. However, {{as a consequence}} of World War II, the Italian involvement in the airport project ceased. In 1945 the Portuguese purchased the <b>airport</b> <b>installation</b> from the Italians and by 1949 the Ilha do Sal airport was a fully operational transit facility. The airport has been gradually improved ever since. Small houses were erected in several areas immediately adjacent to the airport. Near Morro Curral, workers from nearby Sao Nicolau named the civilian area [...] "Preguiça" [...] after the port village on their home island. Espargos is the city's official name. No longer after the airport opened, the track became the island's first paved road and was basalt. Since 1977, Espargos has been the principal commercial and government center of the island. [...] The island's Catholic parish seat did not move and remained in Santa Maria.|$|E
50|$|Nordholz {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{airports}} in Germany, dating to 17 December 1912. Construction of the <b>airport</b> <b>installations</b> started a year later and was finished in 1914. Until 2016 it was in military use. For the naval airbase, see Nordholz Naval Airbase.|$|R
50|$|In July 1961, the {{regiment}} jumped over Bizerte {{and broke the}} Tunisian siege of the French <b>airport</b> <b>installations.</b> The regiment was then dissolved on 5 July 1962 and recreated 1 January 1965 in Ivato, Madagascar from the 5th Marine Infantry Parachute Battalion 5e BPIM.|$|R

40|$|Air cargo {{represents}} an increasingly significant {{share of the}} transport market. In addition to mail, express, and emergency cargoes, air transportation is being used for the new market niches of perishable commodities and just-in-time deliveries. The transport and processing of these cargoes is performed by a specialized system that includes dedicated loading units, transport modes, equipment, <b>airport</b> <b>installations,</b> and commercial organization. An overview of this system focuses {{on the design of}} airport cargo facilities, describes an analytical method that allows the sizing of storage facilities with low computational effort, and refers to modeling approaches (mainly simulation-based) {{that can be used for}} a detailed investigation of various air cargo terminal design aspects...|$|R
50|$|The CTX-9000 DSi {{system is}} the world's fastest FAA-certified Explosives Detection System, {{handling}} 542 bags per hour. It features alternate operational modes yielding even higher throughputs. The CTX-9000 DSi is designed for integrated <b>airport</b> <b>installations.</b> Its 1-metre wide conveyor coordinates with standard airport baggage handling systems. The system's architecture utilizes modular components, helping to ease scanner upgrading and servicing. The scanner contains 4 active radiation-shielding curtains. In addition, the gantry rotates at 120 RPM, enabling a slice image to be generated within half a second. A high-speed RF data link connects the rotating gantry to the stationary part of the unit. An air-conditioning unit ensures high performance and reliability in hot, dusty and humid airport environments.|$|R

5000|$|The {{airfield}} {{was occupied}} by American forces on 16 May 1945 {{as part of the}} American Zone of Occupation in the Bremen area, an enclave surrounded by the British zone. The United States Army Air Forces moved into the airfield on 5 June and it served as home for P-47 Thunderbolts of 86th Fighter Group 512th and 513th Fighter Squadrons, flying air defense missions from the base over the Bremen area. Initially given the designation of Advanced Landing Ground [...] "R-56", it was renamed Army Air Force Station Nordholtz, or simply Nordholz Air Base. After reducing the boundary of the American enclave to the borders of the State of Bremen in 1947 the airfield, located in Lower Saxony, was handed over to the Royal Air Force, who began dismantling the <b>airport</b> <b>installations</b> and destroying the three concrete runways.|$|R

50|$|In 2007 three {{terrorists were}} arrested in Germany after being {{suspected}} of plans to attack the Frankfurt International <b>airport</b> and US-Military <b>installations</b> such as Ramstein Air Base. The three persons were directly affiliated with the Islamic Jihad Group.|$|R
5000|$|This {{plant is}} {{threatened}} by development {{at the airport and}} other facilities nearby, including roads and a helitack base. In the past few decades the amount of available habitat has been decreased 50% or more, possibly as much as 70%. It has also led to habitat fragmentation as the population is bisected by the airport and the road. Planned expansion projects at the <b>airport,</b> including <b>installation</b> of a parking lot, may reduce the amount of suitable habitat further.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the major}} {{territorial}} commands (metropolitan commands, regional commands and district commands of Aveiro, Braga Coimbra, Faro, Leiria, Santarém, Setúbal, Vila Real and Viseu) there is however an intermediate level of sub-unit {{between them and}} the squad, this being the division. These commands are thus organized in two or more divisions, each of which include several squads. The divisions can be generic (named [...] "police divisions" [...] and being responsible for a given area of responsibility) or specialized (transit, criminal investigation, <b>airport</b> security, <b>installations</b> security or public transportation security).|$|R
5000|$|In February 2002 Friend {{completed}} a commission at George Bush Intercontinental <b>Airport.</b> The <b>installation,</b> “Houston Bayou,” comprises a Byzantine glass mosaic mural on a 73 ft-long serpentine wall, columns, and the terrazzo floor design. It {{was selected as}} one of the best public art installations in the United States by the national organization Americans for the Arts for its [...] "Fresh Perspectives / Public Art Year in Review 2002". The installation also received [...] "Craftsmanship Awards" [...] from the Houston and the Regional Chapters of the Construction Specifications Institute in 2002.|$|R
50|$|During 2008, {{new changes}} {{that will be}} {{occurring}} at the <b>airport</b> include the <b>installation</b> of new air-conditioners and lighting, a second security screening point, a larger departures lounge and 280 new seats. Airport Management will also be releasing an Expression of Interest {{with the aim of}} adding more retail outlets to the airport.|$|R
50|$|In October 2008, to {{coincide}} {{with the opening of the}} new Marshall Business Aviation Centre, the airport's name was changed from Cambridge City Airport to Marshall Airport Cambridge UK. The name was changed again to Cambridge Airport in 2011 as plans were announced for an expansion of the <b>airport</b> following the <b>installation</b> of instrument landing systems and new hangars.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 May 1982, the Royal Air Force {{bombed the}} airport in Operation Black Buck and several other raids were carried out by {{embarked}} Harriers. Through the conflict, the <b>airport</b> <b>installations</b> were attacked with 237 bombs, 1,200 shells by deployed Royal Navy ships and 16 missiles. The 42 1,000-lb bombs dropped by the two Black Buck missions left twin strings of craters which are still visible on satellite photos of the airport today. However, none of these attacks ever put the airfield out of action entirely, and even both Black Buck raids only managed to score one direct hit on the runway, which was repaired sufficiently to allow for C-130 Hercules, Lockheed L-188 Electra and Fokker F-28 transport aircraft to resume night supply flights within 48 hours. These flights continued to bring supplies, weapons, vehicles, and fuel, and airlift out the wounded right {{until the end of}} the conflict. The Argentines left the runway covered with piles of earth during the day, leading to claims this caused British intelligence to surmise that repairs were still in progress and misleading the British as to the condition of the airfield and the success of their raids. [...] In fact, the British were well aware that C-130 flights continued to use the airfield and attempted to interdict these flights leading to the loss of a C-130 on 1 June, which was not, however, engaged in any resupply mission.|$|R
40|$|A dynamic data {{construct}} {{built on}} the basis of a snap-card paradigm is designed to meet the needs of information empowerment, formation flexibility, and representation versatility for rapid interchange and effective integration of information in complex environment. It facilitates the prompt reporting, gathering, tracking, and analysis of information from wide spread of heterogeneous resources, and effective decision making and event responses. The construct is especially designed to operate in wireless communication environment where the data amount contained in the transmission must be tightly packed. The technique is suitable for applications particularly in C 2 situation awareness of battle space and security surveillances of <b>airports,</b> military <b>installations,</b> and occasions of large public events...|$|R
5000|$|... 5AN started {{transmitting}} on 15 October 1937 {{with equipment}} {{located in the}} central telephone exchange, and a radio mast located in Post Office Place. The station transmitter moved to Brooklyn Park, the site of 5CL on 4 May 1944. The radio mast was moved from {{the east side of}} the building to the south side to make way for an airport road in 1952. Proximity to the <b>airport</b> precluded <b>installation</b> of a taller, and hence more efficient, antenna, and its situation in suburbia restricted the permissible transmitter power, so a completely new transmitting station for 5AN and 5CL was built at Pimpala, at the corner of Sherriffs and Hillier Roads, Reynella, and opened on 20 September 1961 by Postmaster-General C W Davidson.|$|R
50|$|Perimeter {{surveillance}} radar (PSR) is {{a class of}} radar sensors that monitor activity surrounding or on critical infrastructure areas such as <b>airports,</b> seaports, military <b>installations,</b> national borders, refineries and other critical industry and the like. Such radars are characterized by their ability to detect movement at ground level of targets such as an individual walking or crawling towards a facility. Such radars typically have ranges of several hundred metres to over 10 kilometres.|$|R
25|$|Interscan {{proved to}} have many {{advantages}} over other precision landing systems. It allows {{a wide selection of}} channels to avoid interference with other nearby airports; has excellent performance in all weather; and gives freedom to locate antennae anywhere at an <b>airport.</b> Some <b>installations</b> became operational in the 1990s and more were set up subsequently in Europe. NASA has operated a similar system to land space shuttles. However, Interscan has not become widely deployed worldwide, largely because the US Federal Aviation Administration has developed the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which augments the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). Although WAAS is cheaper and conforms to ILS Category I, its accuracy is under 1.0 metre laterally and under 1.5 metres vertically, which is a particular concern at locations that frequently suffer from low visibility.|$|R
50|$|During the 2010 Commonwealth Games, it {{was used}} as a {{park-and-ride}} facility, for parking of vehicles for those going to the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. Spread over 1,70,000 sq.m., the parking area could accommodate 3000 cars, 6000 two-wheelers and 450 buses of the shuttle service bus. In a year-long project, the NDMC undertook extensive renovation of the area, which included construction of new roads within the <b>airport</b> premises, and <b>installation</b> of jersey barriers between the main tarmac and temporary parking area.|$|R
40|$|Neutron {{scanning}} {{techniques are}} becoming important {{tools in the}} search for chemical agents, explosives, drugs, nuclear material and other hazardous materials in government buildings, <b>airports,</b> military <b>installations</b> or public areas. Each nucleus when excited emits quanta of gamma radiation at characteristic energies. The element can be physically located and identified by these energy lines. It is important to identify these lines in a minimal amount of time in order {{to increase the number of}} items that are searched and to allow fast flow of people and their possessions into and through facilities. This paper develops a mathematical model of the signal significance and search stopping in a minimal time. The stopping decision is important as the vast majority of searches are negative. The economic benefit for a minimal search time is great, as millions of searches will be conducted daily. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
