40|$|From November 2007 to December 2010 on 25 {{patients}} with pes planovalgus accompanied by os tibiale externum were operated. Age of patients ranged from 16 to 35 years. In 80 % of cases operations {{were performed on}} one foot, and 20 % – {{at the same time}} on two feet. Treatment results were evaluated on a scale American Orthopaedic Society Foot and Ankle (AOFAS). The average pain scores improved from 14. 3 to 29. 0, the improvement of foot and heel functions – from 29. 4 to 42. 0, while the correct position has changed from the average value of 2, 7 to 8, 5. Radiography showed an average reduction of longitudinal arch angle to about 12. 3, a decrease <b>astragalocalcanean</b> corner – at 8 on, the increase in height of the arch – on 5 - 8 mm. The study results confirmed the involvement of the presence of os tibiale externum to the development of planovalgus deformity. Treatment of such patients requires a comprehensive approach, the main stage of which is to remove the extra bone. Subtalar artroereisis in conjunction with plasty of tendon of posterior tibial muscle and transposition of the tendons of flexor digitorum longus is effective and modern methods of surgical correction of pes planovalgus with os tibiale externum. </p...|$|E
