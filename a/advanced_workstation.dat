40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the different patterns of {{coronary artery disease}} among patients with unstable angina by the role of multislice CT coronary angiography. Patients and methods: From September 2013 to May 2014, 40 patients complaining from unstable angina showing initial negative ECG and troponin enzyme underwent a multi-slice CT coronary angiography. Each patient underwent a non-contrast scan to determine the calcium score, then a contrast enhanced ECG gated scan, then the obtained axial images were reconstructed on an <b>advanced</b> <b>workstation.</b> Finally, a systematic analysis of the coronary artery lesions was performed.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the clinical value of using monochromatic images in spectral CT pulmonary angiography to improve image quality of bronchial arteries. We retrospectively analyzed the chest CT images of 38 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced spectral CT. These images included {{a set of}} 140 kVp polychromatic images and the default 70 keV monochromatic images. Using the standard Gemstone Spectral Imaging (GSI) viewer on an <b>advanced</b> <b>workstation</b> (AW 4. 6,GE Healthcare), an optimal energy level (in keV) for obtaining the best contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the artery could be automatically obtained. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), CNR and objective image quality score (1 - 5) for these 3 image sets (140 kVp, 70 keV and optimal energy level) were obtained and, statistically compared. The image quality score consistency between the two observers was also evaluated using Kappa test. The optimal energy levels for obtaining the best CNR were 62. 58 ± 2. 74 keV. SNR and CNR from the 140 kVp polychromatic, 70 keV and optimal keV monochromatic images were (16. 44 ± 5. 85, 13. 24 ± 5. 52), (20. 79 ± 7. 45, 16. 69 ± 6. 27) and (24. 9 ± 9. 91, 20. 53 ± 8. 46), respectively. The corresponding subjective image quality scores were 1. 97 ± 0. 82, 3. 24 ± 0. 75, and 4. 47 ± 0. 60. SNR, CNR and subjective scores had significant difference among groups (all p 0. 80).

40|$|Session - SST 04 : Gastrointestinal (Rectal Cancer: Advanced Imaging) PURPOSE: Diffusion {{weighted}} imaging (DWI) is an emerging, whereas PET/CT {{an established}} tool for tumor assessment. Tumors often demonstrate decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on DWI, and increased standard uptake value (SUV) on FDG-PET/CT. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the relationship between ADC and SUV in primary rectal cancer. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From Nov 08 to Apr 09, 16 consecutive patients (10 men, 6 women; age 55 - 88 years) with pathologically proven rectal cancer and having undergone both MRI and PET/CT were included in this study. All MRs were performed on a 3 T scanner (Achieva, Philips). Routine T 1, T 2, DWI and contrast-enhanced sequences were obtained. Axial pelvic DWI was obtained by single-shot EPI with STIR fat-suppression and slice-selection gradient reversal technique (TR/TE/TI= 7779 / 47 / 260 ms, matrix 188 × 151, FOV 40 × 32 cm, b-value= 0 and 1000 s/mm 2, slice thickness 5 mm). ROIs were manually drawn along contours of the tumor on each slice of ADC maps covering the entire tumor. ADC values were calculated by Image J software (NIH, US). ADCmean was defined as average ADC value for all voxels in each tumor, and ADCmin as the lowest ADC value among all voxels in each tumor. All PET/CT exams (Discovery VCT, GE) were performed within 1 week of MRI. A 3 D ROI was placed over the entire tumor on <b>Advanced</b> <b>Workstation</b> (GE) to calculate SUVmax. Maximum diameter of the tumor was measured on both MRI (M_D) and PET/CT (P_D). Relationship between ADC and SUVmax values was assessed by pearsons correlation test. RESULTS: ADCmean and ADCmin for all tumors were 0. 96 ± 0. 23 and 0. 37 ± 0. 19 (10 - 3 mm 2 /s) respectively. SUVmax values were 10. 55 ± 6. 13. M_D values were 5. 78 ± 2. 19 cm and P_D 6. 11 ± 2. 12 cm. Statistically significant negative correlation was found between ADCmin and SUVmax (r=- 0. 57, p= 0. 02), and ADCmean and SUVmax (r=- 0. 65, p= 0. 006). M_D was significantly correlated with P_D (r= 0. 49, p= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results showed that both ADCmin and ADCmean of the primary rectal cancer are inversely correlated with SUVmax, which has been shown to correlate with tumor aggressiveness and treatment response in many malignancies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: ADC values may be potential surrogate biomarkers for detection, characterization, prognostication and monitoring treatment response of rectal cancer. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|<b>Advanced</b> {{chemical}} <b>workstations</b> {{offer the}} potential to substantially improve the productivity of experimental research. To fully exploit such technologies, effective scheduling of experiments is crucial. Chemists tend to define experimental protocols with rigid time constraints, although often the scientific objectives can be achieved without adhering to such constraints. Investigation of a scheduling algorithm that allows flexible time constraints shows that improvements in workstation throughput as great as 50 % {{can be reached by}} modest flexibility in the timing of operations in the experiments. Several heuris-tics that might be used with the scheduling algorithm were tested; a heuristic that schedules long experiments while first keeping the workstation busy was shown to be a good general choice.

The scheduling of a set of exper-iments to be performed on such a workstation is a nontrivial task (2, 3), and automated workstations need good scheduling algorithms to plan start times for experiments. Such scheduling algorithms must ensure that an experiment that has been started can be completed, while optimizing throughput to the extent possible. Chemical experiments consist of a series of opera-tions such as liquid transfers, heating, cooling, and analyses with the aid of instruments. Time constraints exist between the operations in an experiment. For example, the start time of a sampling operation may be required to occur a specified amount of time {{after the end of the}} previous sampling operation. When a set of experiments is planned, all such time constraints must be taken into account. In routine laboratory practice, time constraints are expressed as precise time points.
