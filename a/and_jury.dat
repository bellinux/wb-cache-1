5|$|After a brief {{preliminary}} hearing starting on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly {{showed no signs}} of emotion, the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a judge <b>and</b> <b>jury</b> under the auspices of Ontario's Supreme Court, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb.|$|E

The {{prosecution}} team was led by Dorsey and included William Smith (Conley's attorney and Dorsey's jury consultant). Frank was represented {{by a team of}} eight lawyersincluding jury selection specialistsled by Luther Rosser, Reuben Arnold, and Herbert Haas. In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside, a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows. The defense, in their legal appeals, would later cite the crowds as factors in intimidation of the witnesses <b>and</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, <b>and</b> <b>jury</b> instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord High Steward's Court, a {{group of}} Lords Triers, sitting under the {{chairmanship}} of the Lord High Steward, acted as judge <b>and</b> <b>jury.</b> By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge <b>and</b> <b>jury.</b> Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of televoting <b>and</b> <b>jury</b> voting results underwent changes that were detailed {{in the official}} rules for the 2013 contest. Each member of a respective nation's jury was required to rank every song, except that of their own country. The voting results from each member of a particular nation's jury were combined to produce an overall ranking from first to last place. Likewise, the televoting results were also interpreted as a full ranking, {{taking into account the}} full televoting result rather than just the top ten. The {{combination of}} the jury's full ranking and the televote's full ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. It was announced in the official Media Handbook that an official app would also be available for voters to vote via during the contest.|$|E

40|$|In this {{keynote speech}} for the Seattle University School of Law Colloquium on the 25 th Anniversary of the Summary Judgment Trilogy: Reflections on Summary Judgment, Professor Suja Thomas {{discusses}} {{access to courts}} <b>and</b> <b>juries</b> before <b>and</b> after the summary judgment trilogy. Following up on debate in the academic literature {{on the effect of}} the trilogy on summary judgment, Professor Thomas explores influences on the trilogy and influences of the trilogy outside of summary judgment. She first describes Supreme Court decisions on judgment notwithstanding the verdict, remittitur, and the directed verdict, which helped {{set the stage for the}} trilogy and which decreased litigants 2 ̆ 7 access to courts <b>and</b> <b>juries.</b> She then explores access after the trilogy. Professor Thomas describes how access to courts <b>and</b> <b>juries</b> continued to decline through the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions on arbitration and the motion to dismiss. Professor Thomas gives all of these procedures some context by showing their effect on one class of factually intensive cases employment discrimination cases. She concludes by introducing the concept of 2 ̆ 2 the Other Branch 2 ̆ 2 and states that access to courts <b>and</b> <b>juries</b> can possibly increase if the jury is viewed in this manner...|$|R
