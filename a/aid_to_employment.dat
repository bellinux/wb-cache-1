Very important issues is therefore control of granted aid. European Commission developed catalogue types of aid, which could be granted.

Using an action research process an evidence guide was developed that met the needs of key stakeholders. This is the first time any Australian university has utilized the national competencies in this way. The evidence guide is a document that collates evidence of attainment of health promotion competencies. It can be used by students as a planning tool and as an <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> gaining <b>employment.</b> It also {{has the potential to be}} used as part of a credentialing process for health promotion practitioners...|$|R

Kalamazoo, Michigan installed curb cuts in the 1940s as a pilot project <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> <b>employment</b> of disabled veterans. A major project in Berkeley, California led by Ed Roberts and others at the Center for Independent Living led to curb cuts up and down Telegraph and Shattuck Avenues creating an extensive path of travel. Following this, the value of curb cuts was promoted more strongly and their installment was often made on a voluntary basis by municipal authorities and developers.|$|R
40|$|Sweden {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of labour market policies explicitly targeting job seekers with disabilities, ranging from in-work <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> subsidized <b>employments,</b> aiming at strengthening their position at the labour market. To ascertain that these programs are limited to the needy they are constrained to those job seekers that are classified as occu-pationally disabled by the Public Employment Service. In this study we have investi-gated the determinants of being classified as occupationally disabled by the PES. Simi-lar to the studies on disability retirement and self-reported disability we find that men {{were more likely to be}} classified as disabled and also that higher age and various meas-ures of socio-economic disadvantages were associated with a higher likelihood. Rather naturally, also all measures indicating poor health were associated with an increased likelihood of being classified as occupationally disabled. A final point is that over the time period under study it became increasingly likely to be classified as occupationally disabled and especially to receive a code related to mental, socio-medical, and learning disabilities...|$|R
2500|$|When Roosevelt {{began his}} {{run for a}} second term in May 1930, he reiterated his {{doctrine}} from the campaign two years before: [...] "that progressive government by its very terms, must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization." [...] He ran on a platform that called for <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> farmers, full <b>employment,</b> unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions. His Republican opponent could not overcome the public's criticism of the Republican Party during the economic downturn, and Roosevelt was elected to a second term by a margin of 14%. With the Hoover administration resisting proposals to directly address the economic crisis, Governor Roosevelt proposed an economic relief package and the establishment of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to distribute those funds. Led first by Jesse I. Straus and then by Harry Hopkins, the agency assisted well over one third of New York's population between 1932 and 1938.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{survivors}} {{of domestic violence}} <b>to</b> secure <b>employment</b> once they leave their vulnerable situations has been identified in the existing knowledge base as a significant issue, and one that urgently needed to be addressed. This qualitative applied social policy research study was undertaken to derive recommendations that could improve {{the current state of}} <b>employment</b> services available <b>to</b> women who had survived domestic violence residing in the Region of Waterloo. This was accomplished by determining which employment services align with the needs of a survivor as they began <b>to</b> seek <b>employment.</b> In-depth interviews were conducted to collect information from six survivors and six social service providers delivering employment services. A thematic analysis was then used to analyze the data and assign meaning to reoccurring descriptive patterns or emerging phenomenon in relation to the focal research question. It was found that the survivor community operating in this geographic area has developed a high level of resiliency, which has enabled this population to successfully access available <b>employment</b> services <b>to</b> <b>aid</b> their <b>employment</b> search. It was also determined that governmental agencies, large-scale non-for-profit establishments, community-based associations, and other partnering organizations mandated <b>to</b> deliver <b>employment</b> services within the Region of Waterloo have designated significant financial and human resources to support individuals through their employment search journey. Overall, it was recommended that social service providers: integrate additional ongoing support activities into their service-delivery models, provide specialized training to front-line workers assigned who work with survivors of domestic violence, and promote their services on an increasing basis to generate public awareness and foster a more inclusive community...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the Clinton administration's welfare reform proposal and views {{the available evidence}} {{on the effects of}} time-limiting cash assistance and requiring work among long-term <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> Families with Dependent Children users. The reforms are designed <b>to</b> increase <b>employment</b> among <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> Families with Dependent Children recipients. Given changes in the labor market for less-skilled workers, {{it is not clear that}} this will increase income among these families. The reform proposals would shift antipoverty spending toward work subsidies, child support collection efforts, and subsidized jobs that support mandated employment. It is unclear that this will produce either a cheaper or more effective antipoverty system than the current one. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1995 nearly {{fourteen}} million Americans received welfare benefits, far {{too many}} {{in the eyes of}} the many critics of the program. Developed originally to allow widowed or divorced women to stay at home with their children, the 1996 federal welfare reform package aimed to do just the opposite. The many changes, including time limits for receiving benefits, seek to move recipients out of the home and into wage work. While inadequate access <b>to</b> <b>employment</b> clearly contributes <b>to</b> unstable work histories, poverty, and dependency on programs like <b>Aid</b> <b>to</b> Families with Dependent Children, it is by no means the only barrier to steady work for most welfare recipients. So while programs that seek <b>to</b> increase <b>employment</b> access [...] either by locating jobs and workers near one another or by improving the transportation linkages between jobs and workers [...] can help to move people into steady employment and reduce welfare usage, such programs are not a panacea...|$|R
