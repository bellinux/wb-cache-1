5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E

5|$|From the 3rd century are {{the first}} records of {{a small number of}} regular units bearing the names of barbarian tribes (as opposed to peregrini tribal names). These were foederati (allied troops under a {{military}} obligation to Rome) converted into regular units, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> was to accelerate in the 4th century. The ala I Sarmatarum, based in Britain, was probably composed of some of the 5,500 captured Sarmatian horsemen sent to garrison Hadrian's Wall by emperor Marcus Aurelius in c. 175. There is no evidence of irregular barbarian units becoming part of the regular army of the Principate until the 3rd century.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the country}} music charts were {{dominated}} by pop singers with only tangential influences from country music, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> has continued since. The 1980s saw a revival of honky-tonk-style country {{with the rise of}} people like Dwight Yoakam and the new traditionalists Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs, as well as the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo. Later alternative country performers, like Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams and Wilco, found some mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Music is an {{important}} part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band. Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school's drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Since the mid-1880s, Riley {{had been}} the nation's most read poet, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> {{accelerated}} {{at the turn of}} the century. In 1912 Riley recorded readings of his most popular poetry to be sold by Victor Records. Riley was the subject of three paintings by T. C. Steele. The Indianapolis Arts Association commissioned a portrait of Riley to be created by world famous painter John Singer Sargent. Riley's image became a nationally known icon and many businesses capitalized on his popularity to sell their products; Hoosier Poet brand vegetables became a major trade-name in the midwest.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Perry City, NY227 {{straddles}} the SchuylerTompkins county line, with the northbound lane in Tompkins County. After , NY227 turns northeastward, leaving {{the border and}} completely entering Tompkins County {{in the town of}} Ulysses. Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> follows the route to its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, celadon was a prized import in East Africa, which was {{initially}} {{obtained from the}} Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by {{a large number of}} black on yellow Islamic wares and celadon. Also during the fourteenth century, local wares began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During {{the beginning and end of}} the fifteenth century, respectively, blue and white porcelain began to gradually replace celadon and monochrome Islamic wares completely replaced black on yellow types. During the same century, local wares began to change with the reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and a shift to long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants. In the following century, blue and white porcelain and monochrome Islamic wares became the dominant imports; <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|Otis began {{gradually}} entering cooler ocean waters, {{although the}} National Hurricane Center noted {{in one of}} its discussions on the system that the environment was still warm enough to support a stronger storm. The hurricane continued drifting northwestward, and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status. At the time, maximum sustained winds were at 105mph (165km/h) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Hours later, however, it began to weaken, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air. The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2, and the center of circulation was separated from the convective activity. Otis weakened to a tropical storm and drifted erratically toward the north-northwest as a result of weak steering currents. Over increasingly cold waters, the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low-level clouds. It became a remnant low pressure area the next day. The system abruptly turned southeastward and drifted parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5.|$|E
5|$|The Bourbon Spanish and French land force {{continued}} to bombard Gibraltar, inflicting further {{damage on the}} town's somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make any progress against the reinforced garrison. They were being vigorously opposed with counter-bombardments, which killed many of their number, and by sallies, two of which were carried out successfully by the confederates on 23 and 31 December. Relations steadily worsened between the Spanish and French components of the besieging force, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> was exacerbated {{by the lack of}} progress they were making, the appalling conditions they were enduring in the open and the steady stream of casualties being caused by the counter-bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease. The weather, too, was terrible, with storms and heavy rain making life a misery. By the New Year of 1705, the besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7,000 men to only 4,000, the remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting.|$|E
5|$|The Kinks' {{second wave}} of {{popularity}} remained at a peak with State of Confusion, but that success began to fade, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> also affected their British rock contemporaries the Rolling Stones and the Who. During {{the second half of}} 1983, Ray Davies started work on an ambitious solo film project, Return to Waterloo, about a London commuter who daydreams that he is a serial murderer. The film gave actor Tim Roth a significant early role. Davies' commitment to writing, directing and scoring the new work caused tension in his relationship with his brother. Another problem was the stormy end of the relationship between Ray Davies and Chrissie Hynde. The old feud between Dave Davies and drummer Mick Avory also re-ignited. Davies eventually refused to work with Avory, and called for him to be replaced by Bob Henrit, former drummer of Argent (of which Jim Rodford had also been a member). Avory left the band, and Henrit was brought in to take his place. Ray Davies, who was still on amiable terms with Avory, invited him to manage Konk Studios. Avory accepted, and continued to serve as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.|$|E

5|$|His next film, Vanakkatukuriya Kathaliye, has an {{introductory}} song to mark his entry, <b>a</b> <b>trend</b> <b>that</b> would soon catch on {{in with his}} later films. Mullum Malarum, released during the same period, received critical acclaim. The film marked the directional debut of J. Mahendran, with a screenplay adapted from a novel {{of the same name}} published in Kalki. It eventually won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film and a special prize for Rajinikanth as Best Actor at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. Following this, he made a foray into Malayalam cinema through the fantasy film Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum, based on a story from the Arabian Nights. The same year, he acted in Dharma Yuddam, in which he played a mentally ill person taking revenge for his parents' deaths. He then co-starred with N. T. Rama Rao in Tiger. With the completion of Tiger, Rajinikanth had acted in 50 films over a period of four years, and in four languages. Some other popular films released during this period are the youthful entertainer Ninaithale Inikkum, the Tamil–Kannada bilingual Priya, the Telugu film Amma Evarikkaina Amma and the melodrama Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai. Priya, based on a detective novel by Sujatha Rangarajan, had the distinction of being the first film of Rajinikanth to be shot mostly outside India, mainly in Southeast Asia.|$|E
