40|$|Abstract Background The {{reconstruction}} of protein complexes {{from the physical}} interactome of organisms serves as a building block towards understanding the higher level organization of the cell. Over the past few years, several independent high-throughput experiments have helped to catalogue enormous amount of physical protein interaction data from organisms such as yeast. However, these individual datasets show lack of correlation {{with each other and}} also contain substantial number of false positives (noise). Over these years, several <b>affinity</b> <b>scoring</b> schemes have also been devised to improve the qualities of these datasets. Therefore, the challenge now is to detect meaningful as well as novel complexes from protein interaction (PPI) networks derived by combining datasets from multiple sources and by making use of these <b>affinity</b> <b>scoring</b> schemes. In the attempt towards tackling this challenge, the Markov Clustering algorithm (MCL) {{has proved to be a}} popular and reasonably successful method, mainly due to its scalability, robustness, and ability to work on scored (weighted) networks. However, MCL produces many noisy clusters, which either do not match known complexes or have additional proteins that reduce the accuracies of correctly predicted complexes. Results Inspired by recent experimental observations by Gavin and colleagues on the modularity structure in yeast complexes and the distinctive properties of "core" and "attachment" proteins, we develop a core-attachment based refinement method coupled to MCL for {{reconstruction of}} yeast complexes from scored (weighted) PPI networks. We combine physical interactions from two recent "pull-down" experiments to generate an unscored PPI network. We then score this network using available <b>affinity</b> <b>scoring</b> schemes to generate multiple scored PPI networks. The evaluation of our method (called MCL-CAw) on these networks shows that: (i) MCL-CAw derives larger number of yeast complexes and with better accuracies than MCL, particularly in the presence of natural noise; (ii) <b>Affinity</b> <b>scoring</b> can effectively reduce the impact of noise on MCL-CAw and thereby improve the quality (precision and recall) of its predicted complexes; (iii) MCL-CAw responds well to most available scoring schemes. We discuss several instances where MCL-CAw was successful in deriving meaningful complexes, and where it missed a few proteins or whole complexes due to <b>affinity</b> <b>scoring</b> of the networks. We compare MCL-CAw with several recent complex detection algorithms on unscored and scored networks, and assess the relative performance of the algorithms on these networks. Further, we study the impact of augmenting physical datasets with computationally inferred interactions for complex detection. Finally, we analyse the essentiality of proteins within predicted complexes to understand a possible correlation between protein essentiality and their ability to form complexes. Conclusions We demonstrate that core-attachment based refinement in MCL-CAw improves the predictions of MCL on yeast PPI networks. We show that <b>affinity</b> <b>scoring</b> improves the performance of MCL-CAw. </p...|$|R

This multi-graph matching problem involves two ingredients affecting the overall accuracy: i) the local pairwise matching <b>affinity</b> <b>score</b> among graphs; ii) the global matching consistency that measures {{the uniqueness of the}} pairwise matching results by different chaining orders. Previous studies typically either enforce the matching consistency constraints in the beginning of iterative optimization, which may propagate matching error both over iterations and across graph pairs; or separate affinity optimizing and consistency regularization in two steps.

40|$|Abstract. Graph {{matching}} has a {{wide spectrum}} of computer vision ap-plications such as finding feature point correspondences across images. The problem of graph matching is generally NP-hard, so most exist-ing work pursues suboptimal solutions between two graphs. This paper investigates a more general problem of matching N attributed graphs to each other, i. e. labeling their common node correspondences such that a certain compatibility/affinity objective is optimized. This multi-graph matching problem involves two key ingredients affecting the over-all accuracy: a) the pairwise affinity matching score between two local graphs, and b) global matching consistency that measures the uniqueness and consistency of the pairwise matching results by different sequential matching orders. Previous work typically either enforces the matching consistency constraints in the beginning of iterative optimization, which may propagate matching error both over iterations and across different graph pairs; or separates score optimizing and consistency synchroniza-tion in two steps. This paper is motivated by the observation that <b>affinity</b> <b>score</b> and consistency are mutually affected and shall be tackled jointly to capture their correlation behavior. As such, we propose a novel multi-graph matching algorithm to incorporate the two aspects by iteratively approximating the global-optimal <b>affinity</b> <b>score,</b> meanwhile gradually in-fusing the consistency as a regularizer, which improves the performance of the initial solutions obtained by existing pairwise graph matching solvers. The proposed algorithm with a theoretically proven convergence shows notable efficacy on both synthetic and public image datasets. ...|$|E
40|$|Carbohydrate-binding {{proteins}} (CBPs) {{are potential}} biomarkers and drug targets. However, {{the interactions between}} carbohydrates and proteins are challenging to study experimentally and computationally because of their low binding affinity, high flexibility, {{and the lack of}} a linear sequence in carbohydrates as exists in RNA, DNA, and proteins. Here, we describe a structure-based function-prediction technique called SPOT-Struc that identifies carbohydrate-recognizing proteins and their binding amino acid residues by structural alignment program SPalign and binding <b>affinity</b> <b>scoring</b> according to a knowledge-based statistical potential based on the distance-scaled finite-ideal gas reference state (DFIRE). The leave-one-out cross-validation of the method on 113 carbohydrate-binding domains and 3442 noncarbohydrate binding proteins yields a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0. 56 for SPalign alone and 0. 63 for SPOT-Struc (SPalign?+?binding <b>affinity</b> <b>scoring)</b> for CBP prediction. SPOT-Struc is a technique with high positive predictive value (79 % correct predictions in all positive CBP predictions) with a reasonable sensitivity (52 % positive predictions in all CBPs). The sensitivity of the method was changed slightly when applied to 31 APO (unbound) structures found in the protein databank (14 / 31 for APO versus 15 / 31 for HOLO). The result of SPOT-Struc will not change significantly if highly homologous templates were used. SPOT-Struc predicted 19 out of 2076 structural genome targets as CBPs.

The ap- proach is based on geometric triangulation performed in a distributed fashion on the computational grid formed by the camera network organized into a tree structure. Since the computational performance of the algorithm strongly depends on the order in which cameras are paired, to optimize the reconstruction a pairing strategy is designed that relies on an <b>affinity</b> <b>score</b> among cameras.

40|$|AbstractA key goal of {{synthetic}} biology {{is to use}} biological molecules to create novel biological systems. Due to their role as transmitters in such systems, RNA molecules have gained much attention from synthetic biologists to design and construct novel RNA molecules with desirable functions and properties. In recent decades, the design of RNAs, however, has been limited to RNA architecture with primitive functions: aptamer and catalysis. To expand the paradigm of RNA-based design, we herein propose a conceptual design of RNA-RNA interaction based systems, considering domain-based structures of RNAs, as well as thermodynamic properties of RNA molecules and their interactions. Two evaluation scores, namely structural score (SS) and <b>affinity</b> <b>score</b> (AS), are used as criteria for selection of proper RNA sets. We employ this concept to design various RNA sets, each of which contains three RNA strands that altogether function like a comparator device. With these criteria, we show that four out of forty RNA sets would behave like a biological comparator since they have appropriate structure (SS= 1) and proper interaction order (AS> 1). The proposed scores are proven to be proper criteria for selection of RNA sets with required functions. This preliminary design offers an opportunity for synthetic biologists to expand the design of RNA sequence from a single strand to multiple strands that would behave {{in the same manner}} as enzymatic reactions...|$|E

Diverse targets like a steroid-binding protein, a serine protease (factor Xa), a tyrosine kinase (Syk), and a nucleotide methyltransferase (TrmD) were included. Pose selection was achieved with high precision; in all 24 tests Wilma-SIE top-ranked the native pose among carefully generated sets of decoy conformations. Good separation for the native pose was also observed indicating robustness in pose scoring. Cross-docking was also accomplished with high accuracy for the various systems, with ligand median-RMSD values around 1 5 from the crystal structures. Larger deviations were occasionally obtained due to the rigid-target approach even if multiple target structures were used. Affinity ranking of congeneric ligands after cross-docking was reasonable for {{three of the four}} systems, with Spearman ranking coefficients around 0. 6. Poor affinity ranking for FXa is possibly due to missing structural domains, which are present during measurements.

Individual pollen taxa (PT-MAT) and the PFT <b>affinity</b> <b>scores</b> (PFT-MAT) {{were used for}} quantitative climatic reconstruction from pollen and algal data. Both techniques indicate that a cold and dry climate, {{similar to that of}} today, prevailed before 10, 500 cal yr B. P. The wettest climate occurred between similar to 10, 500 and 6500 cal yr B. P., at which time annual precipitation was up to 30 - 60 % higher than today. The early Holocene increases in temperature and precipitation occurred simultaneously, but mid-Holocene cooling started at approximately 8000 cal yr B. P., 1500 yr earlier than the drying. Vegetation reconstruction was based on the objective assignment of pollen taxa to the plant functional type. The results suggest that this region was dominated by steppe vegetation throughout the Holocene, except for the period similar to 9200 to similar to 6700 cal yr B. P., when forest patches were relatively common. Inner Mongolia is situated at the limit of the present East Asian monsoon and patterns of vegetation and climate changes in that region during the Holocene probably reflect fluctuations in the monsoon's response to solar insolation variations.

Methods: Five major antcins (A, B, C, H, and K) were isolated from fruiting bodies of Niuchangchih. Structural similarity between the antcins and 2 glucocorticoids (cortisone and dexamethasone) was compared. After incubation with each compound, the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was examined for its migration into the nucleus. Mo lecular docking was performed to model the tertiary structure of GR associated with antcins. Results: Incubation with cortisone, dexamethasone or antcin A (but not antcins B, C, H, and K) led to the migration of glucocorticoid receptor into the nucleus. The minimal concentration of antcin A, cortisone and dexamethasone to induce nuclear migration of glucocorticoid receptor was 10, 1, and 0. 1 mol/L, respectively. The results are {{in agreement with the}} simulated binding <b>affinity</b> <b>scores</b> of these three ligands docking to the glucocorticoid receptor. Molecular modeling indicates that C- 7 of antcin A or glucocorticoids is exposed to a hydrophobic region in the binding cavity of the glucocorticoid receptor, and the attachment of a hydrophilic group to C- 7 of the other four antcins presumably results in their being expelled when docking to the cavity.

40|$|A {{clustering}} is {{an implicit}} assignment of labels of points, based on proximity to other points. It is these labels that are then used for downstream analysis (either focusing on individual clusters, or identifying representatives of clusters and so on). Thus, {{in order to}} trust a clustering {{as a first step}} in exploratory data analysis, we must trust the labels assigned to individual data. Without supervision, how can we validate this assignment? In this paper, we present a method to attach affinity scores to the implicit labels of individual points in a clustering. The affinity scores capture the confidence level of the cluster that claims to "own" the point. This method is very general: it can be used with clusterings derived from Euclidean data, kernelized data, or even data derived from information spaces. It smoothly incorporates importance functions on clusters, allowing us to eight different clusters differently. It is also efficient: assigning an <b>affinity</b> <b>score</b> to a point depends only polynomially on the number of clusters and is independent of the number of points in the data.

We also demonstrate useful visualizations of these scores; these might prove useful within an interactive analytics framework. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, 5 table...|$|E

Fluoroquinolone resistant isolates from India had shown to have evolved several mutants in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of DNA gyrase A subunit (GyrA), the target of fluoroquinolone. In view of high prevalence of mutations in the 'hot spot' region, a study on combinatorial drug design was carried out to identify better analogues for the treatment of MDR-TB. The gyrA subunit 'hot spot' region of codons 90, 94 and 95 were modeled into their corresponding protein folds and used as receptors for the docking studies. Further, invitro tests were carried using the parent compounds, namely gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin and correlated with the obtained docking scores. Results Molecular docking and in vitro studies correlated well in demonstrating the enhanced activity of moxifloxacin, when compared to gatifloxacin, on ofloxacin sensitive and resistant strains comprising of clinical isolates of MDR-TB. The evolved lead structures targeting against mutant QRDR receptors were guanosine and cholesteryl esters of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. They showed consistently high binding affinity values of - 10. 3 and - 10. 1 kcal/mol respectively with the target receptors. Of these, the guanosine ester showed highest binding <b>affinity</b> <b>score</b> and its log P value lied within the Lipinski's range indicating that it could have better absorptivity when it is orally administered thereby having an enhanced activity against MTB. Conclusions The docking results showed that the addition of the cholesteryl and guanosine esters to the 'DNA gyrase binding' region of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin enhanced the binding affinity of these parent molecules with the mutant DNA gyrase receptors. Viewing the positive correlation for the docking and in vitro results with the parent compounds, these lead structures could be further evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo activity against MDR-TB. </p...|$|E

The `biomization' methodology {{is described in}} a stepwise manner that details the reconstruction of vegetation along an altitudinal gradient. In {{the majority of the}} cases, the results are comparable to site-specific descriptions of the vegetation. At altitudes between 2000 and 3000 m, cool mixed forest and cool evergreen forest biomes are important. Between 3000 and 3700 m the cool grassland/shrub biome is dominant. Above 3700 m, the <b>affinity</b> <b>score</b> to arboreal biomes is low with a concomitant increased affinity to the cool grassland biome that co-dominates along with the cool grassland/shrub biome. Hence, the technique is shown successful at reconstructing modern vegetation, this is particularly so when affinity scores to the range of biomes, rather the single most dominant biome, are used to describe vegetation composition. The results are able to delimit the altitudinally-induced changes in vegetation, from Andean forest associations, open forest and shrub grassland complex through to high altitude grasslands. However, this ability of the modern pollen data to predict the potential vegetation, via the biomization technique, is complicated by several site-specific factors that impact on the vegetation. Of particular importance are localised environmental conditions, particularly moisture regime. An additional area of interest is the impact that human activity has had on the vegetation. By manipulation of the input matrices, which are assigned a priori, and consultation of the range of biome affinity scores, it is possible to identify which sites reflect an anthropogenic signal and how this is manifested within the pollen data. By investigating the range of affinity scores, these factors can be identified and the relatively subtle changes in reconstructed vegetation determined, in particular, how the composition and quantity of the arboreal component changes about the tree line. The results are discussed in the context of using tree line position, and altitudinally-induced floristic changes, for palaeoclimatic reconstruction...|$|E

The use of biome models as a diagnostic tool for palaeoclimate simulations can yield maps that are directly comparable with palaeoecological (pollen and plant macrofossil) records provided these records are `'biomized'', i. e. assigned to biomes in a consistent way. This article describes a method for the objective biomization of pollen samples based on fuzzy logic. Pollen types (taxa) are assigned {{to one or more}} plant functional types (PFTs), then <b>affinity</b> <b>scores</b> are calculated for each biome in turn based on its list of characteristic PFTs. The pollen sample is assigned to the biome to which it has the highest affinity, subject to a tie-breaking rule. Modern pollen data from surface samples, reflecting present vegetation across Europe, are used to validate the method. Pollen data from dated sediment cores are then used to reconstruct European vegetation patterns for 6 ka. The reconstruction shows systematic differences from present that are consistent with previous interpretations. The method has proved robust with respect to human impacts on vegetation, and provides a rational way to interpret combinations of pollen types that do not have present-day analogs. The method demands minimal prior information and is therefore equally suitable for use in other regions with richer floras, and/or lower densities of available modern and fossil pollen samples, than Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of direct targets of transcription factors {{is a key}} problem {{in the study of}} gene regulatory networks. However, the use of high throughput experimental methods, such as ChIP-chip and ChIP-sequencing, is limited by their high cost and strong dependence on cellular type and context. We developed a computational method for the genome-wide {{identification of}} functional transcription factor binding sites based on positional weight matrices, comparative genomics, and gene expression profiling. The method was applied to Stat 3, a transcription factor playing crucial roles in inflammation, immunity and oncogenesis, and able to induce distinct subsets of target genes in different cell types or conditions. A newly generated positional weight matrix enabled us to assign <b>affinity</b> <b>scores</b> of high specificity, as measured by EMSA competition assays. Phylogenetic conservation with 7 vertebrate species was used to select the binding sites most likely to be functional. Validation was carried out on predicted sites within genes identified as differentially expressed in {{the presence or absence of}} Stat 3 by microarray analysis. Twelve of the fourteen sites tested were bound by Stat 3 in vivo, as assessed by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, allowing us to identify 9 Stat 3 transcriptional targets. Given its high validation rate, and the availability of large transcription factor-dependent gene expression datasets obtained under diverse experimental conditions, our approach appears to be a valid alternative to high-throughput experimental assays for the discovery of novel direct targets of transcription factors...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{surveillance}} of human crowds in a dynamic environment {{has attracted a}} great amount of computer vision research efforts in recent years. Moving object detection, which conventionally includes motion segmentation and optionally, object classification, is the first major task for any visual surveillance application. After detecting the targets, estimation of their geo-locations is needed to create the same reference coordinate system for them for higher-level decision-making. Depending on the required fidelity of decision, multi-target data association may be also needed at higher levels to differentiate multiple targets in a series of frames. Applying all these vision-based algorithms to a crowd surveillance system (a major application studied in this dissertation) using a team of cooperative unmanned vehicles (UVs), introduces new challenges to the problem. Since the visual sensors move with the UVs, and thus the targets and the environment are dynamic, it adds to the complexity and uncertainty of the video processing. Moreover, the limited onboard computation resources require more efficient algorithms to be proposed. Responding to these challenges, the goal of this dissertation is to design and develop an effective and efficient visual surveillance system based on dynamic data driven application system (DDDAS) paradigm to be used by the cooperative UVs for autonomous crowd control and border patrol. The proposed visual surveillance system includes different modules: 1) a motion detection module, in which a new method for detecting multiple moving objects, based on sliding window is proposed to segment the moving foreground using the moving camera onboard the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); 2) a target recognition module, in which a customized method based on histogram-of-oriented-gradients is applied to classify the human targets using the onboard camera of unmanned ground vehicle (UGV); 3) a target geo-localization module, in which a new moving-landmark-based method is proposed for estimating the geo-location of the detected crowd from the UAV, while a heuristic method based on triangulation is applied for geo-locating the detected individuals via the UGV; and 4) a multi-target data association module, in which the <b>affinity</b> <b>score</b> is dynamically adjusted to comply with the changing dispersion of the detected targets over successive frames. In this dissertation, a cooperative team of one UAV and multiple UGVs with onboard visual sensors is used {{to take advantage of the}} complementary characteristics (e. g. different fidelities and view perspectives) of these UVs for crowd surveillance. The DDDAS paradigm is also applied toward these vision-based modules, where the computational and instrumentation aspects of the application system are unified for more accurate or efficient analysis according to the scenario. To illustrate and demonstrate the proposed visual surveillance system, aerial and ground video sequences from the UVs, as well as simulation models are developed, and experiments are conducted using them. The experimental results on both developed videos and literature datasets reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed modules and their promising performance in the considered crowd surveillance application...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and energetics of protein-carbohydrate and protein-protein interactions are {{of great interest}} due to their importance in many biological phenomena. Two cases of protein-carbohydrate interactions and one case of protein-protein interactions were predicted and analyzed using existing computational methods. Computational methods are shown to provide valuable insights for problems which are difficult to approach with experimental methods. Addressing the absence of crystallographic data, molecular docking methods are used to study the interactions of the enzyme Arylsulfatase A (ASA) with its natural sulfoglycolipid substrates and the activator protein saposin B (Sap B). Some of the predicted interactions of ASA with its natural sulfoglycolipid substrates were verified through mutational studies. The preliminary results of ASA interaction with Sap B were analyzed with existing clinical data on mutations of ASA. These results have implications in designing experiments involving ASA, Sap B and its substrates. The second case concerns binding of norovirus VA 387 {{with a variety of}} histo-blood group ABO active carbohydrate structures. Using an available crystal structure of the VA 387 capsid protein with B-trisaccharide, detailed interactions for 11 carbohydrate structures were predicted using molecular dynamics and binding <b>affinity</b> <b>scoring.</b> The predicted interactions stand in good agreement with the existing mutational data on the binding of VA 387 to carbohydrates. The results could be useful in structure-based drug design of adhesion inhibitors for noroviruses. In the scoring functions of current molecular docking methods, it is seen that entropic contributions are neglected. Methodological development for predicting entropic contributions in binding are planned as future studies...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{software}} developers often discuss {{the usage of}} various APIs in online forums. Automatically assigning pre-defined semantic categorizes to API discussions in these forums could help manage the data in online forums, and assist developers to search for useful information. We refer to this process as content categorization of API discussions. To solve this problem, Hou and Mo proposed the usage of naive Bayes multinomial, which is an effective classification algorithm. In this paper, we propose a Cache-bAsed compoSitE algorithm, short formed as CASE, to automatically categorize API discussions. Considering that the content of an API discussion contains both textual description and source code, CASE has 3 components that analyze an API discussion in 3 different ways: text, code, and original. In the text component, CASE only considers the textual description; in the code component, CASE only considers the source code; in the original component, CASE considers the original content of an API discussion which might include textual description and source code. Next, for each component, since different terms (i. e., words) have different affinities to different categories, CASE caches a subset of terms which have the highest <b>affinity</b> <b>scores</b> to each category, and builds a classifier based on the cached terms. Finally, CASE combines all the 3 classifiers to achieve a better accuracy score. We evaluate the performance of CASE on 3 datasets which contain a total of 1, 035 API discussions. The experiment results show that CASE achieves accuracy scores of 0. 69, 0. 77, and 0. 96 for the 3 datasets respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method proposed by Hou and Mo by 11 %, 10 %, and 2 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The p 53 protein {{has been}} called the “gatekeeper ” of the cell. After DNA damage, p 53 transcriptionally {{activates}} downstream pathways to prevent cancer from occurring. Target genes are activated to cause cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, cell senescence, and apoptosis. However, the exact transcriptional program that determines the specific outcome of a certain cell stress is not completely understood. We present an analysis to help shed light on the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by the p 53 protein. First, we present a detailed analysis of the known modes of p 53 -regulation, and a dataset of 160 functional human p 53 -binding sites curated from the literature. Second, we present a new method (called p 53 HMM) to model p 53 -binding sites using Profile Hidden Markov Models (PHMMs). This new method is the most accurate predictor of functional p 53 single-sites and cluster-sites to date. Third, we show that functional sites with low estimated relative <b>affinity</b> <b>scores</b> are highly correlated with distances from the TSS. Fourth, we show that the capability to fold into a non-linear cruciform DNA structure is an important predictor in estimating the overall binding affinity of a functional p 53 -binding site. We ii use UNAFold to calculate free energies and probabilities of p 53 -binding sites folding into different non-linear cruciform structures. Fifth, we present a new motif-finding algorithm (called PURE) that uses relative entropy to find over- and under-represented motifs near functional p 53 -binding sites. The goal is to find possible motifs (like co-factor motifs) that can help designate functional p 53 -binding sites, thereby reducing the false positive rate that currently plagues motif-finding algorithms. ii...|$|R
