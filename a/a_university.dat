5|$|Oliphant envisaged Canberra one day {{becoming}} <b>a</b> <b>university</b> {{town like}} Oxford or Cambridge. A {{threat to the}} future of the University arose in the wake of the 1949 election, when the Liberal Party of Australia led by Robert Menzies won. Many Liberals were opposed to the University, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the Menzies government amalgamated it with the Canberra University College. Henceforth, it would no longer be a research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission, and the ANU remained <b>a</b> <b>university</b> where research is central to its activities. Despite the setbacks, by 2014 the vision of Canberra as <b>a</b> <b>university</b> town would be well on its way to becoming a reality.|$|E
