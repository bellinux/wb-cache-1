40|$|The hybrid {{created from}} the {{crossbreeding}} of European and African bees, {{known as the}} <b>Africanised</b> <b>bee,</b> has provided numerous advantages for current beekeeping. However, this new species exhibits undesirable behaviours, such as colony defence instinct and a propensity to attack en masse, which can result in serious accidents. To date, there is no effective treatment for cases of <b>Africanised</b> <b>bee</b> envenomation. One promising technique for developing an efficient antivenom {{is the use of}} phage display technology, which enables the production of human antibodies, thus avoiding the complications of serum therapy, such as anaphylaxis and serum sickness. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce human monoclonal single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments capable of inhibiting the toxic effects of <b>Africanised</b> <b>bee</b> venom. We conducted four rounds of selection of antibodies against the venom and three rounds of selection of antibodies against purified melittin. Three clones were selected and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to verify their specificity for melittin and phospholipase A 2. Two clones (C 5 and C 12) were specific for melittin, and one (A 7) was specific for phospholipase A 2. In a kinetic haemolytic assay, these clones were evaluated individually and in pairs. The A 7 -C 12 combination had the best synergistic effect and was chosen to be used in the assays of myotoxicity inhibition and lethality. The A 7 -C 12 combination inhibited the in vivo myotoxic effect of the venom and increased the survival of treated animals.
