One of the Terrio daughters, Marie Louise [...] "Lulu" [...] Terrio had gone to Denmark the year before {{he moved to the}} village to study {{biochemistry}} at the University of Copenhagen. She became an ardent sailor in Denmark, married a Dane and gave birth to a son named Mark Patrick. When her marriage broke up, she moved back to D'Escousse with her son and, [...] "nervous as a schoolboy," [...] Cameron asked her to help him sail his schooner to Louisbourg, Cape Breton in 1979. He writes that he fell [...] "hopelessly in love with her" [...] when she asked him to take the tiller, vomited over the side, [...] "wiped her mouth, climbed back to the afterdeck <b>and</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tiller." [...] They were married in May 1980 in D'Escousse and 10 years later sailed around Cape Breton Island in Silversark, a voyage recounted in Wind, Whales and Whisky.|$|E

5000|$|I was peering anxiously ahead, for the {{controller}} had given us warning {{of at least}} fifty enemy fighters approaching very high. When we did first sight them, nobody shouted, as I think we all saw {{them at the same}} moment. They must have been 500 to 1,000 feet above us and coming straight on like a swarm of locusts. I remember cursing and going automatically into line astern; the next moment we were in among them and it was each man for himself. As soon as they saw us they spread out and dived, and the next ten minutes was a blur of twisting machines and tracer bullets. One Messerschmitt went down in a sheet of flame on my right, and a Spitfire hurtled past in a half-roll; I was weaving and turning {{in a desperate attempt to}} gain height, with the machine practically hanging on the airscrew.Then, just below me and to my left, I saw what I had been praying for - a Messerschmitt climbing and away from the sun. I closed in to 200 yards, and from slightly to one side gave him a two-second burst: fabric ripped off the wing and black smoke poured from the engine, but he did not go down. Like a fool, I did not break away, but put in another three-second burst. Red flames shot upwards and he spiralled out of sight. At that moment, I felt a terrific explosion which knocked the control stick from my hand, and the whole machine quivered like a stricken animal. In a second, the cockpit was a mass of flames: instinctively, I reached up to open the hood. It would not move. I tore off my straps and managed to force it back; but this took time, and when I dropped back into the seat <b>and</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stick in an effort to turn the plane on its back, the heat was so intense that I could feel myself going. I remember a second of sharp agony, remember thinking [...] "So this is it!" [...] and putting both hands to my eyes. Then I passed out.|$|E
40|$|Preverbal infants ’ {{understanding}} of referential gestures* CLAUDIA THOERMERBEATE SODIAN} University of W&uuml;rzburg In a short-term longitudinal study, 10 - and 12 -month-old infants’ (N = 43) comprehension of referential gestures (gaze- and point-comprehension) was assessed independently in an attention-following task, and a preference-for-novelty task, measuring infants ’ encoding of actor-goal-relations (cf. Woodward 1998). Consistent with previous findings, marked developmental progress {{was found in}} gaze- and point-following between 10 and 12 months, with 12 -month-olds approaching ceiling. In contrast, neither 10 -nor 12 -month-olds responded {{to a change in}} relation between actor and object, when the actor looked at or looked and pointed at the target object, whereas at 12 months of age they did, when the actor both looked at <b>and</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> target. These findings indicate that infants ’ ability to follow communicative gestures is not initially accompanied by an {{understanding of}} the intentional relation between communicator and referent independently of the communicative situation. The findings support the role of early pragmatic scaffolding in caretaker-infant interaction in building such an understanding...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the mechanism(s) {{for the growth}} retardation associated with malnutrition early in life, the relationships among plasma somatomedin-C (SM-C), plasma GH, and hepatic bovine GH-binding sites were assessed in rat pups that were milk-deprived from birth until weaning (21 days). After this period of malnutrition, body weight, tail length, plasma SM-C, and liver GH-binding capacity of the malnourished animals were significantly (P less than 0. 001) reduced below those of control, well fed rats [SM-C at 21 days, 0. 06 +/- 0. 01 vs. 0. 30 +/- 0. 04 U/ml (mean +/- SE); GH binding, 2. 96 +/- 0. 39 vs. 7. 19 +/- 0. 80 pmol/liver]. The number of GH-binding sites per mg DNA was also reduced (0. 59 +/- 0. 06 vs. 1. 08 +/- 0. 11 pmol/mg DNA; P less than 0. 001). After 1 week of ad libitum refeeding (days 21 - 28), body weight and tail length of malnourished pups increased significantly but {{showed no signs of}} catching up with that of control pups. Plasma SM-C and liver GH-binding capacity in the malnourished rats also rose significantly (P less than 0. 005) after refeeding, but remained as far below controls as at 21 days [SM-C on day 28, 0. 19 +/- 0. 02 vs. 0. 53 +/- 0. 02 U/ml (P less than 0. 001); GH binding, 6. 59 +/- 0. 99 vs. 12. 94 +/- 1. 60 pmol/liver (P less than 0. 005) ]. After 7 weeks of refeeding (days 21 - 70), tail length but not body weight recovered, while plasma SM-C levels were normalized. The mean number of GH binding sites per mg DNA in the malnourished rats was not significantly different from that in controls <b>and</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> males and the females, respectively, 79 % and 86 % of control binding. When expressed per liver, GH binding followed a similar pattern; for the males, binding capacity returned to 73 % of the control value (20. 45 +/- 1. 82 vs. 27. 93 +/- 3. 49 pmol/liver; P = NS), and for the females, it returned to 77 % of the control value (36. 42 +/- 1. 76 vs. 47. 42 +/- 4. 13 pmol/liver; P less than 0. 01). In the young rats up to day 28, liver GH-binding capacities correlated with plasma SM-C concentrations (r = 0. 81; P less than 0. 01), while in the adult rats no correlation was present. During malnutrition and refeeding, there were no changes in the affinity constants of the hepatic GH-binding sites or in plasma GH concentrations. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
