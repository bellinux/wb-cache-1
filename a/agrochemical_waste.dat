40|$|Abstract: Fresh water {{scarcity}} {{is predicted to}} become the greatest single threat to international stability, human health, global food supply and even the spectre of war over water. According to the World Resources Institute, within 25 years, {{more than half of}} the world population will be suffering severe fresh water shortages. Earlier research has demonstrated vetiver grass’s extraordinary ability to withstand highly adverse climatic and edaphic conditions including elevated levels of salt, acidity, alkalinity, sodicity as well as a whole range of heavy metals. Latest research also shows its extraordinary ability to absorb and tolerate extreme levels of nutrients and consume a large quantity of water in the process of producing a massive growth. These attributes indicate that vetiver is ideally suitable for treating contaminated and polluted wastewater from industries as well as domestic discharge. This review covers past and current research and applications of Vetiver System in treating wastewater, including: • Wastewater volume or quantity by: seepage control, land irrigation and wetland. • Wastewater quality by: trapping sediment and particles, tolerating and absorbing pollutants, and heavy metals and detoxification of industrial, mining and <b>agrochemical</b> <b>wastes.</b> But the most significant advance recently, is the use of vetiver grass in computer modelling to treat industrial wastewater. For this application, not only all known aspects of vetiver physiological and morphological attributes, but also its potential were carefully studied and analysed in the calibration process. The results again establish and confirm our admiration for this unique plant...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>agrochemicals</b> <b>waste</b> water from agricultural fields poses major environmental {{and human health}} problems which may be solved by phytoremediation technologies. Phytoremediation {{is the use of}} plants to remediate contaminants in the environment. Batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of four aquatic macrophytes (Cyperus papyrus, Typha latifolia, Cyperus alternifolius and Phragmites mauritianus) towards phytoremediation of agrochemicals from simulated wastewater in Arusha, Tanzania. The selected agrochemicals belonged to different categories namely heavy metal based (Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) and pesticides (L-Cyhalothrin, Endosulfan and Permethrin). The change in mean concentration of the agrochemicals was described by first-order reaction kinetics. The results indicated that the removal rate constants were greater for the batch experiments planted with the macrophytes than for the control group. Furthermore, the rate of removal varied between the treatments for the different categories of agrochemicals. As far as heavy metals are concerned, Cyperus papyrus had a greater removal Cu and Fe with the k values of 0. 338 d- 1 and 0. 168 d- 1 respectively and Typha latifolia had a greater removal of Mn and Zinc with k values 0. 420 d- 1 and 0. 442 d- 1 respectively. On the other hand, the pesticides endosulfan and permethrin were greatly removed by Cyperus papyrus with k values 0. 086 d- 1 and 0. 114 d- 1 respectively. Lastly, L-Cyhalothrin was removed greatly by Typha latifolia with k value of 0. 116 d- 1. Generally, the result...|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} literature, {{it is clear}} that the {{variation}} of aquifer chemistry from place to place depends upon the influences of geogenic origin associated with soil–rock–water interactions, mineral weathering and dissolution, ion exchange and evaporation as the main controlling processes, while the impact of anthropogenic activities like domestic <b>wastes,</b> <b>agrochemicals</b> and irrigation return flows as the secondary regulating factors. These basic concepts can be helpful for assessing the groundwater quality and contamination in the present study area.|$|R
50|$|Intensive {{factory farming}} {{has grown to}} become {{the biggest threat to}} the global {{environment}} through the loss of ecosystem services and global warming. It is a major driver to global environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. The process in which feed needs to be grown for animal use only is often grown using intensive methods which involve a significant amount of fertiliser and pesticides. This sometimes results in the pollution of water, soil and air by <b>agrochemicals</b> and manure <b>waste,</b> and use of limited resources such as water and energy at unsustainable rates.|$|R
40|$|This {{study from}} Vietnam {{shows that a}} switch from {{conventional}} to organic tea productions would bring real environmental, health and economic benefits for the country’s farmers and its society as a whole. In particular, the amount of <b>agrochemical</b> residue and <b>waste</b> produced by tea production would be reduced. Farmers would {{also be able to}} enjoy a better livelihood as they could command a premium price for their organic tea products. The study therefore recommends that organic tea production is the best method for farmers to adopt.

40|$|Soil {{contamination}} {{may influence}} negatively soil health, which often limits and sometimes disqualifies soil biodiversity and decreases plant growth. Soil health is the continued {{capacity of the}} soil {{to function as a}} vital living system, providing essential ecosystem services. Within soils, all bio-geo-chemical processes of the different ecosystem components are combined. These processes are able to sustain biological productivity of soil, to maintain the quality of surrounding air and water environments, as well as to promote plant, animal, and human health. A common criterion to evaluate long term sustainability of ecosystems is to assess the quality of soil. However, the increased concentration and distribution of toxic substances in soils by mismanagement of industrial activities, overuse of <b>agrochemicals</b> and <b>waste</b> disposal are causing worldwide concern. A major environmental concern in the Mediterranean countries is the production of the large quantities of olive oil mill wastewater (OMW) produced during olive oil extraction process. OMW inhibits several groups of bacteria and fungal species, thus affecting soil stability. In the present study, we investigated the effect of OMW on the soil physical, chemical characteristics and the microarthropods structure. All soil samples were collected from an olive mill garden in Northwest Jordan. Biological soil quality index (QBS-ar) values appeared to decrease with respect to soil pollution by OMW. All investigated parameters were significantly different depending on the levels of OMW contamination in soil. Anthropogenic activities influenced the microarthropod community, altering both quantity and quality of soil chemical and physical structure of the microhabitats. Preliminary data obtained in this study suggest that the application of QBS-ar index could be a useful tool for evaluating surface soils health status...|$|R
40|$|Farms {{are one of}} {{the last}} uncharted frontiers of {{environmental}} regulation in the United States. Despite the substantial environmental harms they cause-habitat loss and degradation, soil erosion and sedimentation, water resources depletion, soil and water salinization, <b>agrochemical</b> releases, animal <b>wastes,</b> nonpoint source water pollution, and air pollution-environmental law has given them a virtual license to do so. When combined, the active and passive safe harbors farms enjoy in most environmental laws amount to an anti-law that finds no rational basis given the magnitude of harms farms cause. This paper comprehensively documents the environmental harms farms cause and the safe harbors they enjoy in environmental law, then argues for a core federal statute that blends regulation, information, tax, incentive, and trading instruments to address several of the major sources of harm. It is shown that conventional prescriptive regulation simply will not effectively fit the geographic, economic, and political demographics of farms, but that the proposed blend of instruments could achieve significant gains in farms' environmental performance without excessive administrative or compliance complexities and costs...|$|R

It therefore highlights the fact that clean tea production (which has a less strict environmental management regime) can offer an interim approach that still brings higher quality standards and profitability for tea growers. There are a number of ways in which the government can promote clean tea and organic tea production. Support from governmental agencies and NGOs in the form of technical training and on-farm monitoring is vital. The government can also create a market mechanism to guarantee a premium price for organic tea products. Organic tea, Vietnam...|$|R
40|$|Water bodies often receive <b>agrochemicals</b> {{and animal}} <b>waste</b> {{carrying}} fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and zoonotic pathogens, {{but we know}} little {{about the effects of}} agrochemicals on these microbes. We assessed the direct effects of the pesticides atrazine, malathion, and chlorothalonil and inorganic fertilizer on Escherichia coli and enterococcal survival in simplified microcosms held in the dark. E. coli strain composition in sediments and water column were positively correlated, but none of the agrochemicals had significant direct effects on E. coli strain composition or on densities of culturable FIBs. In a companion study, microcosms with nondisinfected pond water and sediments were exposed to or shielded from sunlight to examine the potential indirect effects of atrazine and inorganic fertilizer on E. coli. The herbicide atrazine had no effect on E. coli in dark-exposed microcosms containing natural microbial and algal communities. However, in light-exposed microcosms, atrazine significantly lowered E. coli densities in the water column and significantly increased densities in the sediment compared to controls. This effect appears to be mediated by the effects of atrazine on algae, given that atrazine significantly reduced phytoplankton, which was a positive and negative predictor of E. coli densities in the water column and sediment, respectively. These data suggest that atrazine does not directly affect the survival of FIB, rather that it indirectly alters the distribution and abundance of E. coli by altering phytoplankton and periphyton communities. These results improve our understanding of the influence of agricultural practices on FIB densities in water bodies impacted by agricultural runoff...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{agriculture}} (UA) increasingly supplies {{food and}} non-food values to {{the rapidly growing}} West African cities. However, with its typically heavy use of <b>agrochemicals,</b> untreated municipal <b>waste</b> and sewage as inputs for crop and vegetables production, UA bears severe risks of soil and ground water contamination. This study aimed at a consistent quantitative characterisation of the vertical transfer of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) in the soil {{of different types of}} UA crops with special emphasis on their seasonal and spatial variation in order to minimize negative side effects on environmental health. The study was carried out in Bobo-Dioulasso with South-soudanian climate type. In four representative gardens, TDR soil moisture probes, together with CTN soil temperature probes installed horizontally at 10; 30 and 60 cm depth were used to monitor rapid changes in soil moisture and total solute concentration. Vertical leaching losses of N, P and K were determined concurrently with the water balance study over 12 months. Leachates were collected using zero-tension pan lysimeters and analyzed for total P, N, and K content. The selected sites were also equipped below the crops’ rooting depth with anion/cation exchange resin cartridges for monitoring the leaching of K, NO 3, NH 4, and PO 4. Four vegetable cultivation crops were evaluated: tomato, cabbage, carrot and lettuce. Three treatments were used: - T 100 : normal amount of organic and mineral fertilizers (gardener’s practice), - T 70 : 70 % of normal amount of organic and mineral fertilizers, and T 0 : no fertilization. The preliminary results suggest that the reduction of amount of fertilization don’t significantly affect crop production and that the initial nutrients in soil can support at least two crop cycles before fertilization. The reduction of the amount of fertilization significantly reduced the amount of N total and K total in soil solute samples collected below the rooting depth (30 cm) ...|$|R
