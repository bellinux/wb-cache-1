The wear resistance of AlSi surface is thought to originate from the high hardness of the silicon surface formed by the primary Si particles (inclusions).

In this work, a hybrid method to characterize the fracture and interface debonding of Si particles in an <b>AlSi</b> <b>alloy</b> has been developed, which combining a nanoindentation experiment and a finite element analysis.

40|$|International audienceSi {{addition}} to Al is {{considered as a}} promising route to reduce (U,Mo) -Al interaction kinetics, due to its accumulation in the interaction layer, yielding the formation of silicide phases. The (U,Mo) alloy microstructure, and especially its homogenization state, could play a role on this accumulation process. The addition of a third element in γ(U,Mo) could also influence diffusion mechanisms of Al and Si. These two parameters were studied by means of diffusion couple experiments by joining γU based alloys with Al and (<b>Al,Si)</b> <b>alloy.</b> Chemical elements X added into γ(U,Mo) were thoroughly chosen on the following criteria: (i) the potential solubility of the alloying element into the γ(U,Mo) matrix, (ii) its capability to form the ternary aluminides based on the CeCr 2 Al 20 and Ho 6 Mo 4 Al 43 - types, and (iii) the feasibility to control the microstructure of the alloys.

Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) technology can produce metallic parts by selectively fusing powders layer by layer. The metallurgy and properties of such materials are still unknown, but they are clearly unlike equivalent parts produced by traditional manufacturing methods. Two aluminium alloys are investigated in this thesis; an Al- 10 %Si casting alloy and a 6061 wrought alloy. Both materials were received as powders and used to build a component in PBF process.

40|$|AlSi liners in {{internal}} combustion engines are heterogeneous and highly stressed mechanical parts. Due to reduction of weight, {{more and more}} liners are built using hypereutectic <b>AlSi</b> <b>alloys.</b> With respect to tribology, however, AlSi liners scratch the limits of wear rate, system stability and sensitivity to external influences as for example fuel wetting in direct injection engines. One of the most problematic phases is the running-in where the silicon primary crystals are subjected to a drastic grain size reduction forming a mechanically alloyed compound. With {{the help of a}} newly designed piston ring/liner simulator friction and real-time wear were measured for entire rings versus liner segments. In addition, high resolution microscopy and chemical analysis were applied to study the grain size reduction as well as the influence of engine oil and of fluel-diluted oil. The precise control of the acting forces allowed to quantify the onset of the tribo-mechanical <b>alloying</b> process. <b>AlSi</b> liners {{in internal}} combustion engines are heterogeneous and highly stressed mechanical parts.

40|$|Nowadays {{ultrasound}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} relevant treatment in the metallurgy field able to improve microstructure and mechanical properties of aluminium alloys. This simple technique, in fact, allows the achievement of different advantages like degassing, grain refinement, non-dendritic (globular) microstructure, filtration and solubilisation via a single treatment step. On the other hand, it is influenced from the process parameters used. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the influence the microstructure of process parameters such as the amount of treated alloy, the melt temperature and the used frequency. FEM analysis was used to evaluate the ultrasound treatment effectiveness; a comparative analysis between finite element simulations and experimental results was performed on <b>AlSi</b> <b>alloys.</b> It was found that, even working in a not optimized configuration, the treatment guarantees a limited but positive effect...|$|R
40|$|Hypereutectic AlSiFe spray-cast alloys exhibit {{properties}} {{similar to}} those of metal-matrix composite (MMC's) : high Young's modulus and a low coefficient of thermal expansion. These physical properties can be adjusted by changing the Si content of the alloy. The refinement of the microstructure is produced by formation of a large amount of nuclei in the spray. Consolidation done by extrusion (bars, tubes or profiles) and/or forging leads to high mechanical properties, especially very good dynamic properties. High fatigue properties coupled with high modulus, good high temperature behaviour and low thermal expansion, allow their use for applications in the automotive industry. In opposition to MMC's, these materials present the advantage of easy recycling and easy machinability as it is the case for the conventional <b>AlSi</b> <b>alloys.</b> The low oxygen content allows quality joining with conventional arc welding techniques...|$|R
