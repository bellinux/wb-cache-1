It was well received on the day and was sufficient to gain him his doctorate but has not been performed since.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} because the designer Gregg Barnett wanted a large adventure for CD-based systems. A licence {{was difficult to}} obtain; Pratchett was reluctant to grant one as he wanted a Discworld game to be developed by <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>with</b> a reputation and who cared about the property. An original story was created due to Barnett having difficulty basing games on one book. Discworld was praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though some criticised its gameplay and difficult puzzles. Discworld {{was followed by a}} sequel, , in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, {{known as}} Bert Appleroth, was a tram {{conductor}} who created jelly crystals using gelatine {{and sugar in}} his bathtub. He sold these jelly crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his jelly, then formed <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>with</b> Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. Planes were considered new and exciting at the time, so aviation fan Appleroth named the brand Aeroplane Jelly. Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and Aeroplane Jelly's advertising campaigns made the jelly a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite.|$|E

5|$|Potential presidential {{candidates}} are vetted by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ("PEC"). The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny {{a certificate of}} eligibility. Its decision {{is not subject to}} legal or political scrutiny, and its verdict is final. There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan, who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, was denied a certificate of eligibility. Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter, he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character. Subsequently, Kuan was denied a certificate, the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to the experience of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>with</b> a paid-up capital of at least $100 million, as required by the Constitution. There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates, and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain his side of the story. As a result, the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term.|$|E
