5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> structures. Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
50|$|Note that a {{function}} with a vertical asymptote is not helpful in defining <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number,</b> although the function increases very rapidly: {{one has to}} define <b>an</b> argument <b>very</b> close to the asymptote, i.e. use <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small number, and constructing that is equivalent to constructing <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number,</b> e.g. the reciprocal.|$|R

5|$|Today, {{football}} is played at a professional level {{all over the}} world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010 a large hoard of third-century Roman coins was {{unearthed}} {{in a field}} {{near the}} town. Frome {{was one of the}} largest towns in Somerset until the Industrial Revolution, and was larger than Bath from AD 950 until 1650. The town originally grew due to the wool and cloth industry. It later diversified into metal-working and printing, although these have declined. The town was enlarged during the 20th century but still retains <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> listed buildings, and most of the centre falls within a conservation area.|$|E
5|$|The {{bivalves}} are {{a highly}} successful class of invertebrates found in aquatic habitats throughout the world. Most are infaunal and live buried in sediment on the seabed, or in the sediment in freshwater habitats. A large number of bivalve species {{are found in the}} intertidal and sublittoral zones of the oceans. A sandy sea beach may superficially appear to be devoid of life, but often <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bivalves and other invertebrates are living {{beneath the surface of the}} sand. On a large beach in South Wales, careful sampling produced an estimate of 1.44 million cockles (Cerastoderma edule) per acre of beach.|$|E

5|$|To {{accomplish}} just-in-time weaving, {{a change}} to the virtual machine that executes the compiled bytecode is necessary. A proposed solution for AspectJ uses a layered approach which builds upon the existing Java Virtual Machine to add support for join point management and callbacks to a Dynamic Aspect-Oriented Programming Engine. An alternative implementation uses a weaving engine that uses breakpoints to halt execution at the pointcut, select an appropriate method, embed it into the application, and continue. The use of breakpoints in this manner {{has been shown to}} reduce performance due to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> context switches.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> words, no purely logographic scripts {{are known}} to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E

25|$|Criticism {{includes}} {{that it may}} {{be better}} to look at the contributing personality factors rather than treat psychopathy as a unitary concept due to poor testability. Empirical evidence regarding the suggested reproductive success is lacking. Furthermore, if psychopathy is caused by the combined effects of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> adverse mutations then each mutation may have such a small effect that it escapes natural selection. The personality is thought to be influenced by <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> genes and may be disrupted by random mutations, and psychopathy may instead be a product of a high mutation load. Psychopathy has alternatively been suggested to be a spandrel, a byproduct, or side-effect, of the evolution of adaptive traits rather than an adaptation in itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{central limit theorem}} gives only an {{asymptotic}} distribution.
