5|$|By April 2009, market {{research}} firm OTX reported that ODST was the most highly anticipated video game, a spot it continued to hold in late August. Before its release the title was the top-selling game on Amazon.com based on preorders alone, spending 107days atop the merchant's top 100 video games and software list. Copies of ODST were sold early in France. Microsoft responded by launching an investigation <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> ban any players on Xbox Live playing ODST before its official release; Xbox lead manager Stephen Toulouse later clarified {{that they would not}} ban legitimate buyers.|$|E

They are {{interrupted}} by Vic (Michael Mando), whom Alison met in rehab and who is acting as an informant to Detective Angie DeAngelis (Inga Cadranel). Donnie threatens to shoot Vic, who confesses that Angie is parked nearby, before walking into Angie's van <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> destroy her career if she continues to stalk his family, taking a picture of her with Vic as blackmail. After burying Leekie's body and re-laying the cement, Alison confesses her sudden attraction to Donnie and they have sex in the garage.|$|E
5|$|As hats {{go out of}} fashion, the {{anthropomorphic}} bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell. Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E

5|$|Mardonius {{moved to}} break the stalemate, by {{offering}} peace, self-government and territorial expansion to the Athenians (with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the Allied forces), using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediary. The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer, but rejected it. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> accept the Persian terms if not. The Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision for 10 days. However, when the Athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already marching to meet the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{knew that}} the French fleet could not defeat the Royal Navy in a {{head-to-head}} battle, so he planned to lure {{it away from the}} English Channel through diversionary tactics. The main strategic idea involved the French Navy escaping from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> attack the West Indies. In the face of this attack, it was hoped, the British would weaken their defense of the Western Approaches by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet {{to take control of the}} channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade. However, the plan unraveled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805. French Admiral Villeneuve then retreated to Cádiz instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|The King expresses to Sylvia {{his desire}} that she wed him. However, agents of Rome have been {{plotting}} to banish the mistress from Naples. When the King, dismayed, offers to grant her any request, she asks that Leone be set free. A monk appears, brandishing the Papal bull <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> banish Sylvia if she remains a mistress to the King. The King plots with Don Gaspar to free Leone and wed him to Sylvia, although Leone {{would be sent}} away and Sylvia would remain the King's mistress. Leone and Sylvia marry, but when Leone discovers the plot, he breaks his sword {{in front of the}} King and leaves under the monk's escort.|$|E

5|$|When the Chinese forces, {{numbering}} up to 1,000 <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> cut {{supply lines}} to Semarang, arrived in Tanjung in April 1741, Visscher told the regent {{to deal with}} them; however, the regent's forces stalled, refusing to move until they received a tribute of high quality rice. After Yonko sent the rice, the regent's men went to Tanjung, stood with the rebels outside of their range, then fired and left. The rebels soon occupied a sugar mill there. In Grobogan, Mertopuro, armed with weapons from the Dutch military command, staged {{an attack on the}} Chinese rebels, in which the Javanese troops opened fire on the Chinese before the Dutch came. Once the Dutch arrived, Mertopuro showed bullet wounds in horses—inflicted by his own men—as proof that he had fought.|$|E
5|$|After 1143 the war ground on, but {{progressing}} {{slightly better}} for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the}} most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the King recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, before arresting him <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen. By this point, however, Stephen's practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.|$|E
5|$|Despite Kỳ and Đức's media event, it {{appeared}} that Phát and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in Mỹ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> {{break away from the}} Saigon regime by overseeing the area around Mỹ Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton was reported to have threatened to cut the main highway from Saigon into Mỹ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was thought he had no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. Kỳ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Khánh had the plotters taken into custody. Đức, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Phát, who returned to Saigon to turn himself in. A trial was then scheduled. Khánh removed three of the four corps commanders and six of the nine division commanders for failing to move against Phát and Đức.|$|E

5|$|In 1648, the {{relatively}} brief Second English Civil War broke out, and Rupert informed the French King {{that he would}} be returning to King Charles' service. The Parliamentary navy mutinied in favour of the King and sailed for Holland, providing the Royalists with a major fleet {{for the first time since}} the start of the civil conflict; Rupert joined the fleet under the command of the Duke of York, who assumed the rank of Lord High Admiral. Rupert argued that the fleet should be used to rescue the King, then being held prisoner on the Isle of Wight, while others advised sailing in support of the fighting in the north. The fleet itself rapidly lost discipline, with many vessels' crews focussing on seizing local ships and cargoes. This underlined a major problem for the Royalists—the cost of maintaining the new fleet was well beyond their means. Discipline continued to deteriorate, and Rupert had to intervene personally several times, including defusing one group of mutinous sailors by suddenly dangling the ringleader over the side of his vessel <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> drop him into the sea. Most of the fleet finally switched sides once more, returning to England in late 1648.|$|E
5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on it now <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the party}} {{continues}} {{and the party}} goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer {{and some of the}} other guests who happen to be above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E
