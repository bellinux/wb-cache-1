The hardware and online platforms were both discontinued in February 2001. Only nine official disks, including three third-party games and one Internet <b>application</b> <b>suite,</b> were released for it. Most 64DD games were either released as cartridge-based Nintendo 64 games as cartridge storage sizes had increased, ported to other consoles such as Nintendo's next-generation GameCube console, or canceled entirely.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 2005, the Mozilla Foundation {{announced}} that it would not release any official versions of Mozilla <b>Application</b> <b>Suite</b> beyond 1.7.x, since it had now focused on the standalone applications Firefox and Thunderbird. However, the Foundation emphasized that it would still provide infrastructure for community members who wished to continue development.

25|$|The Firefox {{project began}} as an {{experimental}} branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt, Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross. They believed the commercial requirements of Netscape's sponsorship and developer-driven feature creep compromised {{the utility of the}} Mozilla browser. To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, they created a stand-alone browser, with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite. On April 3, 2003, the Mozilla Organization announced that they planned to change their focus from the Mozilla Suite to Firefox and Thunderbird. The community-driven SeaMonkey was formed and eventually replaced the Mozilla <b>Application</b> <b>Suite</b> in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In March 2014, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that because Microsoft and Google had both implemented policies which effectively ban the certification of devices which dual-boot both Android and Windows, the Transformer Book Duet would be cancelled, and Asus would pull its similar all-in-one desktops from the market. Both companies had reportedly {{objected to the}} concept of dual-OS devices of this nature as early as January 2014. Prior to CES, an analyst believed that Microsoft was discouraging manufacturers from releasing such devices because they would dilute Windows 8 and Windows Phone's software ecosystem (which Microsoft was reportedly planning to unify). He also speculated that Microsoft would penalize OEMs by forfeiting discounts on Windows licenses and refusing to provide them with financing for marketing. Additionally, even though Android is an open source operating system that is freely available, Google's <b>application</b> <b>suite</b> is proprietary, and can only be licensed for devices which are approved by the company. This would prevent such devices from including access to Google Play, Android's primary application store.|$|E
50|$|Universal Network Objects (UNO) is the {{component}} model {{used in the}} OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice computer software <b>application</b> <b>suites.</b> It is interface-based and designed to offer interoperability between different programming languages, object models and machine architectures, on a single machine, within a LAN or over the Internet.|$|R
50|$|While running local {{productivity}} applications {{goes beyond}} the normal scope of a thin client, it is sometimes needed in rare use cases. License restrictions that apply to thin clients can sometimes prevent them from supporting these applications. Local storage constraints may also limit the space required to install large <b>applications</b> or <b>application</b> <b>suites.</b>|$|R
50|$|Multiscanning {{is running}} {{multiple}} anti-malware or antivirus engines concurrently. Traditionally, {{only a single}} engine can actively scan a system at a given time. Using multiple engines simultaneously can result in conflicts that lead to system freezes and application failures. However, a number of security <b>applications</b> and <b>application</b> <b>suites</b> have optimized multiple engines to work together.|$|R
2500|$|On January 23, 1998, Netscape {{made two}} announcements: first, that Netscape Communicator would be free; second, {{that the source}} code would also be free. One day later Jamie Zawinski, from Netscape, {{registered}} [...] The project took its name, [...] "Mozilla" [...] after the original code-name of the Netscape Navigator browser - a portmanteau of [...] "Mosaic and Godzilla" [...] and used to co-ordinate {{the development of the}} Mozilla <b>Application</b> <b>Suite,</b> the open-source version of Netscape's internet software, Netscape Communicator. Jamie Zawinski says he came up with the name [...] "Mozilla" [...] at a Netscape staff meeting. A small group of Netscape employees were tasked with coordination of the new community.|$|E
2500|$|Firefox {{was created}} in 2002 under the name [...] "Phoenix" [...] by Mozilla {{community}} members who desired a standalone browser, rather than the Mozilla <b>Application</b> <b>Suite</b> bundle. Even during its beta phase, Firefox proved to be popular with its testers and was praised for its speed, security, and add-ons compared to Microsoft's then-dominant Internet Explorer6. Firefox was released in November 2004, and was highly successful with 60 million downloads within nine months, {{which was the first}} time that Internet Explorer's dominance was challenged. Firefox is considered the spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator, as the Mozilla community was created by Netscape in 1998 before their acquisition by AOL.|$|E
2500|$|Raskin left Apple in 1982 {{and formed}} Information Appliance, Inc. to {{implement}} the concepts of his original Macintosh concept. The first product was the SwyftCard, a firmware card for the Apple II containing an integrated <b>application</b> <b>suite,</b> also released on a disk as SwyftWare. Information Appliance later developed the Swyft as a stand-alone laptop computer. Raskin licensed this design to Canon, which shipped a similar desktop product as the Canon Cat. Released in 1987, the unit had an innovative interface that attracted much interest {{but it did not}} become a commercial success. Raskin claimed that its failure was due in some part to Steve Jobs, who successfully pitched Canon on the NeXT Computer at about the same time. It has also been suggested that Canon canceled the CAT due to internal rivalries within its divisions. After running a cryptic full page advertisement in the [...] "Wall Street Journal" [...] that the [...] "Canon CAT is coming" [...] months before it was available, Canon failed to follow through, never airing the completed TV commercial when the CAT went on sale, only allowed the CAT to be sold by its typewriter sales people, and prevented Raskin from selling the CAT directly with a TV demonstration of {{how easy it was to}} use. Shortly thereafter, the stock market crash of 1987 so panicked Information Appliance's venture capitalists that they drained millions of dollars from the company, depriving it of the capital needed to be able to manufacture and sell the Swyft.|$|E
