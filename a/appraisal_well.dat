5000|$|Two {{campaigns of}} 3-D seismic {{was carried out}} along {{with a number of}} <b>appraisal</b> <b>wells</b> into the Arkutun-Dagi and Chayvo fields. The results were {{initially}} average from the <b>appraisal</b> <b>wells</b> with hydrocarbons being successfully tested, but there was a still a large amount of uncertainty involved with the project. However, in late 1998, a revaluation of the 3-D seismic data using the most advanced seismic-visualization techniques then available indicated that the hydrocarbon depth {{on the edge of the}} field could be significantly deeper than first thought. In 2000, the Chayvo 6a delineation well confirmed what was suspected, a 150 m oil column. This provided the certainty that the field was commercially viable in the hostile environment with a potential to be a [...] field.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Puffin Field was {{discovered}} by well 29 / 5 a- 1, drilled in 1981 to test a Base Cretaceous closure. The well encountered over-pressured gas-condensate-bearing Upper Jurassic shallow marine sandstones below 14, 000 ft. The well flowed over 20 x 10 6 SCFGD with 2650 barrels per day of condensate. Appraisal of the discovery, which fell into five phases, involved the acquisition of two 3 D seismic surveys and drilling of eight wells. This paper describes the appraisal of Puffin from an historical perspective. The initial geological model involved an intra-graben horst draped by a relatively uniform blanket of Fulmar Formation sandstones. The first two <b>appraisal</b> <b>wells</b> were disappointing and hinted at previously unsuspected complexities. The second pair of <b>appraisal</b> <b>wells,</b> although proving up further hydrocarbons, penetrated thick Triassic sequences, with the Pentland and Fulmar Formations being absent. These results were incompatible with the existing eological model and a new model was developed. This envisaged the presence of several large Triassic-cored pods, formed in response to salt withdrawal nd local tectonism, separated by narrow elongate zones (inter-pods) in which Middle and Upper Jurassic sections were present. Four further <b>appraisal</b> <b>wells</b> were drilled and proved the model to b...|$|R

50|$|The {{deepwater}} {{exploration licence}} No. 2/93 for 11 years, covering four {{blocks in the}} Slyne Trough, was granted on 1 January 1993 to Enterprise Oil.

40|$|When a {{discovery}} has been made, <b>appraisal</b> <b>wells</b> are drilled, cored and logged. With {{the information they}} provide, {{an evaluation of the}} formation characteristics begin. Many parameters are correlated to the porosity log, and in a shaly formation some corrections must be made to this log in order to represent the oil bearing sand characteristics. Two approaches has been investigated; total porosity with a fractional net-to-gross ratio, and an effective porosity method. Together with them, the Waxman & Smit and Poupon & Leveaux Indonesia equation was applied for water saturation evaluation. Input from 8 <b>appraisal</b> <b>wells</b> at Ivar Aasen in the North Sea has been used. The logs where interpreted, unique geomodels built and simulations were run. This showed there are large differences in calculated volume in place and oil recovery based on method selected. Both approaches are similar to their sensitivity to volume shale, and behave a little different when faults and vertical permeability is altered in the simulations...|$|R
