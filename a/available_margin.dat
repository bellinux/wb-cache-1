40|$|AbstractThe PFBR core, {{which is}} highly enriched, is very compact due to neutronic considerations. The gap {{provided}} for coolant flow is so less that deformation of the clad will disturb the coolable geometry, which {{may lead to}} severe damage to the core. If adjacent pins balloon at the same axial level (coherent ballooning) they may touch each other impeding a proper flow of the coolant. To make the reactor commercial, studies are being made to exploit the D 9 material at high burn up, longer cycle life and high temperature operations. The Design Safety Limits (DSLs) for fuel clad are given based on rupture. It is necessary to experimentally investigate and confirm the <b>available</b> <b>margin</b> at all category events, and to know at what conditions, the strain within the clad will affect the coolable geometry. Out of pile tests have been conducted with single fuel pin at high temperature and high pressure, to study the material behavior, to quantify and evaluate the <b>available</b> <b>margin</b> for the PFBR clad tube under various category events.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1980 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaAny {{satellite}} communications system operating near 20 GHz will occassionally experience deep fades due to rain attenuation. To maintain a high grade {{of service in}} spite of these fades such a system must have a large <b>available</b> <b>margin.</b> An approach to providing this margin in a high capacity FDMA communications satellite without requiring exorbitant spacecraft power or ground station antenna diversity is to dynamically provide a large margin to those links experiencing deep fades while maintaining only a small fade margin on all other links.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{simplified}} view of robustness and redundancy {{is presented}} for the seismic assessment {{and design of}} structures. It is argued that the topological simplicity of the seismic load, i. e., its highly correlated nature of application for practically every component {{in all but the}} ultra-long structures, means that simpler formulations can be devised compared to blast, wave or wind hazards. In that sense, robustness may be considered to express the influence of structural uncertainties on the seismic performance of the structure, in essence showing the <b>available</b> <b>margin</b> of safety subject to material variability. Quantitatively, a pertinent robustness/redundancy index is defined as the ratio of two different estimates of the mean annual frequency (MAF) of exceeding a limit-state of interest, such as global collapse: On the denominator lies the MAF estimate that incorporates all sources of variability while on the nominator is the estimate that neglects structural uncertainties. It is shown that a simple closed form solution is available that directly relates robustness to the dispersion of response due to model parameter uncertainty. As an example, a steel frame where only beams are allowed to yield is shown to be more robust compared to another version where columns become the sacrificial element. Structural robustness and redundancy are highly desirable structural properties that are understoo...|$|E

40|$|Cognitive radio {{technology}} enables the coexistence of Primary (PUs) and Secondary Users (SUs) {{in the same}} spectrum. In this work, {{it is assumed that}} the PU implements a retransmission-based error control technique (ARQ). This creates an inherent redundancy in the interference created by primary transmissions to the SU. We investigate secondary transmission policies that take advantage of this redundancy. The basic idea is that, if a Secondary Receiver (SR) learns the Primary Message (PM) in a given primary retransmission, then it can use this knowledge to cancel the primary interference in the subsequent slots in case of primary retransmissions, thus achieving a larger secondary throughput. This gives rise to interesting trade-offs {{in the design of the}} secondary policy. In fact, on the one hand, a secondary transmission potentially increases the secondary throughput but, on the other, causes interference to the reception of the PM at the Primary Receiver (PR) and SR. Such interference may induce retransmissions of the same PM, which plays to the advantage of the secondary user, while at the same time making decoding of the PM more difficult also at the SR and reducing the <b>available</b> <b>margin</b> on the given interference constraint at the PR. It is proved that the optimal secondary strategy prioritizes transmissions in the states where the PM is known to the SR, due to the ability of the latter to perform interference mitigation and obtain a larger secondary throughput. Moreover, when the primary constraint is sufficiently loose, the Secondary Transmitter should also transmit when the PM is unknown to the SR. The structure of the optimal policy is found, and the throughput benefit of the proposed technique is shown by numerical results...|$|E
40|$|The water battery, a {{reversible}} water electrolyser device {{being developed}} in a long-term research effort at Battelle's Columbus Laboratories, was evaluated in an analytical and conceptual design study as a load-levelling system for an electric utility. During periods when off-peak electrical power was available, the water battery would produce hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis of water; during peak demand periods the water battery would be operated in the reverse mode, functioning as a fuel cell by producing electrical power through the recombination of the oxygen and hydrogen held in its storage vessels. The analysis involved characterisation of the PSE&G system demand requirements {{now and in the}} future, its current off-peak energy availability, the typical sizing and placement of energy storage units and the approximate break even economics and potential advantages to the utility of a water battery energy storage system. In the economic analysis, the water battery was compared with the gas turbine and the fuel cell for cost effectiveness in meeting peak and intermediate power demands, respectively. Compared with a [`]reformer-type' fuel cell (costed at $ 300 /kW for intermediate duty) the break even capital cost of a 50 % efficient water battery would be $ 100 /kW plus about $ 200 /kW for each increase of $ 1 / 106 Btu above the reference cost of $ 1 / 106 Btu for fossil fuel. The <b>available</b> <b>margin</b> would increase about $ 50 /kW for each decrease of 1 mill/kWh in off-peak energy cost below the reference cost of 8 mills/kWh. In a similar comparison with the gas turbine (costed at $ 135 /kW) for peaking duty, the break even cost of a 50 % efficient water battery would be $ 100 /kW.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and management of}} the nuclear programmes requires compliance with the nuclear safety objectives of the installations for all the lifecycle phases. From this perspective the international experience showed the need for a set of quality assurance standards for components and services in order to support the achievement of the nuclear safety objectives of the nuclear installations As a result mainly of the situation described above the QA issue could be solved based on two different categories of approaches : a TOP-DOWN approach, as shown in IAEA 50 -C-Q, or a BOTTOM UP approach as in ISO – 9001. 1994 Some of the newest methods mentioned before try to evaluate the impact on the quality level/category so that to be able to answer the question what is the <b>available</b> <b>margin</b> on safety and the corresponding change in QA indicator in case of various changes (technical or organizational) impacting on the hierarchical system defining a nuclear programme and a nuclear installation.

40|$|Stormwater {{management}} can be {{a significant}} challenge in urban areas. As population density grows and impervious surface cover increases, the amount and intensity of stormwater runoff escalates correspondingly, placing added stress on water management systems and natural ecosystems. Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is increasingly being seen as a critical tool for addressing these challenges (Garrison and Hobbs 2011). Although a number of {{cities across the country}} have turned to GSI as a key component of their stormwater management system, oftentimes the scope is limited to public property. Since GSI is a distributed approach to stormwater management, programs must engage private property owners (Francis 2010). Energy efficiency programs have seen significant success engaging private property owners across the built environment despite experiencing many of the same challenges attracting investment in the face of high up-front costs and limited inherent collateral value (Palmer, Walls and Gerarden 2012). This project aims to better explain the key factors that influence the success of three types of energy efficiency financing programs in the United States and draw cross-sector parallels to GSI in order to inform a decision-making framework for GSI program design. This is accomplished through 1) a review of the existing literature on energy efficiency program design and the potential equivalencies between energy efficiency and green stormwater infrastructure, 2) an exploration of three financing mechanism case studies, and 3) the definition of decision criteria to provide initial direction for the evaluation of appropriate financing mechanisms in a specific case. In order to better understand the settings in which specific energy efficiency financing mechanisms would be most appropriate, this research evaluated three financing mechanisms: on-bill repayment, PACE financing, and performance contracting with Energy Services Companies (ESCOs). The data informing these case studies was gathered through research of secondary sources, a series of interviews of energy efficiency program administrators and energy and/or GSI industry experts, and a review of example programs. The case analysis informed a consideration of how each financing mechanism could be applied in the stormwater context. The findings reach beyond the existing literature to examine national level themes and provide a local-level decision making framework. Based on the findings of this report, a number of key factors exist that can direct decision-making around green stormwater infrastructure financing. First, a fundamental consideration is whether a stormwater fee structure exists to create the opportunity for savings. Assuming this requirement is met, the following criteria indicate the suitability of the three financing mechanisms for a specific jurisdiction: building stock of greatest concern, authorizing legislation, political buy-in, incentives, and regulatory requirements. The importance of each criteria varies for each financing mechanism. PACE programs are most appropriate in states with a history of PACE authorizing legislation, strong regulatory drivers for action and a wider range of target property sizes. Performance contracting is more appropriate in places with a high concentration of large-scale commercial building stock, limited legislative support and multiple available incentives. On-bill repayment programs are most applicable where there are more opportunities to pursue small-scale GSI and strong regulatory drivers for action. In addition, shared key factors that apply to all three of the case financing mechanisms will impact program viability and are important to consider in program design. These include the stormwater fee size and <b>available</b> <b>margin,</b> the potential to offer credit enhancements, the ability to leverage an economy of scale, the policy requirements affecting loan term stringency, and existing availability of financial partners. An applied analysis of how these findings impact Seattle, WA further illustrates the implications of these findings. The City has an itemized stormwater fee structure, an existing stormwater consent order and is actively investing in GSI. PACE financing is not possible in the state due to legislative restrictions. However, a stormwater credit already exists in the city and a commercial GSI program would target medium to large-scale commercial customers. Therefore, it is recommended that the City of Seattle explore performance contracting by supporting the development of a GISC. In order to make this possible, the City could create a public private partnership with local innovators and consider opportunities to provide credit enhancements. Secondarily, the City might also consider the potential to offer on-bill repayment for small scale projects. In both cases, the City will need to conduct further inquiry into the financial implications and political feasibility of these endeavors and create a framework for measurement and verification of stormwater savings...|$|E
40|$|Cold roller bending is {{commonly}} used for bending straight members with hot rolled wide-flange sections to create arches. This process induces plastic deformations along the member, {{so that it can}} acquire the desired curvature. The resulting residual stress distribution is different from the well-known residual stress pattern due to hot rolling. Extensive {{studies have shown that the}} influence of residual stresses due to hot rolling on the resistance of wide-flange steel sections is non negligible. On the contrary, the residual stress pattern due to roller bending has been only recently clearly identified and its effects on the elasto-plastic behavior of curved members have not been studied sufficiently. Thus, in this paper the influence of such residual stresses on the resistance of both wide-flange sections and corresponding arch members is investigated in detail. Taking into consideration the residual stress pattern due to cold bending, interaction diagrams are developed for combined axial load and bending moment, as well as buckling curves for cold bent steel arches. The results are quantified and compared with those for hot-rolled and stress free members. This will allow designers to appreciate the <b>available</b> <b>margins</b> of safety when using standard residual stress pattern for cold bent members. Furthermore, the results suggest the necessity for the development of buckling curves for curved members including initial imperfections...|$|R
40|$|Using scanner {{data and}} time diaries, we {{document}} how households substitute time for money through shopping and home production. We find {{evidence that there}} is substantial heterogeneity in prices paid across households for identical consumption goods in the same metro area at any given point in time. For identical goods, prices paid are highest for middle age, rich, and large households, consistent with the hypothesis that shopping intensity is low when the cost of time is high. The data suggest that a doubling of shopping frequency lowers the price paid for a given good by approximately 10 percent. From this elasticity and observed shopping intensity, we impute the opportunity cost of time for the shopper which peaks in middle age at a level roughly 40 percent {{higher than that of}} retirees. Using this measure of the price of time and observed time spent in home production, we estimate the parameters of a home production function. We find an elasticity of substitution between time and market goods in home production of close to two. Finally, we use the estimated elasticities for shopping and home production to calibrate an augmented lifecycle consumption model. The augmented model predicts the observed empirical patterns quite well. Taken together, our results highlight the danger of interpreting lifecycle expenditure without acknowledging the changing demands on time and the <b>available</b> <b>margins</b> of substituting time for money. ...|$|R

The antenna control is exerted by applying a particular strategy based on the knowledge of the distribution of the weather conditions all over the served region as derived by standard sources like the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) or the Meteosat. The paper describes the principles of two types of optimizations: a fixed one based on climatological data, which acts as reference, and an adaptive one based on quasi instantaneous pictures that represent the weather situation across the served region. After an explanation of the basic principles of the optimizations, the paper gives an example of application that, despite the brevity of the trial period we are now able to present, indicates an excellent effectiveness of the system which, in the period observed, allows a reduction of the number of non-served users of the two orders of magnitude in the case of low-margin systems (say 2 to 3 dBs over free space) and a still conspicuous advantage (a reduction of a factor about 5) for greater <b>available</b> <b>margins</b> (say 6 to 7 dBs) ...|$|R
40|$|The Luminosity of the HERA lepton proton {{collider}} {{is limited in}} part by the bunch length of the protons of 20 cm. This limitation is expected to be removed by the installation of the new damper system which will control longitudinal coupled bunch instabilities of the proton beam [1] thereby avoiding the bunch lengthening by a factor of two. This opens new possibilities for increasing the luminosity in HERA since the beta functions at IP for both leptons and protons can be lowered by about 20 % without noticeable reduction of the corresponding luminosity by the so called hourglass effect [2]. While the beta function of the proton ring could be reduced {{with the help of the}} quadrupoles in the low beta section only, the reduction of the beta function of the lepton ring up to this value of 20 % cannot be done by the same means without significant loss of dynamic aperture. A more intricated use of the beam-beam focussing (dynamic beta) is required in order to achieve the desired beam spot size at the IP’s. The price to pay here is an additional beam-beam beta beat as well as a distortion of the non-linear chromaticity compensation, which may lead to enhanced synchro-betatron resonances. This paper represents an overview about <b>available</b> <b>margins</b> and given constraints for more luminosity gain in HERA under the new conditions...|$|R

40|$|A {{tendency}} {{seen for}} quite some time in the Swedish railway network is a growing demand for capacity which no longer can be accommodated. This causes congestion and delays, and the relationships between the trains and how they affect eachother are significantly harder to overview and analyse. Railway traffic timetables normally contain margins to make them robust, and enable trains to recover from certain delays. How effective these margins are, depends on their size and location as well as the frequency and magnitude of the disturbances that occur. Hence, it is important to include marigns so, that they can be used operationally to recover from a variety of disturbances and not restricted to a specific part of the line and/or the timetable. In a case study we compare the performance of a selection of passenger train services to the different prerequisites given by the timetable (e. g. <b>available</b> <b>margins</b> and their location, critical train dependencies). The study focuses on the Swedish Southern mainline between Stockholm and Malmö on which a wide variety of train services operate, e. g. freight trains, local and regional commuter train services as well as long-distance trains with different speed profiles. The analysis shows a clear mismatch between where margins are placed and where delays occur. We also believe that the most widely used performance measure, which is related to the delay when arriving at the final destination, might give rise to an unnecessarily high delay rate at intermediate stations...|$|R

A case study on the IEEE 14 -bus test system is carried out to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed method. Numerical results obtained from the simulation study justify the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed scheme to handle the uncertainties...|$|R
