5|$|Although {{the role}} of the camel is {{diminishing}} with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 2nd century BC, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world. Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{depiction}} of an occult ritual, a violent death, a near-nude woman and strongly implied sexual torture, Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was uncontroversial {{on its first}} exhibition in 1833 and was critically well received. Sold by Etty to a private collector in 1833, it passed through the hands of several more before entering {{the collection of the}} Lady Lever Art Gallery. In 1958 it was acquired by the Tate Gallery, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> in the collection of Tate Britain.|$|E

It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|Hubble's law has two {{possible}} explanations. Either {{we are at}} the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the Copernican principle—or the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.|$|E

The storm struck just weeks after Hurricane Andrew, the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone ever at the time, struck Florida.|$|E

The design was advanced for its day <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> basically unchanged today except for re-glazing.

5|$|Monterey Bay Aquarium is {{a nonprofit}} public {{aquarium}} in Monterey, California.

The aquarium's seafood consumer awareness program has had an influential role among consumers and businesses in enhancing sustainable fishing practices.|$|E
5|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively-cycled carbon {{in the world}} and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> there for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E

5|$|The Central Pacific Hurricane Center retired {{the name}} Iwa {{subsequent}} to the storm {{and replaced it with}} Io. However, in 2007 the CPHC revised the four rotating lists of tropical cyclone names and replaced the name Io with Iona before it could be used. Iwa was the first retired hurricane in the Central Pacific since the modern system of using Hawaiian naming began in the early 1980s, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> one of only four to be retired as of 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Lahaut {{assassination}} was not solved, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> contentious as {{the only}} political murder in Belgian history apart from {{the death of the}} socialist politician André Cools in 1991. Leopoldists were suspected, but no individual was prosecuted in the aftermath. An enquiry by historians Rudy Van Doorslaer and Etienne Verhoeyen named an alleged culprit. A final report, commissioned by the Belgian government, was submitted in 2015.|$|E

Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
