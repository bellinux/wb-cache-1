Players and coaches ran onto the field after the final whistle, {{jumped up and down}} together <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> to a corner of the field to acknowledge the Sounders FC fans cheering in the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E

5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with full {{membership}} in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent {{on a tour of}} the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.|$|E

5|$|As Scott's men {{reached an}} open prairie near the Wea {{settlement}} of Ouiatenon on June 1, they were discovered by an enemy scout <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> {{to attack the}} villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, they found the residents hurriedly fleeing across the Wabash River in canoes. Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village {{on the other side}} of the river, they were able to escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was too wide to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other to find a place to ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning to Scott. The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across Eel Creek, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned to Scott. In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of Detroit.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} the first time Cardiff City appeared at Wembley Stadium, reaching their first ever FA Cup final, losing 1–0 to Sheffield United following a goal from England international Fred Tunstall. Although the 1926–27 season was Cardiff's worst performance in the top tier of English Football since they had won promotion six seasons prior, finishing in 14th position, they reached their second FA Cup final in the space of two years. On St George's Day, 23 April 1927, at Wembley Stadium in London, Cardiff became the only non-English side to win the FA Cup by defeating Arsenal 1–0 in the final, Hughie Ferguson scoring the only goal of the game. In the 74th minute, he received the ball from Ernie Curtis <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> a tame shot toward the Arsenal goal. Dan Lewis, the Arsenal goalkeeper, appeared to collect the ball but, under pressure from the advancing Len Davies, clumsily allowed the ball to roll through his grasp. In a further attempt to retrieve the ball Lewis only succeeded in knocking the ball with his elbow into his own net. Captain Fred Keenor received the FA Cup trophy {{at the end of the}} match from King George V only seven years after Cardiff City had entered the Football League.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} of having two {{is that it}} allows preparation for an emergency.

Such an emergency could include the submersible becoming tangled in fishing nets or entrapped in rocks or debris on the ocean floor. In such cases, the second heads to the rescue. There are also research experiments where it is advantageous to use the two vessels together.|$|E
25|$|Despite an 11th {{fatality}} from {{a training}} crash in Wyoming on March 17, the Army resumed the program again on March 19, 1934, in better weather, using only nine routes, limited schedules, <b>and</b> <b>hurried</b> improvements in instrument flying. The O-38E, {{which had been}} involved in two fatal accidents at Cheyenne, Wyoming, was withdrawn completely from the operation despite its enclosed cockpit because of its propensity to go into an unrecoverable spin in the mountainous terrain. In early April the Air Corps removed all pilots with less than two years' experience from the operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{morning of}} June 24, the Roman troops marched eastward {{along the road}} running near the {{northern}} edge of the lake.

Once all the Romans had at last marched through the foggy, narrow defile and entered the plains skirting the lake, trumpets were blown, signalling the general attack.|$|E
