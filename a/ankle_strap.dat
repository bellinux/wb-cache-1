2500|$|Around 1860, the Frye Company {{produced}} a popular line of harness boots. Quickly {{adopted by the}} United States Cavalry, they featured an <b>ankle</b> <b>strap</b> style that revolved around metal rings which may have served as inspiration {{for the design of}} the engineer boot. During the 1930s, Chippewa Shoe Manufacturing Company developed a pair of boots with stovepipe legs and fashioned over their [...] "English Riding Boot" [...] lasts. The West Coast Shoe Company (Wesco) began manufacturing their [...] "engineer boots" [...] in 1939. Engineer boots were originally meant as protective gear for firemen working on steam railway engines (i.e. [...] "engineers"), as their minimal stitching and pull-on design made them ideal for working in conditions with hot coals, embers, and sharp edges. This is a probable source of the name. Wesco's boots were immediately popular with welders in Portland, Oregon-area shipyards, who needed looser fitting shoes that they could quickly remove in the event embers landed in the shafts. On the overall basis, engineer boots were subverted in the shoe market during World War II by the production of lace-up combat boots and demand for them dramatically decreased.|$|E

25|$|Fish-skin boots (amirak ~ amiraq sg amiriik dual in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) are {{waterproof}} skin boot made of fish skin. In {{the past}} fish-skin boots {{were made with}} depilated soles of bearded seal, <b>ankle</b> <b>straps,</b> and a casing sewb to the upper edge of the leg. Large salmon skins were prepared for boots by sewing up the fin holes. A round needle was used because a triangular needle would split the skin.|$|R
50|$|The Hare {{traction}} splint is {{a further}} adaptation of the Thomas splint. Its length is adjustable via telescoping rods, and it has built-in straps to support the hip and leg at several points along its length. It also provides a more comfortable <b>ankle</b> <b>strap</b> and a small winch that makes {{it much easier to}} apply and adjust traction force.|$|E
50|$|A court shoe (British English), or pump (American English), is a shoe with a low-cut front, the vamp, {{and without}} a fastening. They are usually worn by women, but are still {{traditional}} menswear in some formal situations, where the style is sometimes called an opera slipper or patent pump. Pumps with a strap across the instep are called Mary Janes. Pumps may have an <b>ankle</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|E
50|$|The hanging perch is a {{variation}} on the perch where the pole is hung from an aerial mount point, and a pair of fliers perform tricks and stunts from the pole. Usually this includes the base being supported by an <b>ankle</b> <b>strap</b> on the pole. This allows him or her to stand out on the pole and hold a flyer while he/she performs various acrobatic maneuvers.|$|E

50|$|The Thomas half-ring splints {{consist of}} a padded half-circle of steel which is {{strapped}} to the hip, hinged to a U-shaped rod that extends along {{both sides of the}} leg. An <b>ankle</b> <b>strap</b> may be fashioned from cloth, and tied or twisted to apply traction force. It was devised by H.O. Thomas, initially for immobilization for tuberculosis of the knee. It is now commonly used for the immobilization of hip and thigh injuries.|$|E
5000|$|One boot {{designed}} {{to use the}} GSB system was the (now discontinued) Scarpa Mirage GTX, a Gore-Tex lined 3-4 season mountaineering boot. A recess {{was created in the}} front of the sole unit which could accept a specially designed peg on the Grivel AirTech GSB [...] crampon. This crampon did away with the plastic toe covering commonly found on C1 and C2 crampons, and the strap connecting it. This left users with only an <b>ankle</b> <b>strap</b> to do up, with the aim being to make the crampon lighter and easier to put on the boot.|$|E
5000|$|The lack {{of support}} {{provided}} by thong sandals is thought {{by some to be}} a major cause of injuries. Some flip-flops have a spongy sole, causing the foot to roll further inward than normal when it hits the ground [...] - [...] an action called over-pronation, which is responsible for many foot problems [...] Overpronation may also lead to flat feet [...] Flip-flops can cause a person to overuse the tendons in their feet, resulting in tendonitis. The lack of an <b>ankle</b> <b>strap</b> that holds the foot in place is also a common reason for injury, as this causes wearers to scrunch their toes {{in an effort to keep}} the flip-flop in place, which can result in tendonitis.|$|E
50|$|The magician {{presents}} a rectangular table just {{big enough to}} accommodate a person lying upon it. An assistant is introduced and several assistants are recruited from the audience. The magician {{presents a}} set of restraints consisting of a sturdy collar {{and a pair of}} <b>ankle</b> <b>straps,</b> each attached to a length of chain or rope. The assistant sits on the table with her legs stretched out and volunteers are invited to fasten the restraints around her neck and ankles.|$|R
2500|$|Despite the loss, Haye {{was widely}} praised for his {{performance}} in fighting on whilst severely injured. As Kevin Mitchell of the Guardian newspaper summed up of the fight: Haye, staggering around the ring like a Saturday night drunk, went down swinging, his right <b>ankle</b> <b>strapped</b> in the ninth then unstrapped, his aged body sagging under every assault.....Even when thrashed through the ropes at the end, Haye clambered back and was willing to continue.... It will not seem so {{to him as he}} contemplates the fading of his days, but this was Haye's finest night." ...|$|R
50|$|On 1 March 2008, it was {{confirmed}} {{that she had}} chipped a bone in her ankle during training and there were doubts as to whether {{she would be able to}} continue in the competition. Having previously received a gash to the head and a broken rib, this did not deter her, and she vowed to carry on for her dance partner and the people who had voted for her. On 2 March, she skated with her <b>ankle</b> <b>strapped</b> and finished second from bottom on the leader board with a total of 24; however, the public saved her from the skate-off.|$|R
5000|$|Thatcher added a nylon <b>ankle</b> <b>strap</b> to a {{traditional}} thong-style sandal, thus creating the first sports sandal. Thatcher patented his invention and {{signed an agreement with}} the shoemaker California Pacific to manufacture the shoes, while he marketed the [...] "amphibious utility sandals" [...] as their salesman, selling 200 pairs the first year. Although it was effective water sports footwear, it proved less effective for regular sports, as the first Teva users often complained of blisters {{between the first and second}} toes caused by the thong-style strapping system. However, in 1984 a sudden high demand of Teva sandals arose as young Americans found the sandal fashionable. California Pacific then claimed rights over the Teva name and patent, stating that Thatcher was merely an employee of their company. Thatcher sued California Pacific and won his case the following year, severing links with California Pacific. He then started the Tevas company in Flagstaff, Arizona.|$|E

50|$|On December 23, 1994, Foo {{died in a}} surfing {{accident}} at Mavericks, a big wave surf location in Half Moon Bay, Northern California. Surfer magazine wrote that Foo was sleep deprived after arriving in California on an overnight flight for the swell. During take-off on a wave estimated at 18-20 feet (Hawaiian scale), Foo experienced a seemingly innocuous wipeout which resulted in his drowning. The fateful wipeout was photographed from at least two angles, and shows him falling forward {{near the bottom of}} the wave. The most popular presumption is that Foo's surf leash had become entangled on the rocks, with the rushing currents of a second wave passing overhead preventing him disengaging his <b>ankle</b> <b>strap</b> and getting to the surface. This theory was further validated when professional surfer Mike Parsons, who wiped out on the following wave, said that he came into contact with something, possibly Foo, as he was tumbled around underwater. His body was discovered still tied to the broken tail section of his board, inside Pillar Point lagoon, over two hours later. Foo's death shook the big wave surfing community. On December 30, over 700 people arrived at Waimea Bay in Hawaii for his funeral. Approximately 150 surfers paddled into the Bay and formed a large circle. One of the participants, who was carrying a container with Foo's ashes, paddled into the center of the circle and placed the ashes into the ocean. A segment of the film Riding Giants documented Foo's death at Mavericks.|$|E
50|$|Pumps come in {{a variety}} of colors and styles. They can have a rounded or pointed toe, and are usually made of leather. They have a heel of at least 5 cm (2 inches). Today, pumps have evolved beyond the classic working woman's shoe. Now, there are peep toe pumps, which have a small opening at the toes. There are also pumps with <b>ankle</b> <b>straps.</b> Not only have the styles evolved, the fabrics have as well. While almost all pumps used to be made of leather, pumps now {{come in a}} variety of materials, such as suede and wool.|$|R

I was <b>strapped</b> at the <b>ankles,</b> <b>strapped</b> at the knees, and strapped again at the wrists.

40|$|While {{considerable}} {{data indicate}} that positioning retroreflective markings on a pedestrian’s extremities can dramatically enhance nighttime conspicuity, most relevant safety devices (vests) limit coverage to the torso. We asked 120 participants to press a button whenever they recognized that a pedestrian was present during a short drive at night. A test pedestrian wearing different configurations of retroreflective markings was positioned on the left shoulder of an unilluminated two-lane roadway. Compared to an ANSI class-II vest alone, response distances were significantly greater when the vest was supplemented with ankle markings and when a full biological motion configuration was worn. Conspicuity was also greater when the pedestrian was walking and when facing the approaching test vehicle. Relative to a full eleven-element biological motion configuration, adding just two retroreflective <b>ankle</b> <b>straps</b> to a conventional safety vest is considerably more practical while still providing substantial conspicuity benefits...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to wrist <b>straps,</b> <b>ankle</b> and heel <b>straps</b> {{are used in}} industry to bleed away accumulated charge from a body. These devices are usually not tethered to earth ground, but instead incorporate high resistance in their construction, and work by dissipating electrical charge to special floor tiles. Such straps are used when workers need to be mobile in a work area and a grounding cable would get in the way. They are used particularly in an operating theatre, where oxygen or explosive anesthetic gases are used.|$|R
