40|$|Semen of most {{mammalian}} {{species can}} be sexed with greater than 90 % accuracy with an instrument called a flow cytometer/cell sorter. Unfortunately, {{the process is}} slow relative {{to the number of}} sperm in a typical <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>dose.</b> Furthermore, the process damages sperm, although to a lesser degree than current procedures for cryopreservation. Because of these limitations, commercially available sexed semen for artificial insemination has lower sperm numbers per dose (about 2 million sperm) than are used conventionally (usually> 10 million sperm/dose). Thus far, {{there is no evidence that}} these sexing procedures result in abnormal offspring (Tubman et al., 2004). The main problem with this technology is that pregnancy rates are about 10 percentage points lower than with unsexed semen. Nevertheless, sexed semen is commercially available for many bulls. Most applications will be limited to artificial insemination of heifers, which have higher fertility with fewer sperm than cows, and use of sexed semen with dairy heifers has become widespread. Here, I will summarize potential applications of sexed semen in dairy cattle, assuming that accuracy of sexing semen is greater than 90 %, that fertility is about 80 % of fertility of unsexe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the project}} was to use current simple and {{practical}} laboratory tests and compare results with the foaling rates of mares inseminated with commercially produced frozen semen. In Exp. 1, semen was tested from 27 and in Exp. 2 from 23 stallions; 19 stallions participated in both experiments. The mean number of mares per stallion in both experiments was 37 (min. 7, max. 121). Sperm morphology was assessed and bacterial culture performed once per stallion. In Exp. 1, progressive motility after 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h of incubation using light microscopy, motility characteristics measured with an automatic sperm analyzer, plasma membrane integrity using carboxyfluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide (CFDA/PI) staining and light microscopy, plasma membrane integrity using PI staining and a fluorometer, plasma membrane integrity using a resazurin reduction test, and sperm concentration were evaluated. In Exp. 2, the same tests as in Exp. 1 and a hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) using both light microscopy and a fluorometer were performed immediately after thawing and after a 3 -h incubation. Statistical analysis was done separately to all stallions and to those having ≥ 20 mares; in addition, stallions with foaling rates 20 mares, the <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>dose</b> showed a correlation coefficient of - 0. 58 (p < 0. 05). In Exp. 2, the HOST immediately after thawing showed a negative correlation with foaling rate (p < 0. 05). No single test was consistently reliable for predicting the fertilizing capacity of semen, since the 2 experiments yielded conflicting results, although the same stallions sometimes participated in both. This shows the difficulty of frozen semen quality control in commercially produced stallion semen, and on the other hand, the difficulty of conducting fertility trials in horses. </p...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} equine semen, {{it could be useful}} to split the <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>dose</b> and refreeze the redundant spermatozoa. In experiment I, semen of 10 sires of the Hanoverian breed, with poor and good semen freezability, was collected by artificial vagina, centrifuged, extended in INRA 82 at 400 × 106 sperm/mL, and automatically frozen. After this first routinely applied freezing program, semen from each stallion was thawed, resuspended in INRA 82 at 40 × 106 sperm/mL, filled in 0. 5 -mL straws, and refrozen. These steps were repeated, and sperm concentration was adjusted to 20 × 106 sperm/mL after a third freezing cycle. Regardless of stallion freezability group, sperm motility and sperm membrane integrity (FITC/PNA-Syto-PI-stain) decreased stepwise after first, second, and third freezing (62. 3 % ± 9. 35, 24. 0 % ± 15. 4, 3. 3 % ± 4. 34, P ≤. 05; 29. 6 % ± 8. 64, 14. 9 % ± 6. 38, 8. 3 % ± 3. 24, P ≤. 05), whereas the percentage of acrosome-reacted cells increased (19. 5 % ± 7. 59, 23. 9 % ± 8. 51, 29. 2 % ± 6. 58, P ≤. 05). Sperm chromatin integrity was unaffected after multiple freeze/thaw cycles (DFI value: 18. 6 % ± 6. 6, 17. 2 % ± 6. 84, 17. 1 % ± 7. 21, P >. 05). In experiment II estrous, Hanoverian warmblood mares were inseminated with a total of 200 × 106 spermatozoa of two stallions with either good or poor semen freezability originating from the first, second, and third freeze/thaw cycle. First-cycle pregnancy rates were 4 / 10, 40 %; 1 / 10, 10 %; and 0 / 10, 0 %. In conclusion, as expected, sperm viability of stallion spermatozoa significantly decreases as a consequence of multiple freezing. However, sperm chromatin integrity was not affected.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} boars´ ejaculate during 12 months. Five boars were located in each <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> farm with air-conditioned (G 1) and non- air-conditioned (G 2) environment, and submitted to ejaculate examination every two weeks. Scores for sperm progressive motility, concentration and morphology (MOT, CONC and MORPH, respectively) were established. These scores were summed up to compound the breeding soundness examination index (BSE) for pigs with amplitude ranging from 100 to 1 and four classes (A-E). There were differences in several seminal characteristics during the year within and between the farms in periods of higher temperature and temperature and humidity index. There were differences between the farms for MOT (13. 1 ± 4. 0 vs. 12. 0 ± 3. 6), MORPH (35. 5 ± 11. 4 vs. 27. 6 ± 11. 6), CONC (21. 6 ± 16. 8 vs. 13. 4 ± 10. 6) and BSE (70. 2 ± 21. 5 vs. 53. 0 ± 18. 8), and the BSE class frequencies A= 17. 92 % vs. 0. 83 %, B= 13. 75 % vs. 21. 25 %, C= 16. 67 % vs. 21. 67 %, D= 1. 25 % vs. 4. 17 % and E= 0. 42 % vs. 2. 08 % for G 1 and G 2 respectively.

40|$|AbstractTo make {{timing of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) {{relative}} to ovulation less critical, methods for prolonging shelf life of spermatozoa in vivo after AI have been attempted to be developed. Encapsulation of sperm cells is a documented technology, and recently, a technology in which sperm cells {{are embedded in}} alginate gel has been introduced and commercialized. In this study, standard processed semen with the Biladyl extender (control) was compared with semen processed by sperm immobilization technology developed by SpermVital AS in a blind field trial. Moreover, in vitro acrosome and plasma membrane integrity was assessed and compared with AI fertility data for possible correlation. Semen from 16 Norwegian Red young bulls with unknown fertility was collected and processed after splitting the semen in two aliquots. These aliquots were processed with the standard Biladyl extender or the SpermVital extender to a final number of 12  ×  106 and 25  ×  106 spermatozoa/dose, respectively. In total, 2000 semen doses were produced from each bull, divided equally by treatment. <b>Artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> <b>doses</b> were set up to design a blinded AI regime; 5  +  5 straws from each extender within ejaculates in ten-straw goblets were distributed to AI technicians and veterinarians all over Norway. Outcomes of the inseminations were measured as 56 -day nonreturn rate (NRR). Postthaw sperm quality was assessed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide and Alexa 488 –conjugated peanut agglutinin to assess the proportion of plasma membrane and acrosome-intact sperm cells, respectively. In total, data from 14, 125 first inseminations performed over a 12 -month period, 7081 with Biladyl and 7044 with SpermVital semen, {{were used in the}} statistical analyses. There {{was no significant difference in}} 56 -day NRR for the two semen categories, overall NRR being 72. 5 % and 72. 7 % for Biladyl and SpermVital, respectively. The flow cytometric results revealed a significant higher level of acrosome-intact live spermatozoa in Biladyl-processed semen compared to SpermVital semen. The results indicate that the level of acrosome-intact live spermatozoa in the AI dose did not affect the 56 -day NRR for the two semen processing methods. In conclusion, this study has showed that immobilized spermatozoa provide equal fertility results as standard processed semen when AI is performed in a blinded field trial, although the immobilization procedure caused increased sperm damage evaluated in vitro compared to standard semen processing procedure...|$|R

40|$|Exploring the {{genetics}} of {{the efficiency of}} fertile AI dose production in rabbits The general aim of this thesis has been to analyse sources of variation {{for some of the}} most important components of fertile <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> (AI) <b>dose</b> production in order to explore the interest and limitations of different strategies for their genetic improvement in a paternal line of rabbits selected for growth rate. These components refer to seminal production and quality traits, being considered the male reproductive performance (fertility and prolificacy) as the final expression of the effect of the seminal characteristics and the effect of the interaction among them and with the female. Genetic analyses of the seminal traits involved in AI dose production and growth rate were modelled using threshold and linear multiple-trait mixed models. Relationship between fertility and pH of the semen was analysed either using mixed or recursive mixed models. Male and female genetic contributions to fertility were estimated using additive or product threshold models and both models were compared by its ability of predicting fertility data. Existence of genotype x <b>artificial</b> <b>insemination</b> conditions for male effect on fertility and prolificacy was estimated under a Character state model. Finally, the product threshold model was used for estimating separately the effect of the environmental temperature on male and on female contributions to fertility. All inferences of this thesis have been done under a Bayesian approach. Male libido and variables related to the quality of the ejaculate such as presence of urine and calcium carbonates in the ejaculate, individual sperm motility, semen pH and suitability for AI of the ejaculate (which involves the subjective combination of several semen quality traits) were found to be lowly heritable, but repeatable.

Aliquots of diluted semen were assessed for live morphologically normal spermatozoa (LMNS, eosin-nigrosin stain exclusion assay) and sperm chromatin instability (SCI, acridine orange assay). Farrowing rates according to different boar sperm varied (p < 0. 001) from 59. 3 to 88. 92 %. The mean values of LMNS (47. 2 ~ 76. 5 %) and SCI (0. 16 ~ 4. 67 %) differed significantly among boars. LMNS (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 05) and SCI (r = - 0. 90, p < 0. 02) accounted for 62. 2 and 81. 7 % of the variability in farrowing rates, respectively.

40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>Insemination</b> (AI) is {{the single}} most {{important}} tool in facilitating the genetic improvement of dairy cows. Both frozen and liquid semen are used in AI, however the majority (~ 95 %) of <b>insemination</b> <b>doses</b> worldwide (and in Ireland) employ use of frozen semen (Vishwanath & Shannon, 2000). Only 5 % of <b>insemination</b> <b>doses</b> used in Ireland are liquid semen, however, during peak breeding season of April and May, this number could rise to 25 %. Use of frozen semen in AI has the benefit of long term storage as it causes the biochemical and developmental changes in sperm to stop, however, after the freeze thaw process, more than 50 % of sperm cells are damaged (Vishwanath & Shannon, 2000), meaning a higher concentration of sperm cells per dose is required and therefore, less <b>insemination</b> <b>doses</b> per ejaculate are achieved. The use of stored fresh semen would remove this problem of damaged sperm cells after a freeze thaw process. Liquid semen would also allow a lower concentration of sperm cells per <b>insemination</b> <b>dose,</b> thereby, maximising the use of semen from high genetic merit bulls. It has been reported that although liquid bull semen maintains motility for up to 4 weeks post collection, in vivo fertility declines significantly after 4 - 5 days post collection (Vishwanath & Shannon, 1997). The reason for this sudden drop in fertility remains to be elucidated; however, it could be attributed to a number of factors, such as changes in the lipid profile and a subsequent loss in cell membrane fluidity, perhaps due to attack from reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of long chain fatty acids to bull sperm in vitro may have a stabilising effect on the sperm membrane, through fatty acids constituents being incorporated into the sperm cell membrane, as reported in a study by Neill & Masters (1971) or by inhibiting or reducing the lipid peroxidation (LPO) of the sperm membrane, which is high in polyunsaturated fatty acids...|$|R
