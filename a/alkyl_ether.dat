50|$|Niosome {{preparation}} using polyoxyethylene alkyl etherThe {{size and}} number of bilayer of vesicles consisting of polyoxyethylene <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> and cholesterol can be changed using an alternative method.25 Temperature rise above 60 °C transforms small unilamellar vesicles to large multilamellar vesicles (>1 μm), while vigorous shaking at room temperature shows the opposite effect, i.e., transformation of multilamellar vesicles into unilamellar ones. The transformation from unilamellar to multilamellar vesicles at higher temperature might be the characteristic for polyoxyethylene <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> (ester) surfactant, since {{it is known that}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) and water remix at higher temperature due to breakdown of hydrogen bonds between water and PEG moieties. Generally, free drug is removed from the encapsulated drug by gel permeation chromatography dialysis method or centrifugation method. Often, density differences between niosomes and the external phase are smaller than that of liposomes, which make separation by centrifugation very difficult. Addition of protamine to the vesicle suspension facilitates separation during centrifugation.|$|E

50|$|Zanamivir analogues are {{designed}} to improve the therapeutic use. Replacing the carboxylate group at the C1 to phosphonate group led the drug to be more potent with high affinity to form ionic interaction with the active site. Additionally, the click-chemistry reaction was used to synthesize the C4-triazole-modified zanamivir analogue that shows inhibitory activity close to zanamivir. Laninamivir is designed by replacing C7 hydroxy moiety with small lipophilic group, -OCH3, which resulted in an excellent inhibitory activity. The C8 and C9 diol {{play an important role}} in the binding affinity with neuraminidase, prolonging the effect. The polymer scaffolds at the C7 position of zanamivir via an <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> has gained more attention as this showed enhanced antiviral activity.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> fuel oxygenates {{in drinking water}} supplies has raised public health concerns because of possible adverse health effects from chronic exposure to these compounds. To enable large exposure studies exploring possible relationships between chronic exposure to <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> fuel oxygenates and health effects, we developed an improved analytical method, using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. This method quantifies trace levels of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, ethyl tertiary-butyl ether, di-isopropyl ether, and tertiary-amyl methyl ether in tap water. The method achieves detection limits of less than 0. 025 µg/L for all analytes and linear ranges of three orders of magnitude in the measurement of the <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> fuel oxygenates in 5 -mL tap water samples. The relative percentage of recoveries of the <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> fuel oxygenates ranged from 97 % to 105 %. The relative standard deviation ranged from 2 % to 6 %. Methyl tertiary-butyl ether was detected in samples of tap water taken from geographically diverse regions of the United States.

40|$|The alkoxylation of -pinene, -pinene and {{limonene}} with Cl-C 4 alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol and 1 -buthanol) to -terpinyl <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> {{was carried}} out in the presence of silica-occluded tungstophosphoric acid (PW@S) in liquid phase. Different linear and branched alcohols (C 1 to C 4 alcohols) are compared in relation to their activity for the heterogeneously catalysed alkoxylation of alpha-pinene. The PW@S material was an efficient, environmentally friendly heterogeneous catalyst for the liquid-phase alkoxylation of -pinene, -pinene and limonene into their more valuable ethers (-terpinyl <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether),</b> which are used as in perfume and cosmetic products, as in the pharmaceutical industry, {{as well as in the}} food industry for organic synthesis. The catalytic activity decreased with the increase of chain length of the linear alcohols, in the alkoxylation of -pinene, -pinene and limonene, which can be explained due to the presence of sterical hindrance and diffusion limitations inside the porous system of PW@S. The reactivity of the terpenes increases as follows: limonene <-pinene < -pinene. This behaviour can be explained due to the limonene to be a higher stability than the -pinene and -pinene. The pinenes have the angle strain of cyclobutane ring that make them more reactive than limonene. A decrease of the PW@S selectivity to the -terpinyl <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> with the increase of chain length of the alcohols was observed. The catalyst (PW@S) can be easily recovered and reused...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDe novo {{lipogenesis}} in adipocytes, {{especially with}} high fat feeding, is poorly understood. We demonstrate that an adipocyte lipogenic pathway encompassing fatty acid synthase (FAS) and PexRAP (peroxisomal reductase activating PPARγ) modulates endogenous PPARγ activation and adiposity. Mice lacking FAS in adult adipose tissue manifested increased energy expenditure, increased brown fat-like adipocytes in subcutaneous adipose tissue, {{and resistance to}} diet-induced obesity. FAS knockdown in embryonic fibroblasts decreased PPARγ transcriptional activity and adipogenesis. FAS-dependent <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> phosphatidylcholine species were associated with PPARγ and treatment of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells with one such ether lipid increased PPARγ transcriptional activity. PexRAP, a protein required for <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> lipid synthesis, was associated with peroxisomes and induced during adipogenesis. PexRAP knockdown in cells decreased PPARγ transcriptional activity and adipogenesis. PexRAP knockdown in mice decreased expression of PPARγ-dependent genes and reduced diet-induced adiposity.

To {{investigate the}} usefulness {{of this type of}} nonionic surfactant as an emulsifier in cosmetics, the emulsifying properties were compared with poly(ox-yethylene) (x) <b>alkyl</b> <b>ether</b> (R,EOx). The HLB-values (hydrophilic lipophilic balance) of R,TxGy ranged from 7 to 30. It is notable {{that this is the first}} ultrahydrophilic nonionic surfactant hat possesses xcellent emulsifying ability. By using phase diagrams, the reasons why the HLB-values of R•TxGy exceeded 20 were discussed. A lameliar liquid crystalline phase and O/W emulsions are formed by the addition of water to a W/O microemulsion n the R•T•Gy system, whereas W/O emulsion was formed by the addition of water to the W/O microemulsion i the R•EOx system. This difference in solution behavior is why R. T•Gy provides a higher HLB-value and finer O/W emulsions. The dermal and eye irritation levels of R•T•Gy are lower than those of R•EO•. We conclude that RnT•Gy is useful as an emulsifier for cosmetics...|$|E

The effects of ethylene glycol <b>alkyl</b> <b>ethers</b> on testis and embryotoxic effects of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGM) have been studied, as has the teratogenicity of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (EGdM). Studies on ethylene glycol <b>alkyl</b> <b>ethers</b> and related compounds administered to mice by oral gavage revealed the occurrence of testicular atrophy and decreased white blood cell count by EGM, EGdM, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, and the toxicity was related to their chemical structure.

40|$|The aerobic and {{electrochemical}} oxidations of diphenylacetaldehyde (1) were investigated.
