5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were {{a little better than}} at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was able to pass along further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he took <b>along</b> <b>when</b> he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E
5|$|The spy {{followed}} the court mystic to Mount Tai, where he performed a ritual with his followers, {{although no one}} saw any immortals. Luan Da ordered his followers to stay behind while he went ahead to meet the immortals, telling them that the spiritual beings would not descend to meet with lowly servants. The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but only saw the mystic walk along the beach. Luan Da returned to his group and {{reported that he had}} seen his immortal master and that they were to report back to the emperor. Angered by Luan Da's deceit, the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu. The emperor, incensed at Luan Da's confidence tricks, decided to play <b>along</b> <b>when</b> the mystic returned to see what lies he would tell.|$|E
5|$|Communications {{between the}} brigade and {{battalion}} headquarters and the forward company positions broke down {{at this stage}} and runners had to be despatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and {{had run out of}} water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter, but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of Matilda tanks under Major Kenneth Arnott from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and {{over the course of the}} day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks <b>along</b> <b>when</b> they were unable move under their own power.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} he {{abandoned}} it early on is not entirely correct since it was far <b>along</b> <b>when</b> he received two invitations (from Rome and from Paris) in September 1340 each asking him to accept the crown as poet laureate.

25|$|Nutt {{knew that}} Thumb {{was in love}} with Lavinia. He was jealous. He had a fight with Thumb in a {{dressing}} room at the Museum. He threw him on the floor, and beat him up.

25|$|For {{reactions}} involving oxygen, {{the gain}} of oxygen implies the oxidation {{of the atom}} or molecule to which the oxygen is added (and the oxygen is reduced). In organic compounds, such as butane or ethanol, the loss of hydrogen implies oxidation of the molecule from which it is lost (and the hydrogen is reduced). This follows because the hydrogen donates its electron in covalent bonds with non-metals but it takes the electron <b>along</b> <b>when</b> it is lost. Conversely, loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen implies reduction.|$|E

25|$|Boa constrictors are ambush predators, {{so often}} lie {{in wait for}} an {{appropriate}} prey to come <b>along,</b> <b>when</b> they attack. However, they have also been known to actively hunt, particularly in regions with a low concentration of suitable prey, and this behaviour generally occurs at night. The boa first strikes at the prey, grabbing it with its teeth; it then proceeds to constrict the prey until death before consuming it whole. Unconsciousness and death likely result from shutting off vital {{blood flow to the}} heart and brain, rather than suffocation as was previously believed; constriction can interfere with blood flow and overwhelm the prey's usual blood pressure and circulation. This would lead to unconsciousness and death very quickly. Their teeth also help force the animal down the throat while muscles then move it toward the stomach. It takes the snake about 4–6 days to fully digest the food, {{depending on the size of}} the prey and the local temperature. After this, the snake may not eat for a week to several months, due to its slow metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Many of the European comics {{based on}} the Disney Universe have created {{their own version of}} Scrooge McDuck, usually {{involving}} him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s-1980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero dragging his long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go <b>along</b> <b>when</b> his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or blunderbuss, or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings {{up at the end of}} the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb – something which Scrooge shows little concern for – he tends to end up with nothing.|$|E

There {{were a lot of}} tracks, though, where I played bass... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this'.

Desperate to attend the game, Homer accepts. Ned pays for all the food and even gets the winning quarterback to give the game ball to Homer. Overwhelmed by Ned's generosity and no longer ashamed {{to be associated with}} him, Homer becomes friends with Ned and his family. Homer begins acting overly grateful and annoys Ned and his family to no end by interrupting their family time together. The Flanders family and the Simpson family go on a camping trip, but the families do not get <b>along.</b> <b>When</b> the Simpsons initiate a food fight, Ned tells his wife that he has grown to hate Homer.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the war, Greeley {{played with}} ideas {{as to how}} to settle it. In 1862, Greeley had {{approached}} the French minister to Washington, Henri Mercier, to discuss a mediated settlement. [...] However, Seward rejected such talks and the prospect of European intervention receded after the bloody Union victory at Antietam in September 1862. In July 1864, Greeley received word that there were Confederate commissioners in Canada, empowered to offer peace. [...] In fact, the men were in Niagara Falls, Canada to aid Peace Democrats and otherwise undermine the Union war effort. but they played <b>along</b> <b>when</b> Greeley journeyed to Niagara Falls, at Lincoln's request: the president was willing to consider any deal that included reunion and emancipation. The Confederates had no credentials and were unwilling to accompany Greeley to Washington under safe conduct. [...] Greeley returned to New York, and the episode, when it became public, embarrassed the administration. Lincoln said nothing publicly concerning Greeley's credulous conduct, but privately indicated that he had no confidence in him anymore.|$|E

500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, {{because they have to}} go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all <b>along</b> <b>when</b> his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really sad thing is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere. People didn't get back to me for comments and the sad thing is that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|New York {{played a}} pivotal role in the Revolutionary War. The colony verged on revolt {{following}} the Stamp Act of 1765, advancing the New York City–based Sons of Liberty to the forefront of New York politics.

Even though New York City merchants lost out on lucrative military contracts, the group sought common ground between the King and the people; however, compromise became impossible as of April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord.
