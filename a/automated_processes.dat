5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such <b>automated</b> <b>processes</b> {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E

25|$|The {{high cost}} and hence small market for large format {{consoles}} led to pioneers such as <b>Automated</b> <b>Processes</b> Inc (API), {{to experiment with}} modular equipment design.

25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{transformation}} to more <b>automated</b> <b>processes.</b> The accounting systems {{were transferred to}} computers in 1970, followed by the paper machines in 1972 and 1973. These systems automatically measured the water content of the pulp at various stages and then adjusted the input factors as needed. PM1 was renovated and upgraded in a two-month period in 1975. This followed the standardization of newsprint to 48.8g/m2 as well as optimized the paper for offset printing. This and other refinements allowed {{the speed of the}} paper machine to increase to 900 meters per minute, up from 430 at start-up.|$|E

25|$|Once commingled recyclates are {{collected}} and delivered {{to a central}} collection facility, {{the different types of}} materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve <b>automated</b> <b>processes</b> such that a truckload of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as single-stream recycling. In plants, a variety of materials is sorted such as paper, different types of plastics, glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries. A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist.|$|E
25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper {{seat tube}} angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the chainstay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset welding jigs in <b>automated</b> <b>processes,</b> and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.|$|E
500|$|In December 2012, {{two billion}} views {{were removed from}} the view counts of Universal and Sony music videos on YouTube, {{prompting}} a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of <b>automated</b> <b>processes</b> to inflate view counts. This was disputed by Billboard, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube. On August 5, 2015, YouTube removed the feature which caused a video's view count to freeze at [...] "301" [...] (later [...] "301+") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.

40|$|Process mining allows {{analysts to}} exploit logs of {{historical}} executions of business processes to extract insights regarding the actual performance of these processes. One {{of the most}} widely studied process mining operations is <b>automated</b> <b>process</b> discovery. An <b>automated</b> <b>process</b> discovery method takes as input an event log, and produces as output a business process model that captures the control-flow relations between tasks that are observed in or implied by the event log. Various <b>automated</b> <b>process</b> discovery methods have been proposed in the past two decades, striking different tradeoffs between scalability, accuracy and complexity of the resulting models. However, these methods have been evaluated in an ad-hoc manner, employing different datasets, experimental setups, evaluation measures and baselines, often leading to incomparable conclusions and sometimes unreproducible results due to the use of closed datasets. This article provides a systematic review and comparative evaluation of <b>automated</b> <b>process</b> discovery methods, using an open-source benchmark covering twelve publicly-available real-life event logs and eight quality metrics. The results highlight gaps and unexplored tradeoffs in the field, including the lack of scalability of several methods and a strong divergence in their performance with respect to the different quality metrics used...|$|R
