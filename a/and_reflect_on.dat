5|$|In 1964 Chicago {{experienced}} {{two major}} race riots. Triggered by Civil Rights struggles and angst, more riots followed {{in subsequent years}} and the Black Power movement came into fruition. Artists began to explore ways to express black pride, self-determination and self-reliance leading in 1966 to the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC). Artist Norman Parish asked Jarrell to attend a meeting for OBAC's Artists' Workshop. The meetings would consist of artists bringing their work to be critiqued <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> ideas of the black experience in art, leading to the concept behind Wall of Respect. The mural consisted of African American heroes and personalities, each artist deciding who should be depicted in their section. Sylvia Abernathy designed the layout, giving Jarrell a 12 × 14 foot space to share with photographer Bill Abernathy. Jarrell focused on a favorite theme, rhythm and blues, and featured portrayals of James Brown, B.B. King, Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington. The Artists' Workshop would sour {{towards the end of}} the project: there were controversies stemming from the painting in Norman Parish's section, conflicts regarding copyrights being sold without permission, disagreements on law enforcement involvement, as well as deceit. Nevertheless the Wall was considered a success, triggering the creation of liberation themed murals in Chicago and beyond.|$|E

25|$|On March 11, 2006, the City of Cerritos {{dedicated}} a new {{sculpture garden}} featuring {{a memorial to}} the victims of the accident. The sculpture, designed by Kathleen Caricof, consists of three pieces. One piece, which resembles a wing, commemorates all the victims who perished aboard the Aeroméxico jet and the Piper. A similar, but smaller and darker wing, commemorates all the victims who perished on the ground. Each wing rests on a pedestal that lists the respective victims in alphabetical order. In front of the memorial lies a bench, which commemorates all victims and allows visitors to sit <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> the disaster.|$|E

He adds that the phoenix must have some relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes. Granger explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built, so that way people can take {{a long look at}} themselves <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> their lives.

25|$|After this {{rigorous}} recruit training, {{these new}} Marines will receive ten days of leave and possibly more {{if they are}} assisting their local Marine recruiter with recruiting. The leave {{is a time to}} rest up <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> what they have accomplished, as well as incorporate their newly found discipline into their civilian life. They are expected to conduct themselves during leave as a disciplined Marine would and maintain their physical and mental fitness. After the leave has expired, Marines will attend the School of Infantry (SOI); east coast graduates will attend SOI East at Camp Geiger; while west coast graduates will return to Camp Pendleton for SOI West. Non-infantry Marines will attend a course called Marine Combat Training for 29 days, then proceed to the appropriate school for their Military Occupational Specialty (which vary in length). Infantry Marines attend the Infantry Training Battalion for 59 days. Then these newly trained Marines are assigned to their first unit in the operating forces.|$|E
500|$|Locke's {{emphasis}} {{on the role of}} experience {{in the formation of the}} mind and his concern with false associations of ideas has led many to characterise his theory of mind as passive rather than active, but as Nicholas Jolley, in his introduction to Locke's philosophical theory, points out, this is [...] "one of the most curious misconceptions about Locke."

A guard of honour was provided by 56 officers wearing the uniforms of each of the UK's police forces. The Queen stated that [...] "It is surely appropriate that this should be positioned in The Mall - an area of London so often associated with our national way of life. When people pass by the memorial, I hope they will pause <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> the proud traditions that it represents. The courage and personal sacrifice recorded here will, I am certain, serve as an inspiration to us all." ...|$|E
500|$|Tornadas {{can serve}} {{a number of}} {{purposes}} within poems; they often contain useful information about the poem's composition—often {{able to identify the}} location and date of the poem's composition, and the identity of members of the troubadour's circle—and several tornadas serve as dedications to a friend or patron of the poet. An additional purpose of the tornada is to focus <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> the theme of the poem, commenting on the surrounding material within the poem, and to act as a concluding stanza for the poem. [...] However, the device can sometimes be used to create new narrative material. [...] For instance, in Marcabru's pastorela “L’autrier jost’una sebissa” (trans. [...] "The other day along a hedgerow"), the narrator is attracted to a shepherdess for her feisty wit and professes that [...] "country-men want country-women / in places where all wisdom's lacking." [...] The shepherdess' reply in the tornada: [...] "and some will gawk before a painting / while others wait to see real manna." [...] serves to [...] " [...] some tension with the enigma she seems to introduce suddenly at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

He presented the idea that they would meet up casually to chat <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> topics from their past which they were not allowed to touch on back then. The show starred H.O.T.'s Moon Hee-joon and Tony An, NRG's Chun Myung-hoon, Sechs Kies's Eun Ji-won, and g.o.d's Danny Ahn.

2500|$|In {{his essay}} [...] "Cézanne's Doubt", {{in which he}} {{identifies}} Paul Cézanne's impressionistic theory of painting as analogous to his own concept of radical reflection, the attempt to return to, <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on,</b> prereflective consciousness, Merleau-Ponty identifies science as the opposite of art. [...] In Merleau-Ponty's account, whereas art {{is an attempt to}} capture an individual's perception, science is anti-individualistic. [...] In the preface to his Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty presents a phenomenological objection to positivism: that it can tell us nothing about human subjectivity. All that a scientific text can explain is the particular individual experience of that scientist, which cannot be transcended. For Merleau-Ponty, science neglects the depth and profundity of the phenomena that it endeavors to explain.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{settings}} and style {{he used in}} his films came from European and Hollywood cinema but he framed it all in a Japanese context, {{in the spirit of}} [...] "borderless" [...] action cinema. He did not want to make typical films and the more European flavour of his work set him apart from many of his contemporaries. He made many yakuza films but considered them [...] "youth films" [...] put in a yakuza setting, favouring human drama over verisimilitude. The actors were also favoured over a distinctive visual style which, as writer Jasper Sharp suggested, may have accounted for his popular success in the star-based studio system.

2500|$|One {{week after}} {{shooting}} began, the film's production company went bankrupt, leaving the production in short supplies {{of food and}} water. Antonioni still had a large supply of film stock and {{managed to get the}} cast and crew to work for free until funding for the film was found. At one point, ships stopped making trips to Lisca Bianca and the cast and crew were stranded for three days without food or blankets. Eventually the crew went on strike and Antonioni and his Assistant Director shot the film themselves. Due to the rough condition of the sea and the difficulty in landing a ship on the rough rocks of Lisca Bianca, the cast and crew were often forced to sleep on the island. Antonioni has stated that he [...] "woke up every morning at 3 o'clock in order to be alone <b>and</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> what I was doing in order to re-load myself against fatigue and a strange form of apathy or absence of will, which often took hold of us all." [...] After several weeks of Antonioni and the crew working without a budget, the production company Cino del Duca agreed to finance the film and sent money to him.|$|E

[...] Phoebe liked the book, she writes [...] "I was unable to put the book down. I found myself enjoying learning exciting new facts and having old ones reinforced. It was definitely no repeat of the classroom scenario... Perhaps the book's greatest asset is that it manages to bring science to life. The vibrant illustrations reinforce this, as do the fun font styles... His style is colloquial, creating a relaxed, lighter tone."
