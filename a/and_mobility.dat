We have measured the lateral <b>and</b> rotational <b>mobility</b> of band 3 in spectrin-deficient red blood cells from patients with hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. Our data suggest that band 3 lateral mobility is regulated by the spectrin content of the red cell membrane. In contrast, band 3 rotational mobility is unaffected by changes in spectrin content. Band 3 lateral <b>mobility</b> <b>and</b> rotational <b>mobility</b> must therefore be controlled by different molecular mechanisms. ...|$|R

Drawing on a recent interest in mobilities across the social sciences, and a conterminous resurgence in academic accounts of materialities, the book demonstrates how these two ostensibly differing perspectives on education might be fruitfully deployed in tandem. Considering the interaction and convergence of materialities <b>and</b> <b>mobilities,</b> the book highlights the relationship between structural constraints and opportunities and the agency of individuals, providing a unique and essential insight into contemporary education. Examining a range of education spaces from the formal to the informal and the different types of mobility that manifest in relation to education, the book introduces readers to a range of theoretical resources and detailed case studies used to analyse the spatiality of education from across the disciplines of human geography, education and sociology. Drawing on material from across the globe, Materialities <b>and</b> <b>Mobilities</b> in Education is an engaging and relevant text, which will appeal to postgraduate students, researchers and academics interested in the development of education policy and practice...|$|R
