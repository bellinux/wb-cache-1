25|$|The {{following}} morning, Granger teaches Montag and {{the others}} about the legendary phoenix and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix must have some relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes. Granger explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built, so that way people can take a long look <b>at</b> <b>themselves</b> and reflect on their lives. When the meal is over, the exiles return {{to the city to}} rebuild society.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} is upbeat, keeping in theme with the music. According to Madonna the verses are a mystical {{look at the}} {{universe}} and how small we are compared to it. She wanted to capture a feeling of [...] "wonderment" [...] with the lyrics, as if some one has just opened their eyes {{and looked at the}} world for the first time. With NME, she further clarified that the lyrics convey the feeling of being small in comparison to the vast universe. It also talks about how regular life goes on faster [...] "than the speeding light", but one can get out of that journey and look <b>at</b> <b>themselves</b> with an outsider's perspective.|$|E
500|$|In 1935 Bush {{began work}} on a piano concerto which, {{completed}} in 1937, included the unusual feature of a mixed chorus and baritone soloist in the finale, singing a radical text by Randall Swingler. Bush played the piano part when the work was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Adrian Boult on 4 March 1938. The largely left-wing audience responded to the work enthusiastically; Tippett observed that [...] "to counter the radical tendencies of the finale ... Boult forced the applause to end by unexpectedly performing the National Anthem". [...] A performance of the concerto a year later, at the 1939 [...] "Festival of Music for the People", drew caustic comments from [...] Neville Cardus in [...] The Manchester Guardian. [...] Cardus saw little direction and no humour in the music: [...] "Why don't these people laugh <b>at</b> <b>themselves</b> now and then? Just for fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Bart King was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his contemporaries as an affable person. Ralph Barker called him the Bob Hope of cricket thanks to his quips and stories. King was also noted for making jabs at opponents, but leaving them laughing <b>at</b> <b>themselves.</b> The same held true when he would question umpires that turned down his appeals. He {{is said to have}} spoken for ninety minutes at a dinner during his last tour to England, punctuated every few seconds with laughs. The dinner guests were kept laughing even while King spoke with a dead-pan expression. One man who attended the dinner noted that King [...] "told his impossible tales with such an air of conviction ... that his audiences were always in doubt when to take him seriously. He made their task doubly difficult by sprinkling in a fair mixture of truth with his fiction." ...|$|E

500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh <b>at</b> <b>themselves</b> and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was about to say about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E

The group then zoom aimlessly around the city on flying surfboards. The scenes are interspersed with shoots of the girls doing different things, such as Brown at a turntable with bright flashing lights and a large rotating fan, Adams (Beckham) posing {{on top of a}} platform while photographers takes pictures of her, Bunton in a room surrounded with neon-blue balloons, Chisholm winning a boxing match and Halliwell giving a speech at a press conference to a crowd of journalists. The video won the award for Best Video at the 1998 Edison Music Awards, and was nominated for Best Video at the 1998 BRIT Awards. It was also nominated for Best Special Effects at the 1997 Music Video Production Association (MVPA) awards show.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{original}} broadcast of the episode, the staff members of the series received several complaints from chiropractors. The February 26, 2001 issue of the magazine Dynamic Chiropractic featured {{an article about the}} episode that noted: [...] " [...] has poked fun at numerous people, and about every institution and profession imaginable. On January 17, it was chiropractic's turn." [...] In an article of the magazine Canadian Chiropractor, Steven R. Passmore (D.C., M.S.) and Lorraine Kochanowski-Sutter (D.C.) analyzed the portrayal of chiropractors in the media. They gave [...] "Pokey Mom" [...] {{as an example of how}} [...] "chiropractors on sitcoms pok fun <b>at</b> <b>themselves</b> as they prescribe the duration of a course of care. [...] Dr. Steve on The Simpsons corroborates this stereotype when telling Homer that he will need to see him 'three times a week for many years.'" [...] Passmore and Kochanowski-Sutter also noted that in the episode [...] "we see a dreamcatcher on the wall behind Dr. Steve as he treats Homer. This strategically placed decoration could suggest that the chiropractor is in touch with native and/or natural healing, or it could be a jab at the field’s more esoteric practitioners." ...|$|E

500|$|Music halls, {{where both}} Nan and Kitty are employed—and put on display—as male impersonators, allow {{about half the}} novel's action and {{commentary}} on gender to take place, according to scholar Cheryl Wilson. When Nan puts on trousers {{for the first time}} to perform as Kitty's partner and realises the impact of their double act together, she states, [...] "whatever successes I might achieve as a girl, they would be nothing compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad, however girlishly, as a boy". Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel, and some performers are quite popular. Only certain types of depictions of men, however, were acceptable in reality. Nan and Kitty pretend to be London [...] "swells": gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts. Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions, as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class, and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh <b>at</b> <b>themselves.</b> Mashers such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{style of}} Trans-Europe Express was {{described}} by AllMusic as melodic themes which are [...] "repeated often and occasionally interwoven over deliberate, chugging beats, sometimes with manipulated vocals" [...] and [...] "minimalism, mechanized rhythms, and crafted, catchy melodies". Hütter has commented on the minimalist nature of the album, stating that [...] "If we can convey an idea {{with one or two}} notes, it is better than to play a hundred or so notes". The first side of Trans-Europe Express has three songs. The song [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] has been described as containing deadpan vocals with lyrics that speculate how stars look <b>at</b> <b>themselves</b> in a looking glass. Hütter and Schneider have described the song as autobiographical. The third track [...] "Showroom Dummies" [...] {{was described by}} Allmusic as [...] "bouncily melodic in a way that most of Trans-Europe Express isn't" [...] and with lyrics which are [...] "slightly paranoid". The idea for the song came from Flür and Bartos being compared to showroom dummies in a British concert review. Some versions of the song contain a spoken introduction starting with a count-in of [...] "eins zwei drei vier" [...] as a parody of the band Ramones who started some songs with a quick count-in of [...] "one two three four". The second side of Trans-Europe Express is a suite with [...] "Trans-Europe Express" [...] continuing through to [...] "Metal on Metal" [...] and [...] "Franz Schubert" [...] before closing with a brief reiteration of the main theme from [...] "Europe Endless". Allmusic described the musical elements of the suite as having a haunting theme with [...] "deadpan chanting of the title phrase" [...] which is [...] "slowly layered over that rhythmic base {{in much the same way}} that the earlier [...] "Autobahn" [...] was constructed". The song's lyrics reference the album Station to Station and meeting with musicians Iggy Pop and David Bowie. Hütter and Schneider had previously met up with Bowie in Germany and were flattered by the attention they received from him. Ralf Hütter was interested in Bowie's work as he had been working with Iggy Pop, who was the former lead singer of The Stooges; one of Hütter's favorite groups.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Ferguson was {{the drummer}} {{in the band}} of Mataya Clifford (a.k.a. Mat Stagger) when he met Jaz Coleman (from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire) in Notting Hill, London. In October 1978, after Coleman was briefly the {{keyboard}} player in that band, he and Ferguson left to form Killing Joke. They placed an advertisement in Melody Maker which attracted guitarist Geordie Walker and bassist Martin [...] "Youth" [...] Glover. Coleman said their manifesto {{at the time was}} to [...] "define the exquisite beauty of the atomic age in terms of style, sound and form". [...] Coleman gave an explanation concerning their name: [...] "The killing joke is like when people watch something like Monty Python on the television and laugh, when really they're laughing <b>at</b> <b>themselves.</b> [...] It's like a soldier in the first world war. [...] He's in the trench, he knows his life is gone and that within the next ten minutes he's gonna be dead ... and then suddenly he realises that some cunt back in Westminster's got him sussed - 'What am I doing this for? I don't want to kill anyone, I'm just being controlled'." [...] The band played a debut gig on 4 August 1979 at Cheltenham Witcombe Lodge supporting The Ruts and The Selecter.|$|E
2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make it a big one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that the sky is falling. [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that the sky is falling, leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky steps onto the scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look <b>at</b> <b>themselves</b> as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen to him now and should save all the other animals and tell them what to do. [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask to know what to do, Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] When they all run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E
