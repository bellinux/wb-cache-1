The Almighty has said, no doubt: 'Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.' ...|$|E
500|$|With steam {{came the}} need for water. Plans to dig a well near Wotton came to nothing, and the Duke's {{expedient}} of drawing water from a pond near Quainton Road did not impress the pond's owner. By March 1872 Jones recorded that [...] "The party to whom the pond near the Quainton Station belongs is making complaints about our having water <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> he will be using force to prevent our getting any". A wooden water tower was built at Brill station, and a large water tower known as the Black Tank {{was built in the}} fork of the main line and Church Siding.|$|E

500|$|On August 31, New Orleans's 1,500-member {{police force}} {{was ordered to}} abandon search and rescue {{missions}} and turn its attention toward controlling the widespread looting. The city also ordered a mandatory curfew. Mayor Nagin called for increased federal assistance in a [...] "desperate S.O.S.", following the city's inability to control looting. He was often misquoted as declaring [...] "martial law" [...] in the city, despite there being no such term in Louisiana state law (a declaration {{of a state of}} emergency was instead made). On the same day, Governor Kathleen Blanco announced the arrival of a military presence, stating that [...] "they have M-16s and are locked and loaded. These troops know how to shoot and kill <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> they will." [...] Despite the increased law enforcement presence, crime continued to be a problem.|$|E
500|$|The {{expectation}} {{of a world}} to come, [...] "" [...] (<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect)</b> is a joyful concerto of five voices with trumpets. Marked [...] "Vivace a Allegro", the voices begin with a trumpet fanfare in imitation on the same text as before. The movement {{is based on a}} choral movement dating from about 1729 which is used in [...] and a related wedding cantata BWV 120a. In BWV 120 it sets the words [...] (Exult, you delighted voices). After this statement, which ends in homophony, the instruments begin a short section in which runs in rising sequences alternate with the fanfare, in which the voices are later embedded. The word [...] "resurrectionem" [...] appears then in the runs in the voices, one after the other in cumulation. A second repetition of instruments, embedded voices and upward runs brings the whole section to a jubilant close on the words [...] "" [...] (and the life of the world to come. Amen), with extended runs on [...] "Amen". Wenk likens the movement to a bourrée, a dance in [...] "quick duple meter with an upbeat".|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E

2500|$|On September 6, 2010, Oracle {{announced}} that former Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd was to replace Charles Phillips, who resigned as Oracle Co-President. In an official statement made by Larry Ellison, Phillips had previously expressed {{his desire to}} transition out of the company. Ellison had asked Phillips to stay on through the integration of Sun Microsystems Inc. In a separate statement regarding the transition, Ellison said [...] "Mark did a brilliant job at HP <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> he'll do even better at Oracle. There is no executive in the IT world with more relevant experience than Mark." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michigan {{opened its}} season on October 7, 1918, {{with a home}} game against the Case Scientific School (now Case Western Reserve University) from Cleveland. Michigan came into the game with only two players (Angus Goetz and Abe Cohn) who had ever played for Michigan previously. Despite facing a Case team that {{returned}} seven letterman from 1917, head coach Fielding H. Yost expressed confidence in a pre-game interview: [...] "I haven't had a scrimmage since Monday, but the team looks like it ought to go pretty good. Conditions are fair for a good game, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> one." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Massachusetts {{legislature}} took up {{the repeal}} of the 1913 law the next month. On July 15, the Massachusetts Senate voted to repeal it on a unanimous voice vote. The House approved the legislation on July 29 on a 118 to 35 vote and Governor Deval Patrick signed it on July 31. It took effect immediately. He said: [...] "I think other states will make their own judgments, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> them to–that's their own business. All we can do is tend our own garden, and make sure that it's weeded, and I think we've weeded out a discriminatory law that we should have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the urging}} of his supporters, Miller never {{personally}} set an exact date for the expected Second Advent. [...] However, in response to their urgings he did narrow the time-period to sometime in the year 1843, stating: [...] "My principles in brief, are, that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843 and March 21, 1844" [...] March 21, 1844 passed without incident, {{and the majority of}} Millerites maintained their faith. On March 25, Miller wrote to Himes, [...] "I am still looking for the Dear Savior…. The time, as I have calculated it, is now filled up; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> every moment to see the Savior descend from heaven.

2500|$|Coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs {{used the}} Hack-a-Shaq {{strategy}} successfully in Game 5 of the Spurs' 2008 first round series against O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal scored only 9 of his 20 free throws, dropping the Suns to 20-of-37 total on free throws." [...] The Suns were {{eliminated from the}} playoffs in a 92–87 Spurs win. In May 2008, ESPN.com columnist John Hollinger named the Spurs Hack-a-Shaq use as the [...] "Best Tactic" [...] {{of the first two}} rounds of the 2008 NBA Playoffs. [...] Hollinger wrote that Popovich was the [...] "first to really master how to use this weapon to his advantage." [...] He explained that Popovich used the tactic [...] "to eliminate 3-point attempts" [...] and with 25 seconds or less at the end of quarters to get the ball back for the Spurs to gain the last possession. [...] Hollinger stated [...] "This should be a Eureka! moment for other coaches, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> it will be the league's most widely copied tactic next year." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{being interviewed}} by Haaretz in May 2011, Ehud Shani said that [...] "during the last visit by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to Israel a month ago, {{we were told}} that the delay may be shorter than they {{originally}} thought. In any case, I am not nervous about it. This [...] may actually serve our interests. I favor an aircraft with as many Israeli-made systems as possible." [...] He also said that [...] "we will see how they try to meet our requests over this time. In the original timetable, it was argued that there was no time [...] We will hear their conclusions <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> a dialogue with the Americans over the new timetable and the changes." [...] The idea that the Air Force will, in the meantime, acquire another squadron of F-15s {{in order to meet the}} gap that will be created [...] "is not relevant," [...] he said. The delay may mean that in the future there will be more aircraft coming to Israel in a shorter period of time, and the numbers procured may rise from 20 to 30. Israeli defense officials said that the problems with the F-35 were 'much worse than we had been told' and that a high-level delegation would be sent to the United States to determine the extent of the problems.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 July 1974, {{eight weeks}} after Ogilby {{gave birth to}} a {{premature}} son, Derek, fathered by Young, five UDA women, including her lover's wife Elizabeth Young (32), Kathleen Whitla (49, the second-in-command), Josephine Brown (18), Elizabeth Douglas (19), led by the latter's mother, commander Elizabeth [...] "Lily" [...] Douglas, abducted Ogilby from a friend's house in the Suffolk housing estate. They took her back to Sandy Row and put her before a kangaroo court held inside the disused Warwick's Bakery in 114 Hunter Street between Felt Street and Oswald Street, which had been converted into a UDA club. Ogilby had often frequented the club with Young on previous occasions prior to his internment; according to Kiely she had enjoyed the company of the other patrons and being part of the camaraderie of loyalists [...] "against the Fenians". A total of eight women and two men presided over this [...] "trial"; Elizabeth Young, however, had by then absented herself as she was not part of Douglas' [...] "Heavy Squad". The [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] were the members of the Sandy Row women's UDA unit who meted out punishment beatings by Douglas' orders. Ogilby was grilled for an hour over her affair with Young and regarding her calumnies over the food parcels. At some stage, Douglas told her, [...] "We have rules here. We all stick to them <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> anybody new to do the same". Ogilby, by now frightened at the predicament in which she found herself, was additionally informed that if found guilty, she would be subjected to a [...] "rompering". The notorious UDA [...] "romper rooms" [...] had been invented in the early 1970s by UDA North Belfast Brigadier Davy Payne. Named after the children's television programme, these [...] "romper rooms" [...] were located inside vacant buildings, warehouses, lock-up garages, and rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. Once inside, a victim would be [...] "rompered" [...] (beaten and tortured) before being killed. Although most of the victims were Catholics, many Protestants were also consigned to the [...] "romper rooms".|$|E

We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E
