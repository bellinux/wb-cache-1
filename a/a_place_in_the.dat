The Tigers went on to finish the regular season 12–0 with victories over Western Kentucky, Ole Miss and Arkansas.

Ismay was then attached to the Gloucestershire Regiment of the British Army in Ambala, where he served a one year mandatory apprenticeship.

5|$|Although Luton won the League Cup, {{they did}} not earn <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UEFA Cup, as UEFA chose not to relax its ban on English teams from playing in European club {{competitions}} during the late 1980s. David Evans, the Luton chairman was against his club participating in European football, though he never publicised his reasoning.|$|E
5|$|As title holders, Manchester City were {{entitled}} to defend the Cup Winners' Cup in the 1970–71 season. Had they not won the trophy, they would still have been qualified for European competition, as City's victory in the 1970 League Cup granted <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fairs Cup. As a UEFA-organised competition, the Cup Winners' Cup took precedence over the Fairs Cup, and so the club took <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former. In the first round Manchester City almost suffered an upset {{at the hands of}} Linfield, from Belfast. City held a one-goal lead after the first leg, but Linfield twice took the lead in the second leg. The match finished 2–1 to Linfield, and Manchester City progressed on the away goals rule. Honvéd were the opposition in the second round. Manchester City won both legs, the score 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|Ernest learned cavalry {{drill and}} tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the Queen's Light Dragoons, and {{proved to be}} an {{excellent}} horseman as well as a good shot.

5|$|In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a {{more solid}} operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{international}} repertoire.

5|$|José Antonio Camacho led Benfica {{to another}} second-place finish and broke an eight-year title drought; he {{attracted}} interest from Real Madrid, who signed him in late May. As a replacement, Benfica unsuccessfully inquired after Luiz Felipe Scolari for the position. After much speculation, Benfica announced they had recruited Giovanni Trapattoni, the Italian national team's former manager. Benfica signed more players than the year before, but only Quim, Manuel dos Santos and Azar Karadas became regular first-team fixtures. The most significant departure {{was that of}} Tiago, {{who had been a}} regular for the past two seasons. Because their second-place finish only granted <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, Benfica had to play Anderlecht for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group stage. A 3–1 loss on aggregate led to relegation to the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. Between both legs, Benfica contested and lost the 2004 Supercup with Porto.|$|E
