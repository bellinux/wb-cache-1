5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at about the same time, and it is assumed he gave help with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> at Windsor Great Park.|$|E

5|$|Dismantling {{the sets}} cost $125,000. Almost all the filmmaking {{equipment}} {{was turned over}} to the Italian government, which sold and exported it. MGM turned title to the <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> over to Cinecittà. MGM retained control over the costumes and the <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> background, which went back to the United States. The chariots were also returned to the U.S., where they were used as promotional props. The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent them from being used by competing studios. Some of the horses were adopted by the men who trained them, while others were sold. Many of the camels, donkeys, and other exotic animals were sold to circuses and zoos in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The Lake Grounds area, {{built in}} the early 20th century around an <b>artificial</b> <b>lake,</b> is the town's main park. Adjacent {{to the beach and}} esplanade is a 100-year-old <b>artificial</b> <b>lake,</b> and a cricket pitch {{surrounded}} by sloping lawns interspersed with specimen trees. One of the UK's few surviving outdoor swimming pools is situated on the shore next to the lake grounds and is open during the summer months. In 2009, the outdoor pool was renovated by a team filming for the American TV programme Ty's Great British Adventure. Above the lake grounds is Battery Point, where a gun battery was sited to protect the Severn Estuary from invasion.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{complex is}} the part of the Taman Sari complex that is {{practically}} has no visible remains, except for a former hanging bridge and remains of a pier. The description of this area is retrieved from a reconstruction made from the 1812 English army sketch of the Yogyakarta kraton. This area extends about 600 meters to the east of the Segaran lake area. This area consisted of another <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> on the southeast of the Magangan complex toward the northeast of Siti Hinggil Kidul complex. In the middle of this <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> is another artificial island called Kinupeng Island (Javanese Pulo Kinupeng). A building, known as Gading building (Javanese Gedhong Gading) {{stood in the middle of}} the island.|$|E

5|$|Sale's {{urban growth}} {{resulted}} in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, following the Local Government Act 1929. The increase in population led to the granting of a charter in 1935, giving Sale honorific borough status. Since then, Sale has continued to thrive as a commuter town, supported by its proximity to the M60 motorway and the Manchester Metrolink network. Sale Water Park contains an <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> used for water sports. Sale FC and Sale Sharks rugby union clubs and Sale Harriers athletics club were founded in Sale, although only the first now remains in the town at their Heywood Road ground.|$|E

5|$|Taman Sari can {{be divided}} into four areas. The first area is the <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> Segaran located in the west. The second area is a bathing complex in the south of the Segaran lake, called the Umbul Binangun bathing complex. The third area, now {{completely}} gone, is the Pasarean Ledok Sari and Garjitawati Pool, located in the south of the bathing complex. The fourth area is {{the east side of the}} first and second area, which extend far to the east and to the southeast complex of Magangan.|$|E
5|$|The second area {{is located}} on the south of the former <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> of Segaran. Even though this area was not the focal point of Taman Sari, it is the best {{preserved}} area in the complex and is currently the most popular tourist attraction. The area is accessed via two gates on the east and the west side, each of these gates leads {{to the center of the}} complex, first to an inner octagonal-shaped courtyard on the east and the west, and then each of these courtyards leads to a central bathing complex in the center.|$|E

50|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>lakes</b> made {{by holding}} {{groundwater}} on a pebble or loam surface, and sometimes having water input from springs, {{are often used}} as bathing lakes. Usually a land restoration is done after construction of the lake bottom, providing a comfortable environment for bathers. In principle, every lake {{can be used as}} a bathing lake. Thus reservoirs can also be used as bathing <b>lakes.</b> However, <b>artificial</b> <b>lakes</b> have added value to the inhabitants.|$|R

5|$|In 1730 Queen Caroline, wife of George II, {{ordered the}} damming of the River Westbourne in Hyde Park {{as part of}} a general {{redevelopment}} of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Original monastic ponds may have existed in the location and these were modified as part of the 1730–1732 scheme to create a single lake. At that time, the Westbourne formed eleven natural ponds in the park. During the 1730s, the lake filled to its current size and shape. The redevelopment was carried out by Royal Gardener Charles Bridgeman, who dammed the Westbourne to create the <b>artificial</b> <b>lake,</b> and dug a large pond in the centre of Kensington Gardens (The Round Pond) to be a focal point for pathways in the park.|$|E

5|$|Initial extrapolations placed Cooper's {{landing zone}} within an {{area on the}} southernmost {{outreach}} of Mount St. Helens, a few miles southeast of Ariel, Washington, near Lake Merwin, an <b>artificial</b> <b>lake</b> formed by a dam on the Lewis River. Search efforts focused on Clark and Cowlitz Counties, encompassing the terrain immediately south and north, respectively, of the Lewis River in southwest Washington. FBI agents and Sheriff's deputies from those counties searched {{large areas of the}} mountainous wilderness on foot and by helicopter. Door-to-door searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and Yale Lake, the reservoir immediately to its east. No trace of Cooper, nor any of the equipment presumed to have left the aircraft with him, was found.|$|E
