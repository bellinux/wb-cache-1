A new couple, the Braces, buy the house <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> Milly telling the story of the Wheelers to them. Shep stops the story and walks out of the house, crying. When Milly asks Shep what's wrong, he asks her in return to never talk about the Wheelers ever again.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Just a Perfect Day" [...] Maria finds Maddy stabbed and {{bleeding}} {{out on the}} floor in the Keller ward toilets. She immediately starts trying to resuscitate her. Linden rushes in to help. Three weeks have passed since Maddy was stabbed. She is in Holby Care <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> her thinking about a letter she has written to her sister Hannah. She seems to be fully recovered and is desperately trying to get back to work and be interviewed for the ST3 job. Ric held the interviews open until Maddy was well enough, and today she's going to make sure she gets the job. Maddy's going to show them that they can throw anything at her and she'll cope...even after being stabbed. Linden wants Maddy to be careful and take things easy, as she nearly died, but Maddy wants to get back to work.|$|E
2500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss {{stated that}} [...] "No Mercy is largely {{consumed}} with penitence and a looming penitentiary sentence". Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan commented that [...] "Throughout No Mercy, Tip remains an absolutely impeccable rapper, delivering even his lamest pieces of self-help nothingness in masterful clumps of singsong cadence and slurry double-time bounce. I {{get the impression}} that he could still absolutely rip a track to shreds if he could only get himself excited about the prospect. And every so often, No Mercy crackles to life, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> flashes of the rap hero Tip could still be". Giving it a 4 out of 10 rating, David Amidon of PopMatters stated that [...] "While peaks and valleys {{can be used in a}} positive sense, the way Tip's offering here dips in and out of quality seems much too violent for most longtime followers to keep up with. There are references to making terrible choices personally, which is fine, but as a musician one assumes a certain responsibility to avoid those professional pitfalls as well". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen cited it as T.I.'s desire for redemption takes on gospel overtones and [...] "Make no mistake, T.I. still knows how to throw a party. No Mercy is a sleek pop-rap record: 14 taut, catchy songs with beats from big-name producers and an array of top-flight guests. No Mercy suggests that, among A-list rappers, T.I. is the one with the most well-honed pop sensibility".|$|E

60|$|So {{speaks the}} true Son of Thunder.

60|$|As the day advances, {{the heat}} of the sun is {{reflected}} by the hill-sides, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> a faint but sweet music, where flows the rill released from its fetters, and the icicles are melting on the trees; and the nuthatch and partridge are heard and seen. The south wind melts the snow at noon, and the bare ground appears with its withered grass and leaves, and we are invigorated by the perfume which exhales from it, as by the scent of strong meats.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good," [...] {{said the}} Capuchin. [...] "Now I can go on. Well, {{let us say}} it is some months ago--we in this convent are all at breakfast--wretched, wretched breakfasts, son of mine, in this convent!--we are at breakfast, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> bang! bang! twice over. 'Guns,' says I. 'What are they {{shooting}} for?' says Brother Jeremy. 'Game,' says Brother Vincent. 'Aha! game,' says Brother Jeremy.

60|$|But {{again the}} door is opened, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> the tumultuous stir of the world,--a deep and awful sound, expressing in another form some portion of what is written in the volume that lies before the Man of Intelligence. A grandfatherly personage tottered hastily into the office, with such an earnestness in his infirm alacrity that his white hair floated {{backward}} as he hurried up to the desk, while his dim eyes caught a momentary lustre from his vehemence of purpose.

He had given his all to place himself along with Pompey in the republican quarters, and when there the republicans were unwilling to welcome him. Pompey would have preferred that he should have remained away, so as {{to be able to say}} hereafter that he had not come.|$|E

Trade is very bad here, and the gloom of the Preston strike seems to brood over the place. The Titiens Company have been doing wretchedly.

[...] "The Valois has, of course, made us vague promises, but all he cares for is that the war should go on, so that, if he and Burgundy come to blows, Flanders can give no aid to the duke. I have no hope in that quarter. Of late, however, Burgundy and Berry have prevailed in his councils, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> that he has decided to join the duke against us.

60|$|I have {{selected}} {{the sense of}} taste for an instance, {{because it is the}} least favorable to the position I hold, since there is more latitude allowed, and more actual variety of verdict in the case of this sense than of any other; and yet, however susceptible of variety even the ultimate approximations of its preferences may be, the authority of judges is distinctly allowed, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> every day the admission, by those of unpractised palate, that they are, or may be wrong in their opinions respecting the real pleasurableness of things either to themselves, or to others.|$|E

It does not strike me, then, as so bad in a girl who offers to aid her parent as I have aided mine, when the alternative was to suffer by want." ...|$|E
