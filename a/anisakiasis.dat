2500|$|Many {{infections and}} {{parasitic}} infestations produce {{patterns of the}} luminal surface, which are best seen on Barium examinations. Certain parasites are seen as filling defects outlined by Barium and Barium examinations {{play an important role}} in the diagnosis of intestinal infections and infestations as compared to other techniques. Barium studies show tapeworms and roundworms as thin, linear filling defects of the bowel. Because roundworms have a developed alimentary tract, barium may outline the parasites’ intestinal tracts on delayed images. In Strongyloidiasis barium studies show intestinal wall oedema, thickening of intestinal folds with flattening, and atrophy of the overlying mucosa. Schistosomiasis caused by infection with flatworms [...] have an appearance resembling colitis ulcerosa, with inflammatory polyps, ulcers, fibrosis, wall thickening, loss of haustration, and stenosis in Barium X-rays. <b>Anisakiasis</b> is demonstrated by Barium X-rays as bowel wall oedema, thickening, ulceration, or stricture due to inflammation. Sometimes worms are seen as long, thread-like, linear filling defects up to 30cm long. In Typhlitis Barium studies show oedema, ulceration, and inflammation of bowel wall resulting in wall thickening. In pseudomembranous colitis, barium studies show pancolitis with thumb printing and shaggy margins as well as plaque-like eccentric, nodular or polypoid appearance.|$|E
50|$|Raising {{consumer}} and producer {{awareness about the}} existence of anisakid worms in fish is a critical and effective prevention strategy. <b>Anisakiasis</b> can be easily prevented by adequate cooking at temperatures greater than 60°C or freezing. The FDA recommends all shellfish and fish intended for raw consumption be blast frozen to −35°C or below for 15 hours or be regularly frozen to −20°C or below for seven days. Salting and marinating will not necessarily kill the parasites. Humans are thought to be more at risk of <b>anisakiasis</b> from eating wild fish rather than farmed fish. Many countries require all types of fish with potential risk intended for raw consumption to be previously frozen to kill parasites. The mandate to freeze herring in the Netherlands has virtually eliminated human <b>anisakiasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Anisakidae are {{a family}} of {{intestinal}} nematodes (roundworms). The larvae of these worms can cause <b>anisakiasis</b> when ingested by humans, in raw or insufficiently cooked fish.|$|E
5000|$|The Anisakidae {{are also}} called the [...] "marine mammal ascarids". The larvae of these worms cause <b>anisakiasis</b> when {{ingested}} by humans in raw or insufficiently cooked fish, but do not reproduce in humans.|$|E
50|$|As with {{uncooked}} seafood {{in general}} (see Sashimi#Safety), eating this dish made from raw untreated squid poses some risk of contracting <b>anisakiasis,</b> since the parasite when {{present in the}} animal infests the flesh of its body (mantle).|$|E
50|$|Raw salmon flesh {{may contain}} Anisakis nematodes, marine parasites that cause <b>anisakiasis.</b> Before the {{availability}} of refrigeration, the Japanese did not consume raw salmon. Salmon and salmon roe have only recently come into use in making sashimi (raw fish) and sushi.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anisakiasis</b> {{is a human}} {{parasitic}} infection of the gastrointestinal tract caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood containing larvae of the nematode Anisakis simplex. The first case of human infection {{by a member of}} the family Anisakidae was reported in the Netherlands by Van Thiel, who described the presence of a marine nematode in a patient suffering from acute abdominal pain. It is frequently reported in areas of the world where fish is consumed raw, lightly pickled, or salted. The areas of highest prevalence are Scandinavia (from cod livers), Japan (after eating sashimi), the Netherlands (by eating infected fermented herrings (maatjes)), Spain (from eating anchovies and other fish marinated in escabeche), and along the Pacific coast of South America (from eating ceviche). The frequency in the United States is unknown, because the disease is not reportable and can goundetected or be mistaken for other illnesses. <b>Anisakiasis</b> was first recognized in the 1960s. During the 1970s, about 10 cases per year were reported in the literature. The frequency isprobably much higher, due to home preparation of raw or undercooked fish dishes. In Japan,more than 1,000 cases are reported annually. [...] Development of better diagnostic tools and greater awareness has led to more frequent reporting of <b>anisakiasis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Anisakis is a genus of {{parasitic}} nematodes, {{which have}} lifecycles involving fish and marine mammals. [...] They are infective to humans and cause <b>anisakiasis.</b> People who produce immunoglobulin E {{in response to}} this parasite may subsequently have an allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, after eating fish infected with Anisakis species.|$|E
50|$|Raw salmon flesh {{may contain}} Anisakis nematodes, marine parasites that cause <b>Anisakiasis.</b> Before the {{availability}} of refrigeration, Japan did not consume raw salmon. Salmon and salmon roe have only recently come into use in making sashimi (raw fish) and sushi, {{with the introduction of}} parasite-free Norwegian salmon in the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|As a raw food, sashimi {{can result}} in {{foodborne}} illness when bacteria or parasites are present; for example, <b>anisakiasis,</b> is a disease caused by the accidental ingestion of larval nematodes in the family Anisakidae, primarily Anisakis simplex but also Pseudoterranova decipiens. In addition, incorrectly prepared Fugu fish may contain tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin.|$|E
50|$|It can {{sometimes}} be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from asthma, syncope, and panic attacks. Asthma however typically does not entail itching or gastrointestinal symptoms, syncope presents with pallor rather than a rash, and a panic attack may have flushing but does not have hives. Other conditions that may present similarly include: scrombroidosis and <b>anisakiasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acute {{allergic}} manifestations, such as urticaria and anaphylaxis, {{may occur}} {{with or without}} accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms. The frequency of allergic symptoms in connection with fish ingestion {{has led to the}} concept of gastroallergic <b>anisakiasis,</b> an acute IgE-mediated generalized reaction. Occupational allergy, including asthma, conjunctivitis, and contact dermatitis, has been observed in fish processing workers.Sensitivization and allergy are determined by skin-prick test and detection of specific antibodies against Anisakis. Hypersensitivity is indicated by a rapid rise in levels of IgE in the first several days following consumption of infected fish.|$|E
50|$|Ceviche is ideally very healthy. However, bad {{sanitary}} conditions during its preparation {{may lead to}} illness. Aside from contaminants, raw seafood can also be the vector for various pathogens, viral and bacterial, as well as larger parasitic creatures.According to the 2009 Food Code published by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more recent studies, specific microbial hazards in ceviche include: Anisakis simplex, Diphyllobothrium spp., Pseudoterranova decipiens and Pseudoterranova cattani, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. <b>Anisakiasis</b> is a zoonotic disease caused by the ingestion of larval nematodes in raw seafood dishes such as ceviche. The Latin American cholera outbreaks in the 1990s may {{have been attributed to}} the consumption of raw cholera-infested seafood that was eaten as ceviche.|$|E
50|$|The black {{scabbardfish}} is a suitable host for the parasite Anisakis. This is mainly {{due to the}} fishes’ diet of infected hosts such as crustaceans (euphausiids, copepods and amphipods), fish and cephalopods. This parasite is a nematode {{that is capable of}} entering the hosts stomach wall or intestines. Scientists can and have used these parasites to track where the {{black scabbardfish}} has traveled. The parasite Anisakis is commonly used for tracking since they are prevalent in waters nearby Portugal and the Madeira Islands. A study has been conducted on the infectivity of the Anisakis app. Larvae (Nematoda: Aniskidae) in the black scabbardfish near Portuguese waters. The three regions that were observed in the study was the mainland coast of Portugal, Madeira, and Azores. The mainland and Madeira regions were observed throughout four seasons by scientists and the Azores was observed in two seasons. In all fish observed all were infected by Anisakis L3 larvae. Consumption of raw or under cooked black scabbard fish can result in health complications for humans. The only reliable treatment for a human affected with <b>Anisakiasis</b> is the removal of the nematodes through endoscopy, or surgery.|$|E
50|$|Despite having huge {{market value}} {{and a strong}} hold in the typical Southern European diet, there are several health risks {{associated}} with consumption of the black scabbardish due {{to the presence of}} several toxic metals found within the fish including lead, mercury, and cadmium. Even in very small quantities, these metals can be deadly to humans if consumed. However, according to standards set by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agricultural Organization, as long as the liver is not consumed there are no real health risks in consuming the Black Scabbardish {{as long as it is}} done in moderation. 'The levels of toxic metals found in the fish were as follows...Liver: between 2.37 mg/kg and 4.5 mg/kg of mercury foundSkin: between 0.36 mg/kg and 0.59 mg/kg of mercury found. 0.11 mg/kg of cadmium found.muscles: 0.9 mg/kg mercury found. 0.09 mg/kg maximum candmium levels found.In every sample, the lead found was less than 0.10 mg/kg. Black scabbardfish are known hosts to Anisakis. Eating raw or undercooked black scabbardfish could result in a parasitic infection known as <b>Anisakiasis,</b> and the only way this condition can be treated is by removal of the nematodes through endoscopy, or surgery.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{characteristic of}} gastrointestinal <b>anisakiasis</b> is severe abdominal pain after eating raw fish. Intestinal <b>anisakiasis</b> is more uncommon than gastric <b>anisakiasis.</b> Most patients with intestinal <b>anisakiasis</b> need hospitalization because <b>anisakiasis</b> can cause intestinal obstruction, ileus, peritonitis or intestinal perforation. We report {{a case of}} intestinal <b>anisakiasis.</b> A 43 -year-old woman presented with symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain 2 days after eating raw fish. Her brother had eaten the same food and had been suffering from gastric <b>anisakiasis.</b> Abdominal ultrasonography in this patient showed localized jejunal wall thickening with dilated lumen of proximal jejunum and ascites. According to the clinical course and examinations, {{she was diagnosed with}} intestinal <b>anisakiasis.</b> Administration of prednisolone 5 mg/day and olopatadine hydrochloride 10 mg/day improved her symptoms quickly without hospitalization. Prednisolone was administered for 10 days, and olopatadine hydrochloride was administered for a total of 6 weeks according to ultrasonographic findings.

40|$|Background: <b>Anisakiasis</b> is a {{parasitic}} disease caused primarily by Anisakis spp. larvae in Asia and in Western countries. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the genotype of Anisakis larvae endoscopically removed from Middle Eastern Japanese patients and to determine whether mucosal atrophy affects the risk of penetration in gastric <b>anisakiasis.</b> Methods: In this study, 57 larvae collected from 44 patients with <b>anisakiasis</b> (42 gastric and 2 colonic <b>anisakiasis)</b> were analyzed retrospectively. Genotyping was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of ITS regions and by sequencing the mitochondrial small subunit (SSU) region. In the cases of gastric <b>anisakiasis,</b> correlation analyses were conducted between the frequency of larval penetration in normal/atrophic area and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Results: Nearly all larvae were A. simplex seusu stricto (s. s.) (99 %), and one larva displayed a hybrid genotype. The A. simplex larvae penetrated normal mucosa more frequently than atrophic area (p = 0. 005). Finally, patients with normal mucosa infection were more likely to exhibit clinical symptoms than those with atrophic mucosa infection (odds ratio, 6. 96; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 52 – 31. 8).
