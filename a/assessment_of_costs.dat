25|$|Following his judgment, Richard Mawrey ordered Lutfur Rahman {{to pay the}} petitioners' {{costs to}} be {{assessed}} on the standard basis if not agreed between the parties. An order for an interim payment of £250,000 to be paid within 14 days was also made pending agreement or <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs,</b> estimated at £500,000. Rahman was also ordered to pay the costs of John Williams, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police, and expenses incurred in the hosting of the election court. As {{a result of the}} cost order, Andy Erlam obtained interim charging orders on two investment properties registered solely in Rahman's name as security for the judgment debt. Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid filed objection to the charging orders claiming absolute beneficial interest on one of the two property, and 74% beneficial interest in the other. Despite the objection, Erlam was able to obtain a final charging order on the second property on 29 June 2015. Additionally, an interim charging order was then secured against a property registered solely in Farid's name on the argument that Rahman has a beneficial interest in it.|$|E

40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in assessing the}} cost output and outcome for Geospatial Data Infrastructures (GDI’s) {{can be traced back}} to the differences between the various models and techniques that are applied interchangeably.

Furthermore, a number of studies have been carried out to make an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> implementation in relation to the potential capitalized benefits. Most of these publications acknowledge that it is difficult to make a proper <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> its <b>cost,</b> and even more difficult to assess its benefits, simply because most are very intangible.

40|$|PEMFC {{technology}} for transportation must be competitive with {{internal combustion engine}} powertrains {{in a number of}} key metrics, including performance, life, reliability, and <b>cost.</b> Demonstration <b>of</b> PEMFC <b>cost</b> competitiveness has its own challenges because the technology has not been applied to high volume automotive markets. The key stack materials including membranes, electrodes, bipolar plates, and gas diffusion layers have not been produced in automotive volumes to the exacting quality requirements that will be needed for high stack yields and to the evolving property specifications of high performance automotive stacks. Additionally, balance-of-plant components for air, water, and thermal management are being developed to meet the unique requirements of fuel cell systems. To address the question of whether fuel cells will be cost competitive in automotive markets, the DOE has funded this project to assess the high volume production <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> PEM fuel cell systems. In this report a historical perspective of our efforts in <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> PEMFC <b>cost</b> for DOE is provided along with a more in-depth <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> compressed hydrogen storage is provided.

We will discuss the factors influencing the selection of the system specification (i. e., efficiency, reformate versus direct hydrogen, and power output) and how these have evolved over time. The reported costs reflect internal estimates and feedback from component developers and the car companies. Uncertainty in the cost projection was addressed through sensitivity analyses...|$|R
