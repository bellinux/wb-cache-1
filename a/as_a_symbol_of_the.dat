5|$|The Finnieston Crane or Stobcross Crane is a disused giant {{cantilever}} crane (Hammerhead crane) in {{the centre of}} Glasgow, Scotland. It {{is no longer in}} working order, but is retained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's engineering heritage. The crane was used for loading cargo, in particular steam locomotives, onto ships to be exported around the world.|$|E
5|$|The mosque {{was built}} to commemorate {{military}} campaigns against the Maratha king Shivaji Bhonsle, although construction of the mosque exhausted the Mughal treasury and weakened the Mughal state. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosque's importance, it was built directly across from the Lahore Fort and its Alamgiri Gate, which was concurrently built by Aurangzeb during construction of the mosque.|$|E

5|$|The tree {{had been}} {{traditionally}} celebrated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Trinity, {{and it is}} still a venue for religious ceremonies. The first reference in extant records was in 1685, when a cartographer wrote that it was known as the Tree of the Trinity. It is also recorded that in 1746, the bishop of Solsona granted indulgences to those who prayed at the site.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caliph's ritual role as {{the leader}} of the Muslim community, they were closely paralleled in {{official}} propaganda by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. In addition, the constant warfare on the Syrian marches was useful to the Abbasids as it provided employment for the Syrian and Iraqi military elites and the various volunteers (muṭṭawi‘a) who flocked to participate in the jihad.|$|E
5|$|Between 80 and 90 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some {{of the success of the}} evacuation measures. Despite this, many remained in the city, mainly those who did not have access to personal vehicles or who were isolated from the dissemination of news from the local governments. The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flooding occurring in New Orleans.|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{explaining}} the symbols {{used in the}} novel and describing the values of optimistic life reflected in the symbols used in Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea. This research is classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> descriptive qualitative method. The primary data source {{of this study is}} the novel The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. The collecting data process is note-taking technique. This study is also categorized as library research. Based on the findings and discussion, the researcher draws the conclusions such follows. First, it is found that there are eleven symbols used in this novel, they are classified into Universal symbol which is considered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> whose meaning is long agreed by community because of their experience of this. The selected symbols taken from the novel that the researcher considers as Universal <b>symbol</b> are sea <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> universe, sun <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> happiness, night <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> suffering and lion <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> strength. The second catagory is Individual symbol. The symbol which is categorized <b>as</b> individual <b>symbol</b> is <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> which is originally created by authors for the moment of work so interpretating it requires greater attention to context, for their meaning comes almost entirely from context. In the novel The Old Man and the Sea the symbols which the researcher considers as individual symbols are the old man <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> someone who has optimistic life, Manolin (the boy) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> hope, Joe Di Maggio <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> strong desire, harpoon <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> skill, bird <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> help, marlin (great fish) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> struggle and shark <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> destructor or problem. Second, There are six elements or values which characterize someone as the one who has optimistic life and these ones are reflected in the symbols used in this novel. They are the values of hope, faith, power, struggle, positive thinking and respect. Second, Those symbols reflect the values of optimistic life which is to be the theme of the nove...|$|R
50|$|Although it was {{originally}} intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> peace and ecumenism, the tricolour is today seen by Irish unionists <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Irish republicanism and the Irish Republican Army. Many other flags are suggested as the cross-border flag for Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Sir James George Frazer in The Golden Bough {{noted the}} phallic {{nature of the}} spear and {{suggested}} that in the Arthurian Legends the spear or lance functioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> male fertility, paired with the Grail (<b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> female fertility).|$|R
5|$|Chile's National Monuments Council {{declared}} Patio 29 a National Monument on 13 July 2006 at {{the request}} of a group of Chamber of Deputies legislators. The Council chose the site for its proof of the Pinochet military government's elaborate procedures used to conceal the disappeared's bodies and their identities. At the ceremony, Patio 29 was described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's painful history and an educational place for human rights. As a national monument, the site will be conserved and maintained by government funds unless ordered otherwise by the courts. It is the first cemetery to become a national monument in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Connected to a {{spur of the}} Stobcross Railway, the crane's {{primary purpose}} was the lifting of heavy machinery, such as tanks and steam {{locomotives}}, onto ships for export. As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled {{through the streets of}} Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines and diesel tractors, from the works at Springburn to the crane for export to the British Empire. The crane is (as of 1988) not in working order, but is retained <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's engineering heritage.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, in {{response}} to a major new road building programme and expansion of aviation, a delegation of road protest veterans visited the Department for Transport to warn of renewed direct action {{in response}}, delivering a D-lock <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past protests. One such protestor, Rebecca Lush Blum went on to found Road Block to support road protesters and challenge the government. In 2007, Road Block became a project within the Campaign for Better Transport. The M11 Link road protests inspired the launch of Undercurrents the video activism organisation. Training activists to film the protests they released - a 40minute documentary about the M11 link road campaign.|$|E
50|$|Pink {{flowers are}} used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> love and awareness. For decades, pink flowers {{have been used}} to {{decorate}} weddings <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> love. They can also be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> display of love at funerals, as demonstrated at the funeral for Anna Nicole Smith.|$|R
50|$|Tea {{remained}} {{a very important}} item in Britain's global trade, contributing in part to Britain's global dominance {{by the end of}} the eighteenth century. To this day tea is seen worldwide <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> 'Britishness', but also, to some, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> old British colonialism.|$|R
5000|$|In Nsukka {{cultural}} settings,"ofo" [...] {{is called}} [...] "ohoo" [...] {{and is used}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> identity by the Onyishi.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the Union as the Irish Free State, and the Balfour Declaration {{recognised}} {{the evolution of}} the dominions of the empire into separate, self-governing countries within a Commonwealth of Nations. After the Second World War, the vast majority of British colonies and territories became independent, effectively bringing the empire to an end. George VI and his successor, Elizabeth II, adopted the title Head of the Commonwealth <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free association of its independent member states.|$|E
5|$|The Terrible Towel is a rally towel {{associated}} with the Pittsburgh Steelers, an American football team in the National Football League (NFL). The Terrible Towel has spread in popularity; for example, fans take their Towel to famous sites while on vacation. The Towel has been taken to the peak of Mount Everest, and even into space on the International Space Station. It is widely recognized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Steelers {{and the city of}} Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|After 1995 the white-red-white flag is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{opposition}} to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, most notably at the protests after the 2006 and 2010 presidential elections and at mass rallies on Freedom Day celebrations as well as Dziady memorial marches. The flag is not officially banned from public usage, but is treated by the authorities as an unregistered symbol which means that demonstration of it by political activists or sports fans can lead to arrests and confiscation of the flags. In early 2010, the political activist Siarhei Kavalenka was arrested for placing the white-red-white flag atop a Christmas tree on the central square of Vitsebsk. The court gave Kavalenka three years of suspended sentence which {{was followed by a}} second arrest and Kavalenka's several weeks long hunger strike. The hunger strike was interrupted by force-feeding on 16 January 2012.|$|E

5000|$|Around 3400 BC Egyptian pharaohs {{had their}} beds moved {{off the ground}} and slept on a raised surface. Bed linen was widely evolved in Egypt. It was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> light and purity, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> prosperity. The Egyptian mummies were often wrapped in bed linen.|$|R
5|$|Endecott was a zealous and {{somewhat}} hotheaded Puritan, with Separatist {{attitudes toward the}} Anglican Church. This sometimes put him at odds with Nonconformist views that were dominant among the colony's early leaders, which became apparent when he gave shelter to the vocally Separatist Roger Williams. Endecott also argued that women should dress modestly and that men should keep their hair short, and issued judicial decisions banishing individuals who held religious views that did not accord well {{with those of the}} Puritans. He notoriously defaced the English flag because he saw St George's Cross <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papacy, and had four Quakers put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment. An expedition he led in 1636 is considered the opening offensive in the Pequot War, which practically destroyed the Pequot tribe as an entity.|$|E
5|$|Following her commissioning, Australia hosted several {{official}} events. On 30 June, King George V and Edward, Prince of Wales, visited Australia to farewell the ship. During this visit, King George knighted Patey on the ship's quarterdeck—the {{first time}} a naval officer was knighted aboard a warship since Francis Drake. On 1 July, Patey hosted a luncheon which was attended by imperial dignitaries, including Reid, the Agents-General of the Australian states, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for the Colonies Lewis Harcourt, and the High Commissioners of other British Dominions. That afternoon, 600 Australian expatriates were invited to a ceremonial farewelling, and were entertained by shows and fireworks. Journalists and cinematographers were allowed aboard to report on Australia prior to her departure, and an official reporter was embarked for the voyage to Australia: his role was to promote the ship <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bond between Australia and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, 1990, {{the last}} Polish president-in-exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia, {{including}} one of the banners rescued by Mościcki in 1939, to Lech Wałęsa, the first democratically elected president of post-war Poland. The ceremony, held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Republic's continuity with the pre-war Second Republic. However, since legal regulations on national symbols did not recognize a national banner at that time, the banner brought by Kaczorowski did not become the presidential insignia again but was instead donated to the Royal Castle museum {{where it is now}} on display. The other of the two banners remains in the Sikorski Institute in London. Today, a kilim embroidered with the design of the pre-war Banner of the Republic is hanging in the Senate chamber, above the chair reserved for the President of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our {{image of her}} is largely {{through the eyes of}} others, in {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her has been used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E
5|$|The King {{was fascinated}} by astronomy; his {{personal}} association with the science was illustrated {{by the fact that}} the sundial was not only his personal pride and joy but was also designed to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stuart family. It had glass portraits mounted on it, depicting Charles, Queen Catherine, the Duke of York, the Queen Mother and Prince Rupert. A watchman was posted to guard it against the kind of vandalism that had wrecked the earlier sundial, but in June 1675 it was severely damaged when it was attacked by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, much to the king's fury. The fate of the ruined dial is unknown; it was last recorded standing at Buckingham House (later Buckingham Palace) in 1710.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout likens the appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the swastika <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun.|$|E
