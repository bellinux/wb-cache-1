5000|$|The Model 1322 is a {{pneumatic}} pump-action air pistol utilizing [...]22 (5.5 mm) caliber lead pellets. The pistol's {{integral pump}} lever mechanism is located underneath the barrel, {{integral to the}} forearm. This pump lever is cycled a variable number of times (up {{to a maximum of}} ten strokes) to store increasingly pressurized air in a chamber. When the trigger is activated, an air valve dumps the pressurized air into a transfer port integral to the breech, discharging the pellet from the barrel. According to the manufacturer, a maximum velocity of up to 440 ft/s was achievable with ten pump strokes, using standard 14.3-grain [...]22 pellets. [...] The Model 1322 features fully <b>adjustable</b> <b>square</b> notch rear and front fixed blade sights.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of a high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) detector {{is directly related to}} the quality of the asymmetric waveform generator. In this paper, we propose a design scheme of a multi-mode asymmetric waveform generator based on the half-bridge architecture, using a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) method to produce a frequency <b>adjustable</b> <b>square</b> wave pulse and half-sine pulse signal. An isolation circuit was combined with a drive circuit through a TLP 250 which is a MOSFET driver chip with photoelectric isolation. The frequency of the proposed waveform generator can be easily controlled...|$|E
40|$|The pinhole {{plays an}} {{important}} role in confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for adaptive optics (AO) as well as in imaging, where the size of the pinhole denotes a trade-off between out-of-focus rejection and wavefront distortion. This contribution proposes an AO system for a commercial CLSM with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>square</b> pinhole to cope with such a trade-off. The proposed adjustable pinhole enables to calibrate the AO system and to evaluate the imaging performance. Experimental results with fluorescence beads on the coverslip and at a depth of 40 μm in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell spheroid demonstrate that the proposed AO system can improve the image quality by the proposed calibration method. The proposed pinhole intensity ratio also indicates the image improvement by the AO correction in intensity as well as resolution. Numerics for Control & Identificatio...|$|E

In the article, introduced a design of the switching power supply and tested its performance. Firstly, used a sampling amplifier amplify the feedback current signals. The feedback signals were converted into square wave signals through a digital circuit. Then, using the MOSFET in the post stage circuit produced high voltage and high speed <b>adjustable</b> <b>square</b> pulses. The frequency of the pulse is 1 kHz, {{the speed of the}} cutting edge is 20 ns and the amplitude is 200 V. The photoelectron emission time of the photocathode is short when the width of the high speed pulse is narrow for strong illumination. On the contrary, the time is long when the width is wide for weak illumination. The number of photoelectron is a constant {{no matter what kind of}} the illumination. It keeps the flux reaching the phosphor screen constant. © 2017 SPIE. </p...|$|E

40|$|Sensing {{cellular}} adhesion via impedance measurements {{provides a}} versatile and easily accessible means for monitoring in-vitro cell cultures. Previous works used external electronics connected via cables to microelectrodes {{to achieve this}} goal, thus incurring parasitic impedance, electromagnetic interference, and bulky measurement setups. In this work we present a CMOS impedance-to-frequency converter integrated with biocompatible planar surface electrodes to make a compact and robust sensor chip for in-vitro cell monitoring. The system features an 8 × 8 array of individually addressable electrodes connected to four impedance-to-frequency converter circuits with externally <b>adjustable</b> biasing and <b>square</b> wave output.

50|$|The square {{charcoal}} grill is {{a hybrid}} of the brazier and the kettle grill. It has a shallow pan like the brazier and normally a simple method of adjusting the heat, if any. However, it has a lid like a kettle grill and basic <b>adjustable</b> vents. The <b>square</b> charcoal grille is, as expected, priced between the brazier and kettle grill, with the most basic models priced around {{the same as the}} most expensive braziers and the most expensive models competing with basic kettle grills. These grills are available at discount stores and have largely displaced most larger braziers. Square charcoal grills almost exclusively have four legs with two wheels on the back so the grill can be tilted back using the handles for the lid to roll the grill. More expensive examples have baskets and shelves mounted on the grill.|$|R
40|$|Dr Jüri Kermik {{from the}} Design and Craft Programme, Faculty of Arts, was invited guest {{exhibitor}} at the EcoDesign 2011 exhibition in Finland (14 - 18 September). EcoDesign is a prestigious annual event launched in 2009 and held {{as part of}} the Helsinki Design Week. The theme of the 3 rd International EcoDesign was MultiFunction. The exhibition presented ecological and multifunctional furniture from 100 internationally recognized designers from 11 countries including Shigeru Ban, Karim Rashid, Eero Aarnio and Björn Dahlström. Kermik’s design STANDPOINT minimises the amount of material and parts but extends the degree of multifunctionality through detailing, modularity and options for assembly. STANDPOINT utilises only four inter-connectable components for a maximum adjustability. Rather than attempting to define a fixed proposition, Kermik invites the user to create an object to be acted upon. Component parts: four wooden interconnectable and adjustable arms/legs, tray(s) and a box. Compatibles: lampshades, coat hangers, hooks, umbrellas, tools, instruments, clothes, books, maps, flowers, candles etc. Combinations: tripod, easel, stick-leg stand, pedestal, lampstand, crutch, sewing stand, display cabinet, telescope mount, workstand, trestle, plant stand, display stand, deadman, drinks cabinet, cake stand, leg, standard lamp, prop, sawhorse, coat hanger, clothes rack, buttress, music stand, bracket, stick measure, straight edge, mirror stand, notice board, tool box, tool rack, book case, <b>adjustable</b> <b>square,</b> compass, stilt, sign support, gun mount, bookstand, tray stand, magazine rack, key cabinet, valet stand, umbrella stand, candlestand, trivet, navigator’s level...|$|E
40|$|The {{test battery}} was {{developed}} to provide a standard procedure for cursor control device evaluation. The software was built in Visual Basic and consists of nine tasks and a main menu that integrates the set-up of the tasks. The tasks can be used individually, or in a series defined in the main menu. Task 1, the Unidirectional Pointing Task, tests the speed and accuracy of clicking on targets. Two rectangles with an adjustable width and adjustable center- to-center distance are presented. The task is to click {{back and forth between}} the two rectangles. Clicks outside of the rectangles are recorded as errors. Task 2, Multidirectional Pointing Task, measures speed and accuracy of clicking on targets approached from different angles. Twenty-five numbered <b>squares</b> of <b>adjustable</b> width are arranged around an adjustable diameter circle. The task is to point and click on the numbered squares (placed on opposite sides of the circle) in consecutive order. Clicks outside of the squares are recorded as errors. Task 3, Unidirectional (horizontal) Dragging Task, is similar to dragging a file into a folder on a computer desktop. Task 3 requires dragging a <b>square</b> of <b>adjustable</b> width from one rectangle and dropping it into another. The width of each rectangle is adjustable, as well as the distance between the two rectangles. Dropping the square outside of the rectangles is recorded as an error. Task 4, Unidirectional Path Following, is similar to Task 3. The task is to drag a square through a tunnel consisting of two lines. The size of the square and the width of the tunnel are <b>adjustable.</b> If the <b>square</b> touches any of the lines, it is counted as an error and the task is restarted. Task 5, Text Selection, involves clicking on a Start button, and then moving directly to the underlined portion of the displayed text and highlighting it. The pointing distance to the text is adjustable, as well as the to-be-selected font size and the underlined character length. If the selection does not include all of the underlined characters, or includes non-underlined characters, it is recorded as an error. Task 6, Multi-size and Multi-distance Pointing, presents the participant with 24 consecutively numbered buttons of different sizes (63 to 163 pixels), and at different distances (60 to 80 pixels) from the Start button. The task is to click on the Start button, and then move directly to, and click on, each numbered target button in consecutive order. Clicks outside of the target area are errors. Task 7, Standard Interface Elements Task, involves interacting with standard interface elements as instructed in written procedures, including: drop-down menus, sliders, text boxes, radio buttons, and check boxes. Task completion time is recorded. In Task 8, a circular track is presented with a disc in it at the top. Track width and disc size are adjustable. The task is to move the disc with circular motion within the path without touching the boundaries of the track. Time and errors are recorded. Task 9 is a discrete task that allows evaluation of discrete cursor control devices that tab from target to target, such as a castle switch. The task is to follow a predefined path and to click on the yellow targets along the path...|$|R
