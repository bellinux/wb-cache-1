5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded the same argument.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} pioneered {{the use of}} {{graphics}} processing units (GPUs), PlayStation3s, Message Passing Interface (used for computing on multi-core processors), and some Sony Xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> shift from traditional computing methods. As part of the client–server model network architecture, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's database servers, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.|$|E

5|$|After a premiering out of {{competition}} at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, U2 3D showed at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and had its limited theatrical release in late January 2008, followed by its wide release the following month. The film was distributed by National Geographic Entertainment and was only released in IMAX 3D and digital 3D theaters. It peaked at number 19 at the United States box office, and earned over $26million worldwide, ranking {{as one of the}} highest-grossing concert films. It received widely positive reviews, with critics praising the 3D technology and innovation.

5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E

Finally, subjects executed both reflex and remembered saccades in <b>a</b> standard remembered <b>paradigm</b> (the “twosaccade” <b>paradigm).</b> <b>As</b> has been reported previously, Parkinsonian subjects demonstrated hypometria on all remembered saccade paradigms, particularly the “two-saccade” paradigm.

These studies serve to refute a simple attentional capture hypothesis, and a hypothesis that suggests that the abnormality of remembered saccades is due to concurrent reflex saccade suppression.

25|$|The philosopher Robert Todd Carroll {{responded that}} Grinder has not {{understood}} Kuhn's {{text on the}} history and philosophy of science, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Carroll replies: (a) individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create paradigm shifts volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise; (b) Kuhn's text does not contain the idea that being unqualified {{in a field of}} science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> shift in that field and (c) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is foremost a work of history and not an instructive text on creating paradigm shifts and such a text is not possible—extraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure. Carroll explains that <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> shift is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the current (dominant) paradigm that produces data that can't be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm—hence <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> shift, i.e. the adoption of a new paradigm.|$|E

25|$|In {{analogy with}} Thomas Kuhn's {{definition}} of <b>a</b> scientific <b>paradigm,</b> Dosi has defined <b>a</b> technological <b>paradigm</b> {{as the general}} outlook on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, <b>a</b> technological <b>paradigm</b> is composed by some sort of model of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific technological problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving activity in which the problems to be solved are selected by the paradigm itself. In this sense, <b>a</b> technological <b>paradigm</b> entails strong prescriptions on the direction of technological change, that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge. Such gradual improvements along the specific lines prescribed by the paradigm are what constitute technological trajectories and progress.|$|R

40|$|Contemporary piracy is {{a complex}} and {{intricate}} problem. This article discusses different sources of complexity {{of the problem and}} suggests paying attention to ontological complexity. To unravel ontological complexity one has to ask the very fundamental question: Why is piracy actually considered to be problematic? Addressing this question leads to a set of different paradigms of piracy which underpin counter-piracy policy. Each of these paradigms works with different presumptions, foregrounds different dimensions and suggests other types of measures. Five paradigms of counter-piracy are outlined: Firstly, <b>a</b> security <b>paradigm,</b> which stresses that piracy is a threat; secondly, <b>a</b> legal <b>paradigm,</b> within which piracy is a crime; thirdly, <b>an</b> economic <b>paradigm</b> within which piracy is a business model; fourthly, <b>a</b> development <b>paradigm</b> that interprets piracy as a problem of structural root causes; and fifthly <b>a</b> humanitarian <b>paradigm</b> in which piracy is the source of suffering for individuals. These <b>paradigms</b> produce <b>a</b> range of tensions between each other. The article concludes in stressing the importance of paying attention to this complexity to increase reflexivity in drafting counter-piracy policies...|$|R
