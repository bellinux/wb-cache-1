5|$|Even {{with the}} data {{provided}} by the Voyagers, Titan remained a body of mystery—a large satellite shrouded in an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult.

5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, adaptive optics imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, even without <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> in the Jovian system.|$|E

40|$|<b>As</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{become more}} complex and autonomous, the need for {{reliable}} fault protection will become more prevalent. When coupled with the additional requirement of limiting cost, the task of implementing fault protection on spacecraft becomes extremely challenging. The current state-of-the-art Cassini fault protection software, for example, {{is a testament to}} the complexity and difficulty of implementing fault protection on spacecraft. This paper describes how domain knowledge about spacecraft fault protection can be captured and stored in <b>a</b> reusable, component-based <b>spacecraft</b> architecture. The spacecraft-level fault protection strategy for <b>a</b> new <b>spacecraft</b> can then be created by composing generic component specifications, each with component-level fault protection included. The resulting fault protection design can be validated by formal analysis and simulation before any costly implementation begins. <b>As</b> <b>spacecraft</b> technology improves, new generic fault protection logic may be added, allowing active improvements to be made to the foundation...|$|R
5|$|In 1956, Christy {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{scientists}} from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with Freeman Dyson on Project Orion, the design of <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> propelled by atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded.|$|E

The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E
5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the {{enormous amount of}} energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to move <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|As {{the closest}} planet to Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be {{successfully}} landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E

5|$|Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could launch <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{that was}} {{composed}} of a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to dock with the mother ship, and then be discarded.

5|$|Mathilde {{was once}} a planet in the making before being {{involved}} in a collision with another object making it the asteroid that it is today. Speculations do range as {{it may have been}} the solar system's true 9th planet (other than Pluto), previously being an equal rival that of Ceres. This asteroid was visited by the NEARShoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433Eros. During the flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the asteroid, revealing many large craters that had gouged out depressions in the surface. It was the first carbonaceous asteroid to be explored and, until 21Lutetia was visited in 2010, was the largest asteroid to be visited by <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Manned Orbital Telescope was a {{proposal}} for a manned spacecraft for astronomical or solar observation. It would have used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, and would have been launched on a Saturn IB. The enlarged reentry module was also considered for <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> proposed at the same time, which would have been used to rescue the crews of manned spacecraft that were stranded in low Earth orbit. It would have launched atop a Titan IIIC, once in orbit it would have maneuvered by means of a Transtage integrated into the equipment module. The larger capsule would have been used to accommodate the crew of the spacecraft which required rescuing.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{our understanding of}} the Galilean moons, and also discovered Jupiter's rings. They also took the first close-up images of the planet's atmosphere, revealing the Great Red Spot as a complex storm moving in a counter-clockwise direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft.</b> Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Shepard saw action with the surface navy during World War II. He became a naval aviator in 1946, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected {{as one of the}} original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first manned Project Mercury flight, MR-3, in <b>a</b> <b>spacecraft</b> he named Freedom 7. His craft entered space, but did not achieve orbit. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space, and the first person to manually control the orientation of his spacecraft. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B Freedom 7 II in honor of his first spacecraft, but the mission was cancelled.|$|E
