50|$|By nature, ASEF is {{different}} from international organisations, as it works with both ASEM governments and civil society. It works on creating sustainable networks, injects civil society inputs into the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process,</b> and enhances ASEM visibility. This unique attribute allows ASEF's activities to generate ideas and solutions that would not normally emerge from purely inter-governmental or civil society processes.|$|E
50|$|ASEF has set {{in motion}} {{projects}} which contribute to education policy dialogue and facilitate youth networks. Through interdisciplinary and pragmatic approaches, {{as well as the}} integration of ICT as an essential component, ASEF’s education projects strengthen collaboration between education institutions and exchange among young people, while linking them to the <b>ASEM</b> Education <b>Process</b> and <b>ASEM</b> Leaders' Meetings.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the attitudes of the}} European Union on the development of Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). It looks first at the trajectory of EU positions on ASEM, before specific sections explore the EU perspective on the style and format of ASEM, on the substantive issues under discussion, and on the wider geo-political relevance of the institution. In order to provide a critical assessment of the EU’s position, the article also discusses some of the key alternative relationships the EU has with the Asia-Pacific region, be it multilaterally or bilaterally. By way of conclusion, the article argues that despite the limitations of <b>ASEM,</b> the <b>process</b> still retains an added value {{in the context of the}} wider diplomacy between the EU and its Asian partners...|$|R
40|$|The present paper situates the {{relations}} between the European Union (EU) and China in a double framework: the general framework of UE-Asian relations, on the one hand, and the <b>ASEM</b> (Asia-Europe Meeting) <b>process</b> initiated in 1996, on the other hand. Likewise, it examines EU-Chinese relations in a specific way –including {{the relations}} of the most relevant member states of the EU with China–, the latest events that have occurred in EU-Chinese relations in the new international scenario following the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, and the future perspectives for EU-Chinese relations...|$|R
50|$|Since its inception, ASEF has {{initiated}} several dialogue platforms on sustainable development {{and climate change}} issues in Asia and Europe. Reflecting priorities of the <b>ASEM</b> <b>Process</b> and needs from stakeholders at international, regional, and national levels, ASEF’s programmes in this field focus on contributing to the global debate on the 2030 Agenda and climate change policy.|$|E
50|$|In {{support of}} the {{official}} Asia-Europe Meeting (<b>ASEM)</b> <b>process</b> and the 9th ASEM Summit {{to be held in}} Vientiane, the EU Centre teamed up with the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF) and National Library Board (NLB) to put together an Exhibition entitled “Connected Histories, Shared Future” showcasing the work done by ASEF and EU Centre to bring about greater connections and exchanges between Asia and Europe.|$|E
50|$|France has {{extensive}} {{political and}} economical relations with Asian countries, including China, India, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia {{as well as}} an increasing presence in regional fora. France was instrumental in launching the Asia-Europe Meeting (<b>ASEM)</b> <b>process</b> which could eventually emerge as a competitor to APEC. France is seeking to broaden its commercial presence in China and will pose a competitive challenge to U.S. business, particularly in aerospace, high-tech, and luxury markets. In Southeast Asia, France was an architect of the Paris Peace Accords, which ended the conflict in Cambodia.|$|E
50|$|The town hosted The 10th ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting, an interregional forum. It {{consists}} of the 27 members of the European Union (EU), the European Commission, the 10 members of the ASEAN Secretariat, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, India, Mongolia, Pakistan, Australia, Russia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Norway, and Switzerland. The main components of the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process</b> are the three pillars: Political Pillar; Economical Pillar; Social, Cultural and Educational Pillar. In general, the process is considered by the parties involved {{to be a way}} of deepening the relations between Asia and Europe at all levels, which is deemed necessary to achieve a more balanced political and economic world order. The process is enhanced by the biennial meetings of heads of state, alternately in Europe and Asia, and political, economic, and socio-cultural meetings and events at various levels.|$|E
40|$|Writing {{a thesis}} is like writing a story book, {{this book is}} a story of the 17 -year-old Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). It serves as a case-study of inter-regionalism, one of the newest {{cooperative}} mechanism in today’s international arena. Among a variety of cooperative frameworks, namely, multilateral global governance, effective multilateralism, regionalism, regionalisation, inter-regionalism is much less explored. This research determines how the rise of inter-regionalism influences the actors in the international arena and vice-versa. The key actors in inter-regionalism and their interaction are explored. Existing studies in the field of inter-regionalism in general and on the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process</b> in particular have been theory-led. There is a significant deficit of empirically-driven research in the field. In order to comprehensively understand inter-regionalism and the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process,</b> this research incorporates a substantial empirical focus. An unprecedented array of primary data is used. A variety of quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods are employed to generate this unique and comprehensive empirical analysis of ASEM. Ultimately, this thesis demonstrates the persistent state-centrism and lack of actorness of regions and regional organisations as independent actors in the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process.</b> Nation-state remains the primary actor in inter-regionalism; yet, they turn to bilateralism when more concrete cooperation or affairs have to be handled. The proliferation of sideline meetings, although as by-product, becomes one of ASEM’s key added-value to international relations. The empirical analysis also finds that inter-regional fora like ASEM offer participants regular information and views updates and promote socialisation among government officials in the official track and among the involved individual from civil society in the unofficial track...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} EU-East Asian {{relationships}} {{as depicted in}} the media are increasingly moving into the foreground of discursive international relations analysis concentrated on the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process.</b> Yet region-to-region perceptions are still largely conceived within national, historical and linguistic prisms which are only gradually transferring into trans-regional ones. This working paper considers two interrelated moments, as indicated in the title, and hopes to make a modest contribution to the academic study {{of the construction of}} perceptions as a necessary precondition of and complement to an emerging sense of a common, shared and mutually beneficial inter-regional cooperation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} ASEAN-EU relations using {{the framework of}} international society of the English School. Specifically, it attempts to examine the utility of pluralist and solidarist conceptions of international society in understanding the nature and dynamics of ASEAN-EU relations and the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process.</b> It argues that interregional relations between ASEAN and the EU have {{for the most part}} been determined by their identities as pluralist and solidarist societies, respectively, which is clearly manifested in their different perspectives and approaches on political, economic, and security issues.   The EU is primarily considered a strategic partner of ASEAN in the latter’s attempt to balance its relations with other external powers, particularly in dealing with rising power like China.   However, their partnership remains narrow and shallow even as the EU is perceived mainly as a donor to ASEAN’s socioeconomic development goals.

40|$|From {{its formal}} {{inception}} in Bangkok, in March 1996, the Asia-Europe Dialogue (ASEM) {{has been seen}} by Europeans {{as a means to}} reduce the threat of emergence of a block mentality in the two geographical areas. The ASEM dialogue distinguishes itself from other political and economic fora by the high level of its participants. The economic, political and cultural diversity of the ASEM Member States, as well as the constraints imposed by their belonging to two major regional institutional groupings, the European Union and ASEAN, make this dialogue and the creation of common institutions responding to the expectations of all stakeholders even more complex. In addition, ASEAN itself must be strengthened as a model of regional integration in order to effectively support the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process,</b> failing which the stability of Asia could be seriously jeopardized by endogenous factors related to the issue of sustainability of growth and of political handling of economic and political integration.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} the European Union and Asia with the purpose of developing new ideas for multilateral co-operation and building of trust in the area of comprehensive security. Specifically, this paper focuses on cooperation between Europe and Asia in three multilateral institutions: Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), ASEAN Regional Forum and the Asia-Europe Meeting (<b>ASEM)</b> <b>process.</b> The paper notes that Asia is a contested concept and that none of the institutions is universal in its membership. Next, the paper reviews the recent history of Europe-Asia relations and notes that extensive areas of cooperation have already been mapped out. The paper therefore argues that Europe must prioritize immediate and long-term challenges to Asian regionalism and regional security. Six major issues are then highlighted: the ASEAN Charter and community building, Australia’s proposal for the creation of an Asia Pacific Community, the situation Myanmar, conflict resolution in regional hot spots, mitigation of the impact of climate change and developing safe nuclear energy. The paper way to address these issues and build trust is through the cluster where individual European and Asian states take the lead on issues of particular concern...|$|E
40|$|East Asia’s {{economic}} dynamism {{attracted the}} attention of European political leadersin the 1980 s leading to the publication of Asian strategy papers by most Europeangovernments. However, it was the 1994 publication by the European Commission of itscommunication Towards a New Asia Strategy and the holding of the first Asia-EuropeMeeting (ASEM) in Bangkok in September 1996 that marked the first pan-Europeanattempt by the European Union to enter into a process of dialogue with a considerably lessinstitutionally structured Pan-Asian region. This article is an attempt to explore how tenyears of the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process</b> have {{failed to live up to}} initial expectations of interregionalismas one level in multi-layered global governance. This reflects, on the European side, thecontinuing tensions between intergovernmentalism and supranationalism as the modusoperandi of the European Union. On the Asian side, it demonstrates the lack of a coherentAsian region with which the EU can dialogue. The decision at the Helsinki Summit inSeptember 2006 to expand participation to all members of an enlarged European Union(with the addition of Rumania and Bulgaria) and in Asia, with the membership of India,Pakistan and Mongolia will probably accentuate this problem. Moreover, asymmetriesbetween a highly institutionalised European Union and an Asia devoid of strong institutionsare exacerbated by significant disparities in capacities and levels of political will amongstthe member states of both regions. Thus what is somewhat loosely labelled asinterregionalism can more carefully be defined as asymmetric bilateralism. Trappedbetween the Charybdis of multilateralism and the Scylla of bilateralism, interregionalism asa phenomenon engendered by globalization is at best a second-best option for politicalleaderships in both Europe and Asia. Thus, without a solid basis for development on bothsides the future of Euro-Asian interregionalism seems problematical at best. international relations...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of our doctoral thesis is {{to evaluate the}} role of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and its political, economic and socio-cultural pillars as a political process in interregional (multilevel) governance in Eurasian relations. We have conducted a unique case study that is based on a holistic qualitative interpretation by means of a postpositivist perspective and discourse analysis. Given the transitional and multidimensional nature of interregionalism as a political process, we are applying the (neo) realist balancing with elements of (neo) liberal multilateralism and social constructivism as the basic theoretical approach. Based on this structure, we {{have come to the conclusion}} that (1) ASEM as an interregional policy framework is too flexible (in terms of its scope and agenda-setting) and too inclusive (in terms of its enlargement). (2) Given the inability of ASEM to actively respond to various challenges and to implement properly its policies through its currently available instruments, this Eurasian interregional process cannot be regarded as a fully-fledged contribution the global (multilevel) governance. (3) Therefore interregionalism as part of the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process</b> will not lead to a creation of an "Eurasian Century", despite the undeniable need to identify corresponding supranational political regimes that will efficiently promote a balance of power between Europe, Asia and America. (4) Interregionalism as a political approach cannot be demoted to a loose and informal interaction of nation states or regions only because the current challenges in international relations require an organized and results-oriented framework for cooperation. (5) Additionally, the existing bilateral relations between individual countries in Asia and Europe will continue to be the key and most efficient form of solving various issues and challenges between the states...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{issues from}} {{a conference on}} ‘Civil Society and Accountable Global Governance’, {{organised}} by Jan Aart Scholte in May 2007. It examines the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) {{and the role of}} parallel summitry that has established itself on the margins of the official biennial gathering. Now comprising thirty five ‘cooperation partners’ from the regions of Europe and East Asia, ASEM summits, and the many other meetings in its name, focus on a host of issue areas for cooperation, from the further development of ICT to climate change and anti-terrorism. However, while business groups and trade unions are accommodated within the formal structures of ASEM, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are not. Nevertheless, the Asia-Europe People’s Forum (AEPF) has established itself alongside the summitry process, {{and the ways in which}} it has been able to influence government actions within ASEM to date have been contingent upon the particular structural conditions in which they have had to function. In demonstrating the tensions and opportunities inherent in the interregional space created by ASEM, this paper claims that accountability, itself a contested concept, is shaped by the structural frames of reference of agents, by their (power) relationships with one another and by both the internal and external mechanisms available to them to ensure accountability. As ASEM has yet to allow the formal inclusion of NGOs within its framework, claims and consultation to date have been conducted on the edges of the official track. In addition, the multitude of NGO types within the AEPF make it difficult to reach consensus and to organise difference. This difference also implicates and reinforces different levels of influence by NGO participants and highlights the fact that different NGOs may approach their remit quite differently. In addition, the <b>ASEM</b> <b>process</b> embeds an Asian versus European participation that is mirrored within AEPF, with the result that at times in the civil society realm, too, there is evidence to suggest that the structure can bring into conflict Asian versus European ways of doing business. Can accountability be ensured within structures whose modes may not be conducive to transparency and scrutiny? And what claims can the NGO community make for its own accountability? The conclusion examines whether the existing paradigm of civic engagement sets up an impossible hurdle for the establishment of open and accountable policy making behaviour within ASEM...|$|E
