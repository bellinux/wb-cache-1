40|$|Hyperbolic fibrations of PG(3, q) were {{introduced}} by Baker, Dover, Ebert and Wantz in [1]. Since then, many examples were found, {{all of which}} are regular and <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line. It is known, via algebraic methods, that a regular hyperbolic fibration of PG(3, q) that <b>agrees</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line gives rise to a flock of a quadratic cone in PG(3, q), and conversely. In this paper this correspondence will be explained geometrically in a unified way for all q. Moreover, it is shown that all hyperbolic fibrations are regular if q is even, and (for all q) every hyperbolic fibration of PG(3, q) which <b>agrees</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line is regular...|$|R

During July of the 1984 season, Smith went on the disabled list with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres. Smith's return to the lineup a month later was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.|$|E

A number of the barons set out in pursuit of Gaveston while the king left for York.
