5|$|Karl Ivanovich's History (История Карла Ивановича) (1874 or 9 March 1875): a work {{in which}} a man named Karl Ivanovich recounts history. The person's name and {{character}} were borrowed from Leo Tolstoy's Childhood (1852) and Boyhood (1854), both of which Dostoyevsky read in 1855; <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> wrote The Raw Youth and A Writer's Diary.|$|E

25|$|Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) {{encounters}} Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, {{is content}} and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems {{not only more}} reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly {{due to the fact}} that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled. Tyler discovers that Mike is a wolf hunter, killing for pelts to sell to make a living. Tyler demonstrates a trick he has learned: by playing certain notes on his bassoon, he can imitate a wolf howl, calling other wolves in.|$|E
25|$|When {{sufficiently}} complete (probably late in 1087), regular {{life began}} {{under the first}} abbot, Fulchred of Sées. The Abbey of Saint-Martin-de-Sées was closely associated with Shrewsbury {{in the early years}} because Earl Roger was its founder and he and the House of Bellême, into which he had married, were also major benefactors there, as were Roger's knights. A notification lodged at Sées in 1086 by Robert of Bellême, Roger's son, who was later to become 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, shows that they used the monks as witnesses in their property deals and custodians of the documents. <b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> recruited Abbot Fulchred or Foucher, Earl Roger made a huge grant of estates in England to Sées, for the soul of recently deceased William the Conqueror, as well as of Queen Matilda and of Roger himself and his dead wife Mabel de Bellême. Some of these were estates he had originally intended for Mabel. It seems that Sées Abbey for a time harboured plans to claim jurisdiction over Shrewsbury and it also contested some properties granted by Earl Roger; however, Shrewsbury became independent.|$|E

500|$|Christiansen {{reportedly}} {{purchased a}} house with cash {{a few months after}} the hijacking. While dying of cancer in 1994 he told Lyle, [...] "There is something you should know, but I cannot tell you." [...] Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain. After Christiansen's death family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.|$|E
500|$|Inspiration for Marching Men came in {{part from}} the author's time as a laborer in Chicago between 1900 and 1906 (where he, like his protagonist, worked in a warehouse, went to night school, was robbed, and fell in love several times) and his service in the Spanish–American War which took place {{towards the end of the}} war and just after the {{armistice}} in 1898–99. Of the latter, Anderson wrote in his Memoirs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had been marching and got a rock in his shoe. After separating from his fellow soldiers to remove it, he observed them and recalled [...] "I had become a giant.... I was, in myself, something huge, terrible and at the same time noble. I remember that I sat, for a long time, while the army passed, opening and closing my eyes". Combined with his later reading of works by Thomas Carlyle, Mark Twain, and possibly Jack London, Anderson had inspiration for Marching Men that was both experiential and literary.|$|E
500|$|Wheelwright {{received}} intelligence {{concerning this}} publication at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> received the letter lifting his banishment with its unwarranted assumptions. He was deeply stung by {{the tenor of}} this work, coming {{at a time when}} he was making serious inroads into putting the events of the controversy behind him with the help and encouragement of some influential magistrates and ministers in the Bay Colony. He did not want his friends and relatives in England to get their impressions of his time in New England from this unfair account of those who had opposed him. To defend his character, Wheelwright obtained the assistance of some friends to help him publish a response to Short Story. In 1645, Mercurius Americanus was published in London under the name of John Wheelwright, Jr., presumably his son, who was in England attending Jesus College, Cambridge at the time. Bell says of this work, [...] "in tone and temper, it is incontestably superior to the Short Story, and, while devoted especially to the vindication of its author's doctrinal views, agreeably to the school of polemics then in vogue, it contains some key retorts upon his detractors, and indicates a mind trained to logical acuteness, and imbued with the learning of the times".|$|E

500|$|Jennings {{offered to}} record [...] "Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me" [...] and told Shaver to sing another song – if Jennings liked it he would record it and Shaver could sing another; {{but if he}} did not like it, Shaver would have to leave. Shaver sang [...] "Ain't No God in Mexico", {{followed}} by [...] "Honky Tonk Heroes" [...] and [...] "Old Five and Dimers and Me". [...] Jennings was so taken with Shaver's tunes that he decided he would record an album consisting solely of the Texan's songs. [...] RCA producer Chet Atkins was reluctant to record the material of an unknown writer, but since he had creative control, Jennings decided to record the album anyway, although the executives of RCA Records delayed its release. [...] Jennings was also spending more of his time at Tompall Glaser's [...] "Hillbilly Central" [...] studio at 916 Nineteenth Avenue South in Nashville, attracted by the laid back, communal atmosphere that was the antitheses of the traditional setup that Jennings had endured at RCA since 1966. [...] Jennings brought Glaser back with him to RCA Victor Studios to co-produce Honky Tonk Heroes. [...] "Tompall and I were best friends," [...] Jennings reminisced in the audio version of his autobiography Waylon. [...] "We met at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> broke up with his brothers, and I kind of took their place in his life." [...] Jennings and Shaver worked on the songs for several weeks, with [...] Shaver believing that Jennings was not closely following the phrasing of the tunes, and in some cases he played the songs repeatedly so that Jennings would understand them. [...] The title cut was especially problematic, with Jennings and Shaver - both temperamental personalities - clashing over the arrangement.

2500|$|Sutcliffe was coached at Headingley by Hirst and the club's 2nd XI coach, Steve Doughty, {{who placed}} great {{emphasis}} {{on the importance of}} pad play (the use of the pads to intercept the ball and prevent it hitting the wicket when this would not risk being out leg before wicket). Although Doughty's approach was criticised by Sutcliffe's colleagues at Pudsey Britannia, Sutcliffe himself had no regrets <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> spent mastering the technique and later explained that swing bowling had been so well developed by bowlers in every county team that it was impossible for any batsman to keep his wicket by relying on his bat alone. [...] The long-term benefit he derived was a very strong defence that he later used to great effect on treacherous pitches.|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{said that}} he wrote [...] "Gloria" [...] while he {{performed}} with the Monarchs in Germany {{in the summer of}} 1963, at just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> turned 18 years old. He started to perform it at the Maritime Hotel when he returned to Belfast and joined up with the Gamblers to form the band Them. He would ad-lib lyrics as he performed, sometimes stretching the song to 15 or 20 minutes. After signing a contract with Dick Rowe and Decca, Them went to London for a recording session at Decca Three Studios in West Hampstead on 5 April 1964; [...] "Gloria" [...] was one of the seven songs recorded that day. Besides Morrison, present were Billy Harrison on guitar, Alan Henderson on bass, Ronnie Millings on drums and Patrick John McCauley on keyboards. Rowe brought in session musicians Arthur Greenslade on organ and Bobby Graham on drums, since he considered the Them members too inexperienced. There remains some dispute about whether Millings and McCauley were miked up, but Alan Henderson contends that Them constituted the first rock group to use two drummers on a recording. Although some sources claim that Jimmy Page played second guitar, other sources deny this.|$|E
2500|$|Pirate Guybrush Threepwood boasts to two pirates <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> {{defeated}} LeChuck. He further {{tells them}} that {{he is looking for}} the treasure of [...] "Big Whoop", and for a ship to take him there. The pirates tell Guybrush that Largo LaGrande, LeChuck's former first mate, has placed an embargo on the island, and is not allowing any ships to enter or leave. Guybrush wanders into Woodtick, the only town on the island, and encounters Largo, who promptly robs him of all of his money and takes off. Wandering the island, Guybrush comes across the International House of Mojo, the Voodoo Lady's new shop. She offers to help him drive Largo off the island if he can get her some ingredients for a voodoo doll. After retrieving the needed ingredients, Guybrush, with the voodoo doll that Voodoo Lady makes for him, defeats Largo. However, in trying to prove that {{he was the one who}} killed LeChuck, Guybrush makes the mistake of showing Largo LeChuck's beard, which he had kept as a trophy. Largo then steals the beard and uses it to resurrect his old boss, this time as a zombie. The Voodoo Lady reveals to Guybrush that Big Whoop, the mythical treasure for which he is searching, is also the key to another dimension which will allow him to escape from LeChuck forever. In addition, she gives him a library book about Big Whoop which reveals that a map, made by the original discoverers of the treasure, still exists in four fragments.|$|E

2500|$|On October 5, 2003, Kimberly [...] "Kim" [...] Long {{went out}} bar-hopping with her boyfriend, Oswaldo [...] "Ozzy" [...] Conde and a mutual friend, Jeff Dills. When they {{returned}} to the apartment in Corona that Conde and Long shared, the couple got into an intense argument and Long left the apartment, accompanied by Dills, to cool off. Dills later dropped Long off at her apartment, where she found Conde brutally bludgeoned to death, the entire place covered with blood. She immediately called 911. No blood was found on Long. After being taken to the police station and questioned, Long was asked to take a polygraph test and passed it. Friends of the deceased man pointed to Conde's former girlfriend as a possible suspect. Dills, however, told police that he had dropped Long off at 1:20 am, rather than at 2:00 am, as she had told police. Police theorized that Long could have committed the murder of Conde after 1:20 am and before she called 911 at 2:09 am. (Dills died shortly afterwards in a motorcycle accident and thus could not be questioned about the time discrepancy.) Long was tried twice for Conde's murder: the first trial resulted in a hung jury, and the second resulted in a second-degree murder conviction. The judge at the second trial, Patrick F. Magers, stated that {{if it had been a}} court trial, rather than a jury trial, he would have acquitted the defendant. [...] "This is one of those classic cases where the person who finds the dead person ends up becoming a suspect," [...] said Brooks. After the CIP became involved in Long's case, they got the case retried in front of the same judge, with forensic evidence proving that Conde had definitely died before 1:20 am that morning; that, even assuming Dills was correct <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> dropped Long off, it would have been physically impossible for Long to kill Conde and conceal her involvement within the period of less than an hour between 1:20 am and 2:09 am; and that a cigarette butt in the apartment revealed DNA from an unknown male. On June 10, 2016, Judge Magers reversed Long's original conviction, determining that she had been inadequately defended, and she was freed on bail after six years in prison.|$|E
