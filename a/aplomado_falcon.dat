5|$|Deinonychus fossils {{have been}} {{uncovered}} {{in small groups}} near {{the remains of the}} herbivore Tenontosaurus, a larger ornithischian dinosaur. This had been interpreted as evidence that these dromaeosaurids hunted in coordinated packs like some modern mammals. However, not all paleontologists found the evidence conclusive, and a subsequent study published in 2007 by Roach and Brinkman suggests that the Deinonychus may have actually displayed a disorganized mobbing behavior. Modern diapsids, including birds and crocodiles (the closest relatives of dromaeosaurids), display minimal long-term cooperative hunting (except the <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcon</b> and Harris's Hawk); instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, join forces time to time to increase hunting success, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where conflict often occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and might attack smaller Komodo dragons that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal dies, it is usually cannibalized. When this information is applied to the sites containing putative pack-hunting behavior in dromaeosaurids, it appears somewhat consistent with a Komodo dragon-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts that may have been eaten by other Deinonychus, which a study by Roach et al. presented as evidence against the idea that the animals cooperated in the hunt.|$|E

500|$|Based on {{appearance}} and behavior {{it was for}} many years considered {{a member of the}} primarily European and African kestrel clade within the genus falco, but recent DNA analysis shows the American kestrel to actually be genetically more closely related to the larger American falcons such as the <b>Aplomado</b> <b>falcon,</b> the Peregrine falcon, and Prairie falcon. Though the species has not been renamed {{as a result of these}} genetic analyses, it is not actually a kestrel in the phylogenetic sense. [...] Instead, a process of convergent evolution to fit a similar small prey niche in the ecosystem as the true kestrels has left it with similar physical characteristics and hunting methods.|$|E

5000|$|Even {{species that}} are {{normally}} considered solitary hunters {{have been shown to}} engage in cooperative hunting when the distribution of prey makes it difficult for solitary hunters to be successful. [...] For example, in <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> individuals generally hunt alone when searching for insects, as these hunts are simple and these insects are easy to find. However, the <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> generally hunt cooperatively when targeting smaller rodents and birds, as these hunts are lengthy and require high-speed chases. Thus, the decision to hunt cooperatively is often dependent upon the resource distribution in certain species.|$|R
50|$|It {{feeds on}} large {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates, with small birds {{making up the}} overwhelming bulk of its prey. Mixed-species feeding flocks in open cerrado and grassland will go on frenzied alert upon spotting this species; small birds fear it more than most other predators. It is often seen soaring at twilight hunting insects and eating them on the wing. It also hunts at fields being burned, at which many birds of this species may gather; cooperation between individual <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> - usually members of a pair - has also been recorded. In Brazil, <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> have been observed following maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and chasing birds that the wolves flush. Prey items typically weigh one-fifth to one-half of the falcons' own weight, but females of this species (which due to their size can tackle larger prey) have been recorded eating birds larger than themselves, such as a cattle egret (Bulbucus ibis) or a plain chachalaca (Ortalis vetula), on rare occasions.|$|R

50|$|<b>Aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> monitor each other’s {{movements}} during hunts. Males {{and females}} always perform the same task in every situation.

50|$|Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge is {{the largest}} {{protected}} area of natural habitat left in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The 98000 acre refuge is located almost entirely in Cameron County, Texas (near Harlingen), although a very small part of its northernmost point extends into southern Willacy County. The Peregrine Fund began reintroducing captive-bred northern <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco femoralis septentrionalis) to the refuge in 1985, which had been nearly extirpated from the Southwestern United States; today, {{it is home to}} 40 pairs. Nine other endangered or threatened species inhabit the refuge, such as the Texas ocelot (Leopardus pardalis albescens) and Gulf Coast jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi cacomitli), rare wild cats. Programs at the refuge include vegetation and wetland restoration.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1950s it {{was found}} in the extreme southwestern United States, and {{reintroduction}} efforts are under way in West and South Texas. It began to reoccupy its former range in West Texas and southern New Mexico in the 1990s. Documentary evidence for these naturally occurring birds was obtained in New Mexico in 1991, and sightings built steadily through that decade and the next, leading to successful fledging of three young in 2002. Sightings and nesting activity continue to the present. The addition of nesting platforms to areas where Northern <b>Aplomado</b> <b>Falcons</b> Falco femoralis septentrionalis were reintroduced in South Texas improved the birds' productivity. This resulted in a stable population, however without the addition of nest platforms the re-introduced population would likely decline to extinction.|$|R

50|$|Danica {{has begun}} to fit into serpiente society more and more, but other {{people do not have}} her courage or motivation.

Stirring things up is Syfka, a {{powerful}} <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcon</b> who has just arrived to drag a falcon criminal back to the island of Ahnmik.|$|E
50|$|Some avian avivores {{such as the}} shikra, besra, Eurasian sparrowhawk, and {{sharp-shinned hawk}} catch their prey by flying from cover in a tree or bush, taking their prey unawares. In contrast, the lanner falcon hunts in open country taking birds by {{horizontal}} pursuit. The <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcon</b> will use both ambush and more extended flights. The peregrine falcon dives on flying birds from a great height at speeds that can exceed 300 km/h.|$|E
25|$|Governmental {{intervention}} can aid {{in encouraging}} private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' Endangered Species Act requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, {{which is a}} disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place. To help mediate this problem, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date. This practice has already led {{to an increase in}} <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco femoralis) in Texas and red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) in the Southeastern US.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{successful}} captive breeding of peregrine falcons in North America {{occurred in the}} early 1970s by The Peregrine Fund, Professor and falconer Heinz Meng, and other private falconer/breeders such as David Jamieson and Les Boyd who bred the first peregrines by means of artificial insemination. In Great Britain, falconer Phillip Glasier of the Falconry Centre in Newent, Gloucestershire, was successful in obtaining young from more than 20 species of captive raptors. [...] A cooperative effort began between various government agencies, non-government organizations, and falconers to supplement various wild raptor populations in peril. [...] This effort was strongest in North America where significant private donations along with funding allocations through the Endangered Species Act of 1972 provided the means to continue the release of captive-bred peregrines, golden eagles, bald eagles, <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> and others. By the mid-1980s, falconers had become self-sufficient as regards sources of birds to train and fly, {{in addition to the}} immensely important conservation benefits conferred by captive breeding.|$|R
50|$|When {{resources}} are distributed {{in a way}} that supports group living, populations may develop social groups. Cooperative hunting is often a major feature of these groups, and it has been theorized that it is a primary basis for the evolution of sociality in the order Carnivora. While alternate theories have concluded that cooperative hunting may not be as important of a factor as territory sharing and mutual protection of offspring, they still agree that it {{plays an important role in}} developing social groups. For example, as a result of cooperative hunting, <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> defend the nest together and share the food with offspring after the hunt. Cooperative hunting has thus proven to hold certain social groups together since it can be disadvantageous to hunt alone in particular situations. Future research may quantify the contribution of cooperative hunting to the evolution of sociality, as it is currently difficult to ascertain how much cooperative hunting is a cause or a consequence of social behavior.|$|R

5000|$|The {{expansion}} of the reintroduction program to that area has met with criticism, because technically, all <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons</b> in New Mexico are classified {{as part of the}} [...] "experimental" [...] (reintroduction) population. As such, while they are still legally protected from hunting, they are not protected by Endangered Species Act requirements to preserve habitat and the like. It is believed that mainly habitat destruction caused the species' (near-)disappearance from the US and hinders reestablishment of a wild breeding population. A coalition of environmental groups is attempting to have full protection restored so as not to jeopardize the success of the expanding wild population and the reintroduction efforts. [...] A published paper [...] describes the mixed success of the reintroduction program, carried out by The Peregrine Fund. Reintroduced birds are now breeding on the Texas coast.

Sixty-two Northern aplomado and six peregrine falcons died. Epidemiologic analyses indicated a point source epizootic, horizontal transmission, and increased relative risk associated with cross-species brooding of eggs.

50|$|Falcon {{adenovirus}} A is an avian adenovirus {{capable of}} infecting birds {{of the genus}} Falco, commonly called falcons.

40|$|An {{adenovirus}} {{was detected}} by electron microscopy in tissues from falcons that died during an outbreak of inclusion body hepatitis and enteritis that affected neonatal Northern aplomado (Falco femoralis septentrionalis) and peregrine (Falco peregrinus anatum) falcons. Molecular characterization has identified the falcon virus as a new member of the aviadenovirus group (M. Schrenzel, J. L. Oaks, D. Rotstein, G. Maalouf, E. Snook, C. Sandfort, and B. Rideout, J. Clin. Microbiol. 43 : 3402 - 3413, 2005). In this study, the virus was successfully isolated and propagated in peregrine falcon embryo fibroblasts, in which it caused visible and reproducible cytopathology. Testing for serum neutralizing antibodies found that infection with this virus was limited almost exclusively to falcons. Serology also found that wild and captive peregrine falcons had high seropositivity rates of 80 % and 100 %, respectively, although clinical disease was rarely reported in this species. These data implicate peregrine falcons as the natural host and primary reservoir for the virus. Other species of North American <b>falcons,</b> including <b>aplomado</b> <b>falcons,</b> had lower seropositivity rates of 43 to 57 %. Falcon species of tropical and/or island origin were uniformly seronegative, although deaths among adults of these species have been described, suggesting they are highly susceptible.
