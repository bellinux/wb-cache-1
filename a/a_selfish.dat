He is getting married to the daughter {{of one of the}} richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington (Haviland Morris) is <b>a</b> <b>selfish</b> woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in the well-being of her fiancé.

First he has to pick up a cougar for an exotic animal activist named Montgomery Bell (John Mills), then to pick up Nikki, and lastly he has to make sure that Nikki catches the next bus to her hometown of Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Theramenes {{remained}} a controversial figure after his death; Lysias vigorously denounced him while prosecuting {{several of his}} former political allies, but others defended his actions. Modern historical assessments have shifted over time; in the 19th century, Theramenes's part in the coup of 411 BC and his use of Arginusae were widely condemned, but newly discovered ancient texts and 20th-century scholarship supported more positive assessments. Some historians have found in Theramenes <b>a</b> <b>selfish</b> opportunist, others a principled moderate. The details of his actions, his motivations, and his character continue to be debated down to the present day.|$|E

25|$|Douglas's {{image as}} a tough guy was {{established}} in his eighth film, Champion (1949), after producer Stanley Kramer chose him to play <b>a</b> <b>selfish</b> boxer. In accepting the role, he took a gamble, however, since he had to turn down an offer to star in a big-budget MGM film, The Great Sinner, which would have earned him three times the income.|$|E

25|$|However selfish {{individuals}} can exploit the co-operativeness of others by not {{taking part in}} the group activity, but still enjoying its benefits. For instance, <b>a</b> <b>selfish</b> individual which does not join the hunting pack and share in its risks, but nevertheless shares in the spoils, has a fitness advantage over {{the other members of the}} pack. Thus, although a group of co-operative individuals is fitter than an equivalent group of selfish individuals, selfish individuals interspersed among a community of co-operators are always fitter than their hosts. They will raise, on average, more offspring than their hosts, and will ultimately replace them.|$|E
25|$|Jesus is not {{believed}} by his family, {{and so he}} leaves them once again, meets Mary Magdalene, and goes to work helping the fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. One day out on the Sea by himself, he is visited by God and the devil. God tells Jesus of his plan for Jesus to institute Christianity, because God is annoyed at being only the God of one race, and that other gods seem {{to get all the}} glory. Jesus is initially against what he sees as <b>a</b> <b>selfish</b> plan bound to lead to great suffering of many, but is made to see that he actually has no choice in the matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of psychopathy {{has been associated}} with organized crime, economic crime and war crimes. Terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, <b>a</b> <b>selfish</b> world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, and blame externalization. However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting organized terrorism.|$|E

25|$|This was {{of great}} {{relevance}} to Gregory {{himself as he}} presided over the important see of Tours, where extensive use {{was made of the}} cult of St. Martin in establishing the authority of the bishopric with the congregation and {{in the context of the}} Frankish church. Gregory's hagiography was an essential component of this. However, this should not be seen as <b>a</b> <b>selfish</b> grab for power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the Life of the Fathers, but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to be in the best interests of their congregation and the wider church.|$|E
25|$|The series {{centers on}} the surreal adventures and antics of three {{anthropomorphic}} fast food items: Master Shake, <b>a</b> <b>selfish,</b> pathological lying milkshake; Frylock, an intelligent, well-meaning box of French fries; and Meatwad, a shapeshifting, simple-minded ball of ground meat. They live together as roommates, and rarely get along with their human neighbor Carl Brutananadilewski, a balding, middle-aged, sex-crazed sports fanatic. The main protagonists also interact with various villains or other individuals in each episode; these interactions are often restricted to one episode, as minor characters rarely reappear in following episodes. Some episodes feature the main protagonists interacting with celebrities (such as adult film actress Tera Patrick) and occasionally with historical figures and professional athletes (such as Bart Oates or John Kruk).|$|E
