Terrapins have been named to All-ACC second or third teams an additional 61times, although those teams have not been published continuously and there currently is no third team.|$|E

5|$|Originally themed {{around the}} Middle Ages, Medieval Faire is {{a section of}} Canada's Wonderland, a theme park in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. As such, early attractions created under Kings Entertainment Company were named after knights, Don Quixote, Vikings, dragons, bats, and beasts. Throughout the Paramount Parks era, the section's new attractions lacked {{appropriate}} theming. The introduction of the Leviathan roller coaster to Medieval Faire in 2012 {{was the first major}} investment in the section since 2000; the park is now under ownership of Cedar Fair. The section includes four roller coasters (The Bat, Dragon Fire, Leviathan, and Wild Beast) <b>and</b> <b>six</b> <b>other</b> rides.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} {{strength}} of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50–70 year cycle, {{also known as the}} Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging 3–5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40–60 years, <b>and</b> <b>six</b> <b>other</b> averaging 1.5–2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10–20 years. These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout, a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year.|$|E
5|$|Antigua had {{a general}} {{election}} in 2004, following the dissolution of Parliament in late February; with the ALP running a full slate, Joseph was nominated for the St Mary's North seat. The ALP were conclusively defeated by the United Progressive Party (UPP) and forced out of government, Joseph lost his seat to Bertrand Joseph. Now in opposition, the ALP held a leadership contest in 2005, in which Joseph was elected Party Chairman, defeating Vere Bird, Jr. 164 votes to 108. In 2007, he was appointed by Bird to act as Shadow Minister for Tourism and Education. In the 2009 general election he again ran for St Mary's North, defeating Bertrand Joseph by 21 votes; despite this, the UPP retained power. Following an unauthorised ALP march on May Day in 2009 to protest against the UPP government, Joseph <b>and</b> <b>six</b> <b>other</b> senior ALP figures, including the former Prime Minister, were {{arrested and charged with}} public order offences. They pleaded not guilty, but were convicted and fined.|$|E

5|$|Prison life at Fremantle was {{extremely}} regulated. Meals were {{an important part}} of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the operational life of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was never enough to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with flogging and time in irons eventually replaced by lengthening of sentences and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution, between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included Moondyne Joe, as well as John Boyle O'Reilly <b>and</b> <b>six</b> <b>other</b> Fenians in the 19th century, and Brenden Abbott in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|Resolution was {{provided}} by the same 1989 study that confirmed the link between Xenopsaris and Pachyramphus. In it, Xenopsaris <b>and</b> <b>six</b> <b>other</b> genera previously held in the three families were found to actually form a fourth family, later named Tityridae. This new family is where the genus is now placed by the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society. A 2007 study of mitochondrial DNA confirmed the white-naped xenopsaris' place in the Tityridae, and its close relationship to Pachyramphus, as well as the genus Tityra. These three genera were found to be more distantly related to a fourth genus Iodopleura (the purpletufts), although further studies are needed to understand the complete relationship between these four genera.|$|E
5|$|Robinson <b>and</b> <b>six</b> <b>other</b> Georgia Tech {{researchers}} (including Robinson's former professor James E.

Robinson worked as the unpaid general manager for the first year. The relations between Scientific Associates and the EES were initially strained due to an unrelated dispute over station finances between EES director Gerald Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson. Specifically, Emerson believed that surplus funds realized through research contracts {{should be returned to}} Georgia Tech, while the Georgia Tech Research Corporation and Rosselot felt they should be retained to foster additional research.|$|E

5|$|The ALP {{government}} {{lost the}} 2004 election, with the United Progressive Party under Baldwin Spencer taking 14 of the 17 seats in House.

They pleaded not guilty, but were convicted and fined. This followed severe delays after Bird suffered a seizure during the trial, his third since 2008.

5|$|The {{head of the}} {{southern}} territories' government during this time was in effect the Company's regional administrator. The first of these was appointed in 1890, soon after the Pioneer Column's establishment of Fort Salisbury, the capital, on 12 September that year. From 1899, the administrator governed {{as part of a}} ten-man Legislative Council, originally made up of himself, five other members nominated by the Company, and four elected by registered voters. The number of elected members rose gradually under Company rule until they numbered 13 in 1920, sitting alongside the administrator <b>and</b> <b>six</b> <b>other</b> Company officials in the 20-member Legislative Council. The Company's Royal Charter, which originally ran out in October 1914, was renewed for a further ten years in 1915.|$|E
5|$|The joint {{attack against}} the Liao had been planned for 1121, but it was rescheduled for 1122. In February 23 of that year, the Jin {{captured}} the Liao Central Capital as promised. The Song delayed their entry into the war because it diverted resources to fighting the Western Xia in the northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion led by Fang La in the south. When a Song army under Tong Guan's command finally attacked Yanjing in May 1122, the smaller forces of the weakened Liao repelled the invaders with ease. Another attack failed in the fall. Both times, Tong was forced to retreat back to Kaifeng. After the first attack, Aguda changed {{the terms of the}} agreement and only promised Yanjing <b>and</b> <b>six</b> <b>other</b> prefectures to the Song. In early 1123 it was Jurchen forces that easily took the Liao Southern Capital. They sacked it and enslaved its population.|$|E
