5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> {{album was}} {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
5|$|In Super Metroid, {{just after}} giving the {{hatchling}} to a Federation research station, Samus tracks the hatchling (stolen by Ridley) to a newly rebuilt Space Pirate base on Zebes. She travels deep underground, eventually finding the now-fully-grown Metroid, then battling a newly rebuilt {{and more powerful}} Mother Brain. The Metroid hatchling sacrifices itself to save Samus, and Samus in turn defeats Mother Brain and escapes <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> planet is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Nansouty's final {{campaign}} {{took place}} in 1814 on French soil, under bleak circumstances for the French, who saw huge Coalition armies invade France {{at the beginning of}} that year. During this campaign, his command, 5,000 Horse Guards, included the 1st and 2nd Chevau-légers Lanciers regiments, under General Édouard Colbert, the Chasseurs à Cheval, under General Laferrière, the Grenadiers à Cheval under General Guyot, the Dragons, under General Letort, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Guard horse artillery.|$|E

5|$|The city {{averaged}} a four percent annual population growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s. This growth rate slowed during the Great Recession of 2007–09, and has rebounded slowly. Phoenix is the cultural {{center of the}} Valley of the Sun, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> state.|$|E
5|$|The {{film has}} been adapted for radio. In March 1965 the BBC Home Service {{broadcast}} an adaptation by Gilbert Travers-Thomas, with Dennis Price reprising {{his role as}} Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini. In 1980 BBC Radio 4 produced a new adaptation featuring Robert Powell <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> D'Ascoyne clan, including Louis, and Timothy Bateson as the hangman, and another for BBC7 featuring Michael Kitchen as Mazzini and Harry Enfield as the D'Ascoyne family.|$|E
5|$|According to Francis Buchanan, 15,000 of them {{returned}} to Mangalore and its environs, whilst 10,000 of them migrated to Malabar. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1883) mentions that 15,000 persons returned, of whom 12,000 were from South Canara and 3,000 from North Canara. According to the Mangalorean Catholic genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely {{from the small}} group of survivors who {{returned to}} South Canara. Soon after the death of Tipu, a detachment from the Bombay army under Lieutenant-Colonel Wiseman took possession of Mangalore on 4 June 1799, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> province of Canara, {{with the exception of the}} fortress of Jamalabad.|$|E

5|$|An {{extensive}} housebuilding programme {{started in}} the 1960s, and Radyr's population grew rapidly — particularly children. In 1964 Radyr Comprehensive School had 135 pupils on its roll. This number more than trebled in the next decade. A new development, the Danescourt estate, was built on land surrounding Radyr Court and St John the Baptist parish church, and the land was officially incorporated as a suburb of Cardiff in 1974. Danybryn Woods, near the development, was retained <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> forest is protected by a tree preservation order and is home to many species of plants and wildlife. Radyr railway station was renovated in 1998 and the tracks through the station were renewed, reducing journey times to Cardiff city centre.|$|E
5|$|As a Long Island Rail Road station {{it served}} as one of two {{junctions}} between the Far Rockaway and Rockaway Beach Branches. The other junction was at Hammels Station, although it was originally a junction for the Far Rockaway Branch and the Ocean Electric Railway. Hammels is now located where Hammels Wye is. Wooden shelter sheds {{were added to the}} station in 1921 and 1923. A fire on the trestle between this station and another one known as The Raunt, located to the north, forced the closure of both stations on May 23, 1950, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Jamaica Bay trestle which stretches from Howard Beach to Hammels Wye.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{imprisoned in}} a holding cell, but escapes by {{crawling}} through an air vent. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear pool reactor. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a Royal Navy ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.|$|E

5|$|Cabaniss' {{body was}} ordered to be embalmed but was not; the damage to his body was so severe that the {{embalming}} fluid would leak out. His body was buried in Kobe on February 24 with military honors. The entire crew of the Swatara attended, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> crew of HMS Flying Fish and many noted Japanese citizens. Ensign Parker reportedly suffered from depression following the accident. Cabaniss' death received significant media coverage in the Eastern United States. The New York Times published an article on its second page, and among other papers that carried the story were the Wilmington Morning Star and the Petersburg Index-Appeal.|$|E
5|$|It {{was long}} assumed that Vulcanodon lived during the {{lowermost}} (earliest) {{part of the}} Jurassic (the Hettangian stage) or at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, approximately 200 million years ago. Therefore, it was regarded as the earliest sauropod known, until {{the discovery of the}} even older Late Triassic Isanosaurus was announced in 2000. Adam Yates (2004) has recently shown that Vulcanodon is actually much younger than previously thought, dating to the uppermost (latest) part of the Lower Jurassic during the Toarcian stage, approximately 175–183 million years ago. – thus, it is contemporary to the closely related Tazoudasaurus. Although the locality of Vulcanodon itself cannot be dated radiometrically because of weathering of the lavas, it would roughly be a contemporary to Karoo lavas from other localities, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> sequence of volcanic eruptions was finished within one million years.|$|E
5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched {{what he had in}} mind, Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Other minor {{roles were}} cut with {{subsequent}} drafts of the script. At the US premiere of Goblet of Fire, series producer David Heyman said that former Hogwarts professor Gilderoy Lockhart, played by Kenneth Branagh in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, {{was in the}} first draft of the script for Phoenix. However, neither Branagh nor the character of Lockhart appears in the final version. Tiana Benjamin was scheduled to return for the film in the role of Angelina Johnson, the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but she had to withdraw due to a commitment to playing Chelsea Fox in EastEnders. The character, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Quidditch subplot, was ultimately cut from the film. She did, however, record sound clips for the Order of the Phoenix video game.|$|E
5|$|The ceasefire of 3 January allowed {{implementation}} of the Vance plan, which provided {{for the protection of}} civilians in specific areas designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs) and deployment of UN peacekeepers in Croatia. One of the UNPAs defined by the plan, UNPA Western Slavonia, encompassed parts of the municipalities of Novska and Nova Gradiška, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> municipalities of Daruvar, Grubišno Polje and Pakrac. Thus the UNPA covered the area held by the JNA on 3 January, additional territory to the north, recaptured by the HV in late 1991, and towns which never came under SAO Western Slavonia controlsuch as Grubišno Polje and Daruvar. The peacekeeping force named United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), initially expected to be 10,000-strong, started to deploy on 8 March.|$|E
5|$|The early Sultans of Bengal ruled until 1282 {{which was}} {{followed}} by the rule of several successive dynasties. Ilyas Shah founder of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty, took complete charge of the then Bengal and the capital was shifted to Sonargaon (near present day, Dhaka in Bangladesh). He was one of the independent rulers of Bengal. His son, Sikandar Shah, who succeeded him, built the Adina Mosque at Pandua, near Gour, Adina Mosque in the medieval times, was considered to be the largest in undivided Bengal, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Indian subcontinent.|$|E

5|$|The overtures {{from the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, {{and there are}} many {{recordings}} of them. Most of them are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, but not all of them were composed by Sullivan. However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided, and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections. Sullivan invariably conducted them (as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|This area {{is home to}} {{at least}} 10,000 residents. Among the victims was new age artist Ray Lynch. By midnight of the first day, scores of homes and {{businesses}} had been destroyed in Middletown, along with at least 50 homes in Cobb as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Hoberg’s Resort, an historic retreat built in the 1880s. The resort community of Harbin Hot Springs was also destroyed. On September 13, officials from Cal Fire confirmed that more than 1000 homes had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Watt {{was waiting}} for the order, and in 1938 had {{arranged}} for production of the transmitters at Metrovick and receivers at A.C. Cossor. These {{turned out to be the}} wrong products: Metrovick had been told to directly copy ("Chinese") the 1937 design by Percy Hibberd, but Bawdsey had delivered the wrong prototype to Metrovick, who copied it. The Cossor receivers were found to be unusable, weighing as much <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> transmitter and receiver, and having sensitivity about half that of the EMI lash-up.|$|E
