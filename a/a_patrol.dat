5|$|Again {{waiting until}} late afternoon, the Allies took the {{opportunity}} to attack <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as night fell. These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around Euboea, or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> from the 9th Parachute Battalion reconnoitred the Château Saint Come. They found it abandoned, but the {{presence}} of clothing, equipment, a half-eaten meal and a payroll containing 50,000 French francs betrayed the recent German occupancy.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the rebellion, most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, from where they hoped to head north to German territory. Chilembwe was seen by <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other rebels were captured; 300 were imprisoned following the rebellion and 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E
5|$|During NATO's {{intervention}} in Kosovo, Sea Kings of 814 Naval Air Squadron, operating from numerous Royal Navy {{vessels in the}} Adriatic, including the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, maintained <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> of the Balkans' coast. The Sea Kings were also heavily used in the transport role during the preparations for a ground invasion of Kosovo.|$|E

5|$|Explorer/Air Explorer/Sea Explorer : The Explorer badge {{is split}} into three {{different}} badges {{for the three}} different Scouting sections (Land Scouts, Air Scouts and Sea Scouts). The Explorer badge teaches the Scout {{to take control of}} situations, and requires the Scout to plan and run larger activities: an orienteering wide game for the whole troop, an incident hike for their Patrol, <b>a</b> <b>Patrol</b> expedition, and a troop campfire.|$|E
5|$|First Class : This {{advancement}} badge is {{the first}} advancement badge that places the Scout {{in a position of}} leadership and organisation. A Scout is required to plan and run a wide game for their Patrol, <b>a</b> <b>Patrol</b> camp, an overnight Patrol hike for which a log book must be written, a programme to teach younger Scouts in their Patrol about pioneering, and they need to assist in the planning of a Scouts' Own.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} after the battle, the Australians continued to carry out patrolling operations around the knoll. On 7 April, <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> from the 9th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force of about 30 men and in the ensuing engagement four Japanese were killed, while <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> from the 61st Infantry Battalion on 8 April killed another five. On 13 April, the order was given that the 7th Brigade would be gradually withdrawn and relieved by the 15th. Shortly afterwards, the 58th/59th Infantry Battalion replaced the 25th in occupation of the knoll, while the 24th Infantry Battalion resumed the advance along the Buin Road on 17 April, subsequently {{taking part in the}} fighting along the Hongorai River. The 9th Infantry Battalion, however, was not withdrawn immediately, and remained in the northern area until it handed over to the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion in early May. The fighting on Bougainville continued throughout April as the Japanese resisted the Australian advance and went on until July when the fighting petered out due to heavy rain and flooding.|$|E

5|$|Later {{in the day}} on September 7, Captain Melbourne C. Chandler, acting {{commander}} of the 2nd Battalion, received word of G Company's location on Hill 464 from an aerial observer and sent <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> which guided the company safely to the battalion at the eastern base of Hill 380. The battalion, meanwhile, had received radio orders to withdraw by any route as soon as possible. It moved southwest into the 5th Cavalry sector.|$|E
5|$|Most of the three-mile (5km) {{stretch of}} river that had {{previously}} been closed was reopened without restriction, although <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> remained in place to enforce a safety zone. The river restrictions delayed one outgoing vessel and two incoming ones. There was also a minor oil spill originating from equipment at the refinery's unoccupied and rarely used dock.|$|E
5|$|North of {{the main}} advance, <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> from Lieutenant Colonel John J. Tolson's 3rd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, {{encountered}} a force of 200 Japanese crossing the Bumbu River on 15 September. The Americans engaged the Japanese force and reported inflicting heavy losses. The arrival of that day of the first units of Brigadier Ivan Dougherty's 21st Infantry Brigade at Nadzab at last allowed the paratroopers to be relieved.|$|E

5|$|The Anglians were {{replaced}} by a detachment of 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment, formed around C Company. On 25 August, <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> from the Royal Irish went to visit a militia group known as the West Side Boys (WSB). At the village of Magbeni, where the WSB were based, the Royal Irish were overpowered and taken captive. British officers undertook negotiations with the WSB, leading {{to the release of}} five of the eleven soldiers on 31 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{red brick}} Trinity Methodist Church was {{completed}} in 1888. It has survived many troubles, including flooding in its opening year, damage {{on the night of}} 8/9 December 1940 by enemy action, and an arson attack on Christmas Eve 1980, when the church was only just saved from complete destruction by the presence of a police officer in <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> car nearby, who managed to call the fire brigade.|$|E

5|$|Tigerstar {{shows her}} around ShadowClan camp the next day, and {{introduces}} her to Blackstar, {{then known as}} Blackfoot. Sasha is offered to join <b>a</b> <b>patrol,</b> which she accepts. Along the way, she also sees Pine, who has gotten sick because winter is now coming on. Because Sasha does so well on the patrol, Tigerstar invites her {{to spend the night}} in the warriors den. Enjoying herself immensely, Sasha accepts.|$|E
5|$|UB-17 {{spent her}} entire {{career in the}} Flanders Flotilla and sank 13 ships, most of them British fishing vessels. She also {{captured}} two ships as prizes and damaged one tanker. On 11 March 1918, UB-17 departed for <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> in the Hoofden but was never seen again. There have been several suggestions as to UB-17s fate, but none match the U-boat's operation details.|$|E
5|$|Under a new captain, Kapitänleutnant Victor Oehrn, U-37 {{departed}} from Wilhelmshaven on 15 May for <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> around Portugal and Spain.
