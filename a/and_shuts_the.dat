2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection. He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. When he confronts her about her lies after she discovers he lied to her, she says, [...] "Just because I chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give {{you the right to}} be rude!": and Andrew replies, [...] "How about driving my father away? Do I get to be rude then?", <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> door in her face. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{narrative}} {{episode of}} the poem is a psychomachian battle between the hosts of Virtue and Vice for the field of Microcosm, which is possessed by Freewill. [...] As the battle heats up, Freewill joins forces with Vice and they begin to drive Virtue and his host from the field. [...] Perseverance comes and rallies Virtue’s troops, defeats Vice and wins the field. [...] Freewill goes {{through a process of}} cleansing and is made a vassal of Virtue. [...] Reason and Sadness are given control of Microcosm and set about cleansing it of the weeds planted there by Sensuality. [...] A disgusted Atropos determines to leave the service of the “counterfete” gods saying, “For oo God ther ys that can euery dell / Turne as hym lyst, bothe dry & whete, / In to whos seruyce I shall assay to gete” (39). [...] He goes in search of the Lord of Light and is told by Righteousness that the Lord of Light has been his master all along. [...] Atropos’ name is changed to Death and he is sent to Microcosm. [...] Priesthood and the sacraments are sent to the field to prepare it for the coming of Death who causes the grass to wither <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> gates on the field.|$|E

2500|$|The Bible {{presents}} Daniel and {{his companions}} as distinct, positive examples of individuals refusing {{to pay homage to}} another god, even at the price of their lives. During the time of the exile, Nebuchadnezzar erects a gold statue of himself and commands all subjects to worship it. [...] Three Jewish officials – Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego – who had been taken to Babylon as youths along with Daniel, refuse to bow to the statue. [...] As they face being burned alive in a furnace, they communicate their faith as well as their resolve: “If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up." [...] In the later reign of Darius, Daniel’s refusal to give up private prayer to God and pray to the king instead results in him receiving a death sentence: being thrown into the lions’ den. [...] According to the Book of Daniel, an angel comes <b>and</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>the</b> mouths of the lions so that Daniel is spared and rescued by the king himself the following morning.|$|E
