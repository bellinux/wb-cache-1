5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned <b>and</b> <b>sucked</b> in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
25|$|During the 5000km journey across Africa {{through some}} of its most {{difficult}} country consisting of almost impenetrable rainforest and swamps, Stairs and colleagues suffered frequently from malaria and dysentery. Stairs had endurance, toughness and perseverance. He discovered one source of the Nile, the Semliki River, and became the first non-African to ever climb in the Ruwenzoris, reaching 10,677ft before having to turn around. He was seriously wounded in the chest by a poisonous arrow during an attack by natives, many of whom assumed they were a slave-raiding party, and the expedition killed hundreds in return. Stairs recovered from his wound to continue the journey. In Dublin, Ireland there is a bronze plaque depicting this 13 August 1887 event on the statue of expedition Surgeon Major Thomas Heazle Parke who removed the arrow <b>and</b> <b>sucked</b> the poison from the wound.|$|E

Both Rabbeth and the child died.|$|E

500|$|Another {{threat to}} Phelps' goal was Serbia's Milorad Čavić. In Athens 2004, Čavić was leading in a {{semifinal}} of the 100 metre butterfly, but right after his final turn, his suit {{opened at the}} neck <b>and</b> <b>sucked</b> in water, causing Čavić to finish last {{with a time of}} 53.12 seconds. At the 2008 European Championships, Čavić won the men's 50 metre butterfly and was the heavy favorite to win at twice that distance, but was suspended for wearing a [...] "Kosovo is Serbia" [...] T-shirt on the medal podium. American swimmer Gary Hall, Jr. told The New York Times that although [...] "Mike (Phelps) has been saying he’s going to win the 100 fly at the Olympics for the last year", he thought that Čavić would be the winner.|$|E
500|$|The adventurers {{evade the}} city's guardians, {{gain access to}} the temple, and find it filled with {{artifacts}} from many ancient civilizations, identifying the aliens as extra-dimensional [...] "archaeologists" [...] studying the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen alien beings, one missing its skull. Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton, whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. A portal to their dimension becomes activated, and the other remaining Soviets are drawn into the portal. As Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley–who has regained his sanity–escape, the thirteen beings fuse into one, and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge, Spalko is disintegrated <b>and</b> <b>sucked</b> into the portal. Mac is caught in the vortex while trying to scrounge some of the treasure, and even though Jones offers him his whip to pull him to safety, he willingly lets go and is sucked in. Jones and the others escape and watch as the city crumbles, revealing a flying saucer rising from under the ground and vanishing, while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.|$|E
500|$|This theme {{resonated}} with other {{visitors to the}} site. The American writer Edith Wharton visited in 1920 and highlighted what she saw as the contrast between [...] "two dominations {{look at each other}} across the valley", the ruins of Volubilis and [...] "the conical white town of Moulay Idriss, the Sacred City of Morocco". She saw the dead city as representing [...] "a system, an order, a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways." [...] In contrast, she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as [...] "more dead <b>and</b> <b>sucked</b> back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome." [...] As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it, Wharton saw Volubilis as a symbol of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism; the subtext is that [...] "in ransacking the Roman outpost, Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society". Fortunately for Morocco, [...] "the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition"—very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across. Hilaire Belloc, too, spoke of his impression being [...] "rather one of history and of contrast. Here you see how completely the new religion of Islam flooded and drowned the classical and Christian tradition." ...|$|E

500|$|The UK's Daily Telegraph {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, remarking, [...] "For {{the most part}} the action romps along, spurred by some impressive special effects," [...] adding, [...] "It's just slightly disappointing that, with the momentum having been established so effectively, we now have to wait until next year to enjoy the rest of the ride." [...] Roger Ebert awarded the first part three out of four stars, praising the cast and calling it [...] "a handsome and sometimes harrowing film [...] [...] [...] completely unintelligible for anyone coming to the series for the first time". Scott Bowles of USA Today called it, [...] "Menacing and meditative, Hallows is arguably the best instalment of the planned eight-film franchise, though audiences who haven't kept up with previous chapters will be hopelessly lost", while Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly likewise praised the film as [...] "the most cinematically rewarding chapter yet." [...] In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, Roger Moore proclaimed Part I as [...] "Alternately funny and touching, it's the best film in the series, an Empire Strikes Back for these wizards and their wizarding world. And those effects? They're so special you don't notice them." [...] Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek gave a negative review, writing, [...] "They've taken one of the most enchanting series in contemporary fiction <b>and</b> <b>sucked</b> out all the magic [...] [...] [...] while Rowling's stories are endlessly inventive, Potter onscreen just gives you a headache." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post found the film to be [...] "Beautifully shot but a soulless cash machine... delivers no dramatic payoff, no resolution and not much fun." ...|$|E

[...] Three of the four boats were successfully launched this way, {{and most of the}} crew were successfully evacuated, save only five men: [...] Captain Howes, the chief engineer, the second mate, steward Al Rahles, and seaman Denny. [...] As the boats were being launched, the crew saw a light from another ship, and desperately launched two distress rockets to ask for assistance. [...] As the evacuation was going on, a wave broke over the deck <b>and</b> <b>sucked</b> Quartermaster (the seaman who actually steers the ship) Shielderup into the now-exposed side wheel where he was horribly mangled. [...] At about 1:00a.m. on Monday morning, the ship seemed to be going down so they cut the line to the boats. [...] There was then no way off the Alaskan for the five men left on board.|$|E

2500|$|Striped hyenas are {{frequently}} referenced in Middle Eastern literature and folklore, typically {{as symbols of}} treachery and stupidity. In the Near and Middle East, striped hyenas are generally regarded as physical incarnations of jinns. Zakariya al-Qazwini (1204–1283) wrote in Arabic of a tribe of people called [...] "Hyena People". In his book Marvels of Creatures and the Strange Things Existing (...) , he wrote that should one of this tribe be {{in a group of}} 1000 people, a hyena could pick him out and eat him. A Persian medical treatise written in 1376 tells how to cure cannibalistic people known as kaftar who are said to be [...] "half-man, half-hyena". Al-Doumairy in his writings in Hawayan Al-Koubra (1406) wrote that striped hyenas were vampiric creatures that attacked people at night <b>and</b> <b>sucked</b> the blood from their necks. He also wrote that hyenas only attacked brave people. Arab folklore tells of how hyenas can mesmerise victims with their eyes or sometimes with their pheromones. Until the end of the 19th century, the Greeks believed that the bodies of werewolves, if not destroyed, would haunt battlefields as vampiric hyenas which drank the blood of dying soldiers. The image of striped hyenas in Afghanistan, India and Palestine is more varied. Though feared, striped hyenas were also symbolic for love and fertility, leading to numerous varieties of love medicine derived from hyena body parts. Among the Baloch people and in North India, witches or magicians are said to ride striped hyenas at night.|$|E
