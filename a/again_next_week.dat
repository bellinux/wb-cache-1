500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Morning After Pill" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great." [...] He {{thought that it was}} indicative of an overall upward trend in the quality of Veronica Mars and praised the episode's balance between the case-of-the-week and the Dean O'Dell story arc. [...] "Like last week's episode, 'There's Got to Be a Morning After Pill' benefited from integrating already established characters into a mystery of the week." [...] He was positive towards the mystery of the week in general, stating that it made him realize {{that it was possible to}} make good episodes with only a stand-alone mystery. However, he was critical of the development of Veronica and Logan's relationship, particularly Logan's new character traits. [...] "Let's just hope they don't get back together <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> or anytime soon, because this horse has been beaten to death as it is." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend was positive towards the episode, calling it [...] "jam-packed with drama". However, she stated that she would have enjoyed the episode more if Mac, Piz, Wallace, or Parker had made an appearance. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall enjoyed the pairing of Bonnie and her father, played by Chris Ellis.|$|E

6000|$|MY DEAR HODGSON,--I {{write to}} you a few lines on business. Murray has thought proper at his own risk, and peril, and profit (if there be any) to publish 'The Giaour'; and it may {{possibly}} come under your ordeal in the 'Monthly' [1] I merely wish to state that in the published copies there are additions {{to the amount of}} ten pages, text and margin (chiefly the last), which render it a little less unfinished (but more unintelligible) than before. If, therefore, you review it, let it be from the published copies and not from the first sketch. I shall not sail for this month, and shall be in town <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> when I shall be happy to hear from you but more glad to see you. You know I have no time or turn for correspondence(!). But you also know, I hope, that I am not the less ...|$|E

6000|$|... "According to {{your point}} of view, {{there is no doubt}} about it, Childee; but then there is equally no doubt the other way, {{according}} to the statements they put forward. But that is generally the way in all these land disputes. For good hard swearing your Hindoo cultivator can be matched against the world. Unfortunately there is nothing either in your grant or in your neighbors' that specifies unmistakably which of these ancient ditches is the one referred to. My present impression is that it is essentially a case for a compromise, but you know the final decision does not rest on me. I shall be out here <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> and I shall write to the Talookdar to meet me here, and we will go over the ground together again, and see if we cannot arrange some line that will be fair to both parties. If we can do that, the matter would be settled without expense and trouble; whereas, if it goes up to Lucknow it may all have to be gone into again; and if the decision is given against you, and as far as I can see it is just as likely to be one way as another, it will be a serious thing for the village." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song is an {{aggressive}} hard rock number that {{opens with a}} slower synthesizer based interlude before opening up into a full hard rock tune.
