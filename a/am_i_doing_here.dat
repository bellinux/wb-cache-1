500|$|Chatwin {{returned}} {{to the subject of}} art and objects during his career. In his early writing for the Sunday Times Magazine, he wrote about art and artists, and many of these articles Chatwin included in What <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Here.</b> The main focus of Utz is on the impact the possession of art (in this case porcelain figures) has on a collector. Utz's unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West. Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects. His distaste for the art world was the result of his days at Sotheby's, and some of his final writing focused on this. The final section of What <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Here,</b> [...] "Tales from the Art World," [...] consists of four short stories on this topic. At the end of What <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Here,</b> Chatwin shares an anecdote about advice he had received from Noël Coward, who told him [...] "Never let anything artistic stand in your way." [...] Chatwin stated, [...] "I've always acted on that advice." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Patagonia, Chatwin {{discovered}} a change in leadership at The Sunday Times Magazine and his retainer was not continued. Chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a nineteenth-century slave trader born in Brazil who became the Viceroy of Ouidah in Dahomey (present day Benin). Chatwin had first heard of de Sousa {{during a visit to}} Dahomey in 1972. He returned to the country, by then renamed the People's Republic of Benin, in December 1976 to conduct research. In January 1977, the 1977 Benin coup d'état attempt took place, and Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary, arrested, and detained for three days. Chatwin later wrote about this experience in [...] "A Coup—A Story," [...] which was published in Granta and included in What <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Doing</b> <b>Here</b> (1989).|$|E

40|$|I {{arrived in}} Paris in October 1994.

500|$|Mulholland Drive {{has been}} {{compared}} with Billy Wilder's film noir classic Sunset Boulevard (1950), another tale about broken dreams in Hollywood, and early in the film Rita is shown crossing Sunset Boulevard at night. Apart from both titles being named after iconic Los Angeles streets, Mulholland Drive is [...] "Lynch's unique account of what held Wilder's attention too: human putrefaction (a term Lynch used several times during his press conference at the New York Film Festival 2001) {{in a city of}} lethal illusions". The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. David Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, [...] "At night, you ride {{on the top of the}} world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but it's mysterious, and there's a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road." [...] Watts also had experience with the road before her career was established: [...] "I remember driving along the street many times sobbing my heart out in my car, going, 'What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> ...|$|E

2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down.

40|$|The {{roots of}} giant oak trees rose up to grab me, and the rocks seemed {{determined}} to block my path as I scrambled down the slippery, muddy trail {{to a little}} creek.

Why do they call it a walk? It is a strenuous hike…not just one, but day after day after day after day. On my own pilgrimage along the route, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> exhausted. My toes were crushing each other and every step was torture. Every tiny village was either at the bottom of a steep, craggy mountain or at the top of a hill. Either way, it was a daily scramble up or down. All the books, blogs, films, and friends who came before me didn’t prepare me for this. They call it “walking the Camino” but it is walking, hiking, climbing, scrambling, limping...|$|R

60|$|Then {{again when}} day {{declined}} she would quit the stream to sit before the blazing logs, {{staring at the}} flames. What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> she would murmur. And what is this my life? When I was at home in Devon I had a dream of Winchester, of Salisbury, or other great towns further away, where {{the men and women}} who are great in the land meet together, and where my eyes would perchance sometimes have the happiness to behold the king himself--my husband's close friend and companion. My waking has brought a different scene before me; this castle in the wilderness, a solitude where from an upper window I look upon leagues of forest, a haunt of wild animals. I see great birds soaring in the sky and listen to the shrill screams of kite and buzzard; and sometimes when lying awake on a still night the distant long howl of a wolf. Also, it is said, there are great stags, and roe-deer, and wild boars, and it is Athelwold's joy to hunt them and slay them with his spear. A joy too when he returns from the hunt or from a long absence to play with his beautiful wife--his caged bird of pretty feathers and a sweet song to soothe him when he is tired. But of his life at court he tells me little, and of even that little I doubt the truth. Then he leaves me and I am alone with his retainers--the crowd of serving men and women and the armed men to safeguard me. I am alone with my two friends which I have found, one out of doors, the other in--the river which runs at the bottom of the ground where I take my walks, and the fire I sit before. The two friends, companions, and lovers to whom all the secrets of my soul are confided. I love them, having no other in the world to love, and here I hold my hands before the flames until it is hot and then kiss the heat, and by the stream I kiss my wetted hands. And if I were to remain here until this life became unendurable I should consider as to which one of these two lovers I should give myself. This one I think is too ardent in his love--it would be terrible to be wrapped round in his fiery arms and feel his fiery mouth on mine. I should rather go to the other one to lie down on his pebbly bed, and give myself to him to hold me in his cool, shining arms and mix his green hair with my loosened hair. But my wish is to live and not die. Let me then wait a little longer; let me watch and listen, and perhaps some day, by and by, from his own lips, I shall capture the secret of this my caged solitary life.|$|E
