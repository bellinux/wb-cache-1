5|$|Since {{breeding}} Scamper was not {{an option}} for genetic inheritability, James spent several years researching the possibility of cloning. She chose ViaGen, an <b>animal</b> <b>genetics</b> corporation based in Austin, Texas, to perform the cloning procedure for $150,000. James registered the resulting colt born in 2006 with the American DNA Registry under the name Clayton, who is an identical genetic match to Scamper. James chose a surrogate mare to be the dam of the colt and receive the cloned embryo. At age two, James started Clayton as a breeding stallion. She offered his services to the public at a fee of $4,000. Clayton sired healthy progeny, many of whom have inherited Scamper's genetics. Of special note, the AQHA does not register cloned horses; however, breed registration is not required to compete in barrel racing or other PRCA and WPRA sanctioned rodeo events.|$|E

25|$|Since {{registration}} for the Gypsy Horse has only existed {{within the last}} 20 years, most associations require a genetic analysis for registration, to verify identity and identify future offspring. All of the North American Gypsy Horse and Drum Horse societies employ the <b>Animal</b> <b>Genetics</b> Research Laboratory of the University of Kentucky to perform DNA analysis and maintain a database of registered horses' DNA markers. UKY currently tests markers at 17 loci of a horse's genetic makeup. The aim of this analysis is to either exclude or fail to exclude another horse as a parent. In a spirit of co-operation, five American breed societies have jointly granted the University of Kentucky permission to employ DNA markers in confirming parentage. Since information regarding the past histories, including parentage, {{of many of the}} Gypsy Horses imported to North America was lost, many owners seek to reclaim the genetic roots of their animals, and services have sprung up to satisfy this desire.|$|E

In 1920 veterinarian and former administrator of the Northern Territory, Dr John Anderson Gilruth (1871-1937), toured Texas, USA which strengthened his conviction that [...] "vigorously controlled cattle breeding experiments in north Queensland would be wise". In 1929 a Joint Commission appointed to enquire into the beef cattle industry of northern Australia reported {{that there should be}} investigation of [...] "problems of <b>animal</b> <b>genetics</b> with the object of creating a new breed of tropical cattle". Subsequently, when preparing a research program for CSIR in north Queensland, Gilruth (acting chief of the division of animal health within CSIR) included a tropical cattle breeding project which was approved by CSIR council.
