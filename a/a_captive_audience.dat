40|$|Workplace <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> {{meetings}} are assemblies of employees during paid work {{time in which}} employers compel employees to listen to antiunion {{and other types of}} proselytizing. Employers enforce attendance at workplace <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> meetings by threats of discharge. Typically, employers deny employees the right to ask questions or express disagreement with the anti-union views presented during these mandatory meetings. Soon after the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) concluded that workplace <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> meetings discussing unionization are per se unlawful. However, the NLRB reversed course following the enactment of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Amendments to the NLRA, concluding that employer free speech rights immunize <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> meetings from regulation. This remains the NLRB 2 ̆ 7 s view. In this Article, I demonstrate that employers 2 ̆ 7 First Amendment free speech rights do not preclude <b>a</b> ban on <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> meetings. Instead, employees are a 2 ̆ 2 <b>captive</b> <b>audience</b> 2 ̆ 2 whom the Constitution protects from being force-fed the employer 2 ̆ 7 s religious and political ideology at the workplace.

50|$|Concludes {{that under}} the {{circumstances}} the prohibition against physically approaching in the 300-foot zone around the clinic withstands the Petitioners’ First Amendment constitutional challenge. This is because the Petitioners’ “counseling” of the clinic’s patients {{is a form of}} expression analogous to labor picketing. It is a mixture of content and communication. Just as the First Amendment of the Constitution protects the speaker’s right to offer “sidewalk counseling” to all passersby.

The dissent also feels that the injunction generally should be no more burdensome than necessary to provide complete relief.

Methods: Patients and visitors of an urban ED waiting room were randomized into one of the following groups: video, brochure, one-to-one teaching, combi-nation of these three methods, or control group. We administered a 13 -question multiple-choice test to assess stroke knowledge prior to, immediately after, and at 1 month post-education to patients and visitors in the ED waiting room. Results: Of 4 groups receiving education, all significantly improved their test scores immediately post intervention (test scores 9. 4 ± 2. 5 - 10. 3 ± 2. 0, P< 0. 01). At 1 month, the combination group retained the most knowledge (9. 4 ± 2. 4) exceed-ing pre-intervention and control scores (both 6. 7 ± 2. 6, P< 0. 01).
