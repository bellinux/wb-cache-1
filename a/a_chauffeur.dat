The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. He reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.|$|E
5|$|Many of Coffin's {{theories}} and principles {{can be seen}} in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat better luck with her investments and the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn. With the money from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and <b>a</b> <b>chauffeur</b> despite the general economic decline.|$|E
