Later in life, he founded and invested in numerous Atlanta-based science-related companies. Robinson was named an IEEE Fellow and held at least 39patents in fields including solar energy devices and <b>antenna</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some {{types of}} {{transmitting}} <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> in the VLF, LF, MF and lower SW range {{must have a}} good ground to operate efficiently. For example, a vertical monopole antenna requires a ground plane that often consists of an interconnected network of wires running radially away {{from the base of}} the antenna for a distance about equal to the height of the antenna. Sometimes a counterpoise is used as a ground plane, supported above the ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{target of}} the paper is to provide {{guidelines}} for indoor antenna selection for distributed <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> or radiating cable implementation. Distributed <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> is a commonly used <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> for indoor installations, and radiating cables are often used in tunnels, airplanes, or similar constricted areas. However, guidelines for optimizing WCDMA indoor network antenna configuration are lacking in the literature. Distributed <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> with variable amount of antennas is compared to radiating cable, and {{the behavior of the}} system is analyzed by a number of indicators. The results show that distributed <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> is a favorable solution compared to radiating cables. In addition, it can be concluded that the capacity of the network is not highly proportional to the number of antennas in distributed <b>antenna</b> <b>system,</b> but they affect more the coverage of the network.

30|$|The {{optimization}} {{framework is}} comprised by two parts. One is SZOA method {{and the other}} is microstrip <b>antenna</b> <b>system.</b> The former decides the parameter values for antenna size and shape and refines the fitness of parameter values in each iteration. The latter builds <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> based on given parameter values, simulates the working of <b>antenna</b> <b>system,</b> and evaluates the efficiency of the resulting antenna.|$|R
25|$|A {{common problem}} with <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> {{of this sort}} {{is that it is}} not {{possible}} to know if the signal is being received by the front or back of the antenna, which are equally sensitive. To address this, once a null was seen, the bearing operator turned on a sensing switch which connected a second antenna located slightly behind the main one. The mixed output of the two clearly indicated which side the target lay on, front or rear. However, this led to problems in the phasing systems that were never wholly cured.|$|E
25|$|With the Mk. X {{selected}} for deployment, the Mk. IX program was greatly reduced in priority, and additional concepts were considered. In particular, {{the concept of}} adapting the Mk. IX {{to work in the}} S-band at 3cm wavelengths was given long consideration, as this would provide even higher accuracy from the same <b>antenna</b> <b>systems,</b> or similar accuracy from smaller ones. EKCO began adapting the Mk. VIII equipment {{to be able to work}} at either 9 or 3cm, although at that time the 3cm magnetrons were capable of delivering only 50watts of power and this option never utilized.|$|E
25|$|Christmas Island, due to {{its close}} {{proximity}} to Australia's northern neighbours, falls within many of the satellite footprints throughout the region. This results in ideal conditions for receiving various Asian broadcasts, which locals sometimes prefer to those emanating from Western Australia. Additionally, ionospheric conditions are conducive to terrestrial radio transmissions, from HF through VHF and sometimes into UHF. The island plays home to a small array of radio equipment that spans {{a good chunk of}} the usable spectrum. Avariety of government owned and operated <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> are employed on the island to take advantage of this.|$|E
50|$|On {{the antenna}} pole were {{installed}} UHF TV <b>antenna</b> <b>system,</b> VHF TV <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> and VHF FM <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> which broadcast analog {{radio and television}} signal. The facility was primarily used by RTV Sarajevo (Radio Televizija Sarajevo) which broadcast four radio and three television programs until 1992 (TVSA, TVSA 2, TVSA 3; Radio Sarajevo 1, Sarajevo 202, Radio Sarajevo 2 and Radio Sarajevo 3).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> is {{presented}} {{which is designed}} and analyzed for the wireless communication systems using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology combined with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technique. The proposed planar <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> consists of two heterogeneous antenna elements integrated on the same substrate. The presented <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> works efficiently in the frequency range of 3. 1 – 10. 6 GHz. The parameters like reflection coefficient, gain, mutual coupling between the elements, correlation coefficients, diversity gain and total active reflection coefficient have been simulated to verify the functionality of the <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> having the dimensions of 30 × 85 mm 2...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a revolutionary}} method which overcomes {{many of the}} <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> {{analysis}} problems associated with UWB communication. By using this method, the <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> is analyzed {{from the viewpoint of}} antenna to antenna transfer function, which makes it possible to consider the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna as a complete unit rather than individual element. The refined formulation of transfer function in rational polynomial can identify the poles and zeros of <b>antenna</b> <b>system,</b> which also make it possible to devise the <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> together with filter circuit or signal processing so as to simplify the overall design of communication system...|$|R
25|$|Prior to the WAAS, the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) did {{not have}} the ability to provide lateral and {{vertical}} navigation for precision approaches for all users at all locations. The traditional system for precision approaches is the instrument landing system (ILS), which used a series of radio transmitters each broadcasting a single signal to the aircraft. This complex series of radios needs to be installed at every runway end, some offsite, along a line extended from the runway centerline, making the implementation of a precision approach both difficult and very expensive. The ILS system is composed of 180 different transmitting antennas at each point built. The newer system is free of huge <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> at each airport.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, several {{airlines}} {{are experimenting with}} base station and <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> installed on the airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing. Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration {{in the autumn of}} 2007. Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.|$|E
