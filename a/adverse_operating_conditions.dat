At high VIGV blade angles (lower weight flow and thrust levels), the fan stage was stalled over a major portion of its radius. In spite of the stall, fan blade stresses only exceeded the limits at the most extreme flow conditions. It was found that inlet flow separation does not necessarily lead to poor inlet performance or <b>adverse</b> fan <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Generally speaking, separated inlet flow did not adversely affect the fan blade stress levels. There were some cases, however, at high VIGV angles and high inlet angles-of-attack where excessive blade stress levels were encountered.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{computational}} method for accurate simulation of the nonlinear dynamic behavior of single- and multi-spool core engines, turbofan engines, and power generation gas turbine engines is presented. In order {{to perform the}} simulation, a modularly structured computer code has been developed which includes individual mathematical modules representing various engine components. The generic structure of the code enables the dynamic simulation of arbitrary engine configurations ranging from single-spool thrust generation to multi-spool thrust/power generation engines under <b>adverse</b> dynamic <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> For precise simulation of turbine and compressor components, row-by-row calculation procedures were implemented that account for the specific turbine and compressor cascade and blade geometry and characteristics. The dynamic behavior of the subject engine is calculated by solving a number of systems of partial differential equations, which describe the unsteady behavior of the individual components. In order to ensure the capability, accuracy, robustness, and reliability of the code, comprehensive critical performance assessment and validation tests were performed. As representatives, three different transient cases with single- and multi-spool thrust and power generation engines were simulated.

These <b>adverse</b> environmental <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> with time, could degrade the mechanical efficiency of the system and might lead to catastrophic failures. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the mechanical integrity of lead-free ball grid array (BGA) solder joints subjected to isothermal ageing at 150 and 175 °C, for up to 1, 000 h. Upon ageing at 150 °C the Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder alloy initially age-softened for up to 200 h. This behaviour was linked to the coarsening of grains. When aged beyond 200 h the shear strength was found to increase up to 400 h. This age-hardening was correlated with precipitation of hard Ag 3 Sn particles in Sn matrix. Further ageing resulted in gradual decrease in shear strength. This can be explained as the combined effect of precipitation coarsening and growth of intermetallic layer. Samples aged at 175 °C showed a similar behaviour with a reduced initial age-softening period and higher shear force values. Investigation of the fracture surfaces under a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) revealed that higher ageing temperature would expose the solder joints to brittle failures...|$|R

MSB magnitude results represent the nonlinear vibration responses, which are due to instable hydrodynamics, asperity excitations and nonlinear transfer paths, with two distinctive bifrequency patterns corresponding to instable lubrication and asperity interactions respectively. Using entropy measures, these instable lubrications are classified to be the low loads cases. Furthermore, average MSB magnitudes are used to differentiate the asperity interactions between asperity collisions and the asperity churns.

40|$|Digital {{control systems}} for {{applications}} such as aircraft avionics and multibody systems must maintain adequate control integrity in adverse as well as nominal <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> For example, control systems for advanced aircraft, and especially those with relaxed static stability, will be critical to flight and will, therefore, have very high reliability specifications which must be met regardless of <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> In addition, multibody systems such as robotic manipulators performing critical functions must have control systems capable of robust performance in any operating environment in order to complete the assigned task reliably. Severe <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> for electronic control systems can result from electromagnetic disturbances caused by lightning, high energy radio frequency (HERF) transmitters, and nuclear electromagnetic pulses (NEMP). For this reason, techniques must be developed to evaluate {{the integrity of the}} control system in <b>adverse</b> <b>operating</b> environments. The most difficult and illusive perturbations to computer-based control systems that can be caused by an electromagnetic environment (EME) are functional error modes that involve no component damage. These error modes are collectively known as upset, can occur simultaneously in all of the channels of a redundant control system, and are software dependent. Upset studies performed to date have not addressed the assessment of fault tolerant systems and do not involve the evaluation of a control system operating in a closed-loop with the plant. A methodology for performing a real-time simulation of the closed-loop dynamics of a fault tolerant control system with a simulated plant operating in an electromagnetically harsh environment is presented. In particular, considerations for performing upset tests on the controller are discussed. Some of these considerations are the generation and coupling of analog signals representative of electromagnetic disturbances to a control system under test, analog data acquisition, and digital data acquisition from fault tolerant systems. In addition, a case study of an upset test methodology for a fault tolerant electromagnetic aircraft engine control system is presented...|$|R

The 3 D asymmetric flow {{pattern in the}} volute, the fluid dynamics of rotor–stator interaction, the secondary flow, and the cavitation phenomenon induce large pressure fluctuations [4, 5]. Periodic pressure fluctuation may force the impeller or volute to vibrate, and resonance may occur when the frequency of pressure fluctuation approaches the natural frequency of pump components. The energy of pressure fluctuations propagates in fluids {{at the speed of}} sound, which is harmful and unacceptable to the pump and environment.

40|$|Understanding the {{velocity}} field information near the rotor plane of a wind turbine at various <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> {{is very important}} to understanding the aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine. Investigation of these flow fields has been an important area of study in experimental fluid dynamics for the last few decades. It is more convenient and cost effective to perform experiments with scaled-down model wind turbines rather than taking measurements around a full-scale model. Along with different experimental techniques, computational models to predict the performance of wind turbines have been developing. The basis of most of the commercially available codes is the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) method. However, the applicability and performance of these codes are often questionable at different <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to validate these codes with different wind turbine designs under a large variety of <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this research project, two-dimensional PIV measurements near the rotor plane of a three-bladed, horizontal axis model wind turbine were taken at six different <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and at 15 azimuthal angles. The results are presented in terms of axial induction factor. The radial distribution of axial induction factor at the rotor plane was compared to the results obtained from WT_Perf, a typical BEM method.

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} is {{very important}} for critical assets such as gearboxes used in the power and mining industries. Fluctuating <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> are inevitable for wind turbines and mining machines such as bucket wheel excavators and draglines due to the continuous uctuating wind speeds and variations in ground properties, respectively. Many of the classical condition monitoring techniques have proven to be ine ective under uctuating <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and therefore more sophisticated techniques have to be developed. However, many of the signal processing tools that are appropriate for uctuating <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> can be di cult to interpret, with the presence of incipient damage easily being overlooked. In this study, a cost-e ective diagnostic methodology is developed, using machine learning techniques, to diagnose the condition of the machine in the presence of uctuating <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> when only an acceleration signal, generated from a gearbox during normal operation, is available. The measured vibration signal is order tracked to preserve the angle-cyclostationary properties of the data. A robust tacholess order tracking methodology is proposed in this study using probabilistic approaches. The measured vibration signal is order tracked with the tacholess order tracking method (as opposed to computed order tracking), since this reduces the implementation and the running cost of the diagnostic methodology. Machine condition features, which are sensitive to changes in machine condition, are extracted from the order tracked vibration signal and processed. The machine condition features can be sensitive to <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> changes as well. This makes it difficult to ascertain whether the changes in the machine condition features are due to changes in machine condition (i. e. a developing fault) or changes in <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> This necessitates incorporating <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> information into the diagnostic methodology to ensure that the inferred condition of the machine is not adversely a ected by the uctuating <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> are not measured and therefore representative features are extracted and modelled with a hidden Markov model. The <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> machine learning model aims to infer the <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> state that was present during data acquisition from the <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> features at each angle increment. The <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> state information is used to optimise robust machine condition machine learning models, in the form of hidden Markov models. The information from the <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> and machine condition models are combined using a probabilistic approach to generate a discrepancy signal. This discrepancy signal represents the deviation of the current features from the expected behaviour of the features of a gearbox in a healthy condition. A second synchronous averaging process, an automatic alarm threshold for fault detection, a gear-pinion discrepancy distribution and a healthy-damaged decomposition of the discrepancy signal are proposed to provide an intuitive and robust representation of the condition of the gearbox under uctuating <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> This allows fault detection, localisation as well as trending to be performed on a gearbox during uctuating operation conditions. The proposed tacholess order tracking method is validated on seven datasets and the fault diagnostic methodology is validated on experimental as well as numerical data. Very promising results are obtained by the proposed tacholess order tracking method and by the diagnostic methodology. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.
