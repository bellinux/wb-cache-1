5|$|Proposals for the Ebbw Valley line, {{forecast}} to cost £27.2million, were unveiled to {{the public}} in January 2003. The scheme was to provide <b>an</b> <b>hourly</b> service to Cardiff beginning in 2005, followed by <b>an</b> <b>hourly</b> service to Newport beginning in 2009. The display included artists' impressions of the six new stations, envisaged to be built at Ebbw Vale Parkway Victoria, Llanhilleth, Newbridge, Crosskeys, Risca and Rogerstone. Proposed stations at Crumlin and Ebbw Vale Centre were shown in the Rail Atlas Great Britain and Ireland 11th edition, published 2007. The project was forecast to cost £28,583,544 in October2003.|$|E
5|$|Both WWV and WWVH {{announce}} the Coordinated Universal Time each minute, and make other recorded announcements {{of general interest}} on <b>an</b> <b>hourly</b> schedule, including the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather warnings. Since they share frequencies, WWV uses a male voice to distinguish itself from WWVH, which uses a female voice. WWV time signals can also be accessed by telephone.|$|E

5|$|Whilst the Campaign for Borders Rail {{acknowledged}} that the half-hourly weekday stopping service would be useful for commuters, it questions whether {{this is the best}} use of a line, which could carry other types of traffic.

5|$|The Hastings Diesels {{had almost}} {{completely}} replaced steam by June 1958. With {{the introduction of}} the Hastings Diesels, <b>an</b> <b>hourly</b> service was provided. This split at Tunbridge Wells, with the front portion running fast to Crowhurst and the rear portion stopping at all stations. The service ran every two hours on Sundays.

5|$|The reform's clearest {{effect was}} {{to reduce the}} {{proportion}} of Soviet industrial labour that was paid by piece-rate, and by August 1962, 60.5 percent of Soviet workers were paid by piece-rate, down from the 1956 level of 75 percent. Around half of those who remained on piece-rates would continue to receive some kind of bonus payment, but the progressive piece-rate bonuses were mostly eliminated, with only 0.5 percent of workers continuing to receive them in 1962. Workers who were taken off piece-rate payments were then paid <b>an</b> <b>hourly</b> rate or received a salary.|$|E
5|$|There is {{generally}} <b>an</b> <b>hourly</b> service to Sheringham (8minutes) and to Norwich (55minutes), with more frequent services {{during the morning}} and evening peak travel times. On Sundays, trains run every twohours to Sheringham and Norwich. In 1997 a single daily through train to and from London Liverpool Street to Sheringham via Cromer was introduced; it was not heavily used and the service was consequently discontinued. All of these services are run by diesel multiple units Class 153, 156 or occasionally 170.|$|E

5|$|Since the Reformation, {{the nave}} {{is that part}} of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the congregation and general public. There is also, usually in the nave, a raised pulpit from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for <b>an</b> <b>hourly</b> prayer to be said, for the benefit of visitors, and this is often presented from the nave pulpit. In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of the nave so that services might be held there for large congregations. At each place where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a Bible.|$|E

5|$|The airline {{was owned}} 40% by Nordic Air, 40% by the Municipality of Ørland and 20% by North Flying. All {{operations}} were flown by North Flying, who operate a 19-seat Fairchild Metro 23 in Air Norway livery. The municipality subsidised the route with NOK1 million per year.

5|$|The {{company was}} owned by NSB (34%), two {{individuals}} from Notodden, Gjermund Jamtveit and Halvor Grene (51%), Telemark County Municipality and some municipalities (15%). The trains would operate with a one-hour headway, twenty-four hours a day. It was the first private company allowed to operate passenger trains since the amalgamation of operations into the Norwegian State Railways. The concept was based on TIMEkspressen, <b>an</b> <b>hourly</b> coach service between Notodden and Oslo, that was operated by the Jamtveit and Grene-owned Øst-Telemark Automobilselskap. The company bought three used Y1 diesel railcars from SJ of Sweden, despite that the Bratsberg Line is electrified. The trains cost NOK6 million each, and have a capacity of 70 passengers.|$|E
