5|$|The Moon has an {{external}} magnetic field of about 1–100 nanoteslas, less than one-hundredth that of Earth. It does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization, probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was still operating. Alternatively, some of the remnant magnetization may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events through the expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud {{in the presence of}} an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the apparent location of the largest crustal magnetizations near the <b>antipodes</b> of the giant impact basins.|$|E

He then missed the start of the 1908–09 season and did not return to Cardiff until November. The club faced Australia on 28 December 1908, and handed the tourists the biggest defeat of their tour, 24–8, Williams providing two tries. Cardiff finished the season as Welsh Champions, Williams having scored 15 tries in 26 appearances, to Spiller's 16 in 27.|$|E

Although in most familiar examples of Hopf algebras the <b>antipode</b> has order 1 or 2, examples are known of infinite dimensional Hopf algebras in which the <b>antipode</b> has infinite order or arbitrary even order [1, 4, 6] and also of finite dimensional Hopf algebras in which the <b>antipode</b> has arbitrary even order [3, 5]. Some sufficient conditions for the <b>antipode</b> to have order ⩽ 4 are known [2, 4], but the following questions remain open: Does the <b>antipode</b> of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra necessarily have finite order? If the <b>antipode</b> S of a Hopf algebra H has finite order is that order bounded by some function of dim H?In this paper, by constructing a certain basis for an arbitrary pointed coalgebra and studying {{the action of the}} <b>antipode</b> on the elements of such a basis for a pointed Hopf algebra, we obtain affirmative answers to the second question in case H is pointed and to the first question in case H is pointed over a field of prime characteristic.

Using Schauenburg’s free Hopf algebra with a bijective <b>antipode</b> on a Hopf algebra and its “dual ” universal construction, we then show that one can even find examples of non-surjective (non-injective) epis (resp. monos) of Hopf algebras K → H such that the <b>antipode</b> of H (resp.

Most scientific treatises of classical antiquity (in Greek) were unavailable, leaving only simplified summaries and compilations.
