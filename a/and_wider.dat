5|$|A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States is a sociological {{study of}} the Wiccan <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> Pagan {{community}} in the Northeastern United States. It was written by American sociologist Helen A. Berger of the West Chester University of Pennsylvania and first published in 1999 by the University of South Carolina Press.

Back country skis are typically heavier <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> than classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better grip on hard snow; and their greater sidecut helps to carve turns.|$|E
5|$|By April 2009, {{construction}} {{had begun}} on South Australia's third uranium mine— the Honeymoon Uranium Mine. In October 2009, the Australian government was continuing {{to plan for}} a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory. However, there was opposition from indigenous people, the NT government, <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> NT community. In November 2009, about 100 anti-nuclear protesters assembled outside the Alice Springs parliamentary sittings, urging the Northern Territory Government not to approve a nearby uranium mine site.|$|E
5|$|MacPherson struts {{are used}} in the front suspension, and an unusual three-link De Dion tube/Watt's linkage is used in the rear. Front discs with {{anti-lock}} braking (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|E

5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> Pagan community. His espousal of right-wing ethnonationalist ideas and his insistence that Heathenry should be reserved for those of Northern European ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both Pagans and the mainstream media. Conversely, many on the extreme right of the Heathen movement have {{accused him of being}} a race traitor for his opposition to Neo-Nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism.|$|E
5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared {{was that}} it was a robust-looking shark, and may have had a similar build to the great white shark. The jaws may have been blunter <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> than the great white, and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It may have had a pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E
5|$|Organ {{builders}} {{began to}} lean towards specifications with fewer mixtures and high-pitched stops. They preferred {{to use more}} 8 and 16 stops in their specifications <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> pipe scales. These practices created a warmer, richer sound than was common in the 18th century. Organs began {{to be built in}} concert halls (such as the organ at the Palais du Trocadéro in Paris), and composers such as Camille Saint-Saëns and Gustav Mahler used the organ in their orchestral works.|$|E

40|$|Alimentary tract {{morphology}} and {{its relationship}} with diet was examined in three coral reef fish families: Labridae, Chaetodontidae and Pomacentridae. Convergent patterns of dietary‐related morphological variation were evident across the three families, with corallivores possessing long and narrow intestines, carnivores relatively short <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> intestines <b>and</b> herbivores relatively long <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> intestines. Between‐family differences were also evident: chaetodontids typically possessed long and narrow intestines, pomacentrids long <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> intestines <b>and</b> labrids generally possessed short <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> intestines. Overall, intestinal length variation was most strongly attributable to diet, whilst intestinal diameter varied most widely among families. Relative intestinal length appears as a useful predictor of dietary variation, particularly within families. Relative intestinal diameter appears as a less reliable measure, but rather, a useful adjunct to intestinal length comparisons...|$|R

5|$|The {{symposium}} in the Macedonian <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> Greek realm was {{a banquet}} for the nobility and privileged class, {{an occasion for}} feasting, drinking, entertainment, and sometimes philosophical discussion. The hetairoi, leading members of the Macedonian aristocracy, were expected to attend such feasts with their king. They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of game meat {{as well as for}} sport.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Badami Chalukyan temples {{featured}} in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its importance <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> use. Recently however, scholars {{have returned to}} the modern Karnataka region to focus on a longer chronology, investigating a larger geographical area, making detailed studies of epigraphs and giving more importance to individual monuments dating from the 11th through 13th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Among lemurs, the toothcomb is {{variable}} in structure. Among indriids (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent {{and consists of}} four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust <b>and</b> <b>wider,</b> with shorter incisors, wider spaces between the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader apical ridge. It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or one pair of incisors and one pair of canines. In fork-marked lemurs (Phaner) the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous apical ridge. In the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) and sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration {{in the front of}} the mouth. The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the incisors of rodents.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} the {{national}} capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal {{in the same league}} as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade {{is home to}} many ethnicities {{from all}} over the former Yugoslavia <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> Balkans region. The main ethnic groups are: Serbs (1,505,448), Roma (27,325), Montenegrins (9,902), Yugoslavs (8,061), Croats (7,752), Macedonians (6,970), and Muslims by {{nationality}} (3,996). Many people came to the city as economic migrants from smaller towns and the countryside, while tens of thousands arrived as refugees from Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, {{as a result of the}} Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. Between 10,000 and 20,000 Chinese are estimated to live in Belgrade; they began immigrating in the mid-1990s. Block 70 in New Belgrade is known colloquially as the Chinese quarter. Many Middle Easterners, mainly from Syria, Iran, Jordan and Iraq, arrived in order to pursue their studies during the 1970s and 1980s, and have remained in the city.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the quake}} {{a program of}} {{rebuilding}} was rapidly put into action, but before it began in earnest some important decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town planning, decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> main streets, often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of Grammichele represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.|$|E
5|$|Fossil (or subfossil) black {{vultures}} cannot {{necessarily be}} attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea) which constituted the nominate subspecies C. o. occidentalis. The southern birds were of the same size as present-day north black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known. As the Pleistocene and current black vultures form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages, some include the Pleistocene taxa in C. atratus.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1726 Sheffield's Company of Cutlers sought {{parliamentary}} {{approval to}} make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, {{on the edge of}} Sheffield. Terminating at Tinsley placated the Duke of Norfolk, who represented the opposition from Sheffield, {{and a great deal of}} work had been done to reduce the opposition from landowners. The Act of Parliament was passed on 6 May 1726 giving the Cutlers powers to make cuts and {{to make the}} river deeper <b>and</b> <b>wider</b> so that boats of 20 tonnes could reach Tinsley. There were a number of restrictions, intended to protect existing water-powered installations. Lord Frederick Howard's mills at Rotherham, Kilnhurst forge, Thrybergh dam and Sprotborough mills and water engine were specifically mentioned.|$|E
