5|$|When Karajan was in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so {{he added}} Falstaff to the {{repertoire}} of his opera company at Aachen in 1941, and he remained {{a proponent of}} the work {{for the rest of}} his career, presenting it frequently in Vienna, Salzburg and elsewhere, and making audio and video recordings of it. Solti also became closely associated with Falstaff, as did Carlo Maria Giulini; they both conducted many performances of the work in mainland Europe, Britain and the US and made several recordings. Leonard Bernstein conducted the work at the Met and the Vienna State Opera, and on record. The advocacy of these and later conductors has given the work an assured place in the modern repertoire.|$|E

25|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia on the Ides of March, in total contravention of the Munich Agreement that had been signed {{less than six months}} before, infuriated British and French public opinion and lost Germany all sympathy. Such was the state of public fury that it appeared possible for several days afterwards that the Chamberlain government might fall due to a backbench rebellion. Even Ribbentrop's standard line that Germany was only reacting to an unjust Versailles treaty, and really only wanted peace with everyone, which had worked so well in the past, failed to carry weight. Reflecting the changed mood, the Conservative M.P Alfred Duff Cooper {{wrote in a letter to}} The Times:"Some of us are getting rather tired of the sanctimonious attitude which seeks to take upon our shoulders the blame for every crime committed in Europe. If Germany had been left stronger in 1919 she would sooner have been in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what she is doing today". Moreover, the British government had genuinely believed in the German claim that it was only the Sudetenland that concerned them, and that Germany was not seeking to dominate Europe. By occupying the Czech parts of Czecho-Slovakia, Germany lost all credibility with its claim to be only righting the alleged wrongs of Versailles.|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, the two {{variations}} of RAD may develop {{from the same}} inability to develop [...] "stranger-wariness" [...] due to inadequate care. Appropriate fear responses may {{only be able to}} develop after an infant has first begun to form a selective attachment. An infant who is not in <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this cannot afford not to show interest in any person as they may be potential attachment figures. Faced with a swift succession of carers the child may have no opportunity to form a selective attachment until the possible biologically-determined sensitive period for developing stranger-wariness has passed. It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.|$|E

Instead, Lawrence set aside a room in his attic for Etty to copy from his pictures, and agreed to answer Etty's questions {{when he was in}} <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Etty found the experience of trying to copy Lawrence's work extremely frustrating, and in his own words [...] "was ready to run away", but he persisted and eventually taught himself to copy Lawrence's work very closely.

50|$|The officially {{quoted rate}} is a spot price.
