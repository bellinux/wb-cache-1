A 2003 study from Cornell University found that cocoa contains {{large amounts of}} antioxidants that may help prevent cancer. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> has been demonstrated that the cocoa bean helps with digestion.

5|$|Despite many {{sightings}} and {{a seemingly}} large and diverse distribution, wood turtle numbers are in decline. A {{large number of}} deaths caused by humans result from: habitat destruction, farming accidents, and road traffic. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> is commonly collected illegally for the international pet trade. These combined threats have caused many areas where they live to enact laws protecting it. Despite legislation, enforcement of the laws and education of the public regarding the species are minimal.|$|E
5|$|The {{incomplete}} combustion {{of fossil}} fuels (such as diesel) and wood releases black carbon into the air. Though black carbon, most of which is soot, is an extremely small component of air pollution at land surface levels, the phenomenon has a significant heating effect on the atmosphere at altitudes above two kilometers (6,562ft). <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> dims {{the surface of the}} ocean by absorbing solar radiation.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock art has been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and it was not sought after as prey. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> was not a serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and it lacked the impressiveness of the mammoth or woolly rhino.|$|E
5|$|When {{combined}} with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, {{and with the}} addition of sulfur <b>also</b> <b>it</b> forms antibiotics, amino acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.|$|E

5|$|Among Harrison's post-Beatles solo releases, Extra Texture is {{the only}} album on which his lyrics are devoid of any obvious spiritual message. Uniquely <b>also,</b> <b>it</b> was {{recorded}} mostly in America rather than England, while Harrison was working in Los Angeles {{in his role as}} head of Dark Horse Records. Gary Wright, David Foster, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis, Leon Russell, Tom Scott, Billy Preston and Jim Horn were among the many contributing musicians. The keyboard-heavy arrangements incorporate elements of soul music and the influence of Smokey Robinson, signalling a further departure from the rock and folk-rock sound of Harrison's popular early-1970s work. Contrasting with the musical content, the album's art design conveys an upbeat mood and includes an unusual die-cut cover with a textured surface.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, the Planning Office for Oslo Central Station, led by Fin Hvoslef, was {{established}} by the government. In 1950, they presented a new report, which recommended that a new route for the tunnel be considered, to ease construction and increase safety. This was in part based on an engineering report from 1949, which had made the first detailed plans for the line.

5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> has been said that Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|John's father {{augmented}} the family's {{position by}} exploiting the favour of the King, Henry VI, {{to whom he}} was an important councillor in the 1440s. Already Earl of Suffolk, John's father was in turn elevated to a marquess (in 1444) and then Duke of Suffolk (1448), and with these titles received major grants from the crown. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> had been his father's receipt of the wardship of Margaret Beaufort from the king that enabled John's marriage to her, whilst both were still infants and despite them being within the prohibted degrees of consanguinity. Contemporaries claimed that the marriage to the daughter of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset (cousin of the-then childless king) was intended to make John de la Pole an eventual heir to the crown; this is considered unlikely by modern historians, who have pointed at indications that the King supported William in these plans. It {{has suggested that the}} marriage was the direct result of Willim's political difficulties during the 1450-1 parliament.|$|E

5|$|Much of our {{evidence}} for 4th century army unit deployments {{is contained in}} a single document, the Notitia Dignitatum, compiled c. 395–420, a manual of all late Roman public offices, military and civil. The main deficiency with the Notitia is that it lacks any personnel figures so as to render estimates of army size impossible. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> was compiled {{at the very end}} of the 4th century; it is thus difficult to reconstruct the position earlier. However, the Notitia remains the central source on the late Army's structure due to the dearth of other evidence. The Notitia also suffers from significant lacunae and numerous errors accumulated from centuries of copying.|$|E
5|$|Nobel-laureate William Vickrey is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the father of congestion pricing, as he first proposed it for the New York City Subway system in 1952. In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by Maurice Allais, Gabriel Roth who was instrumental in the first designs and upon whose World Bank recommendation the first system was put in place in Singapore. <b>Also,</b> <b>it</b> was considered by the Smeed Report, published by the British Ministry of Transport in 1964, but its recommendations were rejected by successive British governments.|$|E

Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population’s poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.|$|E
