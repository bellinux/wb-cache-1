Then all the lines which are common tangents to both P=0 and Q=0 are tangent to C. So, by the AF+BG theorem, the tangential equation of C has the form HP+KQ=0. Since <b>C</b> has <b>class</b> <b>m,</b> H must be a constant and K but have degree {{less than or equal to}} m−2. The case H=0 can be eliminated as degenerate, so the tangential equation of C can be written as P+fQ=0 where f is an arbitrary polynomial of degree m−2.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{theory of}} codes is a fertile {{area at the}} {{intersection}} of formal language theory, error detection and correction, data compression and data security [6]. Theoretical research into codes is often interested with combinatorial properties of formal languages related to codes. In particular, there has been substantial recent interest in classes of codes defined by certain "finite subset" conditions. In general, given <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>C</b> of codes and m 0, we may define <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>C</b> <b>m</b> as follows: L 2 C m () (L ` L; jL j m) L 2 C) : Thus, for instance, a language L is an n-code if every language L ` L of size at most n is a code [5]. Also studied are n-prefix-suffix codes [3], n-infix-outfix codes [8, 9, 7], n-intercodes [6, p. 555] and others. A general framework for defining such "finite subset" classes of languages is given, e. g., by Jurgensen and Konstantinidis [6, pp. 565 [...] 567]. Decidability problems for such classes of languages appear to be very difficult. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{convenient}} {{setting for}} quasianalytic Denjoy-Carleman differentiable mappings. (English summary) J. Funct. Anal. 261 (2011), no. 7, 1799 – 1834. Given a sequence M: = {Mk} {{and an open}} set U ⊂ R n, the Denjoy-Carleman <b>class</b> <b>C</b> <b>M</b> (U) is defined to be the set of all f ∈ C ∞ (U) such that for every compact set K ⊂ U, | ∂ α f | ≤ Cρ |α | |α|!M |α|, ∀α ∈ N n and all x ∈ K, for some constants C and ρ. When Mk = 1, ∀k, C M (U) coincides with C ω (U), the class of real-analytic functions on U. Under some mild conditions on <b>M,</b> the <b>classes</b> of Denjoy-Carleman differentiable functions are wider than the real-analytic <b>class.</b> <b>A</b> <b>class</b> <b>C</b> <b>M</b> (U) is called a quasianalytic <b>class</b> if, like <b>C</b> ω (U), it does not contain any nonzero flat function. A function f ∈ C ω (R n) {{if and only if}} f ∈ C ∞ and the restriction f | L ∈ C ω for every line segment L in R n. In this sense the restrictions of C ∞ functions to curves are ‘convenient settings’ for C ω. This is no longer true for functions that are not infinitely differentiable. For example, there are discontinuous functions f: R 2 → R that are arc-analytic, i. e., analytic on every analytic arc [E...|$|R
