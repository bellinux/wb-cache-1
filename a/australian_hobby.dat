5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of territoriality, as birds in the Wheatbelt maintain territories year-round there. The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle, square-tailed kite and <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby.</b> The species has been observed bathing by shaking its wings in water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.|$|E
5|$|The pied butcherbird often perches on a fencepost, stump or branch while {{foraging}} for prey. It generally pounces on victims on {{the ground}} and eats them there. At times, it may hop or run along hunting ground-based food, and occasionally seize flying insects. It generally forages alone, or occasionally in pairs. The pied butcherbird has been observed hunting collaboratively with the <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby,</b> either picking off common starlings or rufous-throated honeyeaters disturbed by the larger hobby, or flushing out small birds from bushes, which the larger bird then hunts. The pied butcherbird sometimes stores food items by impaling them on a stick or on barbed wire, or shoving them in a nook or crevice.|$|E
5|$|Birds forage singly or {{in pairs}} in summer, {{and more often}} in larger flocks in autumn and winter, during which time {{they are more likely}} to loiter around people and urban areas. They {{occasionally}} associate with Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) or common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (S.versicolor) and satin bowerbirds (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby</b> (Falco longipennis), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) nestlings became silent when they heard the recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.|$|E

50|$|The hobby is a {{widespread}} and common hunter that often hunts at dusk, diurnally and sometimes nocturnally by artificial light. Hobbys have been witnessed catching their prey in mid air, by direct attack from a perch or in fast contour-flying above or between tree canopies. It is acrobatic {{in the pursuit of}} prey and attacks fleeing birds in a series of short shallow stoops. They have also been recorded using a concealed approach when attacking shorebird roosts, flying towards them behind the cover of dunes, cliffs or trees. Hobbys have been known to harass larger birds but are not capable of killing them. Research has shown that <b>Australian</b> <b>hobbys</b> have one of the lowest prey to predator ratios (i.e. smaller prey relative to their body mass) because of the large number of insects in their diet.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby</b> is {{not listed}} as a {{threatened}} species within Australia and is {{listed as a}} species of least concern on International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List. It is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled.Since dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was introduced to agriculture in 1946, egg shell thickness of some species of falcon including the <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby,</b> was significantly reduced. This led to some decline in local populations through egg breakage during incubation but did not eventuate in widespread population declines for the <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby.</b> [...] ). Hobbys are susceptible to the columbid herpesvirus-1 (CoHV-1) infection which causes death by massive splenic and hepatic necrosis. The cause of infection is often attributed to the consumption of rock pigeons (Columbia livia) which carry the disease.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby</b> (Falco longipennis), {{also known}} as the little falcon, is one of six Australian members of the family Falconidae. This predominately diurnal bird of prey derives its name ‘longipennis’ from its long primary wing feathers. It occurs {{throughout}} Australia and other neighbouring countries with migrating individuals found on the islands of Indonesia and New Guinea ...|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{than other}} falcons, the <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby</b> is {{relatively}} slender and long winged. Its plumage varies in colour depending on sex, age and environment with a darker form in humid areas and a lighter form in drier environments. Generally the hobby displays a black cap and mask with a whitish forehead and half-collar. Underparts can be blue-grey or rufous and streaked darker. The cere in adults is a pale yellowish grey, the eye ring is pale blue, {{the eyes are}} brown and the feet are dull yellow. Females are larger in size between 34 - 35.5 cm and males are generally between 30 - 32 cm in length with a wing span between 66 - 87 cm. The <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby</b> is easily confused with the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) however the hobby is more slender, with longer and thinner wings, and is a less powerful flyer.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby</b> {{has been}} {{recorded}} preying on avian species including the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis). Research suggests they tend to avoid large, dangerous, or agile species that forage close to cover, such as the common myna (Acridotheres tristis). Insectivorous bats [...] and insects including beetles, cicadas, crickets and grasshoppers also form part of the hobby's diet.|$|E
50|$|The chestnut-crowned babbler {{lives in}} open environments and is {{vulnerable}} to predation by aerial predators. Groups {{are more likely to}} be attacked by avian predators when dependent young are present, whilst large groups are more likely to encounter predators but less likely to be attacked. Potential avian predators include the brown falcon (Falco berigora), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby</b> (Falco longipennis), brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) and collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrhocephalus). All of these species are known to elicit pronounced alarm calls from chestnut-crowned babblers when they fly in close proximity to the group.|$|E
50|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} on competition and predation however the pied honeyeater is sometimes harassed in tree canopies by white-plumed honeyeaters (Lichenostomus penicillatus) and yellow-throated miners (Manorina flauigula) (Shelly et al. 2008).

50|$|The Pilbara {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of endemic species adapted to this tough environment. There is a high {{diversity}} of invertebrates, including hundreds of species of subterranean fauna (both stygofauna and troglofauna), which are microscopic invertebrates that live underground in the caves, vugs or groundwater aquifers of the region and terrestrial fauna (see short-range endemic invertebrates). The Pilbara olive python, the western pebble-mound mouse, and the Pilbara ningaui of the Hamersley Range are among the many species of animals within the fragile ecosystems of this desert ecoregion.

5000|$|Research {{undertaken}} {{comparing the}} vocalisations of Australian falcons, found that two structurally distinct calls were emitted when a male hobby was restrained. This included a wide band harmonic vocalisation and a trill-type vocalisation. The trill-type vocalisation was given sporadically upon initial handling and harmonic vocalisation was assessed {{as the most}} common call of the species being used in situations of territorial defence and mobbing. [...] Observations of hobbys during breeding identified that two main calls were used by adults. One was a rapid peevish chatter Kee-Kee-Kee-Kee-Kee which was given by the male as he brought prey to the nest area and was given by both sexes in alarm, when mobbing other predatory birds and when selecting and defending the nest. The second call resembled a squeaky chittering and ticking {{which appears to be}} used in a social dominance and food possession or food begging context. Juveniles were observed calling in an unslurred chittering whine when begging for food and in a chattering kee-kee-kee… when alarmed, or excited, from the feathering stage.Calls by the <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby</b> are similar, but higher pitched, to the male peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) when arriving at the nest with food. The hobby is also described as having similar ‘alarm’ and contact calls to the Australian kestrel (Falco cenchroides).|$|E
50|$|The estuarine {{end of the}} Kalgan River is good {{fishing for}} many species {{including}} black bream with a few skippy, herring, mulloway and whiting.The Kalgan River is renowned as being an excellent place to fish for bream {{and some of the}} State's largest bream have been caught in the river.Smaller freshwater species that {{can be found in the}} Kalgan River include the western galaxias (Galaxias occidentalis), the common jollytail (Galaxias maculatus), the mud minnow (Galaxiella munda), Balston's pygmy perch (Nannatherina balston), Nightfish (Bostockia porosa) and the western pygmy perch (Edelia vittata).The river is home to a large population of birds. In the estuarine part of the river, species such as the Australian pelican, little black cormorant, pied cormorant, pied oystercatcher, black-winged stilt, common sandpiper, Australian white ibis, straw-necked ibis, yellow-billed spoonbill, Pacific gull and Caspian tern can often be seen.The freshwater parts of the river also support an enormous variety of birds including nankeen kestrel, <b>Australian</b> <b>hobby,</b> wedge-tailed eagle, short-billed black cockatoo, long-billed black cockatoo, galah, little corella, purple-crowned lorikeet, red-capped parrot, laughing kookaburra, willie wagtail, white-breasted robin, splendid fairywren, New Holland honeyeater, red wattlebird and red-eared firetail.Amphibious species that can be commonly be found in and around the river are frogs, such as the western banjo and moaning frogs.Reptiles frequently found in the area include tiger snakes and dugites.|$|E
40|$|The {{breeding}} diets of four diurnal raptor {{species were}} studied, by analysis of pellets, prey remains, stomach flushes of trapped birds and feeding observations, in the Top End of the Northern Territory {{and in the}} Kimberley region (northern Western Australia) in 1988 - 89. These were the Black-breasted Buzzard Hamirostra melanosternon, Brown Goshawk Accipiter fasciatus, Little Eagle Hieraaetus morphnoides and <b>Australian</b> <b>Hobby</b> Falco longipennis. The Buzzard and Brown Goshawk were vertebrate generalists (mammals, birds and reptiles), the former also taking birds&# 039; eggs, and the latter also taking many invertebrates. The Little Eagle took mostly birds, with few reptiles and even fewer mammals. The Hobby took small birds and flying insects. This study complements another, concurrent study of the raptor community in the Top End, by characterising the feeding niches of an additional four diurnal species out of the ten now studied in some detail. The remaining 14 species (of the 24 {{that make up the}} diurnal raptor assemblage in northern mainland Australia) require further attention in the tropics...|$|E
