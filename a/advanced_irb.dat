40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{methodology}} to estimate loss given default (LGD) and apply it to a set of micro-data of loans to SME and corporations of an anonymous commercial bank from Central Europe. LGD estimates are important inputs in the pricing of credit risk and the measurement of bank profitability and solvency. Basel II <b>Advance</b> <b>IRB</b> Approach requires internally estimates of LGD to calculate risk-weighted assets and to estimate expected loss. We analyse the recovery rate dynamically over time and identify the efficient recovery period of a workout department. Moreover, we focus on the appropriate choice of a discount factor by introducing risk premium based on a risk level of collaterals. We apply statistical methods to estimate LGD and test empirically its determinants. Particularly, we analyse generalised linear models using symmetric logit and asymmetric log-log link functions for ordinal responses as well as for fractional responses. For fractional responses we employ two alternatives, a beta inflated distribution and a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator. We find out that the main drivers of LGD are a relative value of collateral, a loan size as well as a year of the loan origination. Different models provided similar results. As for the different links in more complex models, log-log models in some cases perform better, implying an asymmetric response of the dependent variable. credit risk, bank loan, loss given default, LGD, recovery rate, fractional responses, ordinal regression, quasi-maximum likelihood estimator...|$|R

40|$|Using {{data from}} three {{countries}} (U. S., Italy and Australia) and surveying related studies from several {{other countries in}} Europe, we investigate {{the effects of the}} New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II) on bank capital requirements for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). For each country, we analyze different possibilities that banking organizations have in considering SMEs, as either retail or as corporate, with a special discount linked to the firm’s sales size. We find, for all the countries, banks will have significant benefits, in terms of lower capital requirements, when considering small and medium sized firms as retail customers. But they will be obliged to use the <b>Advanced</b> <b>IRB</b> approach (providing their own estimates of probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) for each counterparty) and to manage them on a pooled basis. For SMEs as corporate, however, the results show that capital requirements will be slightly greater than under the existing Basel I Capital Accord. We believe that most eligible banks will use a blended approach (considering some SMEs as retail and some as corporate). Through a breakeven analysis, we find that for all of our countries, banking organizations will be obliged to classify as retail at least 20 % of their SME portfolio in order to, at a minimum, maintain the current capital requirement (8 %). Moreover, we show that the percentage of SMEs to be classified as retail increases to at least 40 % if banks will want to enjoy lower capital requirements by implementing the <b>Advanced</b> <b>IRB</b> instead of the Standardized approach. Since one of the main goals of the new Basel Capital Accord is to improve the efficiency of banks risk management systems, we conclude that a likely impact will be an additional motivation for banks to consider and manage their SMEs clients as retail customers. ...|$|E

Empirical results are presented by using a comprehensive database of trading prices and workout recoveries of both distressed bonds and loans. We find that discount rates vary significantly by initial issuer ratings, whether or not the industry is in stress at the time of default, relative seniority to other debt and instrument type. The conclusions are found to be robust to potentially confounding determinants of discount rate.

According to Basel II, {{it is necessary to}} calculate LGD to evaluate credit risk in <b>IRB</b> <b>Advanced</b> approach. Selecting a sample of 9. 557 non-retail credit operations, we calculate their LGD based on the opportunity cost incurred during the default period and on the principal loss. Other recovery costs were not taken into account. According to the results, the empirical probability distribution of LGD is bimodal, ranging on average between 47 % and 92 %. Using a Tobit model, we verified that variables related to economic activity level, collateral, exposure size and renegotiation influenced LGD behavior. Results were similar to Dermine and Carvalho (2006), Asarnow and Edwards (1995), Schuermann (2004) and Hurt and Felsovalyi (1998). ...|$|R

To keep the effort of collecting and processing data as small as possible, results from academic studies could provide essential insights for identifying the important factors influencing the recovery rate.

These results cannot be, or can only to a limited extent, transferred to Germany because of differences in the collateral and in the legal systems.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{question}} whether the risk weights in the <b>advanced</b> (<b>IRB)</b> approach of the Basel 2 regulation are appropriate, on a strictly theoretical ground. The major {{concern is that the}} model behind the regulation considers defaults only {{at the end of the}} time horizon for which capital is to be held - whereas defaults in the whole time interval should be taken into consideration. This latter approach is represented by a model that is different from the Basel model. It follows, as I show, that the Basel model should be viewed just as a technical tool to turn the expected value of the unconditional loss distribution into a given percentile of the same distribution - making use of conditional (on the systemic factor) default probabilities - and should not be interpreted as describing even 'virtual' firms and asset values. More importantly, I also show that a logical step in the theoretical foundation of the model is missing which raises the {{question whether the}} risk weights calculated with the model are indeed appropriate. Due to difficulties in the calculation in the alternative approach of the percentiles of the loss distribution no clean-cut answer is given in this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|No. This paper {{develops}} a simple equilibrium {{model of a}} bank that benefits from subsidized insured deposits and endogenously selects the characteristics of its credit risk exposure. The model is {{used to analyze the}} traits of a bank’s optimal loan portfolio under the regulatory capital requirements of the 1988 Basle Accord and the alternative regulatory capital rules proposed in the New Basel Accord (NBA) Consultative Document. The analysis shows that, while the proposed changes reduce the value of the deposit insurance subsidy relative to levels attainable under the 1988 Accord, the proposals create unintended consequences that are not aligned with regulatory interests. For example, banks using either of the proposed Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approaches will face incentives to construct loan portfolios that generate large losses should a bank default. Such incentives are at odds with the objective of least cost resolution mandated in FDICIA. Moreover, because they create conditions that will foster the development of stable banking clienteles in which banks using the <b>Advanced</b> <b>IRB</b> approach will choose to hold the safest loan portfolios and banks using the Standardized approach the riskiest portfolios, the proposals abandon the objective of establishing “a level playing field. ” The NBA capital proposals do not encourage diversification across the business cycle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The New Basel Accord {{will allow}} internationally active banking {{organizations}} to calculate their credit risk capital requirements using an internal ratings based (IRB) approach, subject to supervisory review. One of the modeling components is loss given default (LGD), the credit loss incurred if an obligor {{of the bank}} defaults. The flexibility to determine LGD values tailored to a bank’s portfolio will likely be a motivation for a bank to want {{to move from the}} foundation to the <b>advanced</b> <b>IRB</b> approach. The appropriate degree of flexibility depends, of course, on what a bank knows about LGD broadly and about differentiated LGDs in particular; consequently supervisors must be able to evaluate “what a bank knows. ” The key issues around LGD are: 1) What does LGD mean and what is its role in IRB? 2) How is LGD defined and measured? 3) What drives differences in LGD? 4) What approaches can be taken to model or estimate LGD? By surveying the academic and practitioner literature, with supportive examples and illustrations from public data sources, this paper is designed to provides basic answers to these questions. The factors which drive significant differences in LGD include place in the capital structure, presence and quality of collateral, industry and timing of the business cycle...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we develop a {{theoretical}} model for ultimate loss-given default in the Merton (1974) structural credit risk model framework, deriving compound option formulae to model differential seniority of instruments, and incorporating an optimal foreclosure threshold. We consider an extension that allows for an independent recovery rate process, representing undiversifiable recovery risk, having a stochastic drift. The comparative statics of this model are analyzed and compared and in the empirical exercise, we calibrate the models to observed LGDs on bonds and loans having both trading prices at default and at resolution of default, utilizing an extensive sample of losses on defaulted firms (Moody’s Ultimate Recovery Database™), 800 defaults in the period 1987 - 2008 that are largely representative of the U. S. large corporate loss experience, for which we have the complete capital structures and can track the recoveries on all instruments {{from the time of}} default to the time of resolution. We find that parameter estimates vary significantly across recovery segments, that the estimated volatilities of recovery rates and of their drifts are increasing in seniority (bank loans versus bonds). We also find that the component of total recovery volatility attributable to the LGD-side (as opposed to the PD-side) systematic factor is greater for higher ranked instruments and that more senior instruments have lower default risk, higher recovery rate return and volatility, as well as greater correlation between PD and LGD. Analyzing the implications of our model for the quantification of downturn LGD, we find the ratio of the later to ELGD (the “LGD markup”) to be declining in expected LGD, but uniformly higher for lower ranked instruments or for higher PD-LGD correlation. Finally, we validate the model in an out-of-sample bootstrap exercise, comparing it to a high-dimensional regression model and to a non-parametric benchmark based upon the same data, where we find our model to compare favorably. We conclude that our model is worthy of consideration to risk managers, as well as supervisors concerned with <b>advanced</b> <b>IRB</b> under the Basel II capital accord.

40|$|This study {{outlines}} how {{proposed changes}} to international capital adequacy standards – {{commonly referred to}} as “Basel II” – will reinforce financial stability. Basel II is designed to contribute to the prevention of individual bank failures by making minimum capital standards more flexible and aligning them more closely with actual risks and changes in the level of risk. By bringing regulatory capital closer to the concept of economic capital that banks use in their internal management, and by going to the core of banks’ financial information systems, the proposed changes will foster better control of risks. By reducing credit disruptions, the changes should help to limit the severity of macro-economic and sectoral downturns and thereby improve financial stability. Concerns have been expressed about the potential “procyclicality” of the new standards, and the possibility of sharp swings in regulatory capital requirements leading to dramatic shifts in the availability of credit. These concerns, while theoretically appealing, do not appear warranted in practice. The Basel Committee took steps early on to ensure that cyclical effects would be moderated, while still achieving the goal of making capital ratios more risk-sensitive, more closely related to the bank’s management of its “risk-return” tradeoff, and therefore more useful as an internal control tool. In contrast with Basel I, which is external to banks’ methods of management, Basel II incorporates an <b>advanced</b> <b>IRB</b> approach. It can therefore figure as a central element in banks’ strategic planning. The success of the proposed changes will depend on how they are applied by bank managers and on the vigilance of bank supervisors in overseeing their implementation. Numerous contacts and on-site examinations carried out to date are encouraging in this regard. A hoped-for reform in the rules on provisioning, consistent with the new capital standard – factoring in ex ante the impact of expected but unrealized credit losses over the credit cycle instead of concentrating them at the lowest point of the cycle – would contribute significantly to financial stability. ...|$|E
