50|$|In 1984 the Supreme Court of Texas {{created the}} Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation (TEAJF) to <b>administer</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> support civil legal {{services}} for low-income Texans. The first source of those funds was the Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (IOLTA) program which allowed attorneys to pool short-term or nominal deposits made {{on behalf of}} clients or third parties into bank accounts in which the accrued interest would be distributed to nonprofit providers of free legal services. In 1997 the Texas Legislature provided a new funding stream for TEAJF to administer when it required people who file lawsuits to include a small add-on fee dedicated to free legal services for low-income Texans. In 2001 the Attorney General of Texas and the Texas Supreme Court agreed that TEAJF should administer a new Crime Victims Civil Legal Services fund dedicated to the provision of free legal services to low-income victims of crime. Finally, in December 2006, the Supreme Court issued an order amending the IOLTA rules so that attorneys had to maintain their IOLTA accounts at banks that pay interest rates comparable to other similarly situated accounts. The Supreme Court's action is expected to generate significant new funding for legal services.|$|E

50|$|When Stephen FitzGerald {{returned}} to Australia, he convened {{a working group}} which presented a report to Andrew Peacock recommending {{the establishment of an}} advisory body which would make recommendations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the ways to develop and strengthen relations with China and which, under Ministerial supervision, <b>administers</b> <b>funding</b> <b>to</b> support programs which will advance the bilateral relationship. The Council would have an independent board representing, on a rotating basis, all major sectors and stakeholder groups involved in Australia-China relations.

This structure has remained largely unchanged to this day. Initially, Sixteen Council members were appointed under the chairmanship of Professor Geoffrey Blainey, former chairman of the Australia Council.|$|R

It explores how these principles have been enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and how different jurisdictions have implemented them to enable meaningful engagement and participation by persons with disabilities in society. The philosophy of 'active citizenship' underpinning the Convention â€“ that all citizens should (be able to) actively participate in the community â€“ provides the core focal point of this book, which grounds its analysis in exploring how this goal has been imagined and implemented {{across a range of}} countries. The case studies examine how different jurisdictions have reformed disability law and policy and reconfigured how support is <b>administered</b> and <b>funded</b> <b>to</b> ensure maximum choice and independence is accorded to people with disabilities...|$|R

40|$|Farm and {{catchment}} {{managers in}} Australia face decisions about controlling invasive native species (or scrub) which may infest agricultural land. The treatment {{of this land}} to remove the infestation and re-establish native pastures {{is likely to be}} expensive for landholders. Yet there are potential social benefits from such remediation and so a policy question arises of what to do to about facilitating such change. New South Wales state government legislation addresses this issue through regulations, and the Catchment Management Authorities are responsible for <b>administering</b> public <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> achieve associated natural resource improvements. However, the extent of the private costs and social benefits associated with such changes are not known, which precludes benefit-cost analyses using the traditional welfare economics framework. This paper reports results of a social and private economic analysis of the impacts of a typical infestation remediation decision. We show that for the landholder the private costs exceed the benefits achieved from increased livestock productivity. However, there are social benefits expressed by the willingness to pay by members of the local catchment community for improvements in native vegetation and biodiversity. When these social benefits are included, the economic analysis shows a positive social net benefit. This raises questions of how to reconcile the public and private accounting, and whether any changes to policies, regulations or procedures for natural resource management in New South Wales are warranted.
