5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration.

5|$|In December 1942, {{the ship}} was {{decommissioned}} in La Spezia. She was scuttled there on 9 September 1943, {{a day after the}} armistice that ended the war for Italy was declared to prevent her from being seized by the Germans, who rapidly moved to occupy the country after Italy surrendered. The Germans captured the ship and re-floated her, though she was sunk by Allied bombers on 23 October. The Germans re-floated the ship <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> she was sunk by bombers, on 23 September 1944 in the outer La Spezia roadstead, where the Germans had moved the hulk to block one of the entrances to the Gulf of La Spezia. Taranto was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap in 1946–1947.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the study}} of {{medicinal}} plants was not being neglected and a full synthesis of ancient Greek pharmacology was compiled in Materia Medica c. 60 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides (c. 40-90 AD) who was a Greek physician with the Roman army. This work {{proved to be the}} definitive text on medicinal herbs, both oriental and occidental, for fifteen hundred years until the dawn of the European Renaissance being slavishly copied <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> throughout this period. Though rich in medicinal information with descriptions of about 600 medicinal herbs, the botanical content of the work was extremely limited.|$|E

Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E
5|$|She was {{sensible}} how arduous a task it is {{to produce}} a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> and, when she had finished what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E

5|$|Single-sensed souls, however, called nigoda, and element-bodied souls pervade all {{tiers of}} this universe. Nigodas are souls {{at the bottom}} end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even {{individual}} bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas {{can also be found}} in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> as they cycle within samsara.|$|E
5|$|They are an {{essential}} part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the Creation of Adam. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. <b>Again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.|$|E
5|$|While castles {{were used}} to hold a site and control {{movement}} of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified. Castle architecture in the East became more complex around the late 12th and early 13thcenturies after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189–1192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortifications, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced Muslim architecture and were copied <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> however they had little influence on Crusader castles.|$|E

5|$|Cid {{is confronted}} by Vaan, Balthier and {{company at the}} Draklor Laboratory, which results in a fight that Cid loses. Cid survives the {{encounter}} and flees. Cid goes to the Pharos lighthouse to invoke the Sun-Cryst's full power, revealing himself to the main characters there once Gabranth is defeated. Enraged, Gabranth tries to attack Cid, who teleports {{out of the way}} as Venat throws the judge against a wall. Cid fights Vaan, Balthier and the rest of the party once <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> loses. Cid dies after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun-Cryst before it is destroyed and fully activates his final airship, the Bahamut. A character named Cid appears or is mentioned in every main Final Fantasy. He made his debut appearance in Final Fantasy II, though this appearance is the first Final Fantasy game to feature a Cid character as a villain. Cid was voiced by John Rafter Lee in English and by Chikao Ōtsuka in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Elias C. Laycock was his 'chief rival'. Just a year {{younger than}} Rush, and like him, a large and {{powerful}} man, Laycock came {{to live on the}} Lower Clarence River around 1874. The two scullers met first at the Queen's Birthday regatta in Grafton in May 1874. Laycock, untried at boat racing, was beaten, though undeterred. During the following years, Laycock challenged Rush and others to sculling matches, until in April 1879, he beat World Champion Trickett at a State regatta. A series of matches followed to determine the current Australian sculling Champion, who would defend the World Title. Laycock beat Rush <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> but Trickett eventually beat Laycock. Trickett once more went to the Thames to row against Ned Hanlan, but these preliminary contests in Sydney marked the end of Rush's World Championship ambitions.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, while Metternich {{was still}} at Laibach with Tsar Alexander, the revolt of Alexander Ypsilantis {{threatened}} to bring the Ottoman Empire {{to the brink of}} collapse. Wanting a strong Ottoman Empire to counterbalance Russia, Metternich opposed all forms of Greek nationalism. Before Alexander returned to Russia, Metternich secured his agreement not to act unilaterally and would write to the Tsar <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> asking him not to intervene. For extra support he met with Viscount Castlereagh (now also Marquis of Londonderry) and King George IV of the United Kingdom in Hanover in October. The warmness of Metternich's welcome was sweetened by his promise to settle in part Austria's financial debts to Britain. The earlier Anglo-Austrian entente was thus restored, and the pair agreed that they would support the Austrian position concerning the Balkans. Metternich went away happy, not least because he had met Dorothea Lieven once more.|$|E

5|$|New Jerseys guns {{opened the}} first shore {{bombardment}} of her Korean career at Wonsan 20 May. During her two {{tours of duty}} in Korean waters, she was <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> to play the part of seaborne mobile artillery. In direct support to United Nations troops; or in preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop positions, New Jersey used her 16-inch guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target to another, {{and at the same}} time could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection. It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a shore battery on her number one turret and received a near miss aft to port.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood.

Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so.
