50|$|San Diego County brewers {{produce the}} full range of craft beers, but they are best known for strongly-hopped, high-alcohol beers such as India Pale Ale (IPA), and {{particularly}} for an even stronger, hoppier style known as Double IPA. Double IPA beers are made with intensely <b>aromatic,</b> <b>bitter</b> hops, which result in a very bitter beer. A standard mass-produced American beer scores less than 20 on the International Bitterness Units (IBU) scale; an average IPA scores about 60 IBU; and a double IPA commonly scores 100 IBU or higher. The style was pioneered by brewer Vinnie Cilurzo at the now-defunct Blind Pig Brewery in Temecula in 1994; nowadays almost every brewery in San Diego County produces a double IPA. Double IPA has been called San Diego's signature beer, and some people refer to Double IPA beers as San Diego Pale Ale.|$|E

40|$|Ailanthus altissima (Miller) Swingle is a tree used in Chinese {{traditional}} medicine as a <b>bitter</b> <b>aromatic</b> drug {{and in the}} treatment of colds and gastric diseases. Previous phytochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of quassinoids in the plant, as well as indole alkaloids. The purpose of this work was to determine the phenolic, flavonoid, and total alkaloid contents of the ethanolic, methanolic, acetone, and hydroalcoholic crude extracts of A. altissima and then try to correlate them with antioxidant activity of corresponding extracts. Moreover, the phenolic compounds present in the extracts were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Extracts from leaves have greater phenolic content than the other parts of this tree. Concerning the extraction process, it is possible to conclude that the mixture of water and ethanol is the best solvent to extract substances with antioxidant activity. Analysis by RP-HPLC showed that ferulic acid was the most dominant hydroxycinnamic acid, with an occurrence percentage of 25. 59 %. These results presented a positive linear correlation between antioxidant activity index and total phenolic content of all the extracts...|$|R

Pilocarpine is an {{alkaloid}} of Pilocarpus, and to {{this primary}} action the crude drug owes its principal effect. The plant from which pilocarpine is derived grows in Brazil, South America. DESCRIPTION. It is about ten (10) to fifteen (15) C. M. long and from four (4) to six (6) C. M. broad. Short stalk, of a dull green color, coriaceous, pellucid- punctuate, mostly smooth; when bruised, slightly <b>aromatic.</b> Taste somewhat <b>bitter</b> and pungent. CONSTITUENTS. From this plant several other alkaloidal products are derived such as Jaborine C 22 H 32 N 4 O 4; Pilocarpudine C 10 H 14 N 2 O 2;Jaborandine whose composition is not exactly known. Pilocarpine is the hydrochlorate of an alkaloid obtained from pilocarpus with alcohol and hydrochloric acid by distillation and evaporation. The residue is dissolved in a slight excess of ammonia and chloroform, shaken with water, and then neutralized with hydrochloric acid. On evaporation crystals of hydrochlorate are formed. The properties of filocarpine,small white crystals having no odor but slightly bitter taste, are very soluble in water and alcohol, but almost insoluble in ether or chloroform. The drug {{can be used for}} a sialogogue cathartic or diaphoretic. Depending on the dose and for the end to which it is intended...|$|R
40|$|For the Lowland Mixe of Oaxaca (Mexico), {{plants are}} {{a central part}} of their medical system. Direct access to the natural {{environment}} is - among other possibilities - made feasible by sensory perceptions of plants and plant products. This is interpreted according to cultural expectations. The Mixe judge uses of a plant based on its characteristic smell and taste. These are used in the decision process on whether a plant may be a potential medicinal and for which particular illness it may be used. Generally, astringent drugs (especially the bark of various trees) are valued to treat diarrhea and dysentery, bitter plants being used as supplementary therapy for these indications. <b>Bitter,</b> <b>aromatic</b> and aromatic-bitter plants are valued in the treatment of gastrointestinal cramps and pain. Cough and other respiratory complaints are treated mostly with sweet, sometimes sour drugs. This form of perception is central to the Mixe 2 ̆ 7 s medicinal plant concepts while the classification based on the humoral 2 ̆ 7 hot/cold 2 ̆ 7 dichotomy is of minor importance. Taste and smell properties thus open natural resources to human use.

Macroscopic study showed that the leaves of this plant possess dark green color with characteristic <b>aromatic</b> odour and <b>bitter</b> taste. Powder microscopy showed the presence of numerous glandular simple trichomes of average length 101 m and anomocytic stomata were also present, whereas, T. S of leaf showed that the leaf has a pot shape midrib and a thin lamina with uneven lower epidermis attached at the lateral sides of its upper side leaving a concave central dorsal depression. Both upper and lower epidermis showed simple, covering, uniseriate trichomes as well as sessile short stalked glandular trichomes. Quantitative microscopy viz., veinlet termination number, vein islet number, stomatal number, stomatal index; physico-chemical parameters viz., ash values, extractive values, Thin layer chromatography (TLC); florescence analysis of Ocimum gratissimum L. were also been determined. TLC studies showed the presence of various phytochemicals in the extracts. Qualitative phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids (methanolic, ethanolic extracts); alkaloids, flavonoids and terpenoids (petroleum ether, chloroform extracts) and carbohydrates in alcoholic extract. This is the first such study on standardization of Occimum gratissimum L. leaf which would serve as a standard reference for identification and distinguishing the plant from its adulterants...|$|R
