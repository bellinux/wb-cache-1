40|$|Human mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (hMSCs) and {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) woven poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3 D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization {{was observed in}} the newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). The 45 -day constructs exhibited mechanical properties {{on the order of}} magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear moduli of 0. 15, 0. 12, and 0. 033 [*]MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox- 9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα 1) /Runx 2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein- 2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3 D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold. These findings merit consideration when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair. National Institutes of Health (U. S.) (NIH <b>AR</b> 055414) <b>National</b> Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|Manure spills {{happen for}} a range of reasons—a manure {{spreader}} rolls over, a hose breaks, a storage pond overflows after a relentless downpour. Whatever the cause, these events are such a threat to the environment that states have emergency teams to deal with the hazard.

Although cleanup efforts start as quickly as possible, a fish kill in a nearby stream is often the first evidence that a spill has taken place. Another problem is that sediments in the contaminated water channel can capture phosphorus from the manure and release the nutrient back into the water— sometimes for months on end—at levels exceeding U.

Multiple organoid models may be further connected together through the microfluidics in a similar manner in which they are arranged in vivo, providing the capability to analyze multiorgan interactions. Although a wide variety of human organ-on-a-chip models have been created, there are limited efforts on the integration of multisensor systems. However, in situ continual measuring is critical in precise assessment of the microenvironment parameters and the dynamic responses of the organs to pharmaceutical compounds over extended periods of time. In addition, automated and noninvasive capability is strongly desired for long-term monitoring. Here, we report a fully integrated modular physical, biochemical, and optical sensing platform through a fluidics-routing breadboard, which operates organ-on-a-chip units in a continual, dynamic, and automated manner. We believe that this platform technology has paved a potential avenue to promote the performance of current organ-on-a-chip models in drug screening by integrating a multitude of real-time sensors to achieve automated in situ monitoring of biophysical and biochemical parameters.

To {{better understand}} the interplay between type I IFNs and the activation of autoreactive B cells, we evaluated the effect of type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) deficiency in murine B cell responses to common TLR ligands. In comparison to wild-type B cells, TLR 7 -stimulated IFNAR−/− B cells proliferated significantly less well and did not up-regulate costimulatory molecules. By contrast, IFNAR 1 −/− B cells did not produce cytokines, but did proliferate and up-regulate activation markers in response to other TLR ligands. These defects were not due to {{a difference in the}} distribution of B cell populations or a failure to produce a soluble factor other than a type I IFN. Instead, the compromised response pattern reflected the disruption of an IFN-β feedback loop and constitutively low expression of TLR 7 in the IFNAR 1 −/− B cells.

It {{was lower}} than altitudinal treelines elsewhere in the Alaska Range (up to 1, 550  m, Sveinbjörnsson 2000), possibly because of poorly drained soils underlain by permafrost. Recent climate change, however, has promoted white spruce establishment and growth in this area for the past 50  years (Hamm, 2007). Treeline is defined not only by elevation (Sveinbjörnsson 2000); considering heterogeneity of treeline including topology, interaction with neighboring vegetation and local climate that affect treeline, we followed the broad definition of treeline as Stueve et al.

40|$|With exotic {{names like}} ayote de caballo (a wild squash), friajolito (a wild bean), and teocinte (a wild {{relative}} of corn), Guatemala’s native plants seem {{very different from}} the agricultural bounty produced by farmers in the United States and other countries. But many of these native plants carry genes that may be vital to global food security. A new tool, developed by a team that includes Agricultural Research Service scientists, will make it easier to find and preserve these important plants. The tool is an interactive atlas designed to provide Guatemalan scientists and land managers with information on where these crop wild relatives grow, where they are relatively safe from habitat destruction, and which ones are rare and most at risk.

40|$|Objective Traumatic joint injury can {{initiate}} early cartilage degeneration in {{the presence}} of elevated inflammatory cytokines (e. g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interleukin (IL) - 6). The positive/negative effects of post-injury dynamic loading on cartilage degradation and repair in vivo are not well-understood. This study examined the effects of dynamic strain on immature bovine cartilage in vitro challenged with TNF-α + IL- 6 and its soluble receptor (sIL- 6 R) with/without initial mechanical injury. Methods Groups of mechanically injured or non-injured explants were cultured in TNF-α + IL- 6 /sIL- 6 R for 8 days. Intermittent dynamic compression was applied concurrently at 10 %, 20 %, or 30 % strain amplitude. Outcome measures included sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) loss (dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB)), aggrecan biosynthesis ([superscript 35]S-incorporation), aggrecanase activity (Western blot), chondrocyte viability (fluorescence staining) and apoptosis (nuclear blebbing via light microscopy), and gene expression (qPCR). Results In bovine explants, cytokine alone and injury-plus-cytokine treatments markedly increased sGAG loss and aggrecanase activity, and induced chondrocyte apoptosis. These effects were abolished by moderate 10 % and 20 % strains. However, 30 % strain amplitude greatly increased apoptosis and had no inhibitory effect on aggrecanase activity. TNF + IL- 6 /sIL- 6 R downregulated matrix gene expression and upregulated expression of inflammatory genes, effects that were rescued by moderate dynamic strains but not by 30 % strain. Conclusions Moderate dynamic compression inhibits the pro-catabolic response of cartilage to mechanical injury and cytokine challenge, but there is a threshold strain amplitude above which loading becomes detrimental to cartilage. Our findings support the concept of appropriate loading for post-injury rehabilitation. National Institutes of Health (U. S.) (Grant <b>AR</b> 060331) <b>National</b> Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|There is no typical {{drainage}} ditch,” says Agricultural Research Service ecologist Matt Moore. “And until recently, farmers {{just thought}} of them as something they need to drain water off their fields. But we can use these ditches to minimize pesticide and nutrient losses in runoff—and {{it can be done}} without taking any cropland out of production. ” Moore, who works at the <b>ARS</b> <b>National</b> Sedimentation Laboratory in Oxford, Mississippi, has been wading through edge of- field drainage ditches since he was a boy planting rice on his family’s farm in Arkansas. The ditches—as common in agricultural landscapes as the fields they drain—range from shallow gullies that sometimes run dry to much larger channels that hold either standing or flowing water throughout the year. Many farmers control ditch vegetation with trimming or dredging to eliminate barriers that could impede the flow of runoff. But Moore has conducted a number of studies over the past 10 years showing that drainage ditches where plants are allowed to flourish are strikingly effective at keeping agricultural pollutants in field runoff from reaching surrounding surface waters. Blocking a Path for Pesticides In one of Moore’s first studies, he spent 28 days evaluating the transport and capture of atrazine and lambdacyhalothrin in a 160 -foot section of a vegetated agricultural drainage ditch in Mississippi. One hour after he started a simulated runoff event, 61 percent of the atrazine and 87 percent of the lambda-cyhalothrin had transferred from the water to the ditch vegetation, {{and at the end of}} the ditch, runoff pesticide concentrations had decreased to levels that were generally nontoxic to downstream aquatic fauna. “I was surprised by the short distance the runoff needed to travel in the drainage ditch to lose its pesticide load,” says Arkansas State University researcher Jerry Farris, who was one of the coauthors on the study. “This suggested that we could use these ditches as one tool in managing agriculture from an ecological perspective. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Hop powdery mildew, {{caused by}} Podosphaera macularis Braun & Takamatsu (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis (Wallr. :Fr.) Lind, syn. S. humuli (DC.) Burrill) was not {{observed}} in Pacific Northwest hop yards until 1997, when it was discovered in Washington. Within one year, it had spread to Oregon and Idaho. This emerging disease caused severe economic losses to hop growers, {{due in part to}} the lack of resistance incorporated into commercial varieties. Despite several collection trips that increased the amount of wild hop (Humulus lupulus L.) germplasm available to researchers, there was no knowledge of its potential as a resource for resistance to P. macularis. The objectives of this study were: 1) to collect previously unrepresented native hop seed from the Southwestern United States, 2) to evaluate wild hop germplasm for resistance to P. macularis, and 3) to microscopically examine the progression of powdery mildew on different hop genotypes. Plant collecting expeditions were taken in September of 2002 and 2003 to obtain wild American hop germplasm (H. l. var. neomexicanus) from Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. During these expeditions, 60 seedlots and 28 plant accessions were obtained. This germplasm was deposited at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (<b>ARS),</b> <b>National</b> Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR), located in Corvallis, Oregon. More than 2, 100 wild (1563 North American and 107 Kazakhstani) hop seedlings, from 54 seedlots were evaluated for powdery mildew resistance. The number of resistant seedlings observed when greenhouse temperatures were > 30 °C was 218. The number of resistant seedlings decreased to 62 when greenhouse temperatures were 30 °C) prior to inoculation. The development of P. macularis on several native North American and Kazakhstani hop genotypes was observed using direct light microscopy. The disease progressed slower on native genotypes than on the susceptible H. l. 'Symphony'. Conidia on the resistant cultivar 'Nugget' produced only the primary germ tube prior to shriveling. On 3 infected native Kazakhstani genotypes, epidermal cells at the center of the colony began to collapse at 120 h, forming a lesion that continued to radiate outward. Fungal hyphae then shriveled in response to epidermal collapse. As a result of this work, new sources of resistance to powdery mildew were identified. A high percentage of resistant seedlings were observed in specific lots from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and North Dakota. Resistant genotypes from North America and Kazakhstan may lead to germplasm releases for use in hop breeding programs. The partial resistance observed in wild hops suggests that multiple genes are involved. This type of resistance would be more durable than single gene resistance, which is easily overcome by the evolution of more virulent pathotypes...|$|E

PKCδ is activated by growth factor-driven PLCγ 1 hydrolysis of phosphoinositide bisphosphate (PIP[subscript 2]) hydrolysis when it becomes tranlocated to the membrane. This leads to MLC- 2 phosphorylation that regulates myosin for contractility. Furthermore, PKCδ n-terminus mediates PKCδ localization to the membrane in relative proximity to PLCγ 1 activity.

Microfabrication-based techniques are emerging as powerful approaches to generate such cell-encapsulating hydrogel structures. In this paper we introduce common hydrogels and their crosslinking methods and review the latest microscale approaches for generation of cell containing gel particles.

40|$|The {{availability}} of therapeutic molecules to targets within cartilage depends on transport through the avascular matrix. We studied equilibrium partitioning and non-equilibrium transport into cartilage of Pf-pep, a 760 Da positively charged peptide inhibitor of the proprotein convertase PACE 4. Competitive binding measurements revealed negligible binding of Pf-pep to sites within cartilage. Uptake of Pf-pep depended on glycosaminoglycan charge density, and {{was consistent with}} predictions of Donnan equilibrium given the known charge of Pf-pep. In separate transport experiments, the diffusivity of Pf-pep in cartilage {{was measured to be}} ~ 1 × 10 [superscript − 6] cm[superscript 2]/s, close to other similarly-sized non-binding solutes. These results suggest that small positively charged therapeutics will have a higher concentration within cartilage than in the surrounding synovial fluid, a desired property for local delivery; however, such therapeutics may rapidly diffuse out of cartilage unless there is additional specific binding to intra-tissue substrates that can maintain enhanced intra-tissue concentration for local delivery.

40|$|The recent paper {{entitled}} by K. C. Lee et al. (2011) establishes nonlocal macroscopic quantum correlations, {{which they}} term “entanglement”, under ambient conditions. Photon(s) -phonon entanglements are established within each interferometer arm. However, our analysis demonstrates, the phonon fields between arms become correlated {{as a result}} of single-photon wavepacket path indistinguishability, not true nonlocal entanglement. We also note that a coherence expansion (as opposed to decoherence) resulted from local entanglement which was not recognized. It occurred from nearly identical Raman scattering in each arm (importantly not meeting the Born and Markovian approximations). The ability to establish nonlocal macroscopic quantum correlations through path indistinguishability rather than entanglement offers the opportunity to greatly expand quantum macroscopic theory and application, even though it was not true nonlocal entanglement.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of early onset primary dystonia, a neuromuscular disease, is a {{glutamate}} deletion (DE) at position 302 / 303 of TorsinA, a AAA+ ATPase that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. While the function of TorsinA remains elusive, the DE mutation is known to diminish binding of two TorsinA ATPase activators: lamina-associated protein 1 (LAP 1) and its paralog, luminal domain like LAP 1 (LULL 1). Using a nanobody as a crystallization chaperone, we obtained a 1. 4 A˚ crystal structure of human TorsinA in complex with LULL 1. This nanobody likewise stabilized the weakened TorsinADE-LULL 1 interaction, which enabled us to solve its structure at 1. 4 A˚ also. A comparison of these structures shows, in atomic detail, the subtle differences in activator interactions that separate the healthy from the diseased state. This information may provide a structural platform for drug development, as a small molecule that rescues TorsinADE could serve as a cure for primary dystonia. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|Introduction Traumatic joint injury damages {{cartilage}} {{and causes}} adjacent joint tissues to release inflammatory cytokines, increasing {{the risk of}} developing osteoarthritis. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the combined catabolic effects of mechanical injury, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&# 945;) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) /soluble IL- 6 receptor (sIL- 6 R) on cartilage could be abolished by short-term treatment with glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone. Methods In an initial dexamethasone-dose-response study, bovine cartilage explants were treated with TNF&# 945; and increasing concentrations of dexamethasone. Bovine and human cartilage explants were then subjected to individual and combined treatments with TNF&# 945;, IL- 6 /sIL- 6 R and injury in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Treatment effects were assessed by measuring glycosaminoglycans (GAG) release to the medium and synthesis of proteoglycans. Additional experiments tested whether pre-exposure of cartilage to dexamethasone could prevent GAG loss and inhibition of biosynthesis induced by cytokines, and whether post-treatment with dexamethasone could diminish the effects of pre-established cytokine insult. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels for genes involved in cartilage homeostasis (proteases, matrix molecules, cytokines, growth and transcription factors) were measured in explants subjected to combined treatments with injury, TNF&# 945; and dexamethasone. To investigate mechanisms associated with dexamethasone regulation of chondrocyte metabolic response, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist (RU 486) and proprotein convertase inhibitor (RVKR-CMK) were used. Results Dexamethasone dose-dependently inhibited GAG loss and the reduction in biosynthesis caused by TNF&# 945;. The combination of mechanical injury, TNF&# 945; and IL- 6 /sIL- 6 R caused the most severe GAG loss; dexamethasone reduced this GAG loss to control levels in bovine and human cartilage. Additionally, dexamethasone pre-treatment or post-treatment of bovine explants lowered GAG loss and increased proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage explants exposed to TNF&# 945;. Dexamethasone did not down-regulate aggrecanase mRNA levels. Post-transcriptional regulation by dexamethasone of other genes associated with responses to injury and cytokines was noted. GR antagonist reversed the effect of dexamethasone on sulfate incorporation. RVKR-CMK significantly reduced GAG loss caused by TNF&# 945; + IL- 6 + injury. Conclusions Short-term glucocorticoid treatment effectively abolished the catabolic effects exerted by the combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mechanical injury: dexamethasone prevented proteoglycan degradation and restored biosynthesis. Dexamethasone appears to regulate the catabolic response of chondrocytes post-transcriptionally, since the abundance of transcripts encoding aggrecanases was still elevated in the presence of dexamethasone.
