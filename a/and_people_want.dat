All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to hear these songs at every concert. They are not just part of our history; they are great masterpieces. It is interesting that Svyaschennaya Voyna, written by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov in 1941, helped Soviet soldiers to protect their Motherland and is still popular in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. Those audiences listen to it standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.|$|E
500|$|Led Zeppelin {{also made}} a {{significant}} cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that [...] "on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement". Led Zeppelin have also been described as [...] "the quintessential purveyors" [...] of masculine and aggressive [...] "cock rock", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that [...] "Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> a piece of that". Led Zeppelin {{laid the foundation for}} the big hair of 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.|$|E

Conceding defeat, he said, “I feel very happy, and very proud” and said that he would win “next time.” Referring to his role as head of the PNI, he said, “We are now the second most important political force in Palestine, ahead of Hamas.

50|$|Lord Justice Wall: A {{few years}} ago I went to address the annual general meeting of Families Need Fathers and I was {{actually}} very impressed by {{the strength of their}} feelings and their emotions. The message I gave them - and I {{was not the only one}} doing it - was that the way to succeed, the way to get into the system, is not to sloganise but actually to get on the committees, get in with government where there is lots going on <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to consult you, and respond to Making Contact Work. We had an excellent response from Families Need Fathers, part of which we incorporated, and I think Families Need Fathers has become a key player in the debate about on-going contact and joint residence. We make progress with rational argument; we do not make progress by sloganising.|$|E

50|$|Lucky Man is not {{performed}} in concert {{the way it}} was recorded. Emerson explains: It is a shame that we really can’t perform it the same way it is on the album. There’s a lot of double-tracked vocals. Greg’s playing electric, bass and acoustic guitar on it. If we had really thought about it, and we ourselves, had wanted to release it as a single, then we would have considered these points, and possibly re-arranged it so we could have done it some way on stage. Now we come out <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to hear it. Greg performs it as an acoustic piece and I guess it's rather disappointing to some people because they want to hear the recorded version. There we were, in the position of it having been released and us not knowing that people want to hear it, and {{the way it was}} done on the album being impossible for us to do on stage.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} that in his own life Isocrates did in fact go to court {{in his own defense}} over an amount of money he was made to pay. Isocrates argued this fine was based on the fact people thought he was wealthier than he {{actually}} was. He claimed this distorted perception of his wealth was due to his popularity as a public figure. This is similar to Isocrates’s defense in the Antidosis in which he claims he has been indicted due to the fact he is a very successful person, people are jealous of him, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to publicly embarrass him. In the Antidosis, Isocrates is charged with corrupting the youth by teaching them to become good public speakers. With this ability, the students may trick people by convincing them of false truths which could ultimately allow the students to corrupt the government. This is an obvious defense of his life’s work of teaching.|$|E

5000|$|In the United Kingdom, the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 {{requires}} {{local authorities}} to provide every household {{with a separate}} collection {{of at least two}} types of recyclable materials by 2010.There has been criticism in the difference of schemes used in the country such as the colour of bins, whether they are bins boxes or bags, and also the fact that clutter roads and how the additional trucks and collections needed have carbon dioxide emissions too. Some find the colour differences confusing, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> a national scheme. A typical example is to compare two neighbouring councils in greater Manchester, Bury council and Salford. Bury uses blue for cans, plastic and glass, green for paper and cardboard and brown for garden waste. Salford uses blue for paper and card, brown for cans plastic and glass and pink for garden waste. Most councils use grey or black for general waste, with a few exceptions such as Liverpool, which uses purple for general waste, a colour used by no other council ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Creemore Springs {{applied for}} {{planning}} permission {{to expand their}} plant by 60% to triple their brewing capacity to 150,000 hL per year. The location of such a large industrial plant in downtown Creemore generated debate. Subsequently, the company {{is no longer a}} member of the Ontario Craft Brewers Association. Considering that aspect, and the ownership by a multi-national, and the expansion into Quebec but not brewing in that province, since 2013, and the volume of beer produced, Creemore Springs may no longer be categorized as a craft brewery. Karen Gaudino, director of marketing offers her perspective: [...] "The term craft doesn’t come in to the equation. People want to envelop us and categorise us. The market is being driven by back to basics <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> simplicity, authenticity and provenance. It’s what people want, and what we want.

5000|$|Of the 2006 Salvo remaster of the album, Classic Rock said: [...] "Wolverhampton's unimpeachable {{purveyors of}} melody-grounded lads rock grafted unpretentious pop sentiments to garish terrace stomping with such {{cavalier}} loutishness {{in the early}} 70s that resistance was useless." [...] In 2010, the magazine considered the album an [...] "essential classic" [...] and wrote: [...] "The consensus among Slade aficionados is that this, the group's third studio album, is their definitive work. Two enormous hit singles are here swelled by party-hard album tracks, and even something approaching a ballad with [...] "Look at Last Nite", ensuring that Slayed? inarguably ticks all the right boxes." [...] The Guardian commented: [...] "Slade's anthems celebrate what Noddy Holder bellows is 'the feelin' when you give it all you've got, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to shake you by the hand". [...] "Gudbuy T'Jane", [...] "Mama Weer All Crazee Now" [...] and the rest are deservedly party riff monsters. However, Slayed?s majesty lies in the melancholy ballads.
