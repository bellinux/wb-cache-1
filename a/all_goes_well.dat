5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. <b>All</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out of the car to prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination.|$|E

25|$|After {{resuming}} {{its journey}} west, the train finds and adds the wagon of a medicine show troupe, who, {{en route to}} California, have become stranded without water. The onward passage of the wagon train is marked by the beginnings of romances between Travis and Denver (Joanne Dru), a female entertainer with the medicine troupe, and between Sandy and a Mormon's daughter, and also by a Mormon square dance celebrating a successful desert passage, and by a pow-wow dance with a band of Navajo. <b>All</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> enough until the Cleggs, fleeing a posse from Crystal City, force themselves into the wagon train. The train surmounts an encounter with the posse, a washed out trail blocking the way west, and ultimately a violent confrontation with the homicidal Cleggs.|$|E
500|$|A {{secondary}} {{function of}} the dog is to [...] "sniff out" [...] ingredients by putting his nose {{to the ground and}} smelling for items. The player can command the dog to search the ground at any time, including in huts and cities. If <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well,</b> the dog will lead his human companion to a certain spot on the map, where the player can uncover the unseen ingredients. With repeated use, Alchemy Formulas will increase in level, enhancing their curative, offensive, or support effectiveness. Although there are dozens of Formulas available to be found within the game, only nine can be equipped at a time. To overcome this, there are several Alchemists scattered throughout the game who offer to manage the boy's current Alchemy list; any formula that has already been learned can be stored by the Alchemist for later use.|$|E

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1924 season, Leyland was recognised in The Times {{as one of the most}} promising young professional batsmen in England; the newspaper's cricket correspondent noted that Leyland [...] "is fully expected, in Yorkshire, to develop into a first-rate left-handed batsman." [...] He continued to improve that season, scoring 1,259 runs at 30.70. In August, he scored his first century in first-class cricket, hitting 133 not out in a drawn game against Lancashire; later in the month, he scored another century. Leyland further improved his record in 1925, hitting 1,572 runs at 40.30. Wisden commented: [...] "Leyland still further increased the big reputation he had made in the previous summer and ought, if <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> with him, to attain the highest distinction." [...] By the end of the 1926 season, in which he scored 1,561 runs at 39.02 and hit five centuries, Leyland had established himself as one of the most reliable batsmen in the Yorkshire team.|$|E
500|$|The {{newspaper}} Aftonbladet had {{supplied the}} pigeons, bred in northern Norway with the optimistic {{hope that they}} would manage to return there, and their message cylinders contained pre-printed instructions in Norwegian asking the finder to pass the messages on to the newspaper's address in Stockholm. Andrée released at least four pigeons, but only one was ever retrieved, by a Norwegian steamer where the pigeon had alighted and been promptly shot. Its message is dated July 13 and gives the travel direction at that point as East by 10° South. The message reads: [...] "Från Andrées Polarexp. till Aftonbladet, Stockholm. Den 13 juli kl. 12,30 midd. Lat. 82° 2' Long. 15° 5' ost god fart åt ost 10° syd. Allt väl ombord. Detta är tredje dufposten. Andrée."

Lundström and others note that all three messages fail to mention the accident at takeoff, or the increasingly desperate situation, which Andrée was describing fully in his main diary. The balloon was out of equilibrium, sailing much too high and thereby losing hydrogen faster than even Nils Ekholm had feared, then repeatedly threatening to crash on the ice. It was weighed down by being rain-soaked ("dripping wet", writes Andrée in the diary), and the men were throwing all the sand {{and some of the}} payload overboard to keep it airborne.|$|E

Cleverly's promoter, Frank Warren, won the purse bid. The WBO threatened Cleverly, who was hoping to pursue a unification fight against WBA champion Beibut Shumenov, if he didn't fight Krasniqi next. Cleverly said, [...] "If it <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> with the Krasniqi fight, Shumenov is definitely in my sights and I would definitely like to fight the winner of Hopkins and Tavoris Cloud."

[...] By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the [...] "I am" [...] and the [...] "I should" [...] is called incongruity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 and 1979, Gurr {{was on the}} Somerset staff, {{though he}} made limited {{appearances}} in both first-class and List A cricket. In 1978, Wisden reported, [...] "Gurr's great potential was, unhappily, not available until the end , when he had manfully overcome a shattering loss of confidence". A year later, the Wisden report was little changed: [...] "The recurring inability of Gurr to fill his ordained position as opening fast bowler continued to worry everyone," [...] its report said. At {{the end of the}} season, Gurr got married and took a job with an insurance company. In his entry in the first-ever Cricketers' Who's Who book in 1980, Gurr wrote: [...] "I will probably spend the 1980 season playing part-time, acting as stand-by. I hope to develop my career in the life assurance market while trying {{to keep in touch with}} the first-class game. If <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well,</b> I hope to try and spend more time in cricket in two or three seasons' time." [...] In fact, he played in one second eleven match for Somerset in 1980, but never again appeared in first-class or List A cricket.|$|E

2500|$|Saadia Gaon {{read the}} words of [...] "And your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the Lord your God," [...] to teach that if <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> and runs {{smoothly}} for those engaged in the accumulation of money, then they are apt to put their entire trust in money and forget to make mention of their Master and deny their Provider. Reading [...] Hezekiah ben Manoah (the Hizkuni) lamented that the phenomenon of becoming haughty is tragically all too common. Reading [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that pride is the principal cause of forgetting essentials. Due to the abundance of affluence, peace, and tranquility, a person's heart can become haughty and smug, and the evil urge ( [...] , yetzer hara) can {{find it easy to}} provoke a person to follow the heart without restraint. When that happens, Heaven's concerns become marginal. In [...] "and you say in your heart: ‘My strength and the power of my hand has gotten me this wealth,'" [...] Bahya ben Asher read Moses to warn of the possibility that arrogance can lead one to ascribe affluence to one's own lucky stars. And reading [...] "you shall remember the Lord your God," [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that God alone is the Source of good fortune, because God has given people the strength to perform deeds of valor, and has handed people the power to overcome bad fortune in their stars. Abraham ibn Ezra read Moses to warn the Israelites in [...] that they might forget that they were slaves with downcast hearts, forget the affliction and the hunger that they experienced in the wilderness, and forget that God sustained them nonetheless. But Ibn Ezra {{read the words}} [...] "But you shall remember" [...] in [...] to teach that if the thought [...] "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth" [...] should enter one's mind, then one should remember the One Who gives one power.|$|E
