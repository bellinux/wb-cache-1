5|$|Despite {{questions}} about his income, no scandal ever touched Sunday. He was sincerely devoted to his wife, who also managed his campaigns, but his three sons disappointed him.

Nevertheless, Sunday continued to preach and remained a stalwart defender of conservative Christianity until his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Wolf Klaphake and {{his wife}} Maria emigrated to Australia. The Klaphakes' {{decision}} to emigrate was probably primarily the result of Maria's encounters with Nazi authorities; their decision to settle in Australia (rather than, say, in Britain) was influenced by Wolf's desire to develop a dew condenser. As a dry continent, Australia was likely to need <b>alternative</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> fresh water, and the Premier of South Australia, whom he had met in London, had expressed an interest. Klaphake made a specific proposal for a condenser at {{the small town of}} Cook, where there was no supply of potable water. At Cook, the railway company had previously installed a large coal-powered active condenser, but it was prohibitively expensive to run, and it was cheaper to simply transport water. However, the Australian government turned down Klaphake's proposal, and he lost interest in the project.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the modeling, simulation and optimization <b>of</b> integrated <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> energy system with grid substation. When {{there is a}} lack of energy in grid substation to meet the demand of customer load then <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> energy compensates energy deficiency and after that if there is excess energy available then remaining energy is stored in battery bank or sells to grid according to need. In another case when required energy is not generated by <b>alternative</b> <b>sources</b> then remaining energy is purchased from the grid and if the grid substation hasn 2 ̆ 7 t available these remaining energy to meet the customer load demand during the peak load then stored battery energy is also active. The size <b>of</b> integrated <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> energy system may vary from few hundred watts to ten or hundreds of MW. The possible <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> energy like solar, wind and biomass are considered under this paper. Study location, Muzaffarpur district of Bihar (India), is taken because there is good potential of energy generation from <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> energy and still there is no any wind and solar energy power plant. The modeling and simulation of the system is done by using HOMER software and the software solve the optimization problem to minimize the total cost of system and maximum utilization <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> energy...|$|R
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other <b>alternative</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> income.|$|E
5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and <b>alternative</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E
