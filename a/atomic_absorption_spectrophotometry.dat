This technique {{is based on the}} hydride generation <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> (HGAA) <b>spectrophotometry.</b> The hydrides of the arsenic species are generated in a reaction vessel by mixing the sample solution with NaBH₄. By controlling the pH of the reaction mixture, the hydrides of As (III) and As(V) are sequentially produced. The hydrides are swept out of the solution with hydrogen and directed to the atomization cell. A flame-in-a-tube technique is employed for atomization. The hydrogen/hydride mixture passes through a hydrogen/air flame where hydrogen radicals convert the arsine to atomic arsenic. The atomic vapor then passes into a 20 -cm long quartz observation tube where the atomic absorbance of arsenic is measured at 193. 7 nm. The flame-in-a-tube technique was found to produce more consistent results than atomization based on electro-thermal heating of a quartz tube to 900 ° C.
