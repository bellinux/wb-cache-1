5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life?, bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact {{we were able to do}} our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit of the Staircase, Curreri's 2004 release saw {{the return}} of Jeff Romano, who {{produced}} and performed on 2002's From Long Gones to Hawkmoth. The title of the record comes from a French expression l'esprit d'escalier, the things you think to say after you are already out the door. His first live album, <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Paul Curreri was recorded at Charlottesville's (now-defunct) Gravity Lounge, and released in 2006. Musical backing was provided by Charlottesvillians Randall Pharr (bass) and Spencer Lathrop (drums).|$|E

6000|$|... "What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to say, Fan--what <b>is</b> it that <b>you</b> wish?" [...] said Merton, with a keener {{interest}} than {{he usually}} manifested in other people's words.|$|R

500|$|Duran Duran {{was chosen}} to do the song after bassist John Taylor (a lifelong Bond fan) {{approached}} producer Cubby Broccoli at a party, and somewhat drunkenly asked [...] "When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to get someone decent to do one of your theme songs?" ...|$|E
500|$|When Henriksen {{first got}} the script, he mistook {{it for a}} film because of its [...] "powerful" [...] story. He was not fond {{of the idea of}} {{participating}} in a television project. Henriksen contacted Carter about the character; his first question was [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to make this hero a hero? I mean, it is so dark, how <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to handle this?" [...] Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to [...] "stand-up" [...] against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark [...] "feel" [...] of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of {{light at the end of}} the tunnel. According to Carter [...] "The yellow house" [...] was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Huff or no huff,' said Mr Tappertit, detaining {{her by the}} wrist. 'What do you mean, Jezebel? What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to say? Answer me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Beechnut. [...] "I <b>am</b> glad <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> <b>You</b> {{will have}} a very {{pleasant}} journey, I have no doubt,--that <b>is,</b> if <b>you</b> have accidents enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You went {{a mighty}} {{long way to}} do it," [...] said Snap, coldly. [...] "Where <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to hide them, at the {{second-hand}} shop or the pawn-broker's?" ...|$|R
500|$|According to General Sumihisa Ikeda and Admiral Zenshirō Hoshina, Privy Council President Hiranuma {{then turned}} to the Emperor and asked him: [...] "Your majesty, you also bear {{responsibility}} (sekinin) for this defeat. What apology <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to make to the heroic spirits of the imperial founder of your house and your other imperial ancestors?" ...|$|E
500|$|Will you {{proclaim}} to {{the world}} that you who carry liberty and democracy to Europe have no liberty here, that you who are fighting for democracy in Germany, suppress democracy right here in New York, in the United States? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to suppress free speech and liberty in this country, and still pretend that you love liberty so much that you will fight for it five thousand miles away? ...|$|E
500|$|At {{another time}} {{he was taking a}} morning walk and met Gen. James Taylor, a {{relative}} by marriage, who said, 'Good-morning, doctor; where are you going?' 'I am going to heaven; where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going,</b> general?' The general, at that time, had some doubts about whether his road led to the same country, and made no reply; but it is hoped he found the way to everlasting life before he left the world.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prefers {{departmental}} work to fighting, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to add?" [...] he said quietly. [...] "Well, perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> right. At any rate, I will content {{myself by}} saying au revoir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to say?" [...] {{questioned}} Ruth, when {{he caught}} himself once. [...] "You act {{as if you had}} something on your mind of special importance, Jack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a good}} thing," [...] {{retorted}} Northmour in his ugliest manner. [...] "You {{might end}} by wearying us.--What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to say?" [...] he added, turning to me.|$|R
500|$|After working {{together}} as Electrafixion, McCulloch, Sergeant and Pattinson regrouped in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen with the UK Top 10 hit [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever". An album of new material, Evergreen, was greeted enthusiastically by critics {{and the band}} made a successful return to the live arena. Though Pattinson left the group for a second time, McCulloch and Sergeant continue to record as Echo & the Bunnymen, releasing What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life? (1999), Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005), The Fountain (2009), and Meteorites (2014).|$|E
500|$|What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life? was {{released}} on 16 April 1999 through London Records following {{the release of the}} first single from the album, [...] "Rust", the previous month. One further single, [...] "Get in the Car", followed the album's release. The album received mixed reviews from the music press, being described as both flawless and having no appeal. The album was not as popular with the public as earlier releases from Echo & the Bunnymen; the album peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
500|$|Released in March 1999, [...] "Rust" [...] was {{the first}} single to come from What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life?. The single peaked at number twenty-two on the UK Singles Chart, and NME {{magazine}} named it their Single of the Week. The album was released the following month on 16 April and, having failed {{to appeal to the}} public as much as the band's previous albums, peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart. [...] "Get in the Car", one of the tracks recorded with Fun Lovin' Criminals, was later released as a single.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now {{that you}} CAN begin, sir,' {{returned}} Bella, {{with a look}} as if she italicized the word by putting one of her dimples under it, 'what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to say?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is a good}} thing," [...] {{retorted}} Northmour in his ugliest manner. [...] "You {{might end}} by wearying us. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to say?" [...] he added, turning to me.|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} a source of {{inspiration}} for Joyce Carol Oates' short story [...] "Where <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going,</b> Where Have You Been?", prompting her to dedicate the story to Dylan. A portion of the first verse of the song was used as the title for Barry Hannah's 1995 novel Yonder Stands Your Orphan. Graham Bonnet's version of the song appears on the soundtrack of the 2009 Peter Jackson film The Lovely Bones.. Philadelphia pop punk band The Wonder Years's 2009 Distances split EP opens with a track entitled [...] "An Elegy for Baby Blue," [...] which references Dylan's song by directly quoting him in its chorus.|$|E
500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to tell me?" [...] said I, smiling, for I saw {{she wanted}} to go on. [...] "You have roused my curiosity, and now you must gratify it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That being so," [...] Francis continued, [...] "I {{am going}} to make a {{proposition}} to you for what it is worth. Where <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> when I met you this morning, Shopland?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Lay your lash in {{the right}} spot, Mr. Benny Pump,” said the wood- chopper, “or I’ll {{put you in the}} palm of my hand and box your ears. Where <b>be</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> with my team?” ...|$|R
500|$|What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life? is {{the eighth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album saw the {{departure}} of bassist Les Pattinson from the group, partly due to disagreements with vocalist Ian McCulloch; McCulloch and the remaining band member, guitarist Will Sergeant, subsequently recorded the record with session musicians. The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England. Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album, Sergeant described it as [...] "probably the worst time in my whole life".|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{described}} himself as [...] "a truly terrible public speaker" [...] and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor. He was known as an independent Republican during {{his career in the}} Senate. In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster's special War Investigating Committee. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him [...] "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to start voting with us?" [...] Cooper responded, [...] "If you'll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best." ...|$|E
500|$|Hans Zimmer {{initially}} denied popular {{rumors that}} he would be composing the film's score. However, in June 2012, it was confirmed that Zimmer would, in fact, be writing the film's musical score. To completely distinguish Man of Steel from the previous films, the iconic [...] "Superman March" [...] by John Williams was not used. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for Man of Steel was released publicly on June 11, 2013. An unofficial rip of the musical score from the third trailer, entitled [...] "An Ideal of Hope", confirmed to be a cut-down version of the track [...] "What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?", was released on April 19, 2013. In late April 2013, the official track listing of the two-disc deluxe edition was revealed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, at all events, {{whichever}} way <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> wrong," [...] cried {{they all}} with one voice--which {{was the only}} thing which they ever agreed about; and all pointed at once to all the thirty-and-two points of the compass, till Tom thought all the sign-posts in England had got together, and fallen fighting.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By no means--not for worlds,' said Merton. 'Kutuzoff is a Conscientious Objector. But <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> {{to shake}} hands with Miss Truman with that horrible ring? Sacred emblems {{enamelled}} on it,' said Merton, gingerly examining the jewel.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can talk}} now," [...] he said, as {{he rose to}} his feet; [...] "but in the future be mighty careful where those fellows are before opening your mouth about them. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to say?" ...|$|R
