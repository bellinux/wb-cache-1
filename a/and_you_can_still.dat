500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] {{is central}} to the 2004 Michael Winterbottom film 9 Songs, being one of the nine songs {{mentioned}} in the title. The movie charts the relationship of main characters Matt and Lisa from their initial meeting to the pair splitting up. Footage of the two attending a series of nine concerts at Brixton Academy, where they initially meet, is interspersed with scenes of the actors performing unsimulated sex. Matt and Lisa are already growing apart when Matt attends a Super Furry Animals concert at the Academy alone. Giving Lisa's ticket away as she [...] "didn't want to go" [...] the character comments: [...] "5000 people in a room <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> feel alone".

500|$|... "Our Man Bashir" [...] was {{the longest}} shoot of any single episode of Deep Space Nine, taking nine days to film instead of the normal seven. The episode {{required}} {{a great deal of}} stunt work and special equipment, such as stuntmen going through tempered glass instead of sugar glass because of the better glass breaking effect. There {{was a great deal of}} new sets used as well, which each took longer to set up camera and lighting for as the crew were not as familiar with them as the standing sets. The backdrop used for Mount Everest was rented, but the crew realised it lacked snow so they had to modify it and then return it to the original condition afterwards. The majority of the 1960s style technologies such as Dr. Noah's base, were all custom built in house and where parts moved they were generally manually operated off screen. Art director Herman Zimmerman said that [...] "Everything that could be manually operated was, because the brain is still smarter than most computers <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> do some things faster by hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Chicago study {{suggests}} that use of the Taser can interfere with heart function. A team of scientists and doctors at the Cook County hospital trauma center stunned 6 pigs with two 40-second Taser discharges across the chest.

500|$|Celilo Falls retains great {{cultural}} {{significance for}} native peoples. Ted Strong of the Intertribal Fish Commission told one historian, [...] "If {{you are an}} Indian person <b>and</b> <b>you</b> think, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> see all the characteristics of that waterfall. If <b>you</b> listen, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> hear its roar. If you inhale, the fragrances of mist and fish and water come back again."

Leguizamo describes the work thusly: [...] "Ghetto Klown is the history that I probably never should have told anyone but my therapist, but it's a real lesson that even if you suffer a certain amount (a lot) of self-doubt <b>and</b> anxiety, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> accomplish great things.

5000|$|Ten {{weeks after}} the war and {{resulting}} worldwide economic depression from the disruption in computer systems, Mr. Slippery returns to the Coven and learns that the Mailman may have survived. Fearing that Erythrina succumbed to temptation for power, Pollack visits her—Debbie Charteris of Providence, Rhode Island—in person. The elderly Charteris, an early military computer programmer, reveals that the Mailman was not an extraterrestrial, but a National Security Agency AI research project to protect government systems. Mistakenly left running, it slowly grew in power and sophistication, and used non real-time communication to disguise its inability to fully emulate the human mind. As Charteris succumbs to senility she transfers more of her personality to the defeated Mailman's kernel, and tells Pollack that [...] "when this body dies, I will still be, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> talk to me".|$|E
50|$|After the Great War the cricket {{field was}} again put into {{condition}} for play to be resumed, In early 1920 Salters Brewery {{was taken over}} by one of the large Brewery firms, and the threat of the Club losing the ground it had used {{for such a long time}} was very real. It was then that Mr Francis William Reckitt, an artist, who had lived in the town since 1904, stepped in and bought the whole property. He then had a modern club house erected as now, a hockey field laid out on what is now the 3rd team pitches, replacing the bowling greens, and hard and grass lawn tennis courts constructed. The hard courts were where the car park is today <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> see the brick built surrounds.

50|$|Today, Frank {{is a quiet}} {{residential}} {{community of}} about 200 people, with few hints of its promising past. It is {{the smallest of the}} five towns that amalgamated into the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass in 1979. The Frank Slide was designated a Provincial Historical Resource in 1977, and in 1985 the provincial government opened a major interpretive centre in Frank that explains the Frank Slide and the coal mining history of the region. The site of the original Frank townsite is now an industrial park, and many of the historic buildings in the north subdivision are gone, including Gebo’s stately mansion and the Catholic Church blown down by wind in 1917.

50|$|Significant part {{numbering}} {{systems are}} easier to use if {{you are trying to}} identify an item though the use of its code inside your company rather than a long description; however, many variations can start to appear when the code is used by other companies, which may be your distributors, and then people can become confused. Non-significant part numbers {{are easier to}} assign <b>and</b> manage. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> create a structure where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have a category and then a sequential number e.g. 231-1002 (2=Hardware 3=Screw 1=Phillips then the unique number 1002) This is also more efficient for data entry where using numbers and dashes are part of a normal keypad which means you don't have to use both hands on a keyboard. One other bonus is that people usually understand numbers easier, <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> store products in a warehouse, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> put items in numerical order (for example, lower numbers at one end of an aisle, <b>and</b> as <b>you</b> continue, the numbers increase).|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from normal}} {{operation}} {{access to your}} blade servers (e.g. SSH sessions to a Linux-based OS, RDP to a Windows-based OS etc.) there are roughly two ways to manage your server blades: via the iDRAC function or via the iKVM switch. Each blade in the enclosure comes with a built-in iDRAC {{that allows you to}} access the console over an IP connection. The iDRAC on a blade-server works {{in the same way as}} an iDRAC card on a rack or tower-server: there is a special iDRAC network to get access to the iDRAC function. In rack or tower-servers a dedicated iDRAC Ethernet interface connects to a management LAN. On blade-servers it works the same: via the CMC you configure the setup of iDRAC and access to the iDRAC of a blade is NOT linked to any of the on-board NICs: if all your server NICs would be down (thus all the on-motherboard NICs and also the Mezzanine B <b>and</b> C) <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> access the iDRAC.|$|R
