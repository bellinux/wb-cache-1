5|$|Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist Max Weber (1864–1920) are {{typically}} {{cited as the}} three principal architects of sociology. Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner, Lester F. Ward, W. E. B. Du Bois, Vilfredo Pareto, <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> Tocqueville, Werner Sombart, Thorstein Veblen, Ferdinand Tönnies, Georg Simmel and Karl Mannheim are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula also may include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber and Friedrich Engels as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology.

5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as great in the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E

25|$|The French Revolution has {{received}} {{enormous amounts of}} historical attention, both from {{the general public and}} from scholars and academics. The views of historians, in particular, have been characterised as falling along ideological lines, with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution. <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> Tocqueville argued that the Revolution was a manifestation of a more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance.|$|E
25|$|Various {{other early}} social historians and economists have gained {{recognition}} as classical sociologists, including Robert Michels (1876–1936), <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> Tocqueville (1805–1859), Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) and Thorstein Veblen (1857–1926). The classical sociological texts broadly differ from political philosophy {{in the attempt}} to remain scientific, systematic, structural, or dialectical, rather than purely moral, normative or subjective. The new class relations associated with the development of Capitalism are also key, further distinguishing sociological texts from the political philosophy of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras.|$|E
25|$|Several {{well-known}} {{figures have}} been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history.

Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer François Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker <b>Alexis</b> <b>de</b> Tocqueville, French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.|$|E
