50|$|On 24 July 2009, Al Megrahi's {{legal team}} made {{a request for}} him to be {{released}} from prison on compassionate grounds. Although it was not a precondition for compassionate release, his defence counsel lodged a request to abandon his second appeal on 12 August 2009, shortly after his private meeting with the Justice Secretary in Greenock jail on 4 August 2009. The <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> Megrahi's <b>appeal</b> was accepted by the High Court of Justiciary on 18 August 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Kate O'Regan, {{writing for}} a {{unanimous}} Court, {{noted that the}} Minister and Director-General were respectively the political and administrative heads {{of the national government}} department responsible for the implementation of the Act, and the foremost sources of knowledge about its terms and objectives and general application. Their last-minute <b>abandonment,</b> both <b>of</b> their <b>appeal</b> and <b>of</b> their opposition to the confirmation proceedings, was [...] "inconvenient and discourteous," [...] O'Regan wrote.|$|R
5000|$|... "Much more serious" [...] in its {{consequences}} was {{the absence of}} legal representation {{on behalf of the}} respondents at the hearing. Where the confirmation of an order of constitutional invalidity was under consideration by the court, O'Regan held, the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>appeal</b> did not {{put an end to the}} proceedings. The court still had to decide whether to confirm or vary or set aside the order. Moreover, the Court had to determine what ancillary orders should be made, if any. The relevant government department was best placed to assist the court in crafting such ancillary orders, by informing it of the potential disruption that an order of invalidity might cause. A common or frequent issue arising in such matters was the time the department would need to replace the unconstitutional provision.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{constitutional}} scheme, which [...] "recognises {{the separation of}} powers, holds high {{the rule of law}} and enjoins all organs of State to protect the Constitution," [...] the Constitutional Court had [...] "the special and onerous responsibility" [...] finally to determine {{the constitutional}}ity of legislation, and to declare unconstitutional legislation invalid. The court could best carry out this task if careful and detailed evidence and argument was placed before it by those in government qualified to do so, particularly when legislation was under challenge. If this is not done, [...] "the Court's ability to perform its constitutional mandate is hampered and the constitutional scheme itself may be put at risk. It is for these reasons," [...] O'Regan wrote, [...] "that the late <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appeal</b> and the absence of the respondents at the confirmation hearing were unfortunate." ...|$|R
60|$|Her eyes fell on Dick {{opposite}} {{her and she}} was both shocked and displeased. There were droppings of food all down the front of his coat; the mouth under the ragged ill-grown beard drooped sullenly; the forehead was lined and contracted; and on the lean temples the hair was a dusty indeterminate colour that might or might not have been called gray. The utter misery and self- <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> the man <b>appealed</b> to her, and at the bottom of her heart lay the wicked feeling that he was humbled and brought low who had once humbled her.|$|R

40|$|The Eleventh Aporia {{results from}} {{the breakup of the}} entire Greek {{philosophy}} previous to Aristotle in two manners of conceiving and proposing the first principles (archai), specially the One (to hen) : (i) the manner by which Physiologoi conceived the One as a principle, namely, assuming an underlying nature, different from the One in itself, not adequately characterized by the simple fact of being one and which is denoted by the concept of One, and (ii) the manner inaugurated by the Pythagoreans and later endorsed by Plato, marked by the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appeal</b> to an underlying nature and by conceiving the One in itself (auto to hen) as a principle, depriving it of any connection with some reality not strictly characterized by being one. Aristotle faces this aporia in Metaphysics Iota 2 and, according to the interpretation I propose: (a) refuses the Pythagorean-Platonic manner of conceiving and proposing principles, (b) endorses the course of action of the Physiologoi, and, in doing so, (c) steps back and retakes the “project” of the Physiologoi at the point where it was interrupted, namely, during the search for a principle of motion. From this scenario, I will try to show that the final outcome of the Eleventh Aporia can be the introduction of the Prime Mover as the properly Aristotelian (and cosmological) candidate to the title of One between the principles...|$|R

5000|$|In a suit {{brought by}} the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, the United States Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> for the Sixth Circuit held that the displays—in this case, a Ten Commandments display at the McCreary County {{courthouse}} in Whitley City, Kentucky and a Ten Commandments display at the Pulaski County courthouse—were unconstitutional. The appeal from that decision, argued by Mathew Staver of Liberty Counsel, urged reformulation or <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "Lemon test" [...] set forth in Lemon v.
