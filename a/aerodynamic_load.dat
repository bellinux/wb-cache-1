This flight, {{a repeat of the}} Little Joe 1 (LJ-1) launch, was to test a launch abort under high <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>load</b> conditions. After lift-off, the pressure sensing system was to indicate when the correct abort dynamic pressure was reached. This should have happened about thirty seconds after launch. A signal was sent to the explosive bolts to separate the spacecraft from the launch vehicle. Up to this point, everything was going as planned. The impulse was also intended to ignite the escape motor. The motor was ignited, but it took a number of seconds to build up thrust, and thus the abort maneuver was not accomplished at the desired dynamic pressure. Because of this, a repeat of the test was planned. Other events from launch through recovery occurred without incident. An altitude of 9 statute miles (14.5 km) and a range of 11.5 statute miles (18.5 km) were obtained, and a speed of 2,021.6 miles per hour (3,254 km/h) was reached. Flight time 8 minutes 11 seconds.

50|$|The {{equation}} for {{the equilibrium}} of cylindrical shells introduced by Donneli in NACA Report No. 479 {{to find the}} critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is applied to find critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under other loading conditions.

The influence of boundary conditions related to edge displacements in the shell median surface is discussed. The accuracy of thesolutions found is established by comparing them with previous theoretical solutions and with test results. The solution to a number of problems concerned with buckling of cylinders with simply supported edges {{on the basis of a}} unified viewpoint are presented in a convenient form for practical use.The continuing emphasis on aircraft designed for very high speed has resulted in a trend toward thicker skin and fewer stiffening elements.

The specific problems solved as a part of this research program are treated in detail in other papers.
