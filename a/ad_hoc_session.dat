40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzes}} {{individual and group}} heart rate responses in exercising adult women. The specific aim was to compare responses during routine workout sessions within a community exercise program with responses during a purpose-designed workout session targeting diverse motor skills. Sixty-seven adult women with a mean ± SD age of 65. 1 ± 11. 7 years participated in the study. Two representative sessions were analyzed: a standard workout session the women took at the local community center and an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>session</b> designed to build {{on a variety of}} motor skills and capabilities. Observational methodology was used to collect categorical data on motor skill performance during each session using the OSMOS-in context observation instrument. Continuous heart rate data were recorded for all participants during each session. A combined analysis of categorical and continuous data was undertaken using Hidden Markov Models. The results show that the session targeting a greater diversity of motor skills not only met the cardiovascular fitness recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine, but resulted in greater individual variability and greater synchrony between participants than the routine session.

The potential merits of the “flipped classroom” teaching approach for traditional courses with multiple class meetings are well-documented. For a guest lecturer already faced with limited in-class time, the flipped classroom may be particularly intriguing because technology transfers much of the content out of the classroom, allowing the instructor to use classroom time for collaborative exercises and practical applications. Despite those benefits, a guest lecture faces unique challenges that may limit the effectiveness of the flipped teaching model, such as limited ability to explain the format ahead of time or get student buy-in. Presenters share their own experiences using the flipped classroom format to teach upper level legal research lectures in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>sessions.</b> Using these experiences as a case study, presenters discuss the benefits and potential pitfalls of attempting the flipped classroom approach as a guest lecturer, as well as the logistics and technologies used to implement this increasingly popular teaching model.

Usually, information literacy programs focus primarily on students and their information needs. A survey among academic staff however showed knowledge gaps regarding important information resources and a fundamental need for research activities to be supported by information expertise. We also found that administrative staff of academic as well as non-academic departments have information needs of varied kinds. Since Bavaria’s curriculum for secondary education recognizes information skills as one of the key skills in society there is a growing need for training students and teachers alike. Arising from TUM’s strong link to its Alumni, these form another important target group of the library. At TUM library we realised a strong need to support these groups regarding their specific information requirements more systematically. As a consequence it has {{become an integral part of}} the library’s mission to respond individually to their different requirements. We offer tours, workshops and lectures which are tailored to specific needs and have been developed in close collaboration with our customers. Content and teaching methods differ accordingly from a treasure hunt for 6 th form students to a workshop on academic networking and bibliometrics for researchers. Some of the services are offered and communicated in collaboration with other support facilities at the university or embedded in the faculty curriculum, others started as <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>sessions.</b> The TUM initiative to address academic and non-academic staff as well as alumni in a more systematic way is part of the library’s program to change the library into the University Centre for Knowledge Management, part of which will be developed in the framework of the current IATUL Task Force action plan.

40|$|Abstract—Game design environments are {{traditionally}} used as means for engaging non-programmers {{in the learning}} process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> practical <b>sessions</b> with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used {{to compensate for the}} lack of computer support for solving design and computa-tional problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.

50|$|The {{start of}} the Great Leap Forward in 1958 came with a vehement attack on pure {{mathematics}} and intellectuals, which prompted Hua to shift towards applied mathematics. Hua developed, with Wang Yuan, a broad interest in linear programming, operations research, and multidimensional numerical integration. In connection {{with the last of}} these, the study of the Monte Carlo method and the role of uniform distribution led them to invent an alternative deterministic method based on ideas from algebraic number theory. Their theory was set out in Applications of Number Theory to Numerical Analysis, which was published much later, in 1978, and by Springer in English translation in 1981. The newfound interest in applicable mathematics took him in the 1960s, accompanied by a team of assistants, all over China to show workers of all kinds how to apply their reasoning faculty to the solution of shop-floor and everyday problems.
