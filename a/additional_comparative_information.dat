40|$|A {{series of}} regular reports that track {{services}} provided in NSW public hospitals and the timeliness {{with which they}} are delivered. Introduction Every day around 25, 000 people receive care in the NSW public hospital system. Hospital Quarterly is a series of regular reports that tracks services provided to the people of NSW and the timeliness {{with which they are}} provided. The Hospital Quarterly report is structured into two main sections. The first section describes measures of hospital activity and the second describes measures of hospital performance. Activity measures are used to describe the volume and type of services provided, while performance measures are used to describe the timeliness of service provision. Within the section on activity, data are provided for emergency department (ED) presentations; hospital admissions; and elective surgery procedures (Figure i). Within the section on performance, data are provided for ED presentations and elective surgical procedures (Figure ii). Hospital Quarterly appendix tables provide information about activity and performance in NSW public hospitals at a state, local health district (LHD), peer group and individual hospital level. <b>Additional</b> and <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> about activity and performance in NSW public hospitals is available on the BHI interactive online portal, Healthcare Observer, at bhi. nsw. gov. au/healthcare_observer...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present two methods {{applied to the}} {{annotation}} and evolutionary analysis of overlapping coding sequence (CDS) in single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viral genomes. The overlapping coding mode is utilized by RNA viruses to increase the coding potential within their short genomes. We discuss the complications this poses for gene finders and suggest methodologies which can improve annotations. We introduce the problems we are addressing and relevant previous work. We present two methods described in detail in the two methodological chapters. The application of these methods to ssRNA viral datasets form the bulk of two results chapters. In these chapters we also illustrate how our methods perform on simulated datasets (including goodness of fit tests). Our methods use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to infer the underlying genomic arrangements {{as well as the}} evolutionary pressures operating along the genome. The first method presents our novel HMM topology which allows for any nucleotide to code in up to three genes. This method uses only a single sequence and solves jointly for the best annotation/parameter set within the model definition (using an Expectation Maximisation algorithm). The second method is an extension using continuous time Markov processes to model the differences in evolutionary selection pressures along the genome. We use <b>additional</b> <b>comparative</b> sequence <b>information</b> to improve the annotation. We illustrate {{that it is possible to}} jointly solve for the protein coding annotation and the selection pressures operating along the HIV 2 genome within our extended Phylogenetic HMM method. We conclude with suggestions for areas of further work including incorporating RNA secondary structure conservation and reducing the methodological reliance on the input topologies and alignment.

40|$|People {{often do}} not walk the talk {{when it comes to}} pro-environmental behaviour. From a Norm Focus theory {{perspective}} what may be happening is that people are experiencing conflicting norms, that is, although pro-environmental behaviour is approved of (i. e., positive injunctive norms), a majority of people are not engaging in pro-environmental behaviour (negative descriptive norms). People therefore perceive inconsistencies in norms and this undermines motivation to engage in pro-environmental actions. The current study aims to investigate whether providing <b>comparative</b> outgroup <b>information</b> (i. e., positive injunctive and descriptive norms) can help overcome the demotivating effect of this type of norm conflict. The logic is that status threat is induced when ingroup members perceive that the outgroup is acting more positively than the ingroup. As such, ingroup members will align their behaviour with the injunctive norm in order to improve group status. To investigate this idea 106 first year psychology students took part in 2 (Norm: Norms aligned, norm conflict) x 2 (Comparative outgroup information: Presented, not presented) experiment and their pro-environmental intentions and energy conservation behaviour were measured following the manipulations. Consistent with hypotheses, results showed that <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> and norm conflict increased engagement in energy conservation behaviour. The same effect was not found on pro-environmental intentions, however, pro-environmental attitudes was found to moderate the effect of norm conflict and <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> such that participants with less positive environmental attitudes had higher intentions when faced with norm conflict and <b>comparative</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

Methods In this randomized controlled experiment, <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> on total hip or knee surgery was used as a test case. An online survey was distributed among 800 members of the NIVEL Insurants Panel and 76 hip- or knee surgery patients. Participants were assigned to one of four subgroups, who were shown 3, 7, 11 or 15 quality aspects of three hospitals. We conducted Kruskall-Wallis tests, Chi-square tests and hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses to examine relationships between the amount of information and consumer characteristics and skills (literacy, numeracy, active choice behaviour) on one hand, and outcome measures related to effectively using information (comprehension, perceived usefulness of information, hospital choice, ease of making a choice) on the other hand. Results 414 people (47 %) participated. Regression analysis showed that the amount of information slightly influenced the comprehension and the perceived usefulness of <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information.</b> It did not affect consumers’ hospital choice and ease of making this choice. Consumer characteristics (especially age) and skills (especially literacy) were the most important factors affecting the comprehension of information and the ease of making a hospital choice. For the perceived usefulness of <b>comparative</b> <b>information,</b> active choice behaviour was the most influencing factor. Conclusion The effects of the amount of information were not unambiguous. It remains unclear what the ideal amount of quality information to be presented would be. Reducing the amount of information will probably not automatically result in more effective use of <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information</b> by consumers. More important, consumer characteristics and skills appeared to be more influential factors contributing to information comprehension and use.

40|$|With {{respect to}} {{conveying}} useful <b>comparative</b> <b>information,</b> current biological classifications are seriously flawed because {{they fail to}} (i) standardize criteria for taxonomic ranking and (ii) equilibrate assignments of taxonomic rank across disparate kinds of organisms. In principle, these problems could be rectified by adopting a universal taxonomic yardstick based on absolute dates of the nodes in evolutionary trees. By using procedures of temporal banding described herein, a simple philosophy of biological classification is proposed that would retain a manageable number of categorical ranks yet apply them in standardized fashion to time-dated phylogenies. The phylogenetic knowledge required for a time-standardized nomenclature arguably may emerge {{in the foreseeable future}} from vast increases in multilocus DNA sequence information (coupled with continued attention to phylogeny estimation from traditional systematic data). By someday encapsulating time-dated phylogenies in a familiar yet modified hierarchical ranking scheme, a temporal-banding approach would improve the <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> content of biological classifications...|$|R
40|$|The Choquet {{expected}} {{utility model}} deals with nonadditive probabilities (or capacities). Their {{dependence on the}} information the decision-maker has {{about the possibility of}} the events is taken into account. Two kinds of information are examined: interval information (for instance, the percentage of white balls in an urn is between 60 % and 100 %) and <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> (for instance, the information that there are more white balls than black ones). Some implications are shown with regard to the core of the capacity and to two additive measures which can be derived from capacities: the Shapley value and the nucleolus. Interval information bounds prove to be satisfied by all probabilities in the core, but they are not necessarily satisfied by the nucleolus (when the core is empty) and the Shapley value. We must introduce the constrained nucleolus in order for these bounds to be satisfied, while the Shapley value {{does not seem to be}} adjustable. On the contrary, <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> inequalities prove to be not necessarily satisfied by all probabilities in the core and we must introduce the constrained core in order for these inequalities be satisfied. However, both the nucleolus and the Shapley value satisfy the <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> inequalities, and the Shapley value does it more strictly than the nucleolus.
