5|$|The film {{may have}} been {{inspired}} by the real 1909 strike of the New York City shirtwaist makers, but the strike ended without settlement. The scenario is bears the hallmarks of the successful dime novels with <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> resolution. Released on July 8, 1910, the film has received attention for presenting labor issues, but the film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, LeMond {{became the}} first non-European {{professional}} cyclist to win the Tour de France, and he remains the only American cyclist to have won the Tour. LeMond was accidentally shot with multiple pellets while hunting in 1987 and missed the next two Tours. He returned to the 1989 Tour, completing <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> comeback by winning in dramatic fashion on the race's final stage. He successfully defended his title the following year, claiming his third and final Tour victory in 1990, which made LeMond one of only seven riders who have won three or more Tours. He retired from competition in December 1994. He {{was inducted into the}} United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E

5|$|Earlier in {{the year}} manager George Graham had started to {{assemble}} a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders Steve Bould and Lee Dixon, he set about trimming the squad letting Steve Williams and Kenny Sansom leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title {{at the start of}} the season, but a 5–1 win away at Wimbledon on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> challenge – winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into stoppage time midfielder Michael Thomas scored the all-important second goal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test of the 2009 Ashes at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, Collingwood scored 64 {{in the first}} innings as England totalled 435. On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of Brad Haddin caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England slid to 70 for 5 and seemed certain to succumb to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5¾ hours (nearly {{the whole of the}} final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth man out, edging Peter Siddle to gully, but final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match to secure <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> draw.|$|E
5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
50|$|Having {{advanced}} on aggregate, Real now {{faced the}} Chicago Fire {{in the second}} round. With Mexican superstar Cuauhtemoc Blanco, the Fire would be tough to beat - especially in a single match in Chicago, where RSL had never won before. The teams played to a scoreless draw, and Salt Lake emerged victorious in the shootout (5-4) thanks to 3 huge saves by Rimando. <b>As</b> <b>improbable</b> as it seemed, RSL claimed the Eastern Conference championship and advanced to face the LA Galaxy in the final match for the MLS Cup.|$|R

5|$|The agents {{track down}} Weems, a {{handyman}} at an apartment building. He refuses {{to testify against}} Cutrona. Weems has a fascination with Rube Goldberg machines. As such, his apartment is filled with them. After meeting with Weems, Scully concludes {{that there is no}} X-File, but Mulder believes that his luck is the X-File in question. As the agents begin to leave the complex, one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems. However, the assassin dies in <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> cascade of events reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: after being distracted when Mulder buzzes the intercom (when he forgot the car keys), he accidentally shoots a lamp that knocks over an ironing board, then trips over the ironing board and ends up getting strangled in a fan. The two agents rush back up stairs and find Weems unscathed. Mulder notes that Weems was the sole survivor of a commuter jet crash that killed 20 people in December 1989, where he was placed in Seat 13 of Flight 7: lucky numbers.|$|E
5|$|Though the broad-billed parrot {{may have}} fed {{on the ground}} and been a weak flier, its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, {{implying}} some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the alula appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless kakapo, with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 34 in the First Test at Johannesburg, Harvey amassed 178 in {{the first}} innings of the Second Test at Cape Town, which set up a first innings lead of 248 runs. He then scored 23 not out to guide Australia to an eight-wicket victory in the second innings. This was {{followed}} by an unbeaten 151 in {{five and a half}} hours at Durban, regarded as one of his finest Test innings. Having been dismissed for 75 on a wet wicket {{in the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/59 in pursuit of a victory target of 336. On a crumbling, sticky pitch, the Australians were having extreme difficulty with the spin of Hugh Tayfield and faced their first Test defeat against South Africa for 39 years. Despite a few square cuts, Harvey adapted his game to play a patient innings, prompting heckling from spectators {{for the first time in}} his career. On 40, a ball from Tufty Mann broke through his defence and Harvey thought himself bowled, only to see that the ball had goven for byes. However, Mann and Tayfield began to tire in the heat and Harvey began to score more quickly, reaching 50 in 137 minutes by the lunch break. He registered his slowest ever century on his way to guiding his team to <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> victory by five wickets. Harvey brought up the winning runs by clipping a ball from Mann to the midwicket boundary.|$|E

5|$|In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal again {{participated in}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, after a six-year absence. Having beaten Glentoran of Northern Ireland, Portugal's Sporting Lisbon and Rouen of France, Arsenal played Romanian club Dinamo Bacău in the quarter-finals. A 1–9 victory on {{aggregate}} saw the club progress into the last four, where they faced Ajax of Amsterdam. The pairing of both clubs pleased Arsenal manager Bertie Mee, who wanted to play Ajax in the semi-finals {{to set up a}} possibility of meeting Internazionale in the final. At Highbury in the first leg, Arsenal won 3–0 and restricted Ajax to a 1–0 win at the Olympisch Stadion to reach the final of the Fairs Cup. It was the fourth successive year the final featured an English club and the first for a London club. Arsenal played Belgian opposition Anderlecht in the 1970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, played {{in the space of a}} week. Anderlecht won the first leg 3–1, with Arsenal midfielder Ray Kennedy scoring a crucial away goal, seven minutes from the final whistle. An early goal scored by Eddie Kelly helped Arsenal to what earlier looked to be <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> victory; John Radford and Jon Sammels overturned Anderlecht's advantage to win 3–0 on the night and 4–3 on aggregate. The result ended Arsenal's 17-year wait for a trophy and ensured the club became the third successive English club to win the honour.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{played in}} all five Tests, {{and in the}} First Test at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, he scored his first Test century. He {{compiled}} 101 in 150 minutes, helping Australia {{to a total of}} 413 after both opening batsmen were out without scoring. Hassett’s men {{went on to win the}} match by an innings. The Second Test was an eight-wicket victory for the Australians, this time dominated by Harvey's 178, with whom Loxton shared a 140-run stand for the fifth wicket, contributing 35 himself. He also took a wicket. The Third Test at Kingsmead in Durban was dramatic; batting first, South Africa made 311 and Hugh Tayfield then took 7/23 as Australia collapsed to 75 all out after the rain and sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket. During the first innings, Hassett changed his batting order so that his better batsmen were low down in the order so that they could bat in better conditions as the pitch stabilised. Loxton batted at No. 10 and Harvey at No. 9, but the Australians collapsed before the pitch had changed measurably. Not enforcing the follow-on, the South Africans batted again and were themselves bowled out for 99, losing their last seven wickets for 14 runs. This left Australia to chase 336 runs for victory, highly unlikely as the last 28 wickets had fallen for only 245. The tourists were still more than 200 runs in arrears when Loxton came in to join Harvey. On Loxton’s first ball, a delivery from Tayfield narrowly missed his edge. He survived to lunch after being caught from a no ball on the long on boundary from a lofted drive. With an unbeaten 151, Harvey took Australia to <b>an</b> <b>improbable</b> five-wicket victory, supported by his fellow Victorian, who scored 54 in a century partnership.|$|E
