40|$|Maritime States {{maintain}} that archipelagic State will {{interfere with the}} fluency of international navigation, since the waters, which were formerly territorial seas and high seas, have been redefined as being archipelagic waters. However, Profesor Hasjim Djalal opines that holding sovereignty over waters between islands is critical to attaining national unity for large archipelagic States. 1 An extension of the jurisdiction by a State may be regarded as undermining {{the freedom of the}} seas. In the course of the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the group of archipelagic States proposed that the regime of innocent passage right should prevail over foreign ships in archipelagic waters. The proposal provided that the right of innocent passage should be guaranteed on sea lanes prescribed by the coastal State. It was, however, rejected by maritime States. Just as the right of innocent passage is applied to the straits for international navigation, it is guaranteed in archipelagic waters. But the right of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lanes</b> <b>passage</b> applies to only certain sea lanes. The maritime States persistently endeavor to maintain right of free passage for their ships. The position of th...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) {{provides}} {{a delicate balance}} between the interests of archipelagic States such as Indonesia {{and the international community}} with respect to navigation. Indonesia recognises three navigation rights and freedoms within Indonesian waters: innocent passage, transit passage and <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lanes</b> <b>passage.</b> In addition, Indonesia and Malaysia have negotiated an additional passage right not mentioned in the LOSC called access and communication passage. The vagueness and ambiguity of the LOSC provisions on navigational rights and freedoms, as well as the absence of further guidance on their interpretation and implementation, have resulted in conflicting claims between Indonesia on one hand and the international community on the other. This thesis aims to provide an analysis of the legal issues relating to navigation through and over Indonesian waters. In particular, it aims to examine inconsistencies between Indonesian navigational regimes and those permitted by the LOSC to ascertain if Indonesia has applied the LOSC correctly and, if necessary, to propose reforms to harmonise national legislation with international law. Specifically, the thesis will first, explain the extent, historical development and concept of navigational regimes in the LOSC and international law in general. Second, it will analyse the implementation of the navigational provisions of the LOSC by Indonesia. Finally, it will provide recommendations concerning the harmonisation of the Indonesian domestic legal framework with international law...|$|E

40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) {{contained}} a specific section for “Archipelagic States” (Part IV) which are given many {{rights under the}} archipelagic regime including, if desired, to designate <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lanes</b> (ASLs) through their archipelagic waters.

This thesis examines {{the case of the}} Republic of the Philippines in designating ASLs and the influences impacting this process at the state and international levels. This thesis argues that the process of adoption of <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lanes</b> by mid-ocean <b>archipelagic</b> states is one which favours the maritime powers over the archipelagic states. Further, in relation to the Philippine case, the efforts of the Republic of the Philippines in repeating some actions undertaken by Indonesia during its case, will strengthen the international system bias and end in a result which will be the by-product of interests other than that of the Philippine state...|$|R
40|$|Freedoms of {{navigation}} and overflight (FON) are {{extremely important to}} Australia both economically and strategically. This is mainly because of Australia’s dependence on seaborne trade most of which passes through the archipelagos to our north and north-east. The archipelagic arc stretching from Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea (PNG) in the north, to the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji in the north-east has great strategic importance to Australia. This is the region from or through which a threat to Australia could most easily be posed. It is also the area that provides opportunities for Australia to work on common interests with the ultimate objective of a more secure and stable region. The countries in the archipelagic arc, {{with the exception of}} Timor-Leste and New Caledonia, are all archipelagic States under the regime of the archipelagic State established under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In a careful balancing of the interests of archipelagic States and the major maritime user States, rights {{of navigation}} and overflight through the waters of these countries are preserved through the regimes of innocent and <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lanes</b> (ASL) <b>passage.</b>  ...|$|R

40|$|Oil spills at sea {{are common}} in the {{shipping}} lanes of the ship {{as well as the}} locations of offshore oil drilling. Unfortunately, in every occurrence of the oil spill, we only see the effects after the occurrence, without knowing the original source. Indonesian Numerical Coastal Environmental Assessment (IndoNACE) is research collaboration between Indonesian and Germany by applying satellite data, numerical modeling, and field observations to make an assessment on environmental consequences to oil spills at sea. One of the locations of these research activities is Pari Island, Seribu Islands, North Jakarta. Simulation of hydrodynamic models around Pulau Pari with Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM) was performed using tides, surface winds, and density difference of seawater as input. Afterwards, by utilizing results of the hydrodynamic model, the spreading of oil spills as well as the origin of the oil spills were estimated using forward and backward trajectory models, respectively. In the case study of Pari Island, there is a presence of thin film of oil in 5 November 2015 that disappears after one day. We suggest that the origin of oil spills were found on the beach Pari Island is expected from the east - northeast of Thousand Islands and is likely from the subsea pipeline which runs from the north to the city of Jakarta or shipping lanes through the Indonesian <b>archipelagic</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lanes</b> (ALKI) I of Karimata Strait up to Java Sea and the Jakarta Bay...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed {{to learn about}} ocean wave {{characteristics}} and to identify times and areas with vulnerability to high waves in Indonesian waters. Significant wave height of Windwaves- 05 model output was used to obtain such information, with surface level wind data for 11 years period (2000 to 2010) from NCEP-NOAA as the input. The model output data was then validated using multimission satellite altimeter data obtained from Aviso. Further, the data were used to identify areas of high waves based on the high wave’s classification by WMO. From all of the processing results, the wave characteristics in Indonesian waters were identified, especially on ALKI (Indonesian <b>Archipelagic</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Lanes).</b> Along with it, which lanes that have high potential for dangerous waves and when it occurred were identified as well. The study concluded that throughout the years, Windwaves- 05 model had a magnificent performance in providing of ocean wave characteristics information in Indonesian waters.
