Kings <b>Bay</b> moved its head office from Oslo to Ny-Ålesund in 1990. New laboratories were built for the Natural Environment Research Council, the Alfred Wegener Institute and SINTEF in 1990 and 1991. From 1990 the Norwegian Mapping Authority moved into the old telemetry station and the following year Japan's National Institute of Polar Research moved into a renovated building at Hamnerabben. Lufttransport started serving the community with fixed-wing aircraft instead of helicopters. A 1992 government report concluded that Svalbard should focus on becoming an international research community, and the authorities started permitting foreign research institutes to establish permanents stations in Ny-Ålesund. Kings Bay sold 7,521 guest days in 1991, 1,720 of which were to researchers.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{distribution}} {{and numbers of}} dovekies during spring migration were studied by aerial surveys of eastern Lancaster Sound (1976, 1978, 1979) and western Baffin Bay (1978, 1979). Dovekies that nest in northwest Greenland migrated north through the study area during May. Extrapolations of recorded densities indicate that a peak of- 14 million dovekies may have been present in eastern Lancaster Sound and northwest Baffin Bay in mid-May 1978; fewer were present in May 1979, although the migration was more protracted and total numbers migrating through these areas may have been similar. Dovekies preferred offshore pack ice habitats with moderate to heavy ice cover. Possible reasons for the highly variable distributions {{in the three years}} are discussed.

40|$|Humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, of the Antarctic Area V stock, {{pass through}} Hervey Bay, Queensland, during their southward migration. As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} of the impact of commercial whalewatching in the <b>bay,</b> <b>aerial</b> surveys were conducted during the 1988 - 90 whalewatching seasons, and a photo-identification project was run over the 1988 season. In 1988, 60 pods containing 127 whales were observed. All pods were sighted on the transects in the eastern section of Hervey Bay, so surveys in 1989 and 1990 were confined to this area. In 1989, 223 whales in 121 pods were counted, and in 1990, 105 whales in 60 pods were observed. There was annual variation in the temporal pattern of the migration through Hervey Bay. Pods tended to occur in shallow water close to the western coast of Fraser Island and, on days when several whales were observed in the bay, pods were not distributed in a regular fashion. Mother-calf pods were the final cohort to migrate through the Bay. The recorded sizes of whale pods varied between observation platforms and averaged 1 · 75 — 2 · 81. In all, 100 whales were identified from photographs of natural marks. Most were photographed once only, although individual whales were sighted up to seven times. Of the 34 whales identified on more than one occasion, 24 were observed over a one- or two-day period. Pod sizes and residence times of whales in Hervey Bay resemble those of whales recorded at tropical breeding grounds. However, there are no data suggesting that Hervey Bay is of particular importance to any class of the humpback whale population migrating off the eastern coast of Australia...|$|R

40|$|Estimates of harem sizes in {{breeding}} {{colonies of}} the Cape fur seal in Namibia {{have been made}} in order to see if the demographic structure of the colonies is affected by the bull harvest. The population size and trends are monitored by aerial photographic surveys during the breeding period. Surveys take place soon after the pupping season in mid-December when the maximum number of animals is expected to be ashore. Photographs of the colonies are taken from the aircraft at an altitude of 350 - 400 feet. Two colonies were selected for this study, Cape Cross and Van Reenen Bay. Cape Cross is harvested, while Van Reenen Bay is not. At Cape Cross, aerial photographs from surveys in 1982 and 2003 were used, and at Van Reenen <b>Bay,</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs from surveys in 1984 and 2001 were used. Two transects were selected from each colony, and the number of bulls and females inside those transects were counted. One reader counted all areas. The harem size at Van Reenen Bay was in the range of 7. 9 and 9. 1 females per bull in 1984, and 7. 4 to 8. 5 in 2001. At Cape Cross, the harem size was in the range of 9. 5 to 12. 4 females per bull in 1982, and 14. 7 to 19. 7 in 2003. The significant increase in harem size at Cape Cross indicate that the bull harvest effects the structure of the colony, and that the number of socially mature bulls participating in formation of harems have decreased relative to the number of females in the colony. Decreases in the proportion of socially mature males may have long-term effects on populations because the productivity of colonies is related to the number and age of the males present. This must be considered when choosing harvesting strategies in the future...|$|R

This network of tide gauges and buoys helps the center to validate the arrivals of tsunami waves in the Indian Ocean region. To further supplement the cause, a network of seismographs has also been installed at appropriate positions to forecast the occurrence of tsunami-producing earthquakes. It has also installed three bottom pressure recorders in different regions to supplement its needs.|$|E
