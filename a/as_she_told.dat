5|$|Lasarra was {{a female}} protoss {{scientist}} stationed on Kaldir when it was attacked by zerg led by Sarah Kerrigan. The protoss were defeated; Lasarra was captured during the attack on Kaldir {{at the request of}} Abathur, who wanted to experiment on her even though it was known that the protoss could not be infested. Kerrigan agreed to spare Lasarra's life until she found a use for her. During her time onboard Kerrigan's leviathan, Lasarra interacted with Kerrigan a number of times. Kerrigan tried to justify her actions on Kaldir, saying that if the protoss could contact Shakuras, Kerrigan {{would not have been able}} to survive. However, Lasarra is unconvinced, saying that self-preservation is no justification for killing so many innocents. Eventually, Kerrigan admitted she could not and would not justify her actions, stating that both the zerg and protoss were killers. Eventually, as one of the protoss ships was able to break through the zerg blockade, Lasarra was implanted with a special larva and allowed to warp in to that ship. The larva devoured her and then other lifeforms being stored on the ship, evading detection. It eventually transformed into a broodmother, Niadra, which bred a new brood that infested the ship, killing every protoss on board. Kerrigan later showed some regret over Lasarra's death, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Izsha that she did not enjoy having to kill her.|$|E
25|$|Juliette Benzoni's {{maiden name}} was Andrée-Marguerite–Juliette Mangin. She was the {{daughter}} of Marie-Susanne Arnold (with Alsace and Swiss Switzerland origin) and Charles-Hubert Mangin. She grew up in an upper-middle-class family in Paris. At the age of nine she discovered in a book Joan of Arc, at the stake and that was the moment her passion for history was awakened. It was her father who persuaded her to read the books of Alexander Dumas <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> 2002 the Magazine Littéraire for the two hundred anniversary of that famous author.|$|E
25|$|On 20 April 1956, Maria married Johan Gerardus Wolkefeld, a 21-year-old Dutch Catholic. On 15 February 1957, {{she gave}} birth to a son, the first of ten children. However, Maria {{did not seem to be}} contented. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> De Telegraaf, she often had rows with her mother, who lived nearby. She also said she still longed for her Malayan homeland. Johan and Mansoor began corresponding. In letters both {{expressed}} wish for Maria to travel to Malaya to visit the aged Aminah, but such trip was never made due primarily to financial difficulties. Aminah died in 1976 and Mansoor would die of a heart attack in 1988.|$|E

500|$|The travel motif is seen {{throughout}} Angelou's {{series of}} autobiographies, emphasizing what Lupton describes as Angelou's [...] "continuing journey of the self". [...] Angelou continues the travel motif in Traveling Shoes, as evidenced in the book's title, but her primary motivation in living in Africa, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> interviewer George Plimpton, was [...] "trying to get home". [...] Angelou not only relates her own journey of an African-American woman {{searching for a}} home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, whom McPherson compares to the descriptions of white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s by Ernest Hemingway and Henry James.|$|E
500|$|Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, John Mayer, Jennifer Hudson, Usher, Jermaine Jackson, and Shaheen Jafargholi {{performed}} at the event. Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson gave eulogies, while Queen Latifah read [...] "We Had Him", a poem written for the occasion by Maya Angelou. The Reverend Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway." [...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> the crowd: [...] "Ever since I was born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father you could ever imagine ... I just wanted to say I love him ... so much." [...] Reverend Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer.|$|E

500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> him that she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing {{a poor job of}} communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E
500|$|Nixon and Broderick also crafted the {{character}} as a darkly brooding and mysterious {{man in the}} same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, Edward Rochester from Jane Eyre, and Maxim de Winter from Rebecca. Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Soap Opera Weekly, [...] "In doing the 'stolen life' story, I felt that we needed something to follow that was also a little larger than life, very romantic, and gothic." [...] The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines. Maxim de Winter's estate, Manderley, provided the inspiration for Dimitri's Pine Valley estate, Wildwind. The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier's book and the depiction from the film Rebecca, a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mr. Rochester, the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman.|$|E
500|$|At first, Angelou {{intended}} {{to return to}} poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and {{so that she could}} [...] "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, [...] "I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression". [...] <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, [...] "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful". [...] She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.|$|E

500|$|Rodham and Bill Clinton {{bought a}} house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him. Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist {{ceremony}} in their living room. A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham. The motivation was to keep the couple's professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> a friend at the time, [...] "it showed that I was still me." [...] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers. Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock. There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence. She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law while also working pro bono in child advocacy; she rarely performed litigation work in court.|$|E
500|$|Also in Traveling Shoes, Angelou came {{to terms}} with her {{difficult}} past, both as a descendent of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African America who had experienced racism. [...] <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> an interviewer, she brought her son to Ghana {{to protect him from}} the negative effects of racism because she did not think he had the tools to withstand them. For the first time in Angelou's life, she did not [...] "feel threatened by racial hate" [...] in Ghana. The theme of racism was still an important theme in Traveling Shoes, but she has matured in the way she dealt with it. As Hagen stated, Angelou was [...] "not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed". This was demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the [...] "genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading", something that has often been overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers. [...] Angelou was taught an important lesson about combating racism by Malcolm X, who compared it to a mountain in which everyone's efforts was needed to overcome it.|$|E
500|$|In late 1992 it was {{announced}} that because of the success of The Who's Tommy, it would be produced for Broadway and open in April 1993. The production cost eight million dollars and it broke the box office record for the biggest non-opening day with US$494,897 earned on April 23, 1993 at St. James Theatre (where the musical opened on April 22), [...] beating Guys and Dolls 1992 record. Des McAnuff, who directed the musical at both La Jolla Playhouse and on Broadway, decided to bring many actors from the original cast with him despite weeks of auditions with thousands of actors trying out for the roles in front of him. The Broadway production featured some changes to the musical, such as a new song devoted to Tommy's parents that Gaven thought [...] "helps show their side of the story." [...] However, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> The San Diego Union-Tribune, the biggest difference was the increased amount of money she earned. Gaven was praised by critics for her portrayal of Mrs. Walker in the Broadway production, with one critic from The Miami Herald writing that her [...] "alluring alto voice makes you wish Tommy's mother had even more to sing." ...|$|E

500|$|The travel motif is a {{recurring}} theme in Traveling Shoes, as evidenced in the book's title, but Angelou's primary motivation in living in Africa, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> interviewer George Plimpton, was [...] "trying to get home". Angelou not only related her own journey of an African-American woman searching for a home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, whom McPherson compared to the descriptions of white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s by Ernest Hemingway and Henry James. Angelou's issues were resolved {{at the end of}} Traveling Shoes when she decided to return to America. She called her departure a [...] "second leave-taking", and compared it to the last time she left her son with his grandmother in Singin' and Swingin' when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors. As Lupton states, [...] "Angelou's journey from Africa back to America is in certain ways a restatement of the historical phase known as mid-passage, when slaves were brutally transported in ships from West Africa to the so-called New World". Even though Angelou's final autobiography A Song Flung Up to Heaven took place in her home country, the travel motif continued. [...] Reviewer Patricia Elam described Song as a [...] "journey through an authentic and artistic life".|$|E
500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E
