5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to ride in}} Canada, Kelly {{rode the}} 1976 Tour of Britain {{and then went to}} Metz, in France, after a London enthusiast, Johnny Morris, had {{arranged}} an invitation. The club offered him £25 a week, free accommodation and four francs a kilometre for every race he won. Kelly won 18 of the 25 races he started in France and won the amateur Giro di Lombardia in Italy. That impressed two French team managers, Jean de Gribaldy and Cyrille Guimard. De Gribaldy went to Ireland unannounced to discuss a contract with the Flandria professional team. He didn't know where Kelly lived and wasn't sure he would recognise him. He took with him another cyclist, to point out Kelly and translate the conversation. Kelly was out driving a tractor and de Gribaldy set out again in the taxi that had brought him from Dublin, hoping to find Kelly as he drove home. They found him and went to Kelly's stepbrother's house. De Gribaldy offered £4,000 a year plus bonuses. A week later Kelly asked for £6,000 and got it. He signed for de Gribaldy with misgivings <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> on his promise to return to Metz, where the club had offered him better terms than before.|$|E

500|$|In late 2011, Garbage {{announced}} {{their return to}} touring upon the release of Not Your Kind of People, marking the band's first live performances since 2007, and their first tour since 2005. [...] "Thinking <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> on the road is both thrilling and terrifying in equal measure," [...] Manson stated, [...] "...but we've always enjoyed a little pain mixed in with our pleasure." [...] Manson considered that self-reflection helped {{change the way the}} group approached touring, and, as a result, [...] "we're playing the best shows of our career." [...] Eric Avery, who performed with the band during their Bleed Like Me tour, rejoined them as the tour bassist. The band played concerts throughout North and South America, Europe, Oceania and Asia.|$|E
500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what I asked him to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E
500|$|The North American {{release was}} {{scheduled}} for July 11, 2008, but was delayed until August 15, before being brought forward to August 13. As {{a result of the}} move from July, 20th Century Fox moved its family comedy Meet Dave in the open slot. The August 13 release date was also the opening weekends for the animated family film [...] and the horror film Mirrors. Studios consider the third week of August to be a weaker performing period than earlier in the summer because of students returning to school. Previous R-rated comedies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Superbad were released in mid-August and performed well at the box office. Reacting to Tropic Thunders release date, Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, stated: [...] "For a young person at the end of summer, you want to have some fun and forget <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to school. What better than a crazy comedy?" ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{turned down}} an offer in 1947 {{to return to his}} old employer, Trinidad Leaseholds, in 1954 Constantine agreed to join the same company as an {{assistant}} legal advisor. Uncertain <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to Trinidad after living for 25 years in England, he nevertheless believed it was a good time to return, particularly as his daughter was moving there to marry. Before leaving England, he published his book Colour Bar (1954), which addressed race relations in Britain and the racism he had experienced. It also discussed worldwide racial oppression and how the lives of black people could be improved. At the time, according to Peter Mason, this was [...] "an explosive, challenging, hard hitting tome, the more so because it came not from a known black militant but from someone who seemed so charming, so unruffled, so suited to British society". Although not viewed as radical by black audiences, it was aimed at white British readers. The British press gave it mixed reviews and criticised him for unfairness in parts of the book; other critics accused him of communist sympathies.|$|E

When they withdrew {{to the safety of}} the base, the missing goggles were highlighted and McLaren was the last person to see them. Later that night, at 2:19am (local time) on the 4 July, McLaren left the base on his own ostensibly to search for the missing kit. It was noted that he had talked <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> for the goggles.|$|E
2500|$|Carlisle is a {{supporter}} of several causes. She has been an ardent supporter of LGBT rights, which she made public after her son, James, came out to her at age fourteen. Carlisle is also a vegetarian and {{a supporter}} of animal rights. She and her bandmates were the first stars to pose for PETA's [...] "Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" [...] campaign in 1990. In a 2013 interview, she talked <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to vegetarianism after a long break, stating that [...] "I fell off the vegetarian wagon and never felt good about it. I wouldn't let myself think of my plate of meat as an animal, but I knew deep inside it was, and actually it was gross, especially chicken. I was full of shame. Then I started practicing yoga, which is all about nonviolence, and realized eating meat isn't compatible with that. Now I teach yoga, and I'm so full of pride not to support factory farms and to be socially responsible." [...] She contributed her song [...] "Bless the Beasts and the Children" [...] to the album Tame Yourself to benefit PETA.|$|E

But I'm so pleased I did, {{it was the right}} decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine".

As soon as he was out of sight, Colville had an impulse to hurry after him and rejoin him; then he felt like turning <b>about</b> and <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to his hotel.|$|R

He brought portions of his work, from time to time, to Miss Theo and her sister: Hetty yawned over the work, but Theo pronounced it to be still more beautiful and admirable than the last, which was perfect.|$|R
