40|$|A {{continuous}} {{stirred tank}} reactor (CSTR) {{is a typical}} example of chemical industrial equipment, whose dynamics represent an extensive class of second order nonlinear systems. It has been witnessed that designing a good control algorithm for the CSTR is very challenging due to the high complexity. The two difficult issues in CSTR control are state estimation and external disturbance attenuation. In general, in industrial process control a fast and robust response is essential. Driven by these challenging issues and desired performance, this paper proposes <b>an</b> output <b>feedback</b> <b>terminal</b> sliding mode control (TSMC) framework which is developed for CSTR, and can estimate the system states and stabilize the system output tracking error to zero in a finite time. The corresponding stability analysis is presented {{in terms of the}} Lyapunov method. Illustrative examples are demonstrated by using Matlab simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Concurrent {{feedback}} is more detrimental for long-term retention of motor skills because learners depend on accessible visual information provided {{in parallel with}} movements. However, visual informa-tion is not always accessible. Furthermore, the effects of concurrent feedback vary with aspects of the task being performed. We investigated the effects of inaccessible visual feedback used concurrently or terminally, focusing on aspects of movement. [Subjects and Methods] Fourteen subjects were quasi-randomly assigned to either <b>a</b> concur-rent <b>feedback</b> group or <b>a</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> group. They practiced a task that involved right shoulder flexion with a specific acceleration. Learning achievements were assessed by measurement of errors in movement duration, peak timing, and strength. [Results] Regarding errors in movement duration, the concurrent feedback group was superior to the <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> group during the midterm and final sessions. Regarding errors in peak timing, learning occurred in the concurrent feedback group, {{but not in the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> group because the improvement in performance during practice was inadequate. Regarding errors in peak strength, learning occurred in both groups. [Conclusion] Concurrent visual feedback that is used inaccessibly has learning effects that either equal or surpass those of <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> that is used with inaccessible visual information for all parameters...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive Horizon Model Predictive Control (AHMPC) is {{a scheme}} for varying as needed the horizon length of Model Predictive Control (MPC). Its {{goal is to}} achieve {{stabilization}} with horizons as small as possible so that MPC {{can be used on}} faster or more complicated dynamic processes. Beside the standard requirements of MPC including a terminal cost that is a control Lyapunov function, AHMPC requires <b>a</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> that turns the control Lyapunov function into a standard Lyapunov function in some domain around the operating point. But this domain need not be known explicitly. MPC does not compute off-line the optimal cost and the optimal <b>feedback</b> over <b>a</b> large domain instead it computes these quantities on-line when and where they are needed. AHMPC does not compute off-line the domain on which the terminal cost is a control Lyapunov function instead it computes on-line when a state is in this domain...|$|R
40|$|Reaches are adapted and {{proprioceptive}} {{sense of}} hand position is partially recalibrated after training with continuous, misaligned visual feedback. When visual feedback is provided {{only at the}} end of the movement, it is unclear if similar changes arise. To test this, participants reached to targets, first with aligned-cursor, then three times with rotated-cursor. After each block, we measured no-cursor reaches and perceived felt hand positions relative to a reference marker. We found that reach aftereffects were slightly smaller than that following training with continuous visual <b>feedback.</b> Additionally, <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> participants incrementally recalibrated their sense of felt hand position over the rotated training blocks. Final proprioceptive recalibration levels were comparable to those in our continuous feedback study. Thus, compared to continuous <b>feedback</b> findings, <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> produced significant, yet smaller, reach aftereffects but similar changes in hand proprioception. Taken together, <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> is sufficient to drive motor adaptation and proprioceptive recalibration...|$|R
40|$|Concurrent {{feedback}} is the continuous {{provision of information}} regarding task performance given during the performance, while <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> is the provision of this information only {{at the conclusion of}} the task. The following study examined performance on VO 2 max tests (VO 2 max, time to exhaustion, HR and RER) using these two types of feedback. Participants consisted of 14 males and 10 females with a mean age of 21. 7 ± 2 years. Stratified random sampling was used to assign participants to either concurrent or <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback.</b> The two groups (n= 12) were treated to a split-halves-transfer design upon completion of the first test. There were four separate groups: concurrent to concurrent feedback (CC), concurrent to <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> (CT), <b>terminal</b> to concurrent <b>feedback</b> (TC), and <b>terminal</b> to <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> (TT). Seven days transpired between the two tests. From the original sample of 24 participants, 21 completed all testing and were included in the data analysis. The <b>terminal</b> to concurrent <b>feedback</b> group (TC) showed a significant increase in VO 2 max evidenced by the significant test by group interaction (F 3, 17 = 3. 28, p = 0. 047). This finding suggests that using concurrent <b>feedback</b> as <b>a</b> form of motivation can elicit a greater VO 2 max compared with <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback...</b>|$|R
40|$|Theme: Care of the Professional VoiceThe {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> on the learning of relaxed phonation using a motor learning paradigm. Twelve dysphonic participants were evenly and randomly assigned to two groups of conditions: with <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> and without <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback.</b> During training, all {{participants were asked to}} read aloud sentence stimuli with four Chinese characters. Participants in the <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> group received surface electromyographic (sEMG) biofeedback from the thyrohyoid site after reading every two sentences. Participants in the ‘no feedback’ group did not receive any feedback throughout the training sessions. A delayed retention test was conducted one week after training to evaluate motor learning. Results showed that motor learning was achieved in the ‘no feedback’ group, as demonstrated by a greater reduction of sEMG levels at the thyrohyoid site, comparing to the <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> group. In order to assess how the participants perceived their learning, Voice Activity and Participation Profile (VAPP) (Ma & Yiu, 2001) was used. A great reduction in the Total VAPP scores during the pre- and posttreatment measurements was obtained from participants in the <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> group. However, <b>an</b> increase in the Total VAPP scores was observed in the ‘no feedback’ group. The results indicated that participants’ perception towards their learning was affected by the amount of feedback they received during therapy and their perceptions did not necessarily parallel the actual benefits of the therapy. In summary, motor learning was evidenced in the ‘no feedback group’, which supported the hypothesis that provision of few or no <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> would be more beneficial to motor learning as there was no concentration of attention focus on the laryngeal area with the absence of feedback...|$|R

40|$|Prism {{adaptation}} causes profound negative aftereffects {{in healthy}} control participants {{and even more}} so in hemispatial neglect patients where {{it has been reported that}} neglect patients are not aware of the perturbation caused by the prisms. Additionally, the use of prisms on alleviating the symptoms of neglect has also been investigated (Rossetti et al., 1998). In an attempt to mimic the unaware experience of neglect in controls, participants have been introduced to a gradual increment in prism strength below the level of conscious awareness, resulting in greater aftereffects (Michel et al., 2007), a finding contradictory to that of Dewar (1971) who argued that it was the number of exposure trials at a large perturbation that induces greater aftereffects. The present study aimed to recreate greater aftereffects in participants without the use of prisms by deviating the <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> line by <b>a</b> set amount, creating <b>a</b> false <b>feedback</b> paradigm. There were three conditions, a single group who experience a 10 ˚ shift of <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback</b> line from <b>terminal</b> position, a graded group who experienced a shift by a constant amount every point, below the level of conscious awareness, thus mimicking the multi-step group described by Michel et al. (2007) and a group that wore 10 ˚ prisms and received valid <b>terminal</b> <b>feedback.</b> Only knowledge of results was given as feedback. Analysis revealed no significant difference in magnitude of aftereffect at the final open loop block or overall. Finally, a neglect patient, JM, was exposed to 100 10 ˚ false <b>feedback</b> trials in <b>an</b> attempt to recreate the findings of Rossetti et al. (1998). Aftereffects for JM were not as large as those reported by Rossetti et al. (1998) as JM no longer suffered from neglect by the time of intervention. The usefulness for the false feedback paradigm in rehabilitating neglect is then discussed...|$|R
