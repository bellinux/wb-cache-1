5|$|It {{was while}} {{operating}} off the Iberian Peninsula that Collier devised {{a need for}} an improved type of ships' boat. He developed a design based on elements of both a whaleboat and <b>a</b> <b>jolly</b> boat, and had one built for him at Plymouth Dockyard. The boat proved extremely useful after tests aboard the Surveillante, especially at being able to land safely on a flat beach to give close support. Collier further modified it by installing a howitzer in the bows, and soon boats of its type were being requested by other captains for their ships. In 1813 Collier succeeded Sir Home Popham in commanding the north coast squadron, Spain. He and a small squadron supported General Arthur Wellesley and General Sir Thomas Graham in the capture of San Sebastián and the siege of Bayonne.|$|E

25|$|Jolly {{boats were}} usually the {{smallest}} type of boat carried on ships, and were generally between 16 and 18 feet long. They were clinker-built and propelled by four or six oars. When {{not in use}} the jolly boat normally hung from davits at the stern of a ship, and could be hoisted {{into and out of}} the water. Jolly boats were used for transporting people and goods to and from shore, for carrying out inspections of the ship, or other small tasks and duties that required only a small number of people, and did not need the use of the larger boats, such as the launch or cutter. Jolly boats were carried on practically all types of warships of the Royal Navy during the age of sail, from ships of the line down to sloops and brigs. Ships of the line would carry a barge, launch, pinnace, two cutters, all of various sizes, and <b>a</b> <b>jolly</b> boat, while the brigs might just carry <b>a</b> <b>jolly</b> boat and a cutter.|$|E

25|$|Shadrake Alan v. Attorney-General is a 2011 {{judgment}} of the Court of Appeal of Singapore that clarified the law relating to the offence of scandalizing the court. Alan Shadrake, {{the author of the}} book Once <b>a</b> <b>Jolly</b> Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock (2010), was charged with contempt of court by way of scandalizing the court. The Prosecution alleged that certain passages in his book asserted that the Singapore judiciary lacks independence, succumbs to political and economic pressure, and takes a person's position in society into account when sentencing; and that it is the method by which Singapore's ruling party, the People's Action Party, stifles political dissent in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|As {{the premier}} cover {{illustrator}} for the enormously popular Saturday Evening Post {{for much of}} the first half of the 20th century, Leyendecker's work both reflected and helped mold many of the visual aspects of the era's culture in America. The mainstream image of Santa Claus as <b>a</b> <b>jolly</b> fat man in a red fur-trimmed coat was popularized by Leyendecker, as was the image of the New Year Baby. The tradition of giving flowers as a gift on Mother's Day was started by Leyendecker's May 30, 1914 Saturday Evening Post cover depicting a young bellhop carrying hyacinths. It was created as a commemoration of President Woodrow Wilson's declaration of Mother's Day as an official holiday that year.|$|E

25|$|While an {{employee}} of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in 1854, Baker was serving as Second Officer aboard the Douro, a passenger vessel. As the ship was sailing near the Paracel Islands it struck the north shoal and was wrecked. On 26 May, accompanied by seven volunteers, Baker took <b>a</b> <b>Jolly</b> boat and set out for Hainan which he estimated was 123 miles away. According to the log he kept, on arrival at the island of Hainan they were unable to locate signs of habitation, so the decision was made by him to head for Hong Kong. The first vessels they encountered on their journey turned out to be pirates who refused food, water, and other assistance unless the crew allowed themselves to be stripped of all valuables. The boat was able to escape, facing adverse weather conditions and taking on water.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of the jolly boat was developed further during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, particularly by the frigate commander Sir George Collier. Collier, who {{was active in the}} close blockade of the Spanish coast during the Peninsular War, combined the features of <b>a</b> <b>jolly</b> boat with those of a whaleboat and found the result extremely seaworthy and particularly effective in carrying out shore landings. The design was particularly buoyant and was often described as a type of lifeboat. Several captains ordered these boats for their own ships, while the Admiralty considered the possibility of ordering a general replacement of old-style jolly boats with the new 'lifeboat' design on several occasions, but were deterred by the cost. By 1815 however the Stores Committee had authorised the replacement of the old-style jolly boats with the improved versions as and when it proved practical for a ship's commander to carry this out.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Ready for the Plaintiff, Belli noted {{examples}} of negligence cited {{by himself and}} other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the municipal code because {{of the effect of}} the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of Vitreous marble, whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell {{off the side of the}} building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise <b>a</b> <b>Jolly</b> Roger flag over his Montgomery Street office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{trained in}} the infantry tank ('I' tank) role on Churchill tanks, and {{in the winter of}} 1942–43 was mobilised for the Allied invasion of Sicily. But the orders were changed, 144 RAC had to hand its Churchills over to a Canadian regiment, and was re-equipped instead with Sherman tanks. The following autumn it reverted to Churchills, then finally, in the winter of 1943–44, it was converted back to Shermans for the Normandy landings. The training was also broadened and 33rd Tank Brigade was redesignated 33rd Armoured Brigade. The plan was still for it to land in the infantry tank role, supporting 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, but if one of the armoured divisions suffered heavy casualties, 33rd would be ready to switch roles and replace its armoured brigade. It was therefore equipped with a proportion of Sherman Firefly tanks armed with the 17-pounder, and the tank gunners practised with this weapon at Holkham Field Firing Range. Lieutenant Colonel <b>A.</b> <b>Jolly,</b> Royal Tank Regiment, (later General Sir Alan Jolly), took command on 10 April 1944.|$|E
