500|$|The delays proved {{beneficial}} in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes {{so that the}} shark was only hinted at. For example, {{for much of the}} shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels. The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie, but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged <b>and</b> <b>yanked</b> by cables to simulate an attack. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin. This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the film's suspense. As Spielberg put it years later, [...] "The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a Hitchcock, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get thriller." [...] In another interview, he similarly declared, [...] "The shark not working was a godsend. It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock than like Ray Harryhausen." [...] The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark: [...] "The more fake the shark looked in the water, the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances." ...|$|E
2500|$|The torture was {{conducted}} publicly in the captors' village, {{and the entire}} population (including children) watched and participated. Common torture techniques included burning the captive, which was done one hot coal at a time, rather than on firewood pyres; cutting with knives, beatings with switches or sticks, and jabs from sharp sticks. [...] Prisoners' fingernails were ripped out. Their fingers were broken, then twisted <b>and</b> <b>yanked</b> by children. [...] Captives were made to eat pieces of their own flesh, and were scalped alive. To make the torture last longer, the Native Americans would revive captives with rest periods during which time they were given food and water. [...] Tortures typically began on the lower limbs, then gradually spread to the arms, then the torso. [...] The Native Americans spoke of [...] "caressing" [...] the prisoners gently at first, which meant that the initial tortures were designed to cause pain, but only minimal bodily harm. [...] By these means, the execution of a captive, especially an adult male, could take several days and nights.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was an even}} {{bet that}} Clarence had {{procured}} that favor for me --and furnished the language, too. When that formidable lance-point was within a yard {{and a half of}} my breast I twitched my horse aside without an effort, and the big knight swept by, scoring a blank. I got plenty of applause that time. We turned, braced up, and down we came again. Another blank for the knight, a roar of applause for me. This same thing was repeated once more; and it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that Sir Sagramor lost his temper, and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task of chasing me down. Why, he hadn't any show in the world at that; it was a game of tag, with all the advantage on my side; I whirled out of his path with ease whenever I chose, and once I slapped him on the back as I went to the rear. Finally I took the chase into my own hands; and after that, turn, or twist, or do what he would, he was never able to get behind me again; he found himself always in front {{at the end of his}} maneuver. So he gave up that business and retired to his end of the lists. His temper was clear gone now, and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed of mine. I slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle, and grasped the coil in my right hand. This time you should have seen him come!--it was a business trip, sure; by his gait there was blood in his eye. I was sitting my horse at ease, and swinging the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head; the moment he was under way, I started for him; when the space between us had narrowed to forty feet, I sent the snaky spirals of the rope a-cleaving through the air, then darted aside and faced about and brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under him for a surge. The next moment the rope sprang taut <b>and</b> <b>yanked</b> Sir Sagramor out of the saddle! Great Scott, but there was a sensation! ...|$|E
