5|$|In August 1990, {{the band}} {{travelled}} to Florida {{to work on}} the album. Scott Burns reprised his role as producer and audio engineer, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> a major advantage: Sepultura were at his home studio, Morrisound, a studio properly equipped to record their music style. Their label Roadrunner granted a $40,000 budget, which helped explain the album's improved production values. That allowed Igor and Burns, for example, to spend a whole week just testing the drum kit's tunings and experimenting with microphone practice.|$|E
5|$|Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, Frederick the Great's prime minister, {{believed}} that any Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would shift {{the balance of}} power in the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence. Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won: thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted wars in Silesia and Bohemia, resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of Silesia, <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>with</b> the economy and society modernizing under his direction, Prussia was emerging as a world power. In the Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, Frederick had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European powers of France, Russia, Britain and Austria. To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the Electorate of Saxony, ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Reyes meet in an FBI records room, {{where she}} divulges {{the story about}} the death of Doggett’s son, Luke: years ago, when Doggett’s son disappeared, the FBI were called in to investigate. Reyes was one of the agents on the case. They never found the killer, and when they {{discovered}} Luke’s body, both Reyes and Doggett saw it transform into ashes instantly. Reyes says that Doggett has spent the last few years convincing himself he did not see it. Reyes believes it was a psychic clue, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> the other crime scene, she has seen it again.|$|E

5|$|The French cavalry {{had been}} {{hindered}} in its movements by the broken terrain and thus far unable to really bother Zieten's infantry squares. Consequently, Blücher {{was able to}} lead an exemplary retreat up to Fromentières and Janvilliers. However, once past these villages, the terrain became flat and even, proper for cavalry action, <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>with</b> the increasingly aggressive action of the enemy cavalry against his flank and rear, Zieten and his brigade became increasingly isolated. Grouchy, with the divisions of Doumerc and Saint-Germain was now boldly menacing Zieten's right, while on his left, the Prussian general saw Nansouty's Guard cavalry (Laferrière-Levesque's division, plus the four service squadrons, under Lefebvre-Desnouettes). Zieten's brigade was finally {{cut off from the}} rest of the army and charged violently by Grouchy's cuirassiers, who broke the infantry squares and took no less than 2,000 prisoners, with the rest of the brigade routed.|$|E

25|$|After Christie's {{death in}} 1976, her estate, principally managed by her {{daughter}} Rosalind Hicks, relaxed this ruling and Why Didn't They Ask Evans {{was the first}} major production that resulted. Evans attracted large audiences and satisfactory reviews, but more importantly, it demonstrated to television executives that Christie's work could be successful for the small screen given the right budgets, stars and attention to detail – Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime, Miss Marple with Joan Hickson (who had a minor role in Evans), Agatha Christie's Poirot with David Suchet and Marple with Geraldine McEwan, until her retirement, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> Julia Mackenzie, can all trace their style and successes back to this 1980 adaptation.|$|E

25|$|Williams College is {{the site}} of the Hopkins Observatory, the oldest extant astronomical {{observatory}} in the United States. Erected in 1836–1838, it now contains the Mehlin Museum of Astronomy, including Alvan Clark's first telescope (from 1852), as well as the Milham Planetarium, which uses a Zeiss Skymaster ZKP3/B optomechanical projector and an Ansible digital projector, both installed in 2005. The Hopkins Observatory's 0.6-m DFM reflecting telescope (1991) is installed elsewhere on the campus. Williams joins with Wellesley, Wesleyan, Middlebury, Colgate, Vassar, Swarthmore, and Haverford/Bryn Mawr to form the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium, sponsored for over a decade by the Keck Foundation <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> its student research programs sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

The Chinese Tang dynasty poet Du Fu (712–770) wrote a poem that in the translation by J. P. Seaton begins [...] "House cricket... Trifling thing. And yet how his mournful song moves us.
