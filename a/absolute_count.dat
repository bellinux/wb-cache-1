40|$|Abstract Background The {{extent of}} {{immunosuppression}} and {{the probability of}} developing an AIDS-related complication in HIV-infected people is usually measured by the absolute number of CD 4 positive T-cells. The percentage of CD 4 positive cells is a more easily measured and less variable number. We analyzed sequential CD 4 and CD 8 numbers, percentages and ratios in 218 of our HIV infected patients to determine the most reliable predictor of an AIDS-related event. Results The CD 4 percentage was an unsurpassed predictor of the occurrence of AIDS-related events when all subsets of patients are considered. The CD 4 <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> was the next most reliable, followed by the ratio of CD 4 /CD 8 percentages. The value of CD 4 percentage over the CD 4 <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> was seen even after the introduction of highly effective HIV therapy.

For MRI imaging (1. 5 Tesla), the phantom was filled with water and doped with Gd-DTPA for contrast enhancement. For both modalities, phantom images were acquired and reconstructed using a routine clinical protocol. MRI and SPET images were matched by Downhill Simplex minimization of the sum of <b>absolute</b> <b>Count</b> Differences (CD), the sum of the Square Root of <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> differences (SR), the Difference in Shape between the binary masks (SD), the number of Sign Changes in the subtracted image (SC), the Variance of intensities between corresponding pixels (VAR), the sum of <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> differences between the 2 D- and 3 D-Gradient images (2 DG- 3 DG) and, finally, the standard deviation of the Uniformity Index (UI), that is the intensity ratio between spatially corresponding voxels.

40|$|Hyperimmunoglobulin M (HIGM) type 3 due to CD 40 {{deficiency}} is a {{very rare}} syndrome. Only 16 cases have been reported thus far. The clinical presentation is very variable. We present the first case of this rare disorder from India. The case is of a two-and-a-half-year-old female, {{with a history of}} repeated episodes of skin infections and diarrhea since birth. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated <b>absolute</b> lymphocyte <b>count</b> and an <b>absolute</b> neutrophil <b>count</b> (ANC) of 1026 /mm 3. The lymphocyte subset analysis showed normal <b>absolute</b> <b>counts</b> of Natural Killer (NK) cells and elevated <b>absolute</b> <b>counts</b> of T-cells (CD 4 and CD 8) and B-cells. The serum immunoglobulin estimation showed low levels of IgG, IgA, IgE and an elevated level of IgM. The CD 154 analysis was normal and expression of CD 40 was absent on the B-cells. Molecular analysis showed a novel mutation, with deletion of 3 bp (AAG) [p. Glu 107 GlyfsX 84] in the homozygous state, in the CD 40 gene. Thus the patient was diagnosed as HIGM type 3. The parents were screened and counseled regarding prenatal diagnosis at the time of next pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the lymphocyte populations’ distribution changes in peripheral blood of patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS). Lymphocyte populations’ distribution changes in peripheral blood of pSS patients were investigated in 52 patients with pSS and in 28 healthy controls by flow cytometry. We found decreased <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> of CD 3 + T cell population in pSS patients. Analysis of CD 4 + T cell population showed significant proportion and <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> differences in pSS patient’s blood with SSA/SSB antibodies (Abs) in comparison to controls. No significant differences were observed analyzing CD 4 + and CD 8 + Treg subpopulation. Proportion and absolute counts of Th 17 cells were significantly lower in pSS patient’s blood. Absolute counts of CD 8 + T cells were significantly lower in pSS patients in comparison to controls and also impaired proportion and absolute counts of CD 8 + subpopulations according to CD 27 + and CD 57 + were observed. Absolute counts of NKT and NK cells were decreased in pSS with Abs. B cells proportion was increased only in blood of pSS with Abs. Lymphocyte distribution impairment can be due to genetically determined lymphopenia or lymphocyte migration from periphery to inflammatory sites or/and increased susceptibility to apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Measurement of {{haematological}} parameters provides {{valuable information}} {{for evaluation of}} health status of man and animals, but {{due to lack of}} reference values for avian blood profiles, it is not widely used in poultry. This study has contributed to the current knowledge on avian blood profiles, or more specifically demonstrated leukograms and haemograms of four main broiler strains (Ross, Cobb, Arbor-Acres, and Arian) during 8 weeks husbandry period. Blood samples were collected from chickens at different age (1 to 56 days old) with 7 -day sampling intervals. Total numbers of RBC and WBC, PCV, Hb, MCV, MCH, MCHC, ESR, together with <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> of heterophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils as well as H / L ratio were determined. One-way ANOVA, Wilcoxon, Spearman correlation and Kruskal-Wallis H tests from SPSS 11 were used for statistical analysis of the results. This study showed that age affects significantly (P< 0. 05) the haematological profiles of the broiler strains. With increasing of age, the erythrocytic parameters (except MCV, MCH, and MCHC) and leukocytic parameters (except heterophils and H / L ratio) were significantly increased (P< 0. 01), but MCV, MCH and <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> of heterophils as well as H / L ratio were significantly decreased (P< 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophilia is {{frequently}} in hospitalized patients, so {{a screening test}} for infections would be very useful. The immature platelet fraction (IPF) {{is provided by the}} automated blood analyzer XE 2100 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) as a proportional value of the total optical platelet count [IPF%; an <b>absolute</b> <b>count</b> of immature platelets can also be obtained (AIPC) ] to indicate the rate of platelet production. IPF could help to identify the aetiology of thrombocytopenia and to recognize the increased bone marrow activity as occurred during the course of infectious disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is associated}} with a lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and neutrophilia and suspected cases may be admitted to hospital on the basis of such abnormalities. Laboratories may report changes as percentages or <b>absolute</b> <b>counts.</b> Objective: To investigate whether absolute or percentage differential counts were more predictive of patients with SARS pneumonia. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: SARS clinic of an emergency department in Hong Kong. Subjects and methods: Whole blood and differential counts were performed on 506 patients presenting to a SARS screening clinic. Ninety-six patients subsequently developed SARS pneumonia. Results: Sixty-nine patients had abnormal lymphocyte <b>absolute</b> <b>counts</b> on first attendance at clinic of which 37 (54 %) developed SARS pneumonia. This compared with 142 subjects with abnormal percentage lymphocyte values of which 50 (35 %) developed SARS pneumonia. The area under the ROC curve for <b>absolute</b> lymphocyte <b>counts</b> is 0. 851 (95 %CI 0. 816 to 0. 881) and for percentage lymphocytes is 0. 736 (95 %CI 0. 694 to 0. 775). The area under the ROC curve for <b>absolute</b> monocyte <b>counts</b> is 0. 535 (95 %CI 0. 489 to 0. 580) and for percentage monocytes is 0. 635 (95 %CI 0. 591 to 0. 678). The area under the ROC curve for <b>absolute</b> neutrophil <b>counts</b> is 0. 591 (95 %CI 0. 546 to 0. 636) and for percentage neutrophils is 0. 703 (95 %CI 0. 660 to 0. 744). Conclusion: Reporting absolute rather than percentage values for differential leucocyte counts are mor...|$|R
40|$|Localized {{radiotherapy}} (RT) {{can cause}} immune dysfunction. Bojungikki-tang {{is known to}} restore immune function. We investigated the <b>absolute</b> <b>counts</b> and percentages of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte subtypes in end stage cancer patients before and after RT and after oral administration of Bojungikki-tang water extract (BJITE) and to evaluate the changes mediated by RT and BJITE. <b>Absolute</b> <b>counts</b> and percentages of lymphocyte and lymphocyte subsets were determined in whole blood using the TetraONE System (Beckman Coulter, USA). Flow cytometry results were compared before and after RT and after administration of BJITE. Absolute numbers of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T cells and CD 19 + B cells decreased significantly after RT (P< 0. 05). Absolute numbers of CD 3 -CD 56 + cells did not change in both groups. No significant differences were observed in the <b>absolute</b> <b>counts</b> of lymphocyte subtypes before and after administration of BJITE or vitamin group. When BJITE group was compared with vitamin group, absolute numbers of CD 19 + B cells increased. RT-induced decrease in T cells and B cells in PB suggests that immune deterioration occurs after RT. Administration of BJITE might be effective in the restoration of number of B cells...|$|R
40|$|High {{neutrophil}} counts in induced sputum {{have been found}} in nonasthmatic amateur runners at rest and after a marathon, but the pathogenesis of airway neutrophilia in athletes is still poorly understood. Bronchial epithelial damage may occur during intense exercise, as suggested by investigations conducted in endurance-trained mice and competitive human athletes studied under resting conditions. To gain further information on airway changes acutely induced by exercise, airway cell composition, apoptosis, IL- 8 concentration in induced sputum, and serum CC- 16 level were measured in 15 male amateur runners at rest (baseline) and shortly after a half-marathon. Different from results obtained after a marathon, neutrophil <b>absolute</b> <b>counts</b> were unchanged, whereas bronchial epithelial cell <b>absolute</b> <b>counts</b> and their apoptosis increased significantly (P 0. 01). IL- 8 in induced sputum supernatants almost doubled postrace compared with baseline (P 0. 01) and correlated positively with bronchial epithelial cell <b>absolute</b> <b>counts</b> (R 2 0. 373, P 0. 01). Serum CC- 16 significantly increased after all races (P 0. 01). These data show mild bronchial epithelial cell injury acutely induced by intense endurance exercise in humans, extending to large airways the data obtained in peripheral airways of endurance-trained mice. Therefore, neutrophil influx into the airways of athletes may be secondary to bronchial epithelial damage associated with intense exercise...|$|R
