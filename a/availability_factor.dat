50|$|The <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> of a {{power plant}} {{is the amount of}} time that it is able to produce {{electricity}} over a certain period, divided by the amount of the time in the period. Occasions where only partial capacity is available may or may not be deducted. Where they are deducted, the metric is titled equivalent <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> (EAF). The <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> should not be confused with the capacity factor. The capacity factor for a given period can never exceed the <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> for the same period. The difference arises when the plant is run at less than full capacity, in which case the capacity factor is less than the <b>availability</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the term}} <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> was {{used only for}} power plants that {{depended}} on an active, controlled supply of fuel, typically fossil or later also nuclear. The emergence of renewable energy such as hydro, wind and solar power, which operate without an active, controlled supply of fuel and which come to a standstill when their natural supply of energy ceases, requires a more careful distinction between the <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> and the capacity factor. By convention, such zero production periods are counted against the capacity factor but not against the <b>availability</b> <b>factor,</b> which thus remains defined as depending on an active, controlled supply of fuel, along with factors concerning reliability and maintenance. A wind turbine cannot operate in wind speeds above a certain limit, which counts against its <b>availability</b> <b>factor.</b> With this definition, modern wind turbines which require very little maintenance, have very high availability factors, up to about 98%. Photovoltaic power stations which have few or no moving parts and which can undergo planned inspections and maintenance during night have an <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> approaching or equal to 100%.|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} of a power plant varies greatly {{depending on the type}} of fuel, the design of the plant and how the plant is operated. Everything else being equal, plants that are run less frequently have higher <b>availability</b> <b>factors</b> because they require less maintenance and because more inspections and maintenance can be scheduled during idle time. Most thermal power stations, such as coal, geothermal and nuclear power plants, have <b>availability</b> <b>factors</b> between 70% and 90%. Newer plants tend to have significantly higher <b>availability</b> <b>factors,</b> but preventive maintenance is as important as improvements in design and technology. Gas turbines have relatively high <b>availability</b> <b>factors,</b> ranging from 80% to 99%. Gas turbines are commonly used for peaking power plants, co-generation plants and the first stage of combined cycle plants.|$|R

However, {{it is unclear what}} impact such services have on the student outcomes for certain parent cohorts. The problem this study addressed is the need to determine if there is a relationship between community college campus child care (CCCCC) centers and the academic success of single mothers. Research into single mother child care support needs was a reasonable way to identify key support services which enable single mothers to achieve academic success. The study investigated single mother academic success related to, estimated average grade, grade improvement, persistence, and credits earned. CCCCC parenting support services and child care <b>availability</b> <b>factors</b> were investigated. The study employed a quantitative research methodology. Survey data were solicited from CCCCC directors and single mothers associated with 108 CCCCC members of the National Coalition for Campus Children's Centers (NCCCC). In order to analyze the CCCCC factors that have influenced the academic success of single mother students descriptive and correlation statistics were used when analyzing survey data. The major findings of the study were related to campus child care <b>availability</b> <b>factors</b> [...] child care on campus, the numbers of parent support services available, and the number of available child care hours single mothers reported using. Significant correlations were found between CCCCC <b>availability</b> <b>factors</b> and grade improvement, persistence, and credits earned. The study's contribution was a focus on identifying CCCCC <b>availability</b> <b>factors</b> that influence the academic success of single mother students. The study also provided insight to research on low-income single mothers, a large and growing cohort of heads of households in our society.

40|$|Lakvijaya {{power station}} {{is the first}} coal fired power station in Sri Lanka having an {{installed}} capacity of 300 MW. During 2012, it has supplied 18 % of the Sri Lankan energy demand. The <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> of this power station in 2012 was 68. 8 %. This is rather high compared with the average <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> of coal powered power stations in {{countries in the region}} falls between 65 % - 90 %. According to the contract document, the <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> of this plant has been expected as 85 % [1]. However, there is a strong public opinion created by media that the plant is unreliable and prone to frequent failures. Therefore, any improvement in the availability of the power station will result in improving the public image as well as reducing overall costs spent on more expensive fuels. This research aims at critically analyzing the Auxiliary Systems of the power plant to identify their contribution to the reduction of plant availability and propose means of improving overall availability through increasing the reliability of auxiliary systems. Data related to outages were collected from plant operational logs and defect reportsfrom 22. 12. 2010 to 09. 06. 2012. Existing systems and layouts were studied referring to plant operation and maintenance manuals and by field observations. Analyzing thedata, it was found that failures and unsatisfactory performance in the auxiliary systems havecontributed to the low availability of the power plant by delaying re-starts after failures and reducing the plant capacity while in operation. Failures and problems in auxiliary systems such as The Sea Water Pre-Treatment System, De-salination System, De-mineralization System, Chlorination System and the Hydrogen Production and Storage System were critically analyzed during this research and improvements to the designs are proposed based on the results. The present <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> of 21 % of the De-salination System can be improved to 91 % by carrying out the proposals made by this research. The <b>availability</b> <b>factor</b> of other systems too can be improved above 90 % using the results. Estimated total cost of the proposals is Rs. 543 Million. However, by implementing themRs. 2. 7 Billion is expected to be saved annually, by reducing the operating and maintenance costs of auxiliary systems and improving the availability of the power plant.
