5|$|Domitian was {{allegedly}} extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised {{in later life}} by wearing wigs. According to Suetonius, he even wrote {{a book on the}} subject of hair care. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|Sibling rivalry often {{continues}} throughout {{childhood and}} can be very frustrating and stressful to parents. Adolescents fight {{for the same reasons}} younger children fight, but they are better equipped to physically, <b>intellectually,</b> <b>and</b> emotionally hurt <b>and</b> be <b>intellectually</b> <b>and</b> emotionally hurt by each other. Physical and emotional changes cause pressures in the teenage years, as do changing relationships with parents and friends. Fighting with siblings {{as a way to get}} parental attention may increase in adolescence. One study found that the age group 10 to 15 reported the highest level of competition between siblings ...|$|R
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Paul Schnabel, a sociologist, {{described}} Rawat as a pure {{example of a}} charismatic leader. He characterized Rawat as materialistic, pampered <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> unremarkable compared to Osho, but no less charismatic.|$|E
25|$|Catherine the Great {{considered}} {{herself an}} enlightened despot. She read {{the most prominent}} philosophes of the day, including Montesquieu and Voltaire and tried to adhere to Enlightenment ideas.

25|$|In 588, the Sui had amassed 518,000 troops {{along the}} {{northern}} bank of the Yangtze River, stretching from Sichuan to the East China Sea. The Chen dynasty could not withstand such an assault. By 589, Sui troops entered Jiankang (Nanjing) and the last emperor of Chen surrendered. The city was razed to the ground, while Sui troops escorted Chen nobles back north, where the northern aristocrats became fascinated with everything the south had to provide culturally <b>and</b> <b>intellectually.</b>|$|E
40|$|In Britain the {{production}} and use of electronic hypermedia for teaching and learning anthropology is expanding. During the 1990 s anthropologists&# 039; published responses to this new form of ethnographic representation ranged from advocating caution {{in the application of}} hypermedia to anthropology (e. g., Banks 1994) to celebrating its creative potential to enhance research, representation <b>and</b> pedagogy <b>intellectually</b> <b>and</b> ethically...|$|R

25|$|Of course, brutal scenes – witness The Massacre of the Innocents – {{have been}} {{important}} and regularly visited motifs {{in the history of}} art. What makes Helnwein's art significant is its ability to make us reflect emotionally <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> on the very expressive subjects he chooses. Many people feel that museums should be a refuge in which to experience quiet beauty divorced from the coarseness of the world. This notion sells short the purposes of art, the function of museums, and the intellectual curiosity of the public.|$|E
25|$|Depictions of the {{character}} have varied spanning the comics and other media adaptations. The original Golden Age version of Lois Lane, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a tough-as-nails journalist <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> equal to Superman. During the Silver Age of Comics, she was the star of Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, a comic book series that had a light and humorous tone. Beginning in 2015, she stars as the protagonist in the young adult novel series, Lois Lane, by writer Gwenda Bond.|$|E

Here Froude began to improve {{personally}} <b>and</b> <b>intellectually,</b> motivated to succeed by a brief engagement in 1839 (although this was broken off by the lady's father). He obtained a second class degree in 1840 and travelled to Delgany, Ireland as a private tutor. He returned to Oxford in 1842, won the Chancellor's English essay prize for an essay on political economy, and was elected a fellow of Exeter College.|$|E

25|$|Criollos: a {{minority}} conformed originally by ancient families {{descendants of the}} Spaniards that conquered Central America and that by 1920 conformed both political parties in the country. By 1920, they were mixed to a large extended with foreigners and the great majority had Indian blood in their veins. They led the country both politically <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> partly because their education, although poor for European standards of the time, was enormously superior {{to the rest of}} the people of the country, partly because only criollos were allowed in the main political parties and also because their families controlled and for the most part owner the cultivated parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|Feminist Historiography {{is another}} notable facet of feminist history. One {{important}} feminist historiography writer and researcher is Judith M. Bennett. In her book, History Matters: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism, Bennett writes {{on the importance}} of studying a “patriarchal equilibrium”. Cheryl Glenn also writes {{on the importance of}} feminist historiography “Writing women (or any other traditionally disenfranchised group) into the history of rhetoric, then, can be an ethically <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> responsible gesture that disrupts those frozen memories in order to address silences, challenge absences, and assert women's contributions to public life” This facet of feminist history inspect historical writings that are typically assumed to be canon, and reinvents them under a feminist lens.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent decades}} Rand's works {{are more likely}} to be {{encountered}} in the classroom. The Ayn Rand Society, dedicated to fostering the scholarly study of Objectivism, is affiliated with the American Philosophical Association's Eastern Division. Aristotle scholar and Objectivist Allan Gotthelf, chairman of the Society, and his colleagues have argued for more academic study of Objectivism, viewing the philosophy as a unique <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> interesting defense of classical liberalism that is worth debating. In 1999 a refereed Journal of Ayn Rand Studies began. In 2006 the University of Pittsburgh held a conference focusing on Objectivism. Programs and fellowships for the study of Objectivism have been supported at the University of Pittsburgh, University of Texas at Austin and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.|$|E

25|$|Member {{institutions}} believe athletic teams {{should be}} representative of school's entire student bodies and hew to NCAA Division III admissions and financial policies prohibiting athletic scholarships while awarding financial aid {{solely on the basis}} of need. Due to the prestigious reputations of its member schools, the NESCAC is able to attract many of the most athletically <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> gifted student-athletes in the country. Members stress that intercollegiate athletic programs should operate in harmony with the educational mission of each institution. Schools are committed to maintaining common boundaries to keep athletics strong yet in proportion to their overall academic mission. Presidents of each NESCAC institution control intercollegiate athletic policy. Conference tenets are usually more restrictive than those of the NCAA Division III regarding season length, number of contests and post-season competition.|$|E
25|$|The Book 2 of the Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus {{contains}} {{roughly the}} same information as the Chronicon Lethrense and the Annales Lundenses, i.e. that Ro (Hroðgar) and Helgo (Halga) were the son of Haldanus (Healfdene). When Haldanus died of old age, Ro took the land and Helgo the water. One day during his sea roving, Helgo arrived at Thurø, where he found and raped the young girl Thora, which resulted in Urse (Yrsa). When Helgo after many years returned to Thurø, Thora avenged her lost virginity by sending Urse to Helgo who, unknowingly raped his own daughter. This resulted in Roluo, who was a gifted man, both physically <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> and as brave as he was tall. After some time Helgo repelled a Swedish invasion, avenged Ro by killing the Swedish king Hothbrodd, and made the Swedes pay tribute. However, he committed suicide due to shame for his incestuous relationship with Urse. Roluo succeeded him.|$|E
25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally <b>and</b> <b>intellectually</b> in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
