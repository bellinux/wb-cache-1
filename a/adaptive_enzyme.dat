5000|$|An <b>adaptive</b> <b>enzyme</b> or {{inducible}} enzyme is an enzyme that is expressed only under {{conditions in which}} it is clear of adaptive value, as opposed to a constitutive enzyme which is produced all the time.The Inducible enzyme is used for the breaking-down of things in the cell. It is also a part of the Operon Model, which illustrates a way for genes to turn [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off".The Inducer causes the gene to turn on (controlled by the amount of reactant which turns the gene on). Then there's the repressor protein that turns genes off. The inducer can remove this repressor, turning genes back on. The operator is a section of DNA where the repressor binds to shut off certain genes; the promoter is the section of DNA where the RNA polymerase binds. Lastly, the regulatory gene is the gene for the repressor protein.An example of {{inducible enzyme}} is COX-2 which is synthesized in macrophages to produce Prostaglandin E2 while the constitutive enzyme COX-1 (another isozyme in COX family) is always produced in variety of organs in body (like stomach).|$|E

In developing seeds, sucrose breakdown was dominated by the sucrose synthase pathway; but in the seedling embryos, both the sucrose synthase pathway and acid invertase were active.

40|$|Adaptation by {{microorganisms}} to {{the utilization}} of certain nutrients has been considered (Rahn, 1938) to represent the de novo formation of an enzyme as a specific response {{to the presence of}} its specific substrate. Others (Gale, 1943; Monod, 1947) have questioned the necessity for the presence of the specific substrate as a prerequisite for the occurrence of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>enzyme.</b> Evidence bearing on this question would consist of the demonstration of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>enzyme</b> in cells grown on substrates other than the specific or closely related substrates. For the most part, investigations aimed at detecting the presence of adaptive enzymes in cells grown on carbon sources which are not substrates for the enzyme in question have given negative results. However, it has been pointed out that such results were possibly a reflection of the inadequate sensitiveness of the techniques employed. In some instances, galactozymase in Bacterium coli (Stephenson and Gale, 1937), p-aminobenzoic acid and anthranilic acid oxidation in a pseudomonad (Mirick, 1943), tryptophanase (Fildes, 1938), and amino acid decarboxylases in Escherichia coli (Gale, 1946), the adaptive enzymes have been found in celLs grown in the absence of specific substrate. In these cases, however, the determination of enzyme activity was conducted with viable or intact cells, and the possibility remains that the low enzymatic activity observed here is due to the induction of enzyme formation by the test substrate. The possibility of adaptation to the test substrate could be obviated by demon-strating <b>adaptive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity under conditions which reasonably preclude such adaptation, namely, in cell-free extracts of unadapted cells. Lederberg (1950) has already used this approach with promising results. This paper deals with the influence of various carbon sources on the produc-tion of f-D-galactosidase (lactase) activity by E. coli, strain K- 12.

40|$|Washed {{vegetative}} {{cells of}} various species of aerobic spore-forming bacteria sporulate abundantly when shaken in distilled water in air. The spores thus formed possess the same heat resistance as spores formed {{in a complete}} growth medium. Various factors influencing sporogenesis in water are described. Glucose in low concentration completely suppresses sporogenesis under these conditions and the suppression is relieved {{by the presence of}} ammonia as an exogenous source of nitrogen. Various amino acid and purine antimetabolite analogues inhibit sporogenesis and their inhibitory effects are completely reversed by much smaller amounts of the corresponding metabolites. Sporogenesis is thus regarded as a de novo synthesis of spore proteins from preexisting endogenous (enzyme) proteins. Cells low in protein fail to sporulate and the capacity of the cell to adaptively attack maltose and trehalose is strongly interfered with after the cell is irreversibly committed to sporulation, but not before that. Evidence is advanced supporting the hypothesis that sporogenesis is an endogenous process which commences when the supply of exogenous energy and carbon is depleted. It utilizes low molecular weight nitrogenous substances liberated by the degradation of preexisting enzyme proteins of the vegetative cell. Sporogenesis and <b>adaptive</b> <b>enzyme</b> formation are regarded as competitive synthetic processes, both utilizing endogenous enzyme proteins. The events of sporogenesis suggest that this process may be an adaptive protein synthesis, analogous to <b>adaptive</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis...|$|E

The idea that synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is essential for protein synthesis is supported by the inability of the bacterial mutants to form protein and several enzymes, including f 3 -galactosidase, in the absence of purines or pyrimidines. All of these experiments were performed in a medium which contained an energy supply other than the inducer. Early in the work, it was noted, however, that in a medium which lacked both an energy supply and the nucleic acid component, formation of the induced enzyme did proceed to a considerable extent.

The studies reported in this paper were conducted to determine the site of action of the antibiotic on the metabolic pattern of this organism.

However, intestinal mucosal cells, like bacteria, face a varying milieu.

All 12 transporters studied proved to be regulated by dietary substrate levels. Regulation in the intestine is slower than in bacteria and shows lower peak-to-basal activity levels. Regulatory patterns vary greatly among transporters: two sugars and two nonessential amino acids monotonically up-regulate their transporters, two vitamins and three minerals monotonically down-regulate their transporters, and two transporters of essential amino acids respond nonmonotonically to levels of their substrates. These varied patterns arise from trade-offs among four factors: transporter costs, calories yielded by metabolizable substrates, fixed daily requirements of essential nutrients, and toxicity of certain nutrients in large amounts. Based on these trade-offs, we predict the form of regulatory pattern for intestinal transporters not yet studied...|$|R

The degradation of the latter compound to ben-zoate with the formation of benzoylformate and benzaldehyde as intermediates was postulated by Stanier (1948) and has been confirmed by Gunsalus, Stanier, and Gunsalus (1953).

High temperatures (70 ºC) and neutral pH (7) were opted by most of the vent bacteria to produce their <b>enzymes.</b> <b>Adaptive</b> mechanisms to detoxify the metals by producing H 2 S gases, catalase and oxidase for decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen supply; extended survival in unfavourable conditions by sporulation were observed as a common characteristic features in most of the bacterial isolates of the shallow vent DJCS...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{patterns}} of sequence divergence were analyzed in genes from the conifer genus Taxus (yew), encoding paclitaxel biosynthetic enzymes taxadiene synthase (TS) and 10 -deacetylbaccatin III- 10 beta-O-acetyltransferase (DBAT). N-terminal fragments of TS, full-length DBAT and {{internal transcribed spacer}} (ITS) were amplified from 15 closely related Taxus species and sequenced. Premature stop codons were not found in TS and DBAT sequences. Codon usage bias was not found, suggesting that synonymous mutations are selectively neutral. TS and DBAT gene trees are {{not consistent with the}} ITS tree, where species formed monophyletic clades. In fact, for both genes, alleles were sometimes shared across species and parallel amino acid substitutions were identified. While both TS and DBAT are, overall, under purifying selection, we identified a number of amino acids of TS under positive selection based on inference using maximum likelihood models. Positively selected amino acids in the N-terminal region of TS suggest that this region might be more important for enzyme function than previously thought. Moreover, we identify lineages with significantly elevated rates of amino acid substitution using a genetic algorithm. These findings demonstrate that the pattern of <b>adaptive</b> paclitaxel biosynthetic <b>enzyme</b> evolution can be documented between closely related Taxus species, where species-specific taxane metabolism has evolved recently...|$|R
40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{concentration}} of ammonia from rising to toxic levels as moisture is lost during the ripening period, the seeds of Juglans regia reduce their ammonia content by synthesizing organic compounds such as tryptophan (Trp) and serotonin (5 -HT). The biosynthetic pathway of 5 -HT was investigated using Tritium-Trp and C(14 isotope) -TNH 2 as tracers, and reversed-phase HPLC for separation of the indoles involved in 5 -HT and IAA metabolism. The first step is the decarboxylation of Trp to TNH 2. This step is rate limiting and is catalyzed by the <b>adaptive</b> tryptophan decarboxylase <b>enzyme</b> (E. C. 4. 1. 1. 27). This enzyme is the key control element of 5 -HT biosynthesis. The decarboxylase activity is not induced by {{a high level of}} ammonia and Trp, but by the cessation of metabolite transfer following abscission of the seeds. Subsequently TNH 2 is transformed to 5 -HT by a constitutive enzyme tryptamine- 5 -hydroxylase. The very low rate of 5 -HO-Trp biosynthesis demonstrates a high substrate specifi ty of this hydroxylase in vivo. We also discuss IAA biosynthesis in walnuts from Trp via 3 -indolepyruvic acid, involving tryptophan transaminase as a constitutive enzyme in these seeds, but not via TNH 2. (IFU...|$|R
