5|$|As the TUTT {{gradually}} warmed, Gordon {{was able}} to undergo a prolonged period of rapid intensification, despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July14 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70mbar (hPa; 2.07inHg), just below the threshold for explosive intensification. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phase, Gordon attained its peak strength as a Category5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915mbar (hPa; 27.02inHg).|$|E

5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} Carboniferous period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes.

5|$|Hurricane Guillermo was {{the ninth}} most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} on record, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure of 919hPa (27.14inHg). Forming {{out of a}} tropical wave on July30, 1997, roughly 345mi (555km) south of Salina Cruz, Mexico, Guillermo tracked in a steady west-northwestward direction while intensifying. The system reached hurricane status by August1 before undergoing rapid intensification the following day. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phase, the storm attained its peak intensity as a powerful Category5 hurricane. The storm began to weaken during the afternoon of August5 and was downgraded to a tropical storm on August8. Once entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, Guillermo briefly weakened to a tropical depression before re-attaining tropical storm status. On August15, the storm reached an unusually high latitude of 41.8°N before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants persisted {{for more than a}} week as they tracked towards the northeast and later south and east before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system off the coast of California on August24.|$|E
5|$|On September19 and 20, Georges {{underwent}} {{a period of}} rapid intensification, in which winds increased by 45mph (85km/h) in a 24-hour span. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phase, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a barometric pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.68inHg), just below Category 5 status. At the time of peak intensity, a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight-level winds up to 168mph (270km/h) while dropsondes measured surface winds up to 175mph (280km/h). One of the readings from a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191mph (307km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm-force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles. Around the time of peak intensity, the eye of Georges was roughly 35mi (55km) in diameter.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{with the}} gord {{building}} activity of ca. 920-50, the Piasts undertook military expansion by crossing the Warta River and moving {{south and west}} within the Oder River basin. The entire network of tribal gords between the Obra and Barycz rivers, among other places, was eliminated. The conquered population was often resettled to central Greater Poland, which resulted in partial depopulation of previously well-developed regions. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stage of the Piast state formation new Piast gords {{were built in the}} (north) Noteć River area and other outlying areas of the annexed lands, for example in Santok and Śrem around 970. During the following decade the job of unifying the core of the early Piast state was finished—besides Greater Poland with Kujawy it included also much of central Poland. Masovia and parts of Pomerania found themselves increasingly under the Piast influence, while the southbound expansion was for the time being stalled, because large portions of Lesser Poland and Silesia were controlled by the Czech state.|$|E
5|$|Returning from Tarawa, Radford was reassigned {{as chief}} of staff to Towers, who was Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet.

He had hoped to return to combat duty <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> assignment, but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C. and appointed as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. He assumed this new duty on 1 April, a role which was primarily administrative in nature. His duties included establishing a new integrated system for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft wear and tear. After six months in this duty, Radford was returned to the Pacific theater by Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Sindhu {{was given}} the ever-full bowl of amrita (elixir of life) as a boon from the Sun-god. The demon was warned that he could drink from the bowl {{as long as it}} was intact. So to protect the bowl, he {{swallowed}} it. Sindhu terrorized the three worlds, so the gods asked Gunesha for help. Gunesha defeated Sindhu's army, cut his general Kamalasura into three pieces and then cut open Sindhu's body, emptying the amrita bowl and thus killing the demon. The creator-god Brahma is described as having built the Morgaon shrine, and marrying Siddhi and Buddhi to Ganesha. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> incarnation, Gunesha returned to his celestial abode, giving his peacock mount to his younger brother Skanda, with whom the peacock mount is generally associated.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} Slavic settlers {{from the}} east reached southeastern Poland {{in the second half}} of the 5th century, specifically the San River basin, then the upper Vistula regions, including the Kraków area and Nowy Sącz Valley. Single early sites are also known around Sandomierz and Lublin in Masovia and Upper Silesia. Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in Lower Silesia. In the 6th century, the above areas were settled. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century, or in the early 7th century, the Slavic newcomers reached Western Pomerania.

5|$|The proto-Scotland landmass moved northwards, {{and from}} 460–430 Ma, sandstone, {{mudstone}} and limestone were {{deposited in the}} area that is now the Midland Valley. This occurred in shallow tropical seas at the margins of the Iapetus Ocean. The Ballantrae Complex near Girvan was formed from this ocean floor and is similar in composition to rocks found at The Lizard in Cornwall. Nonetheless, northern and southern Britain were far apart {{at the beginning of this}} period, although the gap began to close as the continent of Avalonia broke away from Gondwana, collided with Baltica and drifted towards Laurentia. The Caledonian orogeny began forming a mountain chain from Norway to the Appalachians.

5|$|Typhoon Nora, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Luming, was the fourth-most intense {{tropical}} cyclone on record. Originating from an {{area of low pressure}} over the western Pacific, Nora was first identified as a tropical depression on October2, 1973. Tracking generally westward, the system gradually intensified, attaining typhoon status the following evening. After turning northwestward, the typhoon underwent a period of rapid intensification, during which its central pressure decreased by 77mb (hPa; 2.27inHg) in 24hours. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phase, Nora peaked with winds of 295km/h (185mph) and a pressure of 877mb (hPa; 25.91inHg), making it the most-intense tropical cyclone on record (alongside Typhoon Ida in 1958) at the time; however, this pressure has since been surpassed by two other typhoons and one hurricane. The typhoon subsequently weakened and turned northwestward as it approached the Philippines. After brushing Luzon on October7, the system passed south of Taiwan and ultimately made landfall in China on October10. Once onshore, Nora quickly weakened and dissipated the following day.|$|E
