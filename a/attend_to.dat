5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{and the ability}} to <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal relationships that rely on the sharing of experience and knowledge. Infants are highly motivated to share experience. An infant's motivation to engage in joint attention is strong enough that infants voluntarily turn away from interesting sights to engage in joint attention with others.|$|E
40|$|D ow nloaded from 2 This study {{investigated}} the neural basis of individual variation in emotion regulation, specifically the ability to reappraise negative stimuli so as to down-regulate negative affect. Brain functions in young adults were measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging during three conditions: (1) <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> neutral pictures; (2) <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative pictures; and (3) reappraising negative pictures. Resting-state functional connectivity was measured with amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) seed regions frequently associated with emotion regulation. Participants reported more negative affect after <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative than neutral pictures, and less negative affect following reappraisal. Both <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative versus neutral pictures and reappraising versus <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative pictures yielded widespread activations that were significantly right-lateralized for <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> negative pictures and left...|$|R

5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that Japanese people do indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, just like Americans and Europeans, but that these feelings are masked when explicitly asked for.

After the war, he opened his practice and {{was elected to the}} Kentucky House, where he led an unsuccessful attempt to oust Gabriel Slaughter after he ascended to the governorship upon the death of George Madison.

40|$|A {{simulated}} baseball batting {{task was}} used to investigate the role of attention in hitting performance for expert and novice baseball players. In Experiment 1, we compared the relative effects of <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> stimuli in the external environment (tone frequency) and <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> skill execution (bat movement) on batting performance for college players. When non-switch hitters batted from their preferred plate side or switch-hitters batted from either plate side, <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> the external environment had no significant effect relative to single task performance while <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> skill execution degraded batting performance. When non-switch hitters batted from their non-preferred plate side the exact opposite pattern of results was found. In Experiment 2, we compared the relative effects of <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> stimuli in the external environment presented either within or between swings for novice and expert batters. For experts, <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> the external environment had no significant effect relative to single task performance in the within condition but significantly degraded performance in the between condition. Novices showed the exact opposite pattern of results. These {{findings are consistent with}} the dominant theories of skill acquisition and indicate that the optimal attentional focus varies substantially across and within performers of different levels of expertise...|$|R

The ability to regulate emotion, a source of resilience or of risk for distress, appears to vary in relation to differences in intrinsic functional brain architecture.

5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to <b>attend</b> <b>to</b> their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E
5|$|In August 1792, {{a second}} {{convention}} {{was held in}} Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley were not in attendance. Future Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin was one moderate who did <b>attend,</b> <b>to</b> his later regret. A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As {{some of them had}} done in the American Revolution, they raised liberty poles, formed committees of correspondence, and took control of the local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effectiveness of a self-monitoring procedure on increasing <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> task and academic accuracy in two elementary students with autism in their self-contained classroom. A multiple baseline across participants in two academic subject areas was used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.

Results are interpreted to conclude that the self-monitoring procedure was effective for both students and resulted in immediate increases in <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> task and academic accuracy even though results in academic accuracy were variable. Social validity was documented by the increase in two behaviors relevant for student success (<b>attending</b> <b>to</b> task and academic accuracy) and greater student independence. Keyword...|$|R

40|$|Feedback {{plays an}} {{intervention}} {{role in the}} writing process. It is through feedback that writers are guided to achieve negotiated writing goals. Feedback encourages a process of discovery and this plays a developmental role in the writing process. In this paper, we report on three case studies that sought to understand cognitive processes when writers <b>attended</b> <b>to</b> feedback. Three ESL postgraduate {{students were asked to}} think aloud while <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> lecturer written feedback. Concurrent verbal protocols were analysed qualitatively using computer assisted data analysis software called Nvivo 8. The findings from this study indicate that <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> written feedback is a recursive process. While recursively <b>attending</b> <b>to</b> feedback, the writers planned globally, locally, reflected, and justified. The findings suggest that dialogical type of feedback encourage recursiveness and planning. These are essential for the potential development of a writer. Introduction and Literature Revie...|$|R
