2500|$|LZ 18 {{was first}} flown on 6 September at Friedrichshafen, and {{following}} {{a number of}} trial flights was flown to Johannisthal on 20 September for naval <b>acceptance</b> <b>trial</b> to begin, the flight of about 700km (438mi) taking twelve hours. [...] The ship's tenth flight was to be an altitude trial and was scheduled for 17 October. [...] The airship was removed from its shed in the morning but takeoff was delayed {{because one of the}} engines would not start. [...] The delay of two hours while the engine was repaired allowed the morning sun to heat the hydrogen, causing it to expand. [...] This caused the airship to ascend rapidly to , when horrified observers on the ground saw a flame leap out of the forward engine car, causing the explosion of some of the gasbags. [...] Halfway to the ground there was a second explosion, and as the wreckage hit the ground further explosions followed as the fuel tanks ignited. [...] Three survivors were pulled from the blazing wreckage, but two died shortly afterwards and the third died that night in hospital. [...] In all 28 men died, including [...] Pietzker, and the new chief of the Admiralty Aviation Department, Korvettenkapitän Behnisch, the successor to Korvettenkapitän Metzing who had been killed in the L1 on 9 September. [...] The accident was agreed to have been caused by the rapid ascent leading to venting of hydrogen through the relief valves, which in Zeppelins of the period were placed {{at the bottom of the}} bags, without vent trunks to convey any hydrogen let off to the top of the ship. [...] Some of the vented gas was then sucked into the forward engine car, where it was ignited, the fire then spreading to the gasbags.|$|E

50|$|It was {{considered}} that petrol was unsuitable as a fuel for airships {{intended for use}} in hot climates due to its low flash point. For this reason, R101 was powered by diesel engines, and R100 was originally intended to use engines using a mixture of hydrogen and kerosene. The program to develop the Beardmore Tornado diesel engines was beset with difficulties, the engines being both overweight and unable to produce the expected power output. Similarly, the development of hydrogen/kerosene engines ran into difficulties and so the R100 team {{made a decision to}} use existing petrol-fuelled aircraft engines. This resulted in Canada being substituted for India as the destination of the <b>acceptance</b> <b>trial</b> flight.|$|E

5000|$|The Red Army {{initially}} {{refused to}} accept the ZiS-3 - the gun had not undergone the usual acceptance trials - and Artillery Factory No. 92 accumulated a stockpile of serviceable guns. Grabin convinced the army to issue the badly needed guns to units for impromptu testing at the front, where combat experience validated the gun's superiority over all other divisional field guns. Subsequently, the ZiS-3 was presented to Joseph Stalin and a small group of state authorities. Stalin was impressed by the demonstration, saying [...] "This gun is a masterpiece of artillery systems design." [...] The ZiS-3 underwent an official five-day <b>acceptance</b> <b>trial</b> in February 1942, and was then accepted into service as divisional field gun model 1942 (full official name).|$|E

The cruiser returned to Norfolk on 9 April, but soon steamed to Jacksonville, Fla., where on 8 May she began duty under the Operational Technical Evaluation Force that included extensive testing of her missile system and many Talos firings. The effectiveness {{of the system and}} the weapon were demonstrated by a new, long-range record as well as a successful two-missile salvo shot. The Talos missile cruiser entertained over 17,000 visitors at Cape Canaveral on the Armed Forces weekend celebration in May; completed later phases of her evaluation exercises in the Caribbean through 21 July 1960; then visited Bayonne, N.J., where her missile fire-control radars were removed in preparation for overhaul. Galveston was overhauled in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard (30 August 1961 - 23 July 1962). This overhaul included modifications to the fire control system of the Talos missile.|$|E

Pigs fed a diet containing 2 % calendula meal consumed significantly more feed than the ones fed a calendula-free diet. As the calendula meal content of the diet increased, feed intake tended to decrease. Post mortem examination of vital organs showed statistically significant (P < 0. 10) between-treatment differences in heart, kidney, thyroid and pancreas size expressed as percentage of bodyweight. The results of blood and blood serum analyses for haematocrit, haemoglobin, oxygenated haemoglobin, aspartate-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine and zinc remained within the reference values for young pigs.

40|$|This paper {{initially}} {{reports on}} a usability and <b>acceptance</b> <b>trial</b> {{on the use of}} telepresence robots. The object was to assist the elderly by encouraging virtual social interactions in an attempt to reduce social isolation and loneliness. The trial results were disappointing because the telepresence robot under study had a number of technical problems which meant that the trial had to be abandoned. This has lead us to examine the whole process of building technology to suit a specific purpose (older people at home) versus adapting existing technology to fit into a specific context. To this end, the paper assesses two approaches through the use of two different telepresence robots. We hope this paper can also assist future researchers in this area to be more circumspect in their expectations of the technology. We found that one cannot simply assume that the technology would work and channel all their resources into usability and acceptance testing. It may be the case that a significant amount of effort is needed to get the technology to work in the chosen environment before any acceptance testing can be carried out...|$|E

Cookies were produced substituting 10, 20 and 30 % of the wheat flour for UBM, as well as standard cookies without UBM. The chemical compositions, physical features (weight, diameter and thickness) and sensorial characteristics of the cookies were evaluated. A cookie <b>acceptance</b> <b>trial</b> was conducted, which revealed {{no significant difference between the}} formulations containing UBM and the standard, except for the type III cookie, which was less well accepted (p < 0. 05) by children. The chemical composition of the cookies did not differ significantly from the standpoint of moisture and total lipids. The most important differences were found in the starch, total reducing sugars and mineral salts content. The main differences in the cookies’ physical characteristics were their diameters after baking, indicating that UBM altered the properties of the wheat flour. Therefore, in view of the high nutritional value of the cookies containing banana meal, with no significant alteration of their physical and sensorial characteristics, the use of this meal as a partial substitute of wheat flour is viable and can be recommended in the preparation of alternative nutritionally enriched foods...|$|E
