5|$|On February 2, 2015, Cody {{was indicted}} on animal cruelty and drug charges by a Baltimore County grand jury. The {{indictment}} included 15 charges: Two counts of aggravated animal cruelty involving a dog, five counts of animal <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglect</b> involving the same dog, {{one count of}} illegal possession of an alligator, five counts of animal <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglect</b> involving the alligator, one count of possession with intent to use the drug paraphernalia, and one count of possession of marijuana. Cody's agent, Peter Schaffer, denied his client's guilt and said that Cody's dog died of worms {{and that there was}} no animal cruelty. The investigating veterinarian said the dog was neglected and starved to death.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Nash {{formed the}} Steve Nash Foundation. Through grants {{to public service}} and nonprofit entities, the {{foundation}} aims to foster health in kids by funding projects that provide services to children affected by poverty, illness, <b>abuse,</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglect,</b> and create opportunity for education, play, and empowerment. It focuses its resources on communities in Phoenix, Arizona, and British Columbia, Canada. It was given charitable status in 2004. This foundation was awarded the Steve Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports Philanthropy in 2008. Nash also founded the Jim Jennings Memorial Endowment Fund, established in honour of a volunteer staff member at Santa Clara University who served the basketball team for more than 20 years.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on some problems of maltreated, <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> children and it also tries to outline a contemporary view of this situation. Considerable changes occured in this field after breaking a taboo on this subject, which {{is presented as a}} topic for a wide discussion. In my work I tried to give a complex view of some aspects of maltreated, <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> children problems. Furthemore I focused on the problems of a public awareness concerning maltreated, <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> children, and possible public activities in this field. I also investigated a public awareness of civic associations (i. e. organisations, institutions or facilities) which take care of endangered children in Trhové Sviny and nearby sorroundings. This research was based on a standardised questionaire. According to an analysis of its results, it is possible to to state a negation of both hypotheses in which I originally considered a public awareness of maltreated, <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> children low, <b>or</b> likewise, I pressumed that a public awareness of the above mentioned organisations (civic associations, institutions) would not be very high. In spite of these conclusions it is a safe assumption that the tasks given to find out a situation in a public awareness concerning the endangered children, were fulfilled...|$|R

25|$|If {{the victim}} is a minor, consent must come from a parent or {{guardian}}. However, if the legal parent or guardian is absent, unconscious, delusional or intoxicated, consent is implied. A responder {{is not required to}} withhold life-saving treatment (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) from a minor if the parent or guardian will not consent. The parent or guardian is then considered neglecting, and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect has been committed. Special circumstances may exist if child abuse is suspected (the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglect,</b> similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse, such as teachers or counsellors).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{differences}} among incidences of adult intimate partner emotional/psychological victimization between individuals who reported experiences of past childhood emotional/psychological <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> childhood <b>neglect</b> with individuals who did not report past experiences of childhood emotional/ psychological <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> childhood <b>neglect.</b> The dependent variable is adult intimate partner emotional/psychological victimization. The independent variables are childhood emotional/psychological abuse and childhood neglect. The sample size included 288 college students, both females and males from CSULA and CSUDH, who completed a self-administered survey. Univariate and bivariate analysis were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Bivariate analysis demonstrated individuals who reported experiences of past childhood emotional/psychological <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> childhood <b>neglect,</b> reported higher levels of adult intimate partner emotional/ psychological victimization than individuals who did not report experiences of past childhood emotional/psychological <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> childhood <b>neglect.</b> Implications for social work practice and research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The New Jersey Supreme Court {{recently}} ruled, unanimously, {{that the}} state may not find a newborn to be <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> based solely on evidence of prenatal drug exposure without evidence of actual harm to the child. In New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services v. A. L., the court overturned a lower court’s finding that a newborn was <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> based primarily on tests of a stool sample shortly after birth, which was positive for cocaine metabolites. The court’s interpretation of the applicable statute wisely forces the state child protective agency to build a stronger case that a newborn is at risk of future harm before making a finding of abuse and neglect, which might justify temporary or permanent removal {{of the child and}} even termination of parental rights...|$|R
25|$|DSPD often {{coordinates}} and collaborates {{with other}} state agencies {{to provide care}} for recipients of ID/RC HCBS waiver serves. Perhaps the strongest inter-agency partnership exists between the Division and the Division of Child and Family Services. These two state agencies often work together on crossover issues regarding their two respective populations. The most common crossover issue involves children who have experienced traumatic <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglect</b> and demonstrate extreme behavioral issues. Unfortunately, victims of acute abuse and neglect also experience significant developmental delays and thus qualify for services. In cases where these children have no other family or guardians, DSPD steps in to provide long-term care. Often, the child remains in the custody and guardianship of Child and Family Services. Division and Child and Family Services staff work closely together in these cases to ensure that services are administered appropriately and {{that the child is}} safe and healthy.|$|E
25|$|Myiasis is {{the leading}} entomological {{evidence}} used to prove abuse, and neglect in animals. Leading causes of myiasis in animals occur {{when there is an}} injury or the presence of excretory material, making the living animal alluring to insects. The following characteristics have to be present for myiasis to happen in a pet animal. There has to be <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglect</b> that causes an injury with blood, decaying tissue, feces or urine that attracts flies and the animals must be fairly helpless or incapable of cleaning itself. In long-coated animals, matts and burrs can cause irritation which leads to hot spots, scratching, open lacerations, and infestation. Animals with long mats and coats are especially prone to the building of excrement around the genital area. This circumstance worsens when the animal is elderly or hindered and can no longer clean itself. Risk factors are further intensified if the animals spends most of its life outdoors and is vulnerable to the external environments. Regular grooming and check-ups can significantly reduce these risks. In addition, eliminating other fly attractants, such as uneaten food and fecal matter, can also reduce risks. The summer season is when the highest risk occurs because insects are more common during this time.|$|E

500|$|Following Victoria Climbié's death, the {{agencies}} in the case, {{as well as the}} child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, [...] "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to [...] "a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence". Burstow said, [...] "there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, [...] "the Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen", and [...] "the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, [...] "the majority of children who die from <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglect</b> in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society we are still in denial about that hard truth".|$|E

40|$|This paper summarises {{the current}} state of {{knowledge}} about the prevalence of child abuse and neglect in Australia. It provides an overview of Australian studies that have estimated the prevalence of the different forms of child maltreatment (i. e., physical abuse, neglect, emotional maltreatment, the witnessing of family violence, and sexual abuse). In this paper the terms "child abuse and neglect" and "child maltreatment" are used interchangeably. Prevalence refers to the proportion of a population that has experienced a phenomenon, for example, the percentage of Australians aged 18 years and over in 2009 who were ever <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> as a child. Incidence refers to the number of new cases occurring over a specified period of time (normally a year), for example, the number of Australian children aged 0 - 17 years who were <b>abused</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglected</b> during 2009...|$|R

2500|$|Addiction to any substance, {{including}} crack, {{may be a}} {{risk factor}} for child <b>abuse</b> <b>or</b> <b>neglect.</b> Crack addiction, like other addictions, distracts parents from the child and leads to inattentive parenting. Mothers who continue to use drugs once their babies are born have trouble forming the normal parental bonds, more often interacting with their babies with a detached, unenthusiastic, flat demeanor. Conversely, low-stress environments and responsive caregiving may provide a protective effect on the child's brain, potentially compensating for negative effects of PCE.|$|E
2500|$|New {{research}} {{illustrates that}} there are strong associations between exposure to domestic violence and abuse in all their forms and higher rates of many chronic conditions.
