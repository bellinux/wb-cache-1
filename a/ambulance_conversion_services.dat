50|$|The M4 Sherman pattern {{enjoyed a}} lengthy post-war service {{all over the}} world. They were used well into the 1960s and 1970s by some nations, mainly in Africa and Latin America.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was built of steel tubing and fabric, with the fuselage {{forward of the}} wing enclosed in sheet metal. Control surfaces and the empennage were fabric-covered stainless steel. The Lycoming power plant was hand-cranked inertia starting, and was fitted with a Hamilton Standard constant speed propeller. At least 12 <b>ambulance</b> <b>conversions</b> were fitted with Edo 49-4000 pontoons (4,000-pound displacement) for amphibious landings and takeoffs.|$|R
50|$|Retaining major {{structural}} elements and successful sub-assemblies from the wings {{in the initial}} design, a completely new slimmer, strengthened fuselage was added that also offered an excellent rear view aspect for the crew during glider towing operations, and the side doors were re-engineered to open upwards for better aero observation or parachute jump sorties. The upgraded aircraft could be flown with the doors open if required, and had an air <b>ambulance</b> <b>conversion</b> capability.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the first}} Gulf War, Iraq bought around 1,000 BMP-1s and 800 BMP-2s. The first {{vehicles}} were bought by Iraq from the USSR in the 1970s. Iraq also developed two upgrades for the BMP-1 and one armored <b>ambulance</b> <b>conversion.</b> The first upgrade, designated the Saddam I, was shown during the 1989 Baghdad exhibition. It added appliqué armour {{to the sides of}} the hull and looked quite similar to the Soviet BMP-1D. The Saddam I never entered production because the additional armor overloaded the chassis and a suitable replacement engine to handle this extra weight was not available. The second upgrade, designated the Saddam II, added rubber sideskirts, additional armor on the upper hull sides and an ATU box. Unlike the first upgrade, it did enter production and was mainly used by the Iraqi Republican Guard. In 1985 Iraq also developed an armored <b>ambulance</b> <b>conversion</b> (named in some sources as the BMP-1SM) which had the turret removed and the rear part of the vehicle extended to allow the easier transportation of stretchers and walking wounded. The vehicle did not enter service in large numbers.|$|R

50|$|The Ghostbusters' vehicle, the Ectomobile, was in {{the first}} draft of Aykroyd's script, and visualized through concept {{drawings}} by John Daveikis. Early versions of it were jet black, and featured more fantastic features, such as the ability to dematerialize and evade police pursuit. The vehicle used for the Ectomobile during filming was a modified 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor with an aftermarket <b>ambulance</b> <b>conversion.</b> Stephen Dane created its high-tech roof array in Hollywood with various objects including a directional antenna, an air-conditioning unit, storage boxes and a radome. Because of its size, the roof rack was shipped to Manhattan via airplane, while the car had to be transported to the East Coast via train. Sound designer Richard Beggs created the car's distinctive siren from the snarl of a leopard, cut and played backward.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for <b>ambulance</b> <b>conversion</b> if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|R
