25|$|In modern astrology, Mercury is {{regarded}} as the ruler of the third house; traditionally, it had the joy in the first house. Mercury is the messenger of the gods in mythology. It is the planet of day-to-day expression and relationships. Mercury's action is to take things apart <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> together again. It is an opportunistic planet, decidedly unemotional and curious.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much effort}} {{has gone into}} {{restoring}} salt marshes worldwide, further research is needed. There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. Once {{we have a better}} understanding of these processes and not just locally, but over a global scale, we can then suggest more sound and practical management and restoration efforts that can be used to preserve our valuable marshes <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to their original state.|$|E
25|$|The {{generals and}} staff {{officers}} had to reform Bartlett's brigade and deploy {{the men at}} right angles to the Confederate line so they would not be trapped if the Confederates managed a counterattack. Chamberlain rushed two regiments to help. Together, these units put the Confederates to flight, taking about 1,500 prisoners and several battle flags. Bartlett and Chamberlain reorganized 150 to 200 stragglers <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> into the battle. Chamberlain saw Colonel Gwyn's battle flag to the rear and asked Gwyn to have his brigade assist Chamberlain's men, which Gwyn did. Suddenly confronted by a large number of Confederates, Chamberlain feared being caught in a cross-fire when the Confederates suddenly threw down their arms and surrendered.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a meeting}} at army headquarters, an interim {{government}} was formed with Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem as chief martial law administrator and Major General Ziaur Rahman, Air Vice Marshal M. G. Tawab and Rear Admiral M. H. Khan as his deputies. However, discipline in the army had totally collapsed and {{it was difficult to}} disarm the soldiers <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to the barracks. Zia realised that the disorder by the mutiny had to be suppressed firmly if discipline was to be restored in the Bangladesh Army. Zia cracked down on the JSD and Gonobahini. Abu Taher was sentenced to death and other party figures had various terms of imprisonment slapped on them. Taher was executed on 21 July 1976. Zia became the chief martial law administrator following Justice Sayem's elevation to the presidency on 19 November 1976. He tried to integrate the armed forces, giving repatriates a status appropriate to their qualifications and seniority. While this angered some veterans of the independence war, who had rapidly reached high positions following independence in 1971, Zia sent discontented officers on diplomatic missions abroad to defuse unrest..|$|E
500|$|On June 9, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Perry and his fellow Million Dollar Backfield teammate, John Henry Johnson, who died on June 3, 2011, would have their brains examined by researchers at Boston University who are studying head injuries in sports. Both men were suspected of suffering form chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disorder linked to repeated brain trauma. Perry's widow, Donna, told the San Francisco Chronicle that she believes her husband suffered from CTE. She further told the newspaper that [...] "When Joe was playing, they'd give them smelling salts <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> in.

500|$|By the 1990s the temple's {{condition}} {{had deteriorated}} again {{and it had}} suffered heavy vandalism. The Richmond and Twickenham Times reported in 1994 {{that it was in}} a state of [...] "dangerous disrepair" [...] and had suffered from [...] "the theft of lead from the roof and graffiti spray-painted on the walls of the Georgian folly." [...] Vandals had also hacked away one of the wooden columns supporting the portico. In 1995 a campaign was launched to restore the temple and the garden <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> into use for cultural purposes. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £70,000 in 1998–99. Other local groups and a campaign led by the actor Sir John Gielgud provided additional funding to carry out restoration work. The restoration fund was also supported by the actors Sir Peter Hall, Sir Donald Sinden and Richard Briers, and Dame Judi Dench, Jeremy Irons and others have subsequently made donations.|$|E

500|$|Ubisoft Montreal made {{frequent}} scouting {{trips to}} California {{to research the}} setting, and attempted to put most of the local landmarks in that region in the game. For regions {{that they could not}} put in the game, the team redesigned these locations <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> into the game. According to producer Dominic Guay, having realistic and accurate locations featured in the game was essential for the game as they encourage players to explore the open world. Unlike many of Ubisoft's previous open world games, players do not need to climb towers in order to discover locations and missions. Instead, the game is opened up from the start, allowing players to explore the city freely. The game's new progression system, which tasks players to gain followers instead of completing main missions, was another way Ubisoft Montreal hoped to encourage exploration and make the city feel more [...] "free". Watch Dogs 2 had around sixty programmers devoted to its development.|$|E

[...] She tells Tobias that it is his role {{to make all the}} {{decisions}} with regards to what to do about Edna and Harry. She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room is drinking. Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E
