5|$|Races with hurdles as {{obstacles}} {{were first}} popularised in the 19th century in England. The first known event, held in 1830, was {{a variation of}} the 100-yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Clubs in 1864 refined this, holding a 120-yard race (110m) with ten hurdles of 3-foot and 6inches (1.06m) in height (each placed 10 yards (9m) apart), with the first and final hurdles 15 yards from the start <b>and</b> <b>finish,</b> respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric (adding 28cm) and the basics of this race, the men's 110 metres hurdles, has remained largely unchanged. The origin of the 400 metres hurdles also lies in Oxford, where (around 1860) a competition was held over 440yards and twelve 1.06m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics: the distance was fixed to 400m while ten 3-foot (91.44cm) hurdles were placed 35m apart on the track, with the first and final hurdles being 45m and 40m away from the start <b>and</b> <b>finish,</b> respectively. Women's hurdles are slightly lower at 84cm (2ft 9in) for the 100m event and 76cm (2ft 6in) for the 400m event.|$|E
