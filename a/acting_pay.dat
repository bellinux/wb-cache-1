5000|$|The word {{is found}} in the {{writings}} of Plato, and its meaning debated in his dialogue Charmides. Plato's high estimation of sophrosyne may have been influenced by Heraclitus's fragment 112, which states: [...] "Sophrosyne is the greatest virtue, and wisdom is speaking and <b>acting</b> the trust, <b>paying</b> heed to the nature of things." [...] (σωφρονεῖν ἀρετὴ μεγίστη, καὶ σοφίη ἀληθέα λέγειν καὶ ποιεῖν κατὰ φύσιν ἐπαίοντας.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Moore {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario, to Francis John Moore, an Anglican theologian, and Dora Mavor, who helped {{establish}} Canadian professional theatre in the 1930s and 1940s. He began acting {{at the age of}} six on the Hart House Stage and continued his passion throughout high school, turning to radio <b>acting</b> to <b>pay</b> his way through college [...] He received a BA degree from the University of Toronto in 1941. Moore served in the Canadian military as an Intelligence officer during World War II. Following the War, he was employed by CBC Radio, becoming its producer for International Service (based in Montreal).

According to Casa Alianza, Harris had admitted <b>acting</b> improperly by <b>paying</b> for sex with a 19-year-old Honduran {{who had been a}} resident in one of its shelters. [...] "I assume, as I always have done, responsibility for my acts, correct or incorrect... While we all try to do our best, we are also human" [...] said Harris ...|$|R
5000|$|Maslany {{attended}} Dr. Martin LeBoldus High School, {{where she}} participated in school productions and improvisation, and graduated in 2003. While attending high school, she found <b>paying</b> <b>acting</b> jobs that {{allowed her to}} travel all over Canada with her parents' approval. She would work {{for a few months}} at a time and then return to school in Regina. She stated, [...] "It wasn't an easy transition. I felt a little outside of it. Outside of both experiences, really." ...|$|R

5000|$|Baker {{was forced}} to keep <b>acting</b> to <b>pay</b> the bills, often {{accepting}} roles in poor films which adversely affected {{his status as a}} star. His son Glyn later said that:"My dad had to accept any and everything to keep the companies afloat. Doing staggeringly-bad stuff like Popsy Pop, which was an Italian-Venezuelan co-production and A Lizard in a Woman's Skin 1971 - a movie which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. At the slowest period, Stanley still had a payroll of at least 100 in his employ. So it was, 'Here we go - take the money, make this trash, hopefully no one will ever see it.' Famous last words."'According to Michael Deeley, the financiers of British Lion Films were reluctant for Baker {{to be involved in the}} management of the company because they felt his focus was more on his acting career.|$|R
50|$|He left {{high school}} {{at the age of}} 16, and started a BTEC in {{performing}} arts at Barking College. He was expelled after a year for refusing a role in the school play in favour of a <b>paying</b> <b>acting</b> job. He acted in plays in Chichester under the direction of Debra Gillett, wife of Patrick Marber. He met Marber through Gillett, and Marber cast him in the play Howard Katz at the National Theatre. He also performed in His Girl Friday and His Dark Materials there.|$|R

She was a regular on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2012 as Beth.|$|R
5000|$|Oliver understands Jim's {{reliance}} on him, {{but he knew}} that he should not avoid him. Jim's appearance transformed overnight. He was now clean, shaven, and well-dressed. Jim wanted {{to spend some time with}} Oliver like the old days, but Oliver knew he couldn't be around Jim on this trip. His mother would be uproarious if she found out that Jim was on the ship at all. Jim offered Oliver some of his father's books and keep-sakes from the [...] "Black Swan." [...] Jim tells Oliver of his newly planned life. He is to marry a new girl name Bella Iggins, and they plan on <b>acting</b> to <b>pay</b> the bills until he gets his money for the ship and they can settle at a riverside cottage. Oliver knew better than to believe in Jim's plan, he doubted he would get married, but was sure he would be divorced soon afterward if he did follow through with the plan.|$|R
50|$|Osvaldo Laport {{was born}} in Juan Lacaze, Uruguay, from Rubens Sixto and Teresa Natividad. He worked at several casual jobs during his youth. His brother Luis Udaquiola was {{detained}} and tortured, suspected of being linked to the guerrilla group Tupamaros. He moved to Buenos Aires in 1976 and started to study drama at Luis Tasca's Drama School. In order to support his <b>acting</b> classes and <b>pay</b> his room in a hotel downtown {{he had to work}} in some jobs as clown, warehouse employee and bricklayer. In 1979, he met Viviana Sáez in the same school, whom he married the following year (they have one daughter, Jazmín, born in 1995).|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, after {{ending a}} year-long {{starring}} role in a stage production of Tony and Tina's Wedding at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, Mollner moved to Los Angeles {{to pursue a career}} in the film industry. Believing his dream to direct films was a long shot, JT did not pursue it immediately, instead taking small <b>acting</b> jobs to <b>pay</b> the bills, while writing screenplays in his spare time. Mollner soon became frustrated with acting in LA, explaining {{in an interview that he}} was tired of [...] "being a tool in someone else's vision...having to read lines from someone else's script...while wanting to be doing what directors are doing".|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Griffin flew forty bombing {{missions}} and attempted after the conflict {{to become an}} airline pilot but was rejected because at twenty-six he was deemed three years too old to become a beginning pilot. For two years under the GI Bill of Rights, Griffin attended the Theater School of Dramatic Arts in Carnegie Hall in New York City. His wife, Grace, initially a secretary but usually an office manager, supported them during his lean years in <b>acting.</b> His first <b>paying</b> job as an actor was with the summer stock company, the Red Barn Theater of Westborough in Worcester County, Massachusetts. He performed in eight or nine plays, a different one each week. He subsequently appeared in several films and guest starred on various television series between 1952 and 1961. In 1955, the Griffins moved from cold Brooklyn, New York, to sunny Hollywood, California, and occupied an apartment {{that had once been}} half of a house occupied by Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and Mary Pickford.|$|R
40|$|Online display {{advertising}} exchanges connect web publishers with advertis-ers seeking to place ads. In {{many cases the}} advertiser obtains value from an ad impression (a viewing by a user) {{only if it is}} clicked, and frequently advertisers prefer to pay contingent on this occurring. But at the same time many publish-ers demand payment independent of click. Arbitragers with good estimates of click-probabilities can resolve this conflict by absorbing the risk and <b>acting</b> as in-termediary, <b>paying</b> the publisher on allocation and being paid only if a click occurs. This paper examines the incentives of advertisers and arbitragers and contributes an efficient mechanism with truthful bidding by the advertisers and truthful re-porting of click predictions by arbitragers as dominant strategies while, given that a hazard rate condition is satisfied, yielding increased revenue to the publisher. We provide empirical evidence based on bid data from Yahoo’s Right Media Exchange suggesting that the mechanism would increase revenue in practice. ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Albano {{afterwards}} corrected this statement, substituting 27,000 [...] for 40,000: {{and perhaps}} the other sums {{may also have been}} [...] exaggerated, but I leave the reader to consider what an annual [...] expenditure of from 30,000l. to 50,000l. might effect in [...] practical idealism in general, whether in Swiss valleys or [...] elsewhere. I am not one of those who regard all theatrical [...] entertainment as wrong or harmful. I only regret to see our theatres [...] so conducted as to involve an expense which is worse than useless, [...] in leading our audiences to look for mere stage effect, instead of [...] good acting, good singing, or good sense. If we really loved music, [...] or the drama, we should be content to hear well-managed voices, and [...] see finished <b>acting,</b> without <b>paying</b> five or six thousand pounds to [...] dress the songsters or decorate the stage. Simple but well-chosen [...] dresses, and quiet landscape exquisitely painted, would have far [...] more effect on the feelings of any sensible audience than the tinsel [...] and extravagance of our common scenery; and our actors and actresses [...] must have little respect for their own powers, if they think that [...] dignity of gesture is dependent on the flash of jewellery, or the [...] pathos of accents connected with the costliness of silk. Perfect [...] execution of music by a limited orchestra is far more delightful, [...] and far less fatiguing, than the irregular roar and hum of [...] multitudinous mediocrity; and finished instrumentation by an [...] adequate number of performers, exquisite acting, and sweetest [...] singing, might be secured for the public at a fourth part of the [...] cost now spent on operatic absurdities. There is no occasion [...] whatever for decoration of the house: it is, on the contrary, the [...] extreme of vulgarity. No person of good taste ever goes to a theatre [...] to look at the fronts of the boxes. Comfortable and roomy seats, [...] perfect cleanliness, decent and fitting curtains and other [...] furniture, of good stuff, but neither costly nor tawdry, and [...] convenient, but not dazzling, light, are the proper requirements in [...] the furnishing of an opera-house. As for the persons who go there to [...] look at each other--to show their dresses--to yawn away waste [...] hours--to obtain a maximum of momentary excitement--or to say they [...] were there, at next day's three-o'clock breakfast (and it is only [...] for such persons that glare, cost, and noise are necessary), I [...] commend to their consideration, or at least to such consideration as [...] is possible to their capacities, the suggestions in the text. But to [...] the true lovers of the drama I would submit, as another subject of [...] inquiry, whether they ought not to separate themselves from the mob, [...] and provide, for their own modest, quiet, and guiltless [...] entertainment, the truth of heartfelt impersonation, and the melody [...] of the unforced and delicate voice, without extravagance of adjunct, [...] unhealthy lateness of hours, or appeal to degraded passions. Such [...] entertainment might be obtained at infinitely smaller cost, and yet [...] at a price which would secure honorable and permanent remuneration [...] to every performer; and I am mistaken in my notion of the best [...] actors, if they would not rather play at a house where people went [...] to hear and to feel, than weary themselves, even for four times the [...] pay, before an audience insulting in its listlessness and ignorant [...] in its applause.|$|R
