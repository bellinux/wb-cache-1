By using this synthetic approach we have obtained POT nanostructures of uniform granular morphol., with av. 40 - 100 nm particle size doped with oxalic or citric acid, whereas in tartaric <b>acid</b> doped <b>POT</b> fibrilar morphol. with 40 - 60 nm size nano fibers was ascertained.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate effects of Cu application to a calcareous soil and to leaves on the yield and growth of tomato plants. Cu was first applied to soil as CuSO 4. 5 H 2 O in three different levels (0, 1000, and 2000 mg Cu kg- 1) and then to leaves in three different frequencies (no application, biweekly and weekly) using two cupric fungicides (Cu oxychloride, and Cu salts of fatty and rosin <b>acids)</b> in <b>pot</b> experiments carried out in a computer-controlled greenhouse. Total yield, fruit number, dry root weight and plant height decreased with increasing Cu application to soil. Increasing levels of Cu applied to soil and leaves resulted in decreasing final fruit number, dry root weight and plant height in 4 th, 5 th and 6 th weeks.

A green house experiments was conducted to study potential of Ricinus communis and Brassica juncea in metal accumulation at different concentration of Pb and also the effect of the application of two different chelators i. e., EDTA and Citric acid, on the Pb phytoextraction was studied in an artificially contaminated soil. Ricinus communis and Brassica juncea accumulated high concentrations of Pb in its shoots but the biomass, root and shoot length of Brassica juncea was highly affected due to increased Pb accumulation. Ricinus communis showed high tolerance to Pb since the biomass, root and shoot length of the plant was not affected. Chelators had a potential role in enhancing Pb content in both the plants. The results analysed for metal extraction using chelates revealed that EDTA treated pots increased Pb concentration in Ricinus communis and Brassica juncea compared to citric <b>acid</b> treated <b>pots</b> and untreated pots (control).

In another pot trial, Na did not improve lucerne root growth into the same subsoil. In a field trial on a limed, low-Na soil with severe subsoil acidity, the effects offour rates ofNa, three Na carriers, and three rates of gypsum on maize growth were compared. In three out of four seasons grain yield responses to the Na applications were positive, and ofa similar magnitude to the response to gypsum (455 - 925 kg ha"). In another field trial with maize, responses to Na (of up to 1027 kg grain ha") were recorded in two out ofthree years on plots with topsoil acid saturations of greater than 45 %.

40|$|For {{practical}} reasons Spinacia oleracea {{was chosen for}} these pot experiments in a greenhouse. For the quantitative estimation of carotene, a short method was developed. The vitamin C content of leaves decreased rapidly at room temperature and even at ice-box temperature, so analysis had to be rapid (titration with 2, 6 - dichlorophenolindophenol in <b>acid</b> medium). The <b>pots</b> contained pure washed quartz sand or an exactly analysed sandy soil, and were supplied with Krnger's nutrient solution. Increasing the N supply increased the carotene and vitamin C content. Increasing K supply decreased carotene content, but increased vitamin C content. But decrease in carotene content was only obvious in plants grown with little N. The increase of vitamin C content was usually most distinct in plants grown with much N, although it was fairly clear in the whole combined experiment. The influence of P, Ca and Mg salts was small. A final section attempts to interpret the data to demonstrate a relation between chlorophyll and carotene. Ascorbic acid {{was considered to be}} a product of photo- synthesis.

Another sample of Fe(acac) 3 /silica xerogel without PVA addition was prepared in the similar processing conditions.

The two xerogel (with and without PVA) samples were thermally treated, in air, at 220, 260 and 300 °C and characterized by different techniques. XRD investigations revealed phase composition evolution with calcination temperature, from cubic spinel phase (maghemite) to hexagonal stable hematite containing nanocomposite of 10 – 20 nm average crystallite size. These findings were confirmed by Mössbauer spectroscopy. Up to 300 °C, the surface area and total pores volume increased with temperature for all samples.

40|$|Metallic salts {{as well as}} protic {{additives}} {{are widely}} employed in transition metal catalyzed C-H bond functionalization reactions to improve the efficiency of catalytic protocols. In one such example, ZnCl 2 and pivalic acid are used as additives in a palladium catalyzed synthesis of isoxazolone from a readily available benzohydroxamic <b>acid</b> under one <b>pot</b> conditions. In this article, we present some important mechanistic insights {{into the role of}} ZnCl 2 and pivalic acid, gained by using density functional theory (M 06) computations. Two interesting modes of action of ZnCl 2 are identified in various catalytic steps involved in the formation of isoxazolone. The conventional Lewis acid coordination wherein zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 center dot(DMA)) binds to the carbonyl group is found to be more favored in the C-H activation step. However, the participation of a hetero-bimetallic Pd-Zn species is preferred in reductive elimination leading to C-aryl-N bond formation. Pivalic acid helps in relay proton transfer in C-H bond activation through a cyclometallation deprotonation (CMD) process. The explicit inclusion of ZnCl 2 and solvent N, N-dimethyl acetamide (DMA) stabilizes the transition state and also helps reduce the activation barrier for the C-H bond activation step. The electronic communication between the two metal species is playing a crucial role in stabilizing the C-aryl-N bond formation transition state through a Pd-Zn heterobimetallic interaction...|$|R

An experiment was conducted to evaluate phosphorus transformations in the soil and phosphatase activity during periods of Congo grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis, Germain et Evrard) growth in two tropical soils receiving 20, 40, 80, 160 mg dm- 3 of inorganic P.

Phosphorus fertilization increased soil P availability, Congo grass yields and P accumulation in the plant. On average, less labile P forms in the soil were not changed by Congo grass; however, the P in the soil extracted with HCl (P-Ca - non labil form) decreased. This decrease may have resulted from the combination of the presence of grass and phosphatase capacity to dissolve less available P in the soil. Thus, soil exploration by Congo grass roots and the subsequent extraction of calcium phosphate may have increased the P concentration in the plant tissue. Despite the decrease in the P extracted from the soil with HCl resulting in increased labile P forms in the soil, the effect of Congo grass on the availability of P depends on the soil type...|$|R

We have used them for myriad reasons throughout history, including non- essential purposes such as dyes for textiles and paints. Less trivial uses, such as those related to food and health better demonstrate the importance of natural products. We have made use of toxic natural products to bolster hunting efficiency (e. g. poison tipped darts), and insect pheromones and natural products with antifeedant properties have assisted agricultural growth. Therapeutic natural products have long been used as dietary supplements and medicines. The ubiquitous nature of natural products and their derivatives in current health care validates continued laboratory work {{in all areas of}} natural product research. We (The Theodorakis Lab) have viewed natural product synthesis as a tool for expanding our understanding of organic chemistry. Of particular interest, are natural products which contain rare or novel architectural features.

40|$|Comunicación oral presentada en el European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2016 Vienna, Austria | 17 – 22 April 2016 In {{areas with}} {{frequent}} wildfires, soil organic nitrogen (SON) is sequestered in pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) due to heat-induced transformation of proteinaceous compounds into N-heterocycles, i. e. pyrrole, imidazole and indole compounds. These newly formed structures, known as Black Nitrogen (BN), have been {{assumed to be}} hardly degradable by microorganisms, thus being efficiently sequestered from the N cycle. On the other hand, a previous study showed that nitrogen of BN {{can be used by}} plants for the built-up of their biomass (de la Rosa and Knicker 2011). Thus, BN may play an important role as an N source during the recovery of the forest after a fire event. In order to obtain a more profound understanding of the role of BN within the N cycle in soils, we studied the bioavailability and incorporation of N derived from PyOM into microbial amino <b>acids.</b> For that, <b>pots</b> with soil from a burnt and an unburnt Cambisol located under a Mediterranean forest were covered with different amendments. The toppings were mixtures of unlabeled KNO 3 with 15 N labeled grass or 15 N-labeled PyOM from burned grass and K 15 NO 3 mixed with unlabeled grass material or PyOM. The pots were kept in the greenhouse under controlled conditions for 16 months and were sampled after 0. 5, 1, 5, 8 and 16 months. From all samples the amino acids were extracted after hydrolysis (6 M HCl, 22 h, 110 ºC) and quantified via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The fate of 15 N was followed by isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The results show that the contribution of extractable amino acids to total soil organic matter was always higher in the unburnt than in the burnt soil. However, with ongoing incubation their amount decreased. Already after 0. 5 months, some PyOM-derived 15 N was incorporated into the extractable amino acids and the amount increased with experiment time. Since this can only occur after prior microbial degradation of PyOM our results clearly support a lower biochemical recalcitrance of N-rich charred residues than formerly assumed. Our experiment demonstrated further that aside from being incorporated into plants (de la Rosa and Knicker 2011) the release PyOM-N can also be used for the built-up of new microbial biomass.
