500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Tennis Court" [...] address Lorde's newly {{established}} fame and criticise the [...] "high life." [...] Lorde said {{she wrote the}} song [...] "after having had {{a glimpse into the}} music industry, and I was just thinking about how superficial people can be and how we put up all these fronts." [...] She found the idea of a tennis court [...] "very visually beautiful" [...] and [...] "something I kept coming back to on Tumblr and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing", saying it was [...] "kind of a symbol of nostalgia for me. It was something which was familiar and safe to me." [...] She also described the song as being [...] "about the town where she grew up and the friends [...] she would ... hang out all summer." [...] Paul Lester, writing for The Guardian, compared the song's lyrical theme to that of two other songs by Lorde: [...] "Royals" [...] and [...] "Million Dollar Bills" [...] (from The Love Club EP).|$|E

He {{was playing in}} cabaret lounges and entertaining all sorts of people, driving a pink Mercedes, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> stuff, straight out of school!" [...] Hunter also provided drums and vocals {{as a member of}} a band, Quintessence, which performed at a restaurant in Auckland.|$|E
2500|$|The hits just {{inspired}} {{confidence in}} us. We became totally involved in getting dressed up {{and going out}} to gigs, the gigs and rehearsals were everything. Nothing worried us, we were so busy consuming what was happening around us. We were super aware, on top of every trend in music and clothes and language. We tried {{to be honest and}} sincere with our music, only playing and recording what we liked. The guys in the good record bars dug what we were doing and they got in all the latest English R records for us. We were listening to Zoot Money, John Mayall, Manfred Mann, The Animals, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> stuff and trying to create that sound. We were different from groups like The Underdogs who just played 12-bar blues all night; we tried {{to be a lot more}} imaginative about what we did ... We had no idea what we were earning on tour, we just spent what we wanted and ploughed the rest back into the band. We had our way with girls, bought more clothes and equipment and just enjoyed being stars.|$|E

2500|$|Paine captained Tasmania at Under–15 and Under–17 level, {{along with}} {{being a member of}} its Under–19 team at the age of just fifteen. He was vice-captain of the Australian Under–17, before scoring a first grade century for the University club in Hobart. [...] "He was always the {{smallest}} one playing cricket," [...] Paine's father John said. [...] "We lived in a fairly quiet street and we lived right next to the beach [...] so they used to play a fair bit of beach cricket. We used to have a cricket pitch in our backyard which was the driveway and the next-door neighbours had a turf wicket which the boys used to roll and mow and do <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> stuff. So he had to learn from an early age I suppose to be a bit stronger and a bit more competitive." [...] As a junior, Paine was a talented Australian rules player—considered good enough to make the Australian Football League (AFL)—and his brother Nick, one of four siblings, plays in the Tasmanian Football League with the Clarence Football Club. Paine's uncle, Robert Shaw, was an AFL player and coach.|$|E
