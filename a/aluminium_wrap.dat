30|$|AQUA TITAN-treated {{material}} {{is shown to}} exert effects on physiology even when not {{in direct contact with}} nerves, this is supported by several lines of evidence in cells cultured in plates above pico- to micrometer thickness of titanium: with evidence of enhanced osteoblast differentiation (Sugita et al. 2011), migration, proliferation, and differentiation of myoblasts (Ishizaki et al. 2011) and altered neuronal firing rate (Korte 2008). That the effects of titanium are inhibited when cells are shielded with <b>aluminium</b> <b>wrapping</b> and lead plates in both animal and culture studies (Aoi et al. 2009; Korte 2008), indicates that the influence of AQUA TITAN on neurons seems to be mediated via some factor that can cross open space but does not penetrate other metals, such as electromagnetic waves. This is further supported in a recent in vivo study where altered physiological stress responses were measured following five days sleeping in a room containing titanium (Aoi et al. 2012). Further research is required to determine the magnitude and clinical effects of longer-term exposure to wearable garments treated with AQUA TITAN, while information on dose response and on the physical and physiological mechanisms will be valuable in determining if there is a robust evidential base for application.|$|R

Some of its benefits are to obtain triploid and tetraploid progenies {{at the same time}} by cross and self pollination. Previous research showed that some morphological characters which could be the indications of polyploidy plantlets before the analysis of chromosome number. Colchicine treatment on flower bud of diploid Phalaenopsis amabilis was conducted to determine the effect of colchicine on flower bud development, plantlets morphology and growth, and potential of polyploidy induction based on plantlets morphology. Colchicine concentrations in the experiment were 0, 50, 500, 1, 000, and 2, 000 mg L- 1, with three days duration of treatments with <b>aluminium</b> foil <b>wraps</b> on flower buds. The results showed that high colchicine concentrations (2, 000 mg L- 1) inhibited flowers blooming of treated flower buds.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. For fast and effective simulation of filling processes of pressure vessels with compressed gaseous media the governing equations are derived from a mass balance equation for the gas and from energy balance equations for the gas and {{the wall of the}} vessel. For simplicity the gas is considered as a perfectly mixed phase and two heat transfer coefficients are introduced. The first one is the mean heat transfer coefficient between the gas and the inner surface of the pressure vessel and the second one is the heat transfer coefficient between outer surface of the vessel and the surroundings. Although the process is transient, steady-state heat transfer coefficients for free convection are used between outer surface of the vessel and the surroundings. The use of available correlations for steady-state heat transfer coefficients to describe transient processes is common practice, e. g. in the modelling of the transient behaviour of heat exchangers [1]. But no correlations – neither steady-state nor transient – are available for the heat transfer coefficient between inflowing gas and inner surface of the vessel. To solve this problem a CFD tool is used to determine the gas velocities at the vicinity of the inner surface of the vessel for a number of discrete surface elements. The results of a large amount of numerical experiments show that there exists a unique relationship between the tangential fluid velocities at the vicinity of the inner surface of the vessel and the gas velocity at the inlet. Once this unique relationship is known the complete velocity distribution at the vicinity of the inner surface can be easily calculated from the inlet velocity of the gas. The nearwall velocities at the outer limit of the boundary layer are substituted into the heat transfer correlation for external flow over flat plates. The final heat transfer coefficient is the areaweighted mean of all local heat transfer coefficients. The method is applied to the special case of filling a 70 MPa composite vessel for fuel cell vehicles with hydrogen. Because of the heat capacity of the composite wall consisting of an inner <b>aluminium</b> liner <b>wrapped</b> with carbon fibre, heat transfer from the compressed gas to the vessel wall strongly influences the temperature field of the gas which is predicted by the model and confirmed by experiments. vk 201...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inadvertent {{hypothermia}} {{is common}} in patients undergoing surgical procedures with a reported prevalence of perioperative hypothermia ranging from 50 % to 90 %. Hypothermia within the perioperative environment may have many undesired physiological effects {{that are associated with}} postoperative morbidity. There are different options for treating and/or preventing hypothermia within the adult perioperative environment, which include active and passive warming methods. This systematic review was undertaken to provide comprehensive evidence on the most effective strategies for prevention and management of inadvertent hypothermia in the perioperative environment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to identify the most effective methods for the treatment and/or preventions of hypothermia in intraoperative or postoperative patients. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adult patients ≥ 18 years of age, who underwent any type of surgery were included in this review. Types of interventions included were any type of linen or cover, <b>aluminium</b> foil <b>wraps,</b> forced-air warming devices, radiant warming devices and fluid warming devices. This review considered all identified prospective studies that used a clearly described process for randomisation, and/or included a control group. The primary outcome of Interest was change in core body temperature. REVIEW METHODS: Two independent reviewers assessed methodological validity of papers selected for retrieval and any disagreements were resolved through discussion. RESULTS: Nineteen studies with a combined 1451 patients who underwent different surgical procedures were included in this review. Meta-analysis was not possible. Forced-air warming in pregnant women scheduled for caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia prevented maternal and foetal hypothermia. Intravenous and irrigating fluids warmed (38 – 40 °C) to a temperature higher than that of room temperature by different fluid warming devices (both dry and water heated) proved significantly beneficial to patients in terms of stable haemodynamic variables, and higher core temperature {{at the end of the}} surgery. Water garment warmer was significantly (P 0. 05) effective than forced-air warming in maintaining intraoperative normothermia in orthotopic liver transplantation patients. Extra warming with forced air compared to routine thermal care was effective in reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections and postoperative cardiac complications. Passive warming with reflective heating blankets or elastic bandages wrapped around the legs tightly were found to be ineffective in reducing the incidence or magnitude of hypothermia. CONCLUSION: There are significant benefits associated with forced-air warming. Evidence supports commencement of active warming preoperatively and monitoring it throughout the intraoperative period. Single strategies such as forced-air warming were more effective than passive warming; however, combined strategies, including preoperative commencement, use of warmed fluids plus forced-air warming as other active strategies were more effective in vulnerable groups (age or durations of surgeries).

40|$|Corrosion under {{insulation}} (CUI) is {{an extensive}} and costly {{problem for the}} petrochemical and chemical industry. Both good coatings to mitigate the problem and test methods {{to ensure the quality}} of these coatings are needed. In this thesis, four coatings; standard epoxy coating, epoxy phenolic coating, titanium modified inorganic copolymer (TMIC) and thermally sprayed aluminium (TSA), were tested for their ability to mitigate the problem. To simulate the CUI conditions, several test methods may be used, as there is no consensus on which method that best represents the CUI conditions. The cyclic pipe test developed by Halliday et al. [1] were used and evaluated in this work. In this test method, the coatings were applied at carbon steel pipes with outer diameter of 6 cm and length of 60 cm. Calcium silicate insulation covered by <b>aluminium</b> foil was <b>wrapped</b> around the pipes and this was placed in casseroles and put on hot plates. 30 cycles with cyclic temperatures and wet/dry conditions were performed. 1 cycle ran for 24 hours and consisted 8 hours of heating at 450 oC followed by 16 hours of natural cooling at ambient temperature. Before and after each heating period, 1 litre of 1 % NaCl solution was poured into the insulation. The results showed that best protection was achieved by the TMIC coating with no degradation up to 300 oC. Second came the TSA with no degradation up to 190 oC. The epoxy phenolic had the lowest temperature tolerance with blistering and poor adhesion at 160 oC and failure by rusting and blistering at 220 oC. The testing of the standard epoxy was not completed due to lack of time. The cyclic pipe test proved to be an overall good test method for comparing coatings for CUI protection. All the major problems as thermal cycling with high temperatures, wetting and drying period, intermittent immersion and thermal shock are included in the test. It is also relatively easy to set up and not very demanding concerning equipment. Some improvements could be made for the test method regarding more constant testing conditions between tests. These are:?	A test set-up with a horizontally placed pipe with a heat source in one of the ends could be developed to create equal immersion conditions {{along the length of the}} test pipe. ?	To set additional fixed terms to minimize variations between tests and improve the temperature control. </p...|$|R
