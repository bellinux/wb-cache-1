5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} {{installations}} were identified from Royal Air Force (RAF) aerial reconnaissance photographs during 1941, but their exact purpose <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment that they possessed was not known. Some British scientists believed that these stations were {{connected with the}} heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe. The scientists requested {{that one of these}} installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and, if possible, extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination.|$|E
5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after the find was made, and when the {{remaining}} objects were recovered, {{it was discovered that}} the other ring had been cut into at least four pieces by a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged to the point of illegibility. Fortunately, detailed drawings, a cast, and a photograph made by London's Arundel Society of the ring before it was damaged survive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost character can be established with relative certainty.|$|E

5|$|Written by Chris Avellone, the {{character}} was {{created as a}} sounding board for the game's theme {{of the role of}} the Jedi <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Force, and was heavily influenced by s Ravel Puzzlewell. She served both to test the player and to act as a mouthpiece for any questions Avellone thought should be asked about the Star Wars universe. Sara Kestelman voiced {{the character}}, with Kreia's casting being considered the most important of all the characters. Her name references Princess Leia of the original Star Wars trilogy, while her character design draws both on Palpatine's hood and Obi-Wan Kenobi's robes.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E

5|$|First Contact was the highest-grossing film on {{its opening}} weekend, making $92 {{million in the}} United States and Canada with an {{additional}} $54 million in other territories, combining a worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it {{to be one of}} the best Star Trek films. The Borg and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean-Luc Picard's parallels to Herman Melville's Ahab <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Borg. First Contact was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup and won three Saturn Awards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function. These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory underpinning, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reprimand function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 of the Securities and Futures Act, which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's financial sector. Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E
5|$|Quern stones: Quern {{stones were}} used in China at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The {{production}} of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site {{is located in the}} heartland of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River.|$|E

5|$|Reserved and efficient, Ianto {{was often}} used by writers to add humorous asides to the episodes' scripts. The {{character}} becomes the main romantic interest of Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), {{who is the}} lead male of the series. Established to have had heterosexual relationships prior to the series, Ianto's story forms {{a part of the}} show's ongoing exploration of human sexuality. Expanded Universe material develops on Ianto's sexual orientation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship with Jack, describing Ianto as bisexual and his feelings for Jack as genuine love. Additionally, writers have used these other media to explore Ianto's characterisation; for example, some stories elaborate on Ianto's backstory, or provide insight into his feelings.|$|E
5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} the origins <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bad blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists {{because he was}} one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or be in an elevator with Silva, but he was not one of them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Age {{coincided with}} the rise of pop art, an artistic {{movement}} that used popular cultural artifacts, such as advertising and packaging, as source material for fine, or gallery-exhibited, art. Roy Lichtenstein, one of the best-known pop art painters, specifically chose individual panels from comic books and repainted the images, modifying them to some extent in the process but including in the painting word and thought balloons and captions as well as enlarged-to-scale color dots imitating the coloring process then used in newsprint comic books. An exhibition of comic strip art was held at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs of the Palais de Louvre in 1967, and books were soon published that contained serious discussions of the art of comics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium.|$|E

5|$|The {{peoples of}} early Iron Age Scotland, {{particularly}} {{in the north and}} west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 to 300 with the most imposing structures having been created around the 2ndcentury. The most massive constructions that date from this time are the circular broch towers. On average, the ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed 6.5m (21ft) in height. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland. Despite extensive research, their purpose <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> societies that created them are still a matter of debate.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{while the}} {{armoured}} units {{that were involved}} in operations overseas acquitted themselves well, despite significant investment {{in the development of}} tank forces, they ultimately played a limited role in the Australian war effort. Three armoured divisions capable of independent operations were formed during World War II, but none were deployed outside Australia. Many individual units later fought against the Japanese in the Pacific, although only in regimental strength. Despite initial delays in receiving adequate equipment a considerable force had subsequently been developed, although it was not until late 1942 that the first units saw action in support of the infantry in New Guinea. Yet the need to quickly deploy units following the rapid Japanese advance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrain in the South West Pacific Area in which the bulk of Australian forces would fight meant they were unable to be deployed as a formation. Meanwhile, as the threat of invasion passed the need for large armoured formations had lessened, and the divisions had been broken up between mid-1943 and 1944 with only one operational brigade remaining {{by the end of the}} war. However, despite using tanks that were obsolete by the standards of the war in Europe the contribution of the Australian Armoured Corps to the success of later campaigns was significant, lessening casualties among the infantry and demonstrating the role of tanks in jungle operations. The Matilda proved the most successful tank used in jungle fighting by the Australian Army, achieving immediate success following its deployment to New Guinea in 1943 due to its heavy armour, manoeuvrability in close terrain, and the effectiveness of its 2-pounder against Japanese bunkers. This was possible due to the limited number of effective antitank weapons deployed by the Japanese in the areas where the Matilda was used, while the terrain was conducive to it being operated alongside infantry—in the role for which the Matilda had originally been designed.|$|E
