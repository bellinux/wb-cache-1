Normative statements and model building fostering now the environmental area.In this period the development of teaching programmes about social and environmental accounting issues has its roots.Despite an increasing use of conceptual frameworks, accounting standards, and legal provisions to reduce the degree of individual interpretation in financial reporting little of this accounting structuration applies to an own appropriate framework of social and environmental accounting. Less normative statement have been made, but more articles discussing philosophical matters.|$|E

50|$|The {{area has}} strong links to both {{economic}} sociology, economic anthropology, social accounting and other critical accounting research. Sociology {{has had a}} longstanding interest in value and values, which naturally feeds into {{an examination of the}} tools and processes of valuation in society. In terms of economic sociology, Viviana Zelizer and the cultural school of economic sociology can be seen as an early precursor to this area of interest, with following work by her students and postdoctoral researchers (e.g. Olav Velthuis in art), along with Patrick Aspers, Jens Beckert, Marion Fourcade, Michele Lamont, Donald MacKenzie, David Stark and many others. Considerably more could be said on the topic about French sociologists, given the longstanding traditions of theorists like Pierre Bourdieu. While the methods of researchers from economic sociology tended to be either qualitative (usually cultural approaches) or quantitative, a different approach came from the critical <b>accounting</b> <b>area,</b> with a focus on accounting models, tools and devices. Here, the theory of market devices was one early precursor to this work, and {{it should be noted that}} researchers in this area have been strongly influenced by sociological research in both the US and European schools. Part of this is due to the overlap of work from science and technology studies (STS) and sociology of knowledge, where we again see influences from e.g. Donald MacKenzie and Karin Knorr Cetina, as well as Bruno Latour, Michel Callon and related Paris-Mines innovation school and others, such as Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thévenot.|$|E

With this aim, the authors conducted a study using a questionnaire, whose results were analyzed and interpreted.

The debate of these hidden costs involved the treating of notions {{that exist in the}} accounting language, but are still not sufficiently explored by the specialists in the area.

40|$|Principles-based {{accounting}} standards require {{the application of}} profes- sional judgment {{in the production of}} nancial statements. In recent years, the bene ts of such judgment has been debated, for example in relation to fair value measurement. An <b>accounting</b> <b>area</b> where estimates are of partic- ular sign cance is that of credit losses in the banking sector. In this paper, we evaluate the `incurred loss model' under IFRS - an <b>accounting</b> <b>area</b> char- acterized by relatively few estimates compared to the `expected loss model'. We nd that only recognizing incurred losses decreases the validity of loan loss provisions and thus has a negative e ect on the quality of accounting for credit losses in banks. This indicates that the expected loss model would work better to prevent or reduce negative e ects of nancial crises. There are consequently important implications for the IASB as it deliberates whether to adopt the more principles-based `expected loss model'...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} {{by the need to}} characterize scientific research on the "Mental Accounting" construct in the period 1900 to 2015. Mental Accounting is a branch of Accounting science that aims at guiding individuals to make financial decisions as successful enterprises.

The main objective {{of this study is to}} describe and to analyze the progress of Accounting research in the Mental <b>Accounting</b> <b>area</b> in the mentioned period, based on an approach of content analysis. The results confirm the need for Accounting research in the Mental <b>Accounting</b> <b>area,</b> although in recent years a gradual progress and greater interest in it is seen. However, despite being considered a promising area, it is still little explored in the literature. We also note that the consumer and his purchasing decisions are priority issues, with focus on the main concept of Mental Accounting in this area, namely the "Loss Aversion" As a suggestion for future works we propose the investigation of other issues related to the Mental Accounting construct, with the aim of expanding the approaches to the issue.
