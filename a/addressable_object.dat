40|$|The first {{question}} to be asked in any consideration of addressing is what are the types of object for which addresses are being provided? The {{most common form of}} an address is the postal address. In this case, the “addressable object” is the postal delivery point. This address is frequently used as a synonym for the building, be it residential, commercial or public, and for referencing purposes beyond the delivery of mail. The address is usually built around a property identifier (e. g. building number or name), street name, and a sequence of geographic areas (town, county, country etc). However, {{there is no reason why}} addresses should be restricted to buildings. This paper discusses the requirement for addresses, how addresses can be created for a range of classes of <b>addressable</b> <b>object,</b> and outlines a definitive address infrastructure.

The content names in MotusNet are hierarchical, {{so that they can}} be aggregated in the routing tables to support a larger number of contents. Further, the process of content replication improves availability, performance, and defends against denial of service attacks by localizing their effect. Additionally, using content migration, similar contents can be placed closer together in order to improve the degree of aggregation.

AppleScript can do basic calculations and text processing, and is extensible, allowing the use of scripting additions that add new functions to the language. Mainly, however, AppleScript relies on the functionality of applications and processes to handle complex tasks. As a structured command language, AppleScript {{can be compared to}} Unix shells, the Microsoft Windows Script Host, or IBM REXX in its purpose, but it is unique from all three. Essential to its functionality is the fact that Macintosh applications publish [...] "dictionaries" [...] of <b>addressable</b> <b>objects</b> and operations.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} {{specifications}} {{of the web}} (1990-1994), the term resource is barely used at all. The web is designed as a network of more or less static <b>addressable</b> <b>objects,</b> basically files and documents, linked using uniform resource locators (URLs). A web resource is implicitly defined as something which can be identified. The identification deserves two distinct purposes: naming and addressing; the latter only depends on a protocol. It is notable that RFC 1630 does not attempt to define at all the notion of resource; actually it barely uses the term besides its occurrence in URI, URL and URN, and still speaks about [...] "Objects of the Network".|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{much effort}} {{has been devoted to}} {{analyzing}} the performance of distributed memory systems for multiprocessors. Such systems usually consist of a set of memories or caches, some device such as a bus or switch to connect the memories and proces-sors, and a policy for determining when to put which <b>addressable</b> <b>objects</b> in which memories. In attempting to evaluate such sys-tems, it has generally proven difficult to separate the performance implications of the hardware architecture from those of the policy that controls the hardware (whether implemented in software or hardware). In this paper we describe the use of off-line optimal analysis to achieve this separation. Using a trace-driven dynamic programming algorithm, we compute the policy decisions that would maximize overall memory system performance for a given program execution. The result allows us to eliminate the artifacts of any arbitrarily chosen policy when evaluating hardware perfor-mance, and provides a baseline against which to compare the performance of particular, realizable, policies. We illustrate this technique in the context of software-controlled page migration and replication and argue for its applicability to other forms of multiprocessor memory management.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, we have {{witnessed}} the introduction of Internet of Things {{as an integral part}} of the Internet with billions of interconnected and <b>addressable</b> everyday <b>objects.</b> On the one hand, these objects generate massive volume of data that can be exploited to gain useful insights into our day-to-day needs. On the other hand, context-aware recommender systems (CARSs) are intelligent systems that assist users to make service consumption choices that satisfy their preferences based on their contextual situations. However, one of the major challenges in developing CARSs is the lack of functionality providing dynamic and reliable context information required by the recommendation decision process based on the objects that users interact with in their environments. Thus, contextual information obtained from IoT objects and other sources can be exploited to build CARSs that satisfy users’ preferences, improve quality of experience and recommendation accuracy. This article describes various components of a conceptual IoT based framework for context-aware personalized recommendations. The framework addresses the weakness whereby CARSs rely on static and limited contextual information from user’s mobile phone, by providing additional components for reliable and dynamic contextual information, using IoT context sources. The core of the framework consists of context recognition and reasoning management, dynamic user profile model incorporating trust to improve accuracy of context-aware personalized recommendations. Experimental evaluations show that incorporating context and trust in personalized recommendations can improve its accuracy...|$|R

The Internet of Things is a {{bearer network}} {{based on the}} Internet, the {{traditional}} telecommunications network, wireless self-organizing networks etc, so that all can be individually <b>addressable</b> ordinary physical <b>objects</b> to achieve the interconnection network. The Internet of Things is evolved from the wireless sensor network, which has limited resource in energy, memory, calculation, bandwidth and etc,. In addition, many applications in the Internet of Things are related to user privacy. In the process of data collection and transmission, the data may be forged, tampered, {{and a variety of}} other information security threats. In order to extend the network lifetime, to protect the authenticity and reliability of data fusion, this paper presents a reputation model of data fusion algorithm. The algorithm is verified by simulation, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and the result of data aggregation is reliable. 1...|$|R

40|$|Internet of Things (IoT) is {{the future}} of {{ubiquitous}} and personalised intelligent service delivery. It consists of interconnected, <b>addressable</b> and communicating <b>objects,</b> which are embedded in our environments. To realize this new and promising generation of ubiquitous systems, the IoT's 'smart' objects should be supported with intelligent platforms for data acquisition, preprocessing, classification, modelling, reasoning and inference including context distribution. However, some current IoT systems lack these capabilities: they provide only the functionality for obtaining raw sensor data. In this paper, we propose a framework towards deriving high-level context information from streams of raw IoT sensor data, using artificial neural networks (ANN) as context recognition model. Before building the model, the data was preprocessed using weighted average low-pass filtering and a sliding window with overlapping algorithm. From the resulting windows, statistical features were extracted as vectors, which were used to train the ANN model. Evaluations of the proposed system show that it has between 87. 3 % and 98. 1 % accuracies...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} a significant proliferation of Internet-capable devices. While its greatest commercial impact {{has been in the}} area of consumer electronics, with the smartphone revolution and the uptake of wearables, connecting humans is only part of a greater trend toward the interconnection of the physical world with the digital world. While the Internet is a communication network connecting people to information, the Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected ecosystem of uniquely <b>addressable</b> physical <b>objects</b> with varying degrees of sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities, sharing the ability to communicate and interoperate through the Internet as their common denominator [1]. With the IoT paradigm, sensor-equipped devices can provide fine-grained information about the physical world, allowing cloud-based resources to extract value from such information and possibly make decisions to be implemented by actuator-equipped devices, blurring the line between the IoT and the broader concept of Cyber-Physical Systems [2], [3] and [4], which does not necessarily presuppose Internet connectivity per se. The vagueness of the term ?Things?makes it hard to define the ever expanding boundaries of the IoT, {{but at the same time}} offers a clear idea of its heterogeneity and its virtually limitless application potential. This has spawned very encouraging projections from market analysts and corporate players who envision a multi-trillion dollar market for the IoT. As commercial success materializes, the IoT continues to offer a seemingly boundless supply of opportunities for both business and research. This special issue of Computer Communications is dedicated to the latter, offering a varied collection of research contributions to cutting-edge themes within the IoT space.

40|$|Context: The NIRSpec {{instrument}} for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can be operated in multiobject (MOS), long-slit, and integral field (IFU) mode with spectral resolutions from 100 to 2700. Its MOS mode uses {{about a quarter}} of a million individually <b>addressable</b> minislits for <b>object</b> selection, covering a field of view of ∼ 9 arcmin^ 2. Aims: The pipeline used to extract wavelength-calibrated spectra from NIRSpec detector images relies heavily on a model of NIRSpec optical geometry. We demonstrate how dedicated calibration data from a small subset of NIRSpec modes and apertures can be used to optimize this parametric model to the necessary levels of fidelity. Methods: Following an iterative procedure, the initial fiducial values of the model parameters are manually adjusted and then automatically optimized, so that the model predicted location of the images and spectral lines from the fixed slits, the IFU, and a small subset of the MOS apertures matches their measured location in the main optical planes of the instrument. Results: The NIRSpec parametric model is able to reproduce the spatial and spectral position of the input spectra with high fidelity. The intrinsic accuracy (1 -sigma, RMS) of the model, as measured from the extracted calibration spectra, is better than 1 / 10 of a pixel along the spatial direction and better than 1 / 20 of a resolution element in the spectral direction for all of the grating-based spectral modes. This is fully consistent with the corresponding allocation in the spatial and spectral calibration budgets of NIRSpec. Comment: 17 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
