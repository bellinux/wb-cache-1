30|$|The {{hydrocarbon}} <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{is a key}} parameter in resources {{evaluation by}} genetic techniques. Methods of obtaining its value scientifically have always been an important factor influencing evaluation credibility. In this paper, the hydrocarbon accumulation system is evaluated quantitatively by establishing a hierarchy structure model based on an analytical hierarchy process. The hydrocarbon accumulation system of a higher exploration degree is selected as a calibration area and its hydrocarbon <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> can be calculated using methods of hydrocarbon generation potential and reservoir-scale sequence. The hydrocarbon <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a petroleum accumulation system can be gained by analogy of reservoir forming comprehensive evaluation results with the calibration area. The hydrocarbon <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of each petroleum accumulation system in the upper reservoir-forming combination of the Liaohe Western Sag can be obtained with this method. Practice shows that using the analytical hierarchy process to quantitatively evaluate the hydrocarbon accumulation system and then quantitatively predict the hydrocarbon <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> decreases the influence of human factors in resources evaluation, and makes the resources assessment more objective {{and closer to the}} actual geological condition.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{methodology}} of ecological risk assessment for the terrestrial ecosystem under chronic radioactive pollution of a biotope near a regional radioactive waste storage {{has been developed}} {{in terms of the}} critical environmental loads analyzed. It consists of five stages: determination of effect indicators and assessment of their values; establishment of reference species and indices; assessment and analysis of critical loads by plotting “dose-effect ” dependencies; ecological risk assessment from critical loads versus permissible values; plotting of risk functions to calculate the expected adverse alterations in the ecosystem. Based on the results obtained the storage risk for a terrestrial ecosystem is considered to be inadmissible and this implies unstable conditions in the territory in the nearest future. The calculations and mapping have shown that in the territory studied the area with excess critical loads is 48 % for CFU and 61 % for 90 Sr <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The analyzed risk functions give evidence of highly probable negative alterations in the tested ecosystem: 85 % for CFU and 99 % for 90 Sr <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Key words:Radioactive waste storage, Sr- 90, Ecological ris...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to define the {{relationship}} between the concentration of PAHs in sewage sludge at a particular location and their amount in various plant materials growing on it. The credibility of the results is enhanced by the fact that sewage sludge from two separate sewage-treatment plants were selected for their influence on the content of PAHs in three plant species growing on them. The investigations were carried out for a period of three years. The results demonstrated unequivocally that the uptake of PAHs by a plant depended on polyaromatic hydrocarbon concentration in the sewage sludge. The correlation between <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of PAH in a plant and the content of the same PAH in the sewage sludge had for three-, four- and five-ring hydrocarbons an exponential character and for six-ring hydrocarbons was of a linear character. The accumulation coefficients calculated for three-ring aromatics were several times higher than for four-ring PAHs; further the coefficient values calculated for five-ring PAHs were several times lower than for four-ring hydrocarbons. Finally, the <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> values of six-ring PAHs were the lowest in the series of studied polyaromatic hydrocarbons...|$|E

Total As in the soils ranged from 5. 3 to 2035. 3 mg/kg, soluble and extractable As from 0. 01 to 8. 5 and from 0. 04 to 35. 8 mg/kg, respectively. The As concentrations in the different fractions of soil were correlated significantly or very significantly. Sixty-four plant species were analyzed. The highest As contents were found in roots and leaves of Mentha aquatica (540 and 216 mg/kg, respectively) and in roots of Phragmites australis (688 mg/kg). In general, the As {{contents of}} plants were low, especially in crops and in the most common wild species.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of controlling the}} solidification and cooling time of castings creates prospects of improving their structure and by the same their properties. Thermal properties of the mould constitute therefore an important factor which is necessary to consider while seeking for the mentioned improvement.

It was found that during germination the nickel from the seed is intensively translocated to the root and shoot of young plants. With increase of applied concentrations of nickel, its concentration in the root and shoot increased as well. Nickel concentration and <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> were higher in the root than in the shoot except at the highest applied concentration when the result was opposite. The highest applied concentration of nickel increased percentage of atypical seedlings and non-germinated seeds and decreased percentage of typical seedlings, germination energy and seed germination ability. Nickel implementation did not affect the growth and mass of the shoot. Root mass and length of the primary root decreased at the highest concentration of nickel, which led to change in shoot and root mass ratio. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that only the highest applied nickel concentration affected the biological value of the seed and the growth of young maize plants, regardless of its intensive accumulation in the root and the shoot, which indicates a significant tolerance of maize in initial phases of growth to presence of high nickel concentration. Intensive translocation of nickel during germination into newly formed organs points to its good mobility and potential possibility to enter the food chain from a contaminated seed...|$|E

Total arsenic in water samples (4. 5 to 280 µg/L) {{was correlated with}} electrical conductivity, total dissolved solid, total hardness, alkalinity, chloride, sulphate, bicarbonate, calcium and sodium (p< 0. 001). Total arsenic in the soils ranged from 105. 4 to 1500 mg/kg. Some of the soil factors {{play an important role}} in soil arsenic content and its bioavailability for organisms. In general, the arsenic concentrations in plants were low, especially in the most common wild species.

Cadmium (Cd) exists in extremely high concentrations in soil due to the considerable input of industrial wastewater into the soil ecosystem. The in situ technique of diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT), the ex situ static equilibrium approach (HAc, EDTA and CaCl 2), and the dissolved concentration in soil solution, as well as microwave digestion, were applied to predict the Cd bioavailability of soil, aiming to provide a robust and accurate method for Cd bioavailability evaluation in Yixing. Moreover, the typical local cash crops—paddy and zizania aquatica—were selected for Cd accumulation, aiming to select the ideal plants with tolerance to the soil Cd contamination. The {{results indicated that the}} biomasses of the two applied plants were sufficiently sensitive to reflect the stark regional differences of different sampling sites. The zizania aquatica could effectively reduce the total Cd concentration, as indicated by the high <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> However, the fact that the zizania aquatica has extremely high transfer coefficients, and its stem, as the edible part, might accumulate large amounts of Cd, led to the conclusion that zizania aquatica was not an ideal cash crop in Yixing. Furthermore, the labile Cd concentrations which were obtained by the DGT technique and dissolved in the soil solution showed a significant correlation with the Cd concentrations of the biota accumulation. However, the ex situ methods and the microwave digestion-obtained Cd concentrations showed a poor correlation with the accumulated Cd concentration in plant tissue. Correspondingly, the multiple linear regression models were built for fundamental analysis of the performance of different methods available for Cd bioavailability evaluation. The correlation coefficients of DGT obtained by the improved multiple linear regression model have not significantly improved compared to the coefficients obtained by the simple linear regression model. The results revealed that DGT was a robust measurement, which could obtain the labile Cd concentrations independent of the physicochemical features’ variation in the soil ecosystem.

It {{was found that the}} filter element of the reactor was highly efficient in retaining biomass, leading to a biomass <b>accumulation</b> yield <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 029 g volatile suspended solids g– 1 COD, higher than reported previously for either upflow anaerobic sludge-blanket reactors or anaerobic filters operating independentl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} better {{understand}} Cu behaviour in the submontane, eutrophic Dobczyce dam Reservoir (southern Poland), speciation measurements of Cu {{in the water and}} the sediment were conducted. To investigate the partitioning of Cu in the main components of the sediment, a scheme of VI-step sequential extraction was used. In addition, other physical and chemical parameters of the water, such as temperature, pH, dissolved O 2, nutrients, and suspended particulate matter were determined. Copper content in the water and the sediment was low (1. 1 – 7. 4 µg L− 1 and 5. 5 – 45. 4 µg g− 1, respectively). In the water Cu was usually present in the dissolved state (with the exception of the near-bottom water). This was probably the main reason of its small <b>accumulation</b> (cumulation <b>coefficient</b> K = 10687. 5) in the sediment of the Dobczyce Reservoir. The seasonal variations in Cu contents in the dissolved and particulate phases as well as observed correlations with the physico-chemical parameters of the water are discussed. In the sediment Cu occurred mainly in a strongly bound form. Most Cu found there was in the moderately reducible phase and residual. Therefore, copper (re-) mobilization from the sediment to the water was probably not of importance...|$|R
40|$|High-k gate stacks were {{fabricated}} {{with the}} p-Si/graded-SiO 2 /HfO 2 /TaN configuration; control samples were fabricated with the p-Si/graded-SiO 2 /TaN configuration. A host of device parameters were {{extracted from the}} measured admittance data, including the gate stack capacitance density, the surface potential in the accumulation regime, the standard deviation of the surface potential, the interface trap density, trap energy, and trap capture cross-section, the flatband charge density in the SiO 2 intermediate layer, the flatband charge density in the HfO 2 high-k layer, and the <b>accumulation</b> surface potential <b>coefficient,</b> {{many of which were}} extracted for the first time for the high-k gate stacks. The experimental results provided new information on the nature of defects (interface traps and bulk charges) in the SiO 2 intermediate layer and in the HfO 2 high-k layer...|$|R
40|$|Morphology, {{physicochemical}} properties, {{chemical composition}} of post-galvanized sewage sludge from Screw Factory in Łańcut, leachability and mobility of metals has been analyzed. The analyses {{with the use}} of scanning electron microscope with an adapter to perform chemical analysis of microsites (EDS) showed that the material is characterized by a high fragmentation and a predominant number of irregularly shaped grains. The sewage sludge is alkaline with a large loss of ignition (34. 6 %) and small bulk density (< 1 g/cm 3). The EDS analyses evidenced presence of oxygen, silicon, calcium, chromium, iron and zinc in all examined areas, and presence of manganese and copper in selected areas indicating a non-uniform distribution of metals in the sewage sludge. Within one-stage mineralization and FAAS technique a predominant share of calcium, zinc and iron in terms of dry matter was recorded in the sewage sludge. The contents of Co, Cr, Cu, K, Mn, Ni and Pb in sewage sludge are below 1 %. Evaluation of mobility and leaching of metals in sewage sludge was carried out by means of two parameters: <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of mobile fractions and leaching level related to the mass solubility of sewage sludge. The results indicate that the short-term or long-term storage of not inactivated post-galvanized sewage sludge can result in release of metals...|$|E
40|$|Various {{types of}} plant {{species have been}} {{extensively}} used for heavy metals phyto-remediation without taking into consideration its tolerance threshold. In this study, Vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides (Linn.) Nash was evaluated under five different sets of contaminated spiked cadmium (5 Cd, 10 Cd, 50 Cd, 100 Cd and 150 Cd mg/kg) and lead (50 Pb, 100 Pb, 200 Pb, 400 Pb and 800 Pb mg/kg) concentration levels in soil. The growth performance, metal tolerance and phyto-assessment of Cd and Pb in the roots and tillers were assessed using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Tolerance index (TI), translocation factor (TF), biological transfer factor (BTF), biological <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (BAC) and metal uptake efficacy {{were used to determine}} the Cd and Pb translocation capability in Vetiver grass. Significantly higher (p< 0. 05) accumulation of Cd and Pb was recorded in the roots of all spiked treatments. Furthermore, strong and significantly positive correlations were exhibited between the increased levels of spiked heavy metal concentrations with both Cd (r= 0. 975) and Pb (r= 0. 952) accumulations. The results of this study showed Vetiver grass as an effective phyto-stabilizer for both Cd and Pb. Nevertheless, the growth of Vetiver grass was restricted when the tolerance threshold of 100 mg/kg (dry weight basis) Cd was exceeded in the contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the heavy metal (Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Mn, Zn, Fe and Cu) content of the fruiting bodies (cap and stipe) of four species (Amanita caesarea, Pleurotus ostreatus, Fistulina hepatica and Armillariella mellea) and their substrate, collected from forest sites in Dâmboviţa County, Romania. The elements were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS) after microwave assisted digestion. From the same collecting point were taken n = 5 samples of young and mature fruiting bodies of mushrooms and their substrate. The high concentrations of lead, chrome and cadmium (Pb: 0. 25 – 1. 89 mg. kg- 1, Cr: 0. 36 – 1. 94 mg. kg- 1, Cd: 0. 23 – 1. 13 mg. kg- 1) for all collected wild edible mushrooms, were determined. These data were compared with maximum level for certain contaminants in foodstuffs established by the commission of the European Committees (EC No 466 / 2001). A quantitative evaluation of the relationship of element uptake by mushrooms from substrate was made by calculating the <b>accumulation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Ka). The moderately acid pH value of soil influenced the accumulation of Zn and Cd inside of the studied species. The variation of heavy metals content between edible mushrooms species is dependent upon the ability of the species to extract elements from the substrate and on the selective uptake and deposition of metals in tissue...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Near {{the town}} of Zumaya in {{northern}} Spain, upper Maastrichtian strata consist of limestone/marl rhythms with thin, interbedded sandstones. The marls and limestones are primarily pelagic and hemipelagic deposits, while the sandstones {{are the product of}} turbidity currents. Stratigraphic variations m the volume of marl and limestone form three hierarchical or composite cycles. The first-order cycles consist of 20 - 30 -m alternations between stratal sequences consisting of interbedded limestone and marl, and sequences composed almost exclusively of marl. Within the interbedded limestone/marl sequences, econd-order cycles occur that consist of 5 - 10 -m alternations between limestone or marl domination. The third-order cycles consist of the bed-by-bed alternation of limestone and marl. These three composite cycles are the product of shifts in the clay-carbonate ratio on various rock- and time-stratigraphic scales. In order to determine if the cyelicity was the result of changes in the supply of siliciclastic material or carbonate material, detailed stratigraphic measurements were made of volume percent, average bed thickness, and stratigraphic frequency for each lithoiogy. Product-moment coefficients indicate that a negative correlation exists between percentage marl and sandstone frequency and a positive correlation exists between limestone percent and sandstone frequency. Assuming that turbidite deposition is not genetically related to limestone or marl deposition, the correlation coefficients suggest that there were increased sedimentation rates during marl <b>accumulation.</b> Correlation <b>coefficients</b> also showed that increases in amount of marl in a section occur through bed thickening rather than the increased number of marl beds. In contrast, limestone-dominated intervals are achieved by reduction of marl-be...|$|R
40|$|A Field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} wetlands (Vertic Ustochrept), Agricultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore during Kharif (June to October) season of 2005, to ascertain the optimum irrigation method and nitrogen dose to enhance aerobic rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity with PMK 3 cultivar. Four irrigation regimes viz., irrigation at IW/CPE ratio of 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2 and micro sprinkler irrigation once in three days, four N levels viz., 100, 125, 150 and 175 kg ha - 1 were tested in strip-plot design with three replications. Irrigation at 1. 2 IW/CPE ratio recorded significantly higher crop growth rate and yield with no moisture stress, minimal proline <b>accumulation</b> and sterility <b>coefficient.</b> N levels followed the quadratic response (R 2 > 0. 973), with 150 and 175 kg N ha - 1 produced on par growth and yield. Hence, irrigation at 1. 2 IW/CPE ratio with 150 kg N ha - 1 will be optimum to realise the maximum productivity under aerobic rice cultivation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the extent to which starch synthesis in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers is controlled by the activity of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2. 7. 7. 27; AGPase). In order to do this, fluxes of carbohydrate metabolism were measured in tubers that had reduced AGPase activity {{as a result of the}} expression of a cDNA encoding the B subunit in the antisense orientation. Reduction in AGPase activity led to a reduction in starch accumulation, and an increase in sucrose <b>accumulation.</b> The control <b>coefficient</b> of AGPase on starch accumulation in intact plants was estimated to be around 0. 3. The fluxes of carbohydrate metabolism were measured in tuber discs from wild-type and transgenic plants by investigating the metabolism of [U-(14) C]glucose. In tuber discs, the control coefficient of AGPase over starch synthesis was estimated as 0. 55, while the control coefficient of the enzyme over sucrose synthesis was - 0. 47. The values obtained suggest that AGPase activity exerts appreciable control over tuber metabolism in potato...|$|R
