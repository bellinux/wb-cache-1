25|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Act, {{which gave the}} DoD {{authority}} to sell excess military aircraft to <b>airtanker</b> contractors.|$|E
25|$|The USFS had {{traditionally}} {{relied on}} contracting with private companies to provide large airtankers for fighting forest fires, {{the majority of}} which had been retired World War II and Korean War-era transports, bombers, and maritime patrol aircraft. Such aircraft were relatively inexpensive to obtain and could carry the large loads of fire retardant needed to make their use effective. In the 1980s, the bulk of the <b>airtanker</b> fleet consisted of C-119 Flying Boxcars which had been obtained from the military. After concerns about safety, the aging C-119s were grounded in 1987. Because the available <b>airtanker</b> fleet was substantially diminished, the Forest Service needed to obtain additional aircraft for firefighting operations.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{aircraft}} were acquired by companies who were contracted by the United States Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management to provide airtankers for fighting wildfires. Others were pressed into civilian cargo service. After {{a series of}} crashes, the age and safety of the aircraft being used as airtankers became a serious concern, and the U.S. C-119 <b>airtanker</b> fleet was permanently grounded in 1987. Eventually, many of these aircraft were provided to museums across the U.S. in a complicated – and ultimately illegal – scheme where stored USAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports and Navy Lockheed P-3 Orion anti-submarine patrol aircraft were provided to the contractors {{in exchange for the}} C-119s. (See U.S. Forest Service <b>airtanker</b> scandal.) After the end of the <b>airtanker</b> days, many C-119s flew in Alaska for Northern Pacific Transport, Gifford Aviation, Stebbins & Ambler Air transport, and Delta Associates, being used for public service contracts, such as hauling building materials to the villages in the bush of Alaska that have no road access.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the panel's recommendations, the USFS and BLM {{declined}} to renew the leases on nine C-130A and PB4Y-2 <b>airtankers,</b> and ordered the 33 remaining large <b>airtankers</b> to undergo an improved inspection program before they returned to active service. The agencies contracted with the Sandia National Laboratories to analyze the safety of continuing use of three types of <b>airtankers,</b> the Douglas DC series (DC-4, DC-6 and DC-7), P-3 Orion and P-2 Neptune. In addition, 11 of 19 Beechcraft Baron 58P leadplanes were also retired, as they had exceeded the 6,000 flight hour airframe safety limit. To further reduce the risk to the fleet, the agencies directed their field managers to use <b>airtankers</b> primarily for initial attack only.|$|R
5000|$|Conair's {{air attack}} aircraft, more {{commonly}} known as [...] "bird dogs", are aircraft that contain the pilot and Air Attack Officer. The bird dogs ensure the runs {{to be made by}} the laden <b>airtankers</b> are safe and free of obstructions. The crew inside the bird dog determine the run locations and drop types to be made, coordinate the aerial action with the ground crews if present and control the airspace around the fire. The attack aircraft are Piper PA-60 Aerostars, Rockwell Turbo Commanders, and Cessna 208 Caravans. These aircraft are always used in conjunction with the <b>airtankers.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} {{at least three}} private Canadair CL-215s, four Government of Alberta owned Canadair CL-215s, four private Lockheed L188 Electra <b>airtankers</b> {{and at least one}} Martin Mars air tanker {{attempting}} to put out the fire.|$|R
25|$|An Airbus A330 {{aircraft}} {{operated by}} <b>AirTanker</b> Services {{on behalf of}} the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) carried out those flights, called the South Atlantic Air Bridge, although a limited number of commercial passenger tickets were available. Those flights now travel via Cape Verde.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft, a Convair CV-580 <b>Airtanker,</b> {{serial number}} 129 {{registered}} C-FKFY, manufactured in 1953, was powered by two Allison 501-D22G engines. The aircraft {{was equipped with}} a fire retardant tank and other standard equipment, but did not carry a cockpit voice recorder, flight data recorder, or a stall warning device.|$|E
25|$|Initially, four <b>airtanker</b> {{operators}} {{were represented}} by Reagan {{and participated in}} the exchange program: Hemet Valley Flying Service, Aero Union, TBM, Inc., and Hawkins and Powers. Because only a select number of contractors were provided aircraft, and because the program was not publicized nor were the contracts and aircraft put up for bid, accusations of favoritism followed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airtankers</b> {{or water}} bombers are {{fixed-wing}} aircraft fitted with tanks {{that can be}} filled {{on the ground at}} an air tanker base or, in the case of flying boats and amphibious aircraft, by skimming water from lakes, reservoirs, or large rivers.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2012, Ely was {{threatened}} by a fast-moving wildfire started by a downed power line on Highway 1. [...] Due to the rapid fire fighting response, {{including the use of}} <b>airtankers,</b> the fire was limited to 216 acre just outside town.|$|R
50|$|Seventeen DC-7s {{remained}} on the U.S. registry in 2010, used mainly for cargo and as aerial firefighting <b>airtankers.</b> Due to its engine problems, the DC-7 has not had the same longevity as the DC-6, which is still used {{by a number of}} commercial operators.|$|R
25|$|In 1958, CAL FIRE, then CDF, {{contracted}} {{with a private}} air tanker service {{for the use of}} their converted World War II aircraft. By 1970 the department began to evaluate the use of former military Grumman S-2 aircraft. Over the next ten years CAL FIRE continued to build up its fleet of S-2A air tankers and in 1987, CAL FIRE began the process of converting their piston engines to turboprop. By 2005 all of CAL FIRE's <b>airtanker</b> fleet had been converted to S-2T air tankers.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Forest Service <b>airtanker</b> scandal {{involved}} a scheme, called the Historical Aircraft Exchange Program, {{in which the}} agency would acquire retired U.S. Air Force C-130A transport aircraft and U.S. Navy P-3 anti-submarine patrol aircraft, ostensibly for use as firefighting airtankers, but which {{ended up with the}} planes' ownership being transferred illegally to private companies and the aircraft themselves being used for other purposes or even sold for a profit. The controversy resulted in two of the involved principals being sentenced to prison and a number of civil lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft, {{previously}} Air Force Serial Number 56-0538, {{was one of}} {{the original}} C-130A production series and had been built by Lockheed and delivered to the USAF in 1957. It was retired from military service in 1986. In May 1988, the aircraft was acquired by the U.S. Forest Service from the General Services Administration, and in August 1988 the Forest Service sold the plane to Hemet Valley Flying Service along with five others it had acquired, for conversion to an <b>airtanker.</b> Hemet then sold the C-130 to Hawkins & Powers. At the time of the crash, the airframe had logged 21,863 flight hours.|$|E
50|$|Development {{started after}} the 2002 fire season, which saw the fatal crashes of two air tankers in the United States. The accidents, {{involving}} a Lockheed C-130 Hercules and a Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, prompted the U.S. Department of Interior {{to issue an}} official Request for Information on next-generation <b>airtankers.</b>|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the fire, there were major changes to wildland fire training, firefighting safety standards, and overall awareness of how weather affects fire behavior.The 1953 Rattlesnake Fire prompted U.S. Forest Service Region 5 (Pacific Southwest Region) to increasingly rely on technical strategies such as use of helicopters and <b>airtankers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations {{operates}} convertible-to-cargo Ilyushin Il-76 <b>airtankers</b> {{that have}} been operating with 11000 gal L tanking systems, and several Beriev Be-200 jet powered amphibians. The Be-200 can carry a maximum payload of about 12000 L of water, making [...] "scoops" [...] in suitable stretches of water in 14 seconds.|$|R
25|$|The aircraft, a Consolidated-Vultee PB4Y-2 Privateer, BuNo 66260, (the {{designation}} {{was later}} {{changed by the}} Navy to P4Y-2), was {{a variant of the}} World War II B-24 Liberator. It had been delivered in July, 1945 to the U.S. Navy who used it for coastal patrol duties. In 1952, it was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard, who flew it until it was retired in 1956. The aircraft was pulled out of storage and converted to an <b>airtanker</b> in 1958, and was flown by several different companies, the last being Hawkins & Powers. At the time of the crash, the airframe had logged 8,346.3 flight hours.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} side of the deal, the surplus {{aircraft}} were also valued at scrap prices by the Forest Service for the purposes of the exchange, as little as $15,000 each. The Forest Service later put the value of each plane at between $750,000 and $1.5 million. The Inspector General, however, reported in 1992 that the aircraft were actually worth about $2.4 million each, with a resulting price tag of $67 million for the aircraft which were given to the contractors. The Forest Service has argued that if the aircraft had been actually sold to contractors for their full value, the U.S. tax payers ultimately would have footed the bill in terms of higher <b>airtanker</b> contract costs. The contractors paid for the costs of the conversions, about $500,000 per aircraft, and once they received the planes, they found that the program did not have provisions for providing spare parts to keep the fleet flying, and some of the surplus transports had costly turbine engines which had reached their life limits, and were therefore worthless and had to be replaced.|$|E
500|$|On 27 January 2015, the RAF {{deployed}} an E-3D Sentry to Cyprus {{in support}} of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. [...] The Sentry joins RAF Panavia Tornado, MQ-9 Reaper, and <b>AirTanker</b> Voyager aircraft performing or supporting almost daily strikes against militants.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, most {{of these}} {{aircraft}} are privately owned and contracted to government agencies, and the National Guard and the U.S. Marines also maintain fleets of firefighting aircraft. On May 10, 2004, The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) announced that they were cancelling contracts with operators of 33 heavy <b>airtankers.</b> They cited liability concerns and an inability to safely manage the fleet after the wing failure and resulting crash of a C-130A Hercules in California and a PB4Y-2 in Colorado {{during the summer of}} 2002. Both aged aircraft broke up in flight due to catastrophic fatigue cracks at the wing roots. After subsequent third-party examination and extensive testing of all USFS contracted heavy <b>airtankers,</b> three companies were awarded contracts and now maintain a combined fleet of 23 aircraft.|$|R
50|$|A {{wildland}} fire is initially {{managed by the}} local agency that has fire protection responsibility for that area. Engines, ground crews, hotshots, smokejumpers, helicopters with water buckets, and <b>airtankers</b> may all be used for initial suppression. Various local agencies may work together, sharing personnel and equipment, to fight both new fires and those not contained by the initial response.|$|R
50|$|The airline {{modified}} a Boeing 747-100 for aerial firefighting, receiving final certification {{from the}} FAA in October 2006. Compared to existing large water bombers and <b>airtankers,</b> the Evergreen Supertanker was planned to offer {{at least seven}} times more fire retardant capacity. In December, 2010, Israel hired Evergreen's fire-fighting aircraft to assist in firefighting efforts of the 2010 Mount Carmel forest fire.|$|R
500|$|On July31, 2010, a Convair CV-580 {{firefighting}} <b>airtanker</b> {{operated by}} Conair Aviation as Flight 448 , on {{route to the}} Kamloops Airport, crashed and was destroyed due to a local forest fire on the British Columbia Ministry of Forests land near Siwash Road, some [...] south of Lytton, British Columbia, a town in the Thompson region, along with Kamloops. Both crew members {{were killed in the}} accident.|$|E
500|$|During 1986 and 1987, {{the former}} {{terminal}} building {{was changed to}} serve as an operation structure. Besides Pacific Western, Air BC and Time Air served the airport with scheduled passenger flights during the 1980s; all three airlines no longer exist. In 1988, the amount of passengers dropped to 137,579. The runway has been used by a wide variety of jet and propeller aircraft over the years from Airbus 320, Boeing 727-200, Boeing 737-200, Boeing 737-400, Boeing 737-600, Boeing 737-700 and British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jetliners to Aeroncas, Aero Commander 500s, Cessna 150s and Grumman TBF Avengers since historical dates. [...] A number of different aerial fire fighting <b>airtanker</b> aircraft have also used the airport including the Convair 580, Grumman S-2 Tracker and Lockheed L-188 Electra. On May 20, 2001, a U.S. Air Force C-32, which is a military version of the Boeing 757-200 and is used for U.S. government VIP flights, was present at the airport.|$|E
2500|$|Conair Aviation Flight 448 was a Conair Aviation {{flight that}} crashed while {{fighting}} a wildfire over British Columbia on 31 July 2010. The Convair CV-580 <b>Airtanker,</b> registration C-FKFY, crashed roughly [...] south of Lytton, British Columbia, killing both crew members.|$|E
50|$|On May 6, 2013, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell {{announced}} that the Forest Service had issued a notice of intent to award contracts to five companies to provide a total of seven Next Generation <b>airtankers</b> for wildfire suppression. 10 Tanker Air Carrier was among the five companies selected {{and one of the}} companies' DC10s is contracted for five years with the USFS.|$|R
5000|$|The Foresthill Fire {{started on}} August 27 and burned 30 acre along the American River Canyon near the Foresthill Bridge {{before it was}} {{contained}} on August 28. This fire {{is close to the}} location of the Mammoth Fire. The fire took over 100 firefighters, 10 engines, 3 <b>airtankers</b> (planes), and 2 helicopters to extinguish. The cause was undetermined as of August 28, 2009.|$|R
25|$|The Department of Defense contributed twelve engines for {{firefighting}} efforts. The National Guard called {{more than}} 2,400 troops, with 17,000 available if needed; of which 100 California National Guard medical personnel provided medical assistance. Six crews from the Navy's Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 85 based at Naval Air Station North Island {{were assigned to}} battle the Witch Creek fire. They flew MH-60 Seahawk helicopters equipped with a 420-gallon water bucket {{and they were the}} only local Navy teams trained to fight fires from the air. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar contributed several aircraft as well as fire fighting trucks to operations based in Ramona. One of the larger <b>airtankers,</b> the Martin Mars, sent through a private contract from its home in Port Alberni, British Columbia on October 25, landing on Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, California. It has a 7,000 gallon capacity. Two other <b>airtankers</b> and their crews from Quebec worked on the fires, part of an annual three-month contract with the state of California.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, {{two large}} airtankers [...] a C-130 Hercules and a PB4Y-2 Privateer [...] crashed {{about a month}} apart while {{performing}} aerial firefighting operations. These crashes prompted {{a review of the}} maintenance and use of the entire U.S. large <b>airtanker</b> fleet. Ultimately, the whole fleet (33 aircraft in all) was grounded, dramatically reducing the resources available to fight major wildfires. Both aircraft were owned by Hawkins & Powers Aviation of Greybull, Wyoming and operated under contract to the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The crashes occurred in one of the worst fire seasons in the last half century, one in which 73,000 fires burned [...] of land.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Gary Eitel filed a qui tam {{civil lawsuit}} {{on behalf of}} the Federal {{government}} against Reagan, the six <b>airtanker</b> operators, {{and a number of other}} defendants, which alleged fraud and the unjust gain of enrichment through the exchange program. Due to federal law, Fuchs is immune from being named in such a civil suit. Initially, the U.S. government declined to join the suit. In a qui tam suit, a private citizen may file suit on behalf of and as an agent for the U.S. Government against entities accused of defrauding the government. While the plaintiff must pay for the legal expenses out of his own pocket (in 1998 Eitel estimated that the suit had cost him $3 million), he is entitled to receive 15% to 30% of the money which the government recovers should he prevail in court. Potential penalties were estimated to run as high as US$500 million. Among the issues raised in court by the suit are [...] "whether some aerial firefighters were unjustly enriched, if the U.S. Justice Department and Forest Service covered up CIA and drug cartel links to some of the planes, whether the planes should remain in private hands, if the list of defendants should grow or dwindle, and who is telling the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, a Forest Service {{contracting}} officer {{determined that}} the exchanges had been illegal, and on December 1, 1998, the Forest Service asserted ownership of the aircraft and ruled that the aircraft must be returned. [...] "The original exchange agreements for the transfer of aircraft are void because we didn't {{have the authority to}} conduct an exchange. I have been working to resolve concerns about the air tanker program raised in the OIG audit and issued the letter asserting aircraft ownership on behalf of the Agency," [...] stated Ron Hooper, staff assistant to the Forest Service Deputy Chief for Business Operations, the contracting officer who made the determination of ownership, and who would later testify to that effect in court. In letters sent to the operators, the Forest Service also said that they were prepared to return the titles of the historical aircraft then in museums, many of which were no longer flyable. The <b>airtanker</b> operators sued and eventually prevailed against this ruling. The assertion of ownership ruling allowed for continued operation of eleven of the aircraft which were scheduled to be used under the 1999 National Air Tanker Contract (five other operable aircraft were in the possession of companies who either were unsuccessful in their bid for the contract, or simply chose not to bid; the aircraft, the USFS stated, must still be maintained and used only for firefighting purposes).|$|E
2500|$|On May 6, 2013, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell {{announced}} that the Forest Service had issued a notice of intent to award contracts to five companies to provide a total of seven Next Generation <b>airtankers</b> for [...] wildfire suppression. 10 Tanker Air Carrier was among the five companies selected {{and one of the}} companies' DC10s is contracted for five years with the USFS.|$|R
5000|$|Larger water {{dropping}} helicopters {{such as the}} S-64 Skycrane, {{which can}} hold as much as 3,000 gallons, rivaling fixed-wing <b>airtankers,</b> are increasingly being used. Only some of these larger rotorcraft have provisions for carrying ground crews, therefore may not always considered [...] "helitack" [...] aircraft in the true sense of the word. Some Type I rotorcraft, such as the Boeing 234, can carry up to 44 passengers in proper configuration.|$|R
25|$|Concerns {{about the}} safety of older {{transport}} aircraft being used as <b>airtankers</b> had been ongoing, long before the 2002 crashes. In the early 1980s, concern about the age and safety issues of World War II and Korean War-era aircraft that were the predominant aircraft used as <b>airtankers</b> led the Forest Service to initiate a program to provide more modern, turbine-powered C-130As to contracting companies. However, this solution quickly became the problem. According to an NTSB advisory, During a C-130A contract pre-award evaluation in 1991, the Department of the Interior's (DOI) Office of Aviation Services inspectors concluded that essential inspection and maintenance services critical to sustaining the airplane in an airworthy condition under normal operating conditions were not being accomplished with the C-130A. This prompted the DOI, in 1993, to prohibit the use of the C130A on DOI land. The FAA and the DOI subsequently developed an action plan to address many of the same inspection and maintenance issues seen in the most recent C-130A and P4Y accident investigations. Since that time the DOI has dropped its restrictions on the C-130A....|$|R
