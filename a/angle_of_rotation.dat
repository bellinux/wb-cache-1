25|$|In {{rational}} geometry {{the spread}} between two lines is defined at {{the square of}} the sine of the angle between the lines. Since the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotation}} vector, {{from the}} axis-angle representation of rotations, is a compact way of representing rotations in three dimensions. In its most compact form, {{it consists of}} a vector, {{the product of a}} unit vector ω that is the axis of rotation with the (signed) <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> θ, so that the magnitude of the overall rotation vector θω equals the (unsigned) rotation angle.|$|E

25|$|Non-repeating helical symmetry: This is {{the case}} in which the angle of rotationθ {{required}} to observe the symmetry is irrational. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> never repeats exactly {{no matter how many times}} the helix is rotated. Such symmetries are created by using a non-repeating point group in two dimensions.

25|$|Treating a grain {{boundary}} geometrically as an interface {{of a single}} crystal cut into two parts, {{one of which is}} rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a {{grain boundary}}. The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{degrees of freedom}} of a {{rotation}} matrix is always less than the dimension of the matrix squared. That is, {{the elements of a}} rotation matrix are not all completely independent. For example, the rotation matrix in dimension 2 has only one degree of freedom, since all four of its elements depend on a single <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> A rotation matrix in dimension 3 (which has nine elements) has three degrees of freedom, corresponding to each independent rotation, for example by its three Euler angles or a magnitude one (unit) quaternion.|$|E

25|$|In the Wankel engine, {{the four}} strokes of an Otto cycle piston engine {{occur in the}} space between a three-sided {{symmetric}} rotor and the inside of a housing. In each rotor of the Wankel engine, the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing surrounds a rotor which is triangular with bow-shaped flanks (often confused with a Reuleaux triangle, a three-pointed curve of constant width, but with the bulge in the middle of each side a bit more flattened). The theoretical shape of the rotor between the fixed corners {{is the result of a}} minimization of the volume of the geometric combustion chamber and a maximization of the compression ratio, respectively. The symmetric curve connecting two arbitrary apexes of the rotor is maximized in the direction of the inner housing shape with the constraint that it not touch the housing at any <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> (an arc is not a solution of this optimization problem).|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} single-scattering model {{as well as}} a Monte Carlo model of the effect of glucose on {{polarized}} light in turbid media.
