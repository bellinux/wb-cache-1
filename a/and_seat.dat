40|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} resurfacing is {{the most}} commonly utilized rehabilitation practice used by the Iowa Department of Transportation. The major problem with asphalt concrete resurfacing is the reflective cracking from underlying cracks and joints in the portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement. Cracking <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> the PCC prior to an asphalt overlay was the construction method evaluated in this project. There was cracking <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> on portions {{of the project and}} portions were overlaid without this process. There were also different overlay thicknesses used. Comparisons of crack <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> to the normal overlay method and the different depths are compared in this report. Cracking <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> results in some structural loss, but does reduce the problem of reflection cracking...|$|R

5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the lived experience of children who have specialised wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> needs from a family perspective with a view to facilitating family-centred practice in wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> services. Concepts of acceptance and adjustment for the family, integration into the home and community environments, experiences with service providers, perceptions of family-centred practice, and general views and opinions regarding wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> services were of interest in this study. Participants were recruited under the Enable Ireland remit. An interpretative phenomenological approach was used and data was gathered through semi structured interviews with three families. The research provided an insight into how family members viewed the impact of the phenomenon and adjusted to life with a child who has specialised wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> needs. Four main themes emerged from the data: Acceptance and adjustment, learning new ways of doing, being independent and interactions with service providers. Findings from the study suggest that caring for a child with specialised wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> needs is a family affair and affects the entire family unit. Using a holistic approach to wheelchair <b>and</b> <b>seating</b> service provision which encompasses the philosophy of family centred care is optimal to support family health and wellbeing...|$|R
5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{established}} {{in response to the}} opening of Gardermoen, which would allow any airline sufficient landing slots to compete with the incumbents Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). Color Air commenced operations on 1 August 1998, with the two other airlines moving from Oslo Airport, Fornebu on 8 October. Following the airline's establishment, a price war broke out between it and the two incumbents. All three increased capacity and dropped prices, giving a 40% increase in seats on the dominant domestic routes <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> loads of between 30 and 50 percent. After thirteen months and NOK400 million in losses, Color Air gave up and filed for bankruptcy. The price war cost the three airlines more than NOK3 billion, and ultimately forced the other two to merge.|$|E
5|$|As Lucan's {{bankruptcy}} proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors {{were informed}} that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326. His assets were estimated at £22,632. The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around £30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust {{in the years immediately}} following his disappearance. His family was granted probate over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, George Bingham, Lord Bingham, was refused permission to take his father's title <b>and</b> <b>seat</b> in the House of Lords. Following the passage of the Presumption of Death Act 2013, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful in a High Court hearing at the Rolls Building on 3 February 2016. He therefore inherited his father's title, becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan.|$|E

5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone <b>and</b> <b>seat,</b> is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E
