500|$|In late May 1942, in {{an effort}} to draw out and destroy the elusive American carriers, Japanese forces {{organized}} attacks on the Aleutian Islands in Alaska and Midway Atoll in the Western Pacific. Nagumo, aboard Akagi, led Kaga, Sōryū, and Hiryū and the support ships of the First Carrier Striking Force to Midway. In the initial attack, Japanese planes neutralized a small force of fighter aircraft and inflicted heavy damage to American installations. Torpedo planes and dive-bombers sent from Midway to harry the Japanese fleet had little effect, but the Japanese attack plan had been deciphered by codebreakers, and the American carriers' planes were already en route. Torpedo bombers from , , and [...] joined the attack in succession, forcing the Japanese carriers to maneuver violently to avoid torpedoes and rendering them unable to launch additional aircraft. American dive-bombers, arriving late after difficulty locating the fleet, soon landed fatal strikes on Akagi, Kaga, and Sōryū. Yorktown, handicapped by hits from Hiryūs bombers, managed to return to the fight only to take two torpedo hits <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> The burning Yorktown was abandoned, but her scouts pinpointed Hiryūs location, and bombers from Enterprise put Hiryū out of action with four bomb strikes.
