5|$|Among {{the notable}} finds is a golden plaque showing a snake curling on a staff, a Hellenic symbol of Eshmun. and a granite altar bearing {{the name of}} Egyptian Pharaoh Achoris {{uncovered}} in the Eshmun sanctuary. This gift <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> the good relations between the Pharaoh and the kings of Sidon.|$|E
5|$|Brock had a {{successful}} pre-war military career and a quick rise through the ranks, which many commented on at the time. Some credited luck and others skill in his rapid promotions, and Brock had substantial portions of both {{on his way to}} prominence. Lacking special political connections, Brock's ability to gain promotions even when the nation was at peace <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> his skills in recruiting men and organizing finances, and ambition.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} {{the education of}} a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying rhetoric and literature. In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Suetonius <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation. Among his first published works were poetry, as well as writings on law and administration.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E
5|$|We {{are pleased}} the President recognizes the near {{pristine}} {{condition of the}} Northwestern Hawaiian Islands waters. We believe the abundance and biodiversity of the area <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> the successful management of the NWHI fisheries by the Council the past 30 years and indicates that properly regulated fisheries can operate in the NWHI without impacting the ecosystem. The small NWHI bottomfish fishery has not and would not jeopardize {{the protection of the}} NWHI that President Bush is pursuing by designating the area a national monument.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{style in}} art {{did not exist}} in Qatna; instead, a regional hybrid style prevailed where international motifs appear along with regional ones, yet all the pieces reveal enough features to trace them to Qatna. The volute-shaped plant {{is one of the most}} widespread international motifs; many pieces from the royal hypogeum were decorated with the motif, but Qatna had its own typical volute, where the crown is a single long lobe with dotted pendants branching out of the corners of the upper volute. The wall painting in Qatna's royal palace <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> contact with the Aegean region; they depict typical Minoan motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.|$|E

5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being madness. Myrrha's {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|E
5|$|Some early writers {{theorized that}} the last saber-toothed cats, Smilodon and Homotherium, became extinct through {{competition}} with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced them. It was even proposed that the saber-toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Yet fast felids such as the American lion and the American cheetah also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene. The fact that saber-teeth evolved many times in unrelated lineages also <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> {{the success of this}} feature.|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E

5|$|Legend {{goes that}} Tulsidas was born after {{staying in the}} womb for twelve months, he had all thirty two teeth in his mouth at birth, his health and looks were {{like that of a}} five-year-old boy, and he did not cry {{at the time of his}} birth but uttered Rama instead. He was {{therefore}} named Rambola (literally, he who uttered Rama), as Tulsidas himself states in Vinaya Patrika. As per the Mula Gosain Charita, he was born under the Abhuktamūla constellation, which according to Jyotisha (Hindu astrology) causes immediate danger to the life of the father. Due to the inauspicious events at the time of his birth, he was abandoned by his parents on the fourth night, sent away with Chuniya (some sources call her Muniya), a female servant of Hulsi. In his works Kavitavali and Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> his parents abandoning him after birth due to an inauspicious astrological configuration.|$|E
5|$|The Best Man Wins is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film features Thanhouser's leading players Anna Rosemond, Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline in a drama about morality. Two suitors are vying for the hand of Julia Seaton and propose {{to her on the}} same day, but she asks for a month to decide between them. In the time the caliber of both men are tested when asked by a young girl, named May, to help her dying mother. The doctor refuses to help and the lawyer offers his assistance, but her mother soon dies. The orphan is taken in by the Seaton family and personally <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> the character of both men when Julia Seaton has to choose between her suitors. The writer, director and cameraman are unknown. Released on May 14, 1910, the film was met with mostly positive reviews by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The work at Salò and {{associated}} documentation, reconstructed through the numerous bills and payments, <b>attests</b> <b>to</b> the complex relationship between Cairano and Mangiacavalli. They shared staff, which {{was directed by}} either of them depending on who was on site. Such collaborative work, which has already been noted at San Pietro in Oliveto are emblematic of Cairano's artistic activity, which became increasingly busy and varied as public and private commissions poured {{in the first decade}} of the sixteenth century following the work at the Loggia palazzo. However, Cairano's attention was not directed to Salò, which he visited rarely, or even to San Pietro in Oliveto, which was mainly run by Sanmicheli, but to two works of greater importance and resonance: the grand staircase of the Loggia and the arch at Sant'Apollonio.|$|E
