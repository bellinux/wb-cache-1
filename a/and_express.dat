Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local <b>and</b> <b>express</b> services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that anger {{may be related to}} the {{development}} and maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study investigates the impact of anger on patients with PTSD in a general psychiatric population. Participants diagnosed with PTSD were grouped according to current levels of subjective <b>and</b> inappropriately <b>expressed</b> anger: (a) low subjective <b>and</b> <b>expressed</b> anger; (b) elevated subjective anger <b>and</b> low <b>expressed</b> anger; (c) low subjective anger <b>and</b> elevated <b>expressed</b> anger; <b>and</b> (d) elevated subjective <b>and</b> <b>expressed</b> anger. It was hypothesized that participants reporting elevated levels of subjective anger coupled with recent overt expression would be more impaired and distressed than individuals with PTSD in the other anger groups, after comorbid diagnoses were controlled. The elevated subjective <b>and</b> <b>expressed</b> anger group was more impaired/distressed on global measures and their elevated anger affected some measures of behavioral functioning. Findings are discussed in light of the literature on anger and PTSD...|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{airport site}} to Gardermoen was proposed at Hurum, south-west of Oslo. Had Hurum been chosen, the Gardermoen Line {{would not have}} been necessary for the airport express train, but the planning documents recommended that construction still proceed to ease traffic congestion north of Oslo. The tunnel is used by all trains on the Gardermoen Line, including the Flytoget airport express, and the regional <b>and</b> <b>express</b> trains which continue via the Dovre Line. Local trains on the Hoved Line and Kongsvinger Line to the north also use the tunnel. Use of the Hoved Line is limited to freight trains and commuter trains which make stops along the route.|$|E

In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
