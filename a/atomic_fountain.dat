50|$|The {{idea of the}} <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s by Jerrold Zacharias. Zacharias attempted to implement an <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> using a thermal beam of atoms, {{under the assumption that}} the atoms at the low-velocity end of the Maxwell - Boltzmann distribution would be of sufficiently low energy to execute a reasonably sized parabolic trajectory. However, the attempt was not successful because fast atoms in a thermal beam strike the low-velocity atoms and scatter them.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} two experimental {{tests of}} the Equivalence Principle {{that are based on}} frequency measurements between precision oscillators and/or highly accurate atomic frequency standards. Based on comparisons between the hyperfine frequencies of 87 Rb and 133 Cs in <b>atomic</b> <b>fountains,</b> the first experiment constrains the stability of fundamental constants. The second experiment is based on a comparison between a cryogenic sapphire oscillator and a hydrogen maser. It tests Local Lorentz Invariance.

50|$|An <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> is a {{cloud of}} atoms that is tossed upwards by lasers in the Earth's {{gravitational}} field. If it were visible, it would resemble {{the water in a}} fountain. While weightless in the toss, the atoms are measured to set the frequency of an atomic clock.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of operation of an atomic clock {{is based on}} atomic physics; it uses the microwave signal that electrons in atoms emit when they change energy levels. Early atomic clocks were based on masers at room temperature. Currently, the most accurate atomic clocks first cool the atoms to near absolute zero temperature by slowing them with lasers and probing them in <b>atomic</b> <b>fountains</b> in a microwave-filled cavity. An {{example of this is}} the NIST-F1 atomic clock, one of the national primary time and frequency standards of the United States.|$|R
40|$|We {{reconsider the}} idea of a pulsed {{optically}} pumped frequency standard conceived in the early 1960 s to eliminate the light-shift effect. The development of semiconductor lasers and of pulsed electronic techniques for <b>atomic</b> <b>fountains</b> and new theoretical findings allow an implementation of this idea which may lead to a frequency standard whose frequency stability is limited only by the thermal noise in the short term and by the temperature drift in the long term. We shall also show both theoretically and experimentally the possibility of doubling the atomic quality factor with respect to the classical Ramsey technique approach...|$|R

50|$|The {{precision}} of the Ramsey method {{can be increased}} by increasing the wait time T of the cloud. The use of an <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> with a cooled atomic cloud allows for wait times {{on the order of}} one second, which is vastly greater than what can be achieved by performing the Ramsey method on a hot atomic beam. This is one reason why NIST-F1, a cesium fountain clock, can keep time more precisely than NIST-7, a cesium beam clock.|$|E
50|$|The payload {{actually}} {{contains two}} clocks: a caesium laser cooled <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> clock (PHARAO) developed by CNES, France for long-term stability and an active hydrogen maser (SHM) developed by Spectratime, Switzerland for short-term stability.The onboard frequency comparison between PHARAO and SHM {{will be a}} key element {{for the evaluation of}} the accuracy and the short/medium-term stability of the PHARAO clock. Further, it will allow to identify the optimal operating conditions for PHARAO and to select a compromise between frequency accuracy and stability.The mission will also be a test-bed for the space qualification of the active hydrogen maser SHM.|$|E
50|$|Time {{of flight}} (TOF) {{describes}} {{a variety of}} methods that measure the time that it takes for an object, particle or acoustic, electromagnetic or other wave to travel a distance through a medium. This measurement can be used for a time standard (such as an <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain),</b> as a way to measure velocity or path length through a given medium, or as a way to learn about the particle or medium (such as composition or flow rate). The traveling object may be detected directly (e.g., ion detector in mass spectrometry) or indirectly (e.g., light scattered from an object in laser doppler velocimetry).|$|E
40|$|For a long time, one of {{the main}} {{limitations}} of cesium <b>atomic</b> <b>fountains</b> has been the cold collision frequency shift [2, 7, 10, 11]. By using a method based on a transfer of pop- ulation by adiabatic passage (AP) [12, 16, 18] allowing to prepare cold atomic samples with a well defined ratio of atomic density as well as atom number we have a better measurement of this effect. By improving the method we found out some unexpected properties of cold collisions, confirming that 133 Cs is a rich atom to study cold collisions. Those results lead to fine comparisons with cold collision theory and may constraint some parameters of cesium...|$|R
40|$|The GPS {{system is}} {{simulated}} in three scenarios, {{so as to}} estimate how its performance would be improved by more stable ground clocks. One scenario is an approximation to the current system. The second replaces the cesium frequency standards at the monitor sites with masers. The third replaces the masers at the two USNO-controlled monitor sites with <b>atomic</b> <b>fountains.</b> The simplifications exaggerate {{the differences between the}} scenarios, and the results suggest that the three scenarios are similar in the timing information delivered to the user with broadcast parameters for positioning, but that GPS Time could be more stable with improved clocks. Results are tentative, pending more realistic simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{limits of}} <b>atomic</b> <b>fountains</b> as operational clocks are considered. Four rubidium fountains in operation at the U. S. Naval Observatory for over 5. 5 years have demonstrated unprecedented long-term stability for continuously running clocks [1, 2]. With only these rubidium fountains, a post-processed timescale {{can be created}} that demonstrates superior long-term performance to any individual clock by compensating for occasional frequency steps. By comparing to the world's primary standards we demonstrate instability of this rubidium fountain timescale reaching the mid 10 ^- 17 's and zero drift {{at the level of}} 1. 3 × 10 ^- 19 /day. We discuss fundamental limits due to common mode behaviour or individual fountain performance that cannot be corrected...|$|R
50|$|The Wissenschaftsrat had 2010 {{recommended}} {{to build a}} new research building at Leibniz Universität Hanover, the Hanover Institute of Technology, HiTec shortly. In the research building QUEST scientists will carry out basic research, applied research and technology development in the field of quantum physics and geodesy together under one roof. The approximately 29.5 million-euro research building is designed for a staff number of 100 to 120 people and is to be realized in a four-year construction period from 2012 to 2015. It will include in addition to many especially for laser experiments planned laboratories three major equipments: a freefall simulator, a fiber-drawing system and an <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{motivation}} {{behind the}} development of the <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> derives from the Ramsey method of measuring the frequency of atomic transitions. In broad strokes, the Ramsey method involves exposing a cloud of atoms to a brief radiofrequency (rf) electromagnetic field; waiting a time T; briefly exposing the cloud to the rf field again; and then measuring what fraction of the atoms in the cloud have transitioned. If the frequency of the rf field is identical to the atomic transition frequency, 100% of the atoms will have transitioned; if the frequency of the field differs slightly from the transition frequency, some of the atoms will not have transitioned. By repeatedly sending clouds of atoms through such an apparatus, the frequency of the field can be adjusted to match the atomic transition frequency.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{limitations}} of cesium <b>atomic</b> <b>fountains</b> has been the cold collision frequency shift. By using a method based on a transfer of population by adiabatic passage allowing to prepare cold atomic samples with a well defined ratio of atomic density as well as atom number the collisional shift is controlled at the 10 E- 3 of its value. A calibration of Zeeman sub-states contribution to the clock shift {{as a function of}} the field has been performed. Feshbach resonances have been observed for the first time at very low magnetic field and with a very good resolution. A Monte Carlo simulation has been performed and could fit properly some of experimental data. This constrains some parameters of the theory of collisions. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

These measurements set a stringent upper bound to a possible fractional time variation of the ratio between the two frequencies : (d/dt) ln(nu_Rb/nu_Cs) =(0. 2 +/- 7. 0) * 10 ^{- 16 } yr^{- 1 } (1 sigma uncertainty). The same limit applies to a possible variation of the quantity (mu_Rb/mu_Cs) *alpha^{- 0. 44 }, which involves the ratio of nuclear magnetic moments and the fine structure constant.

The alternate master clock, at Schriever Air Force Base, maintains 12 cesium clocks and 3 masers. [...] The observatory also operates four rubidium <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> clocks, {{which have a}} stability reaching 7. The observatory intends to build several more of this type for use at its two facilities. The clocks used for the USNO timescale are kept in 19 environmental chambers, whose temperatures are kept constant to within 0.1 degree C and whose relative humidities (for all masers and most cesiums) are kept constant to within 1%. The timescale is based only upon the Washington DC clocks. On June 7, 2007, 70 standards were weighted in the timescale computations.|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} interests include ultra low-noise radar and ultra high stability cryogenic microwave oscillators and clocks based on a pure single-crystal sapphire resonators. Applications for the latter are to provide low noise local oscillators to atomic physics labs, time and frequency <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> standards, and very high frequency VLBI (Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry) radio-astronomy. The terrestrial clock technology co-developed by him is {{claimed to be the}} most stable in the universe, with Hartnett et al. stating that it outperformed the stability of signals generated by pulsars (rotating neutron stars that produce highly periodic bursts of radio waves; such astronomical sources are then used as natural clocks e.g. for tests of physics). Further on, he is interested in the development of cryocooled CSO resonators, detection of WISPs using low noise microwave techniques, tests of the fundamental theories of physics, such as special and general relativity, measurement of drift in fundamental constants and their cosmological implications and cosmology and the large scale structure of the universe. He is also part of a team of scientists who are building liquid helium-cooled oscillators used by sapphire clocks for the National Metrology Institute of Japan in Tsukuba, Japan.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaluated}} accuracy (uB) {{reports of}} various primary frequency and time standards are published online by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).The first in-house accuracy evaluation of NIST-F2 reported a uB of 1.1 × 10−16. In October 2013 and March 2015 the NIST-F2 caesium fountain clock reported a uB of 1.5 × 10−16 in the BIPM reports of evaluation of primary frequency standards. However, the uncertainty evaluation of NIST-F2's frequency shift due to distributed cavity phase, which currently limits many other accurate <b>atomic</b> <b>fountain</b> clocks, had a shortcoming {{that makes it}} difficult to assign an accuracy until this error is re-evaluated. In addition, the largest systematic error of NIST-F2 is a microwave amplitude dependent frequency shift, which includes frequency shifts due to the microwave lensing of atomic wave-packets by microwave dipole forces on the atoms and microwave leakage. An independent statistical analysis of the NIST measurements showed that this uncertainty was significantly too small and should be increased from 0.8 × 10−16 to at least 1.5 × 10−16. As a result, the quoted uncertainty of NIST-F2 would increase to approximately 1.7 × 10−16, if the re-evaluation of the uncertainty due to distributed cavity phase shows that it is small. The March, 2015 report to the BIPM did not address the published criticism and there have been neither subsequent reports to the BIPM nor has an updated accuracy evaluation been published.|$|E
