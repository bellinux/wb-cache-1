500|$|Biko and {{his comrades}} {{regarded}} multi-racial anti-apartheid groups as unwittingly replicating {{the structure of}} apartheid because they contained whites in dominant positions of control, and therefore {{did not participate in}} these multi-racial organisations. Instead, they called for an anti-apartheid programme that was controlled by black people. Biko nevertheless believed that sympathetic whites had a place in the anti-apartheid struggle; he called on them to reject any concept that they themselves could be spokespeople for the black majority and instead focus their efforts on convincing the wider white community on the inevitability of apartheid's fall. Biko clarified his position to Woods: [...] "I don't reject liberalism as such or white liberals <b>as</b> <b>such.</b> <b>I</b> reject only the concept that black liberation can be achieved through the leadership of white liberals." [...] He added that [...] "the [...] liberal is no enemy, he's a friend– but for the moment he holds us back, offering a formula too gentle, too inadequate for our struggle".|$|E
500|$|Namuth befriended many German expatriates in Paris, {{including}} photographer George Reisner. [...] In 1935, Reisner invited Namuth {{to assist}} him with his studio in Port de Pollença, Spain, and introduced the 20-year-old Namuth to photography. [...] After several months, the two returned to Paris, supporting themselves with photojournalism and occasional portraits. [...] Namuth and Reisner were sent to cover the Workers' Olympiad in July 1936 by French magazine Vu, which put them in Barcelona during the opening stages of the Spanish Civil War. [...] Over the next nine months, the two photographed the war, providing photos to European publications. [...] Namuth and Reisner returned to Paris in 1937 and continued their careers as photographers until 1939. [...] While in Paris, Namuth studied with Joseph Breitenbach, who taught him {{the technical aspects of}} photography. [...] After increased tension and hostilities between France and Germany, Namuth and his fellow German expatriates were interned, though Namuth joined the French Foreign Legion to avoid his confinement. [...] After being discharged in 1940, Namuth fled to Marseilles and escaped to the United States with the help of journalist Varian Fry and his Emergency Rescue Committee. [...] He arrived in New York City in 1941 and planned to join the Office of Strategic Services in 1943 out of a desire [...] "to do something about everything". [...] However, he {{had fallen in love with}} French-born Guatemalan Carmen Herrera and delayed his enlistment until he was drafted for World War II in December 1943. [...] After completing basic training, Namuth joined the intelligence services and worked as an interrogator and interpreter in England, France, and Czechoslovakia. [...] Upon returning to Germany in 1945 to gather war criminals, Namuth realized, [...] "I really had cut my navel cord completely and totally, not just with my home and family but with the country <b>as</b> <b>such.</b> <b>I</b> was completely out of it." [...] Namuth did not return to Germany until 1970.|$|E

[...] In the case of Bach, Gould admitted, [...] " [...] fixed the action in some of the instruments I play on—and the piano I use for all recordings is now so fixed—so that it is a shallower and more responsive action than the standard. It tends to have a mechanism which is rather like an automobile without power steering: you are in control and not it; it doesn't drive you, you drive it. This is the secret of doing Bach on the piano at all. You must have that immediacy of response, that control over fine definitions of things." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, General Martin Luther Agwai, head of {{the joint}} African Union – United Nations Operation, said {{the war was over}} in the region, {{although}} low-level disputes remained.

This perspective is contradicted by reports which indicate that violence continues in Darfur while peace efforts have been stalled repeatedly. Violence between Sudan's military and rebel fighters has beset Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states since disputed state elections in May 2011, an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has prompted international condemnation and U.S. congressional hearings. In 2012, tensions between Sudan and South Sudan reached a boiling point when the Sudanese military bombed territory in South Sudan, leading to hostilities over the disputed Heglig (or Panthou) oil fields located along the Sudan-South Sudan border.|$|E

Even Emperor Gao of Han can't be compared to you. When you dress casually and venture out, the officials who accompany you usually don't have enough time to prepare for the trip, while the servants and soldiers are getting tiresome. A leader who doesn't behave in a serious manner doesn't command respect. The White Dragon transformed into a fish for fun and ended up being trapped by the fisherman Yuqie (豫且); the White Serpent behaved recklessly and ended up being slain by Liu Bang. I hope you will be more careful." [...] Sun Ce replied, [...] "You're right.

2500|$|Habib {{was raised}} in a female environment, his {{brothers}} being in Tunis and his father being old. Therefore, he spent his days with his mother, grandmother and sisters, Aïsha and Nejia, which permitted him to witness the household chores of women and the gender inequality with men. Bourguiba recounted his childhood in these words: [...] "I was the youngest of all. <b>As</b> <b>such,</b> <b>I</b> was responsible for all chores. I was, in short, a domestic. I was responsible for keeping the jug and pour water on the hands of my elders, after meals. But I was the elder of nobody, and I had to manage all by own with the hudge container in order to wash my hands". Another fact also marked the childhood of Habib Bourguiba: Being the youngest of the family, he had to address his elders, including his brothers with the word [...] "Sidi" [...] (ser). However, the designation of his sisters was a problem of protocol. Even though they were older, their female gender did not give them a right of presence on young Habib. His father Ali, soon found {{a solution to the problem}} arguing that they had to call themselves with their respective first name, [...] "no other difference hallmark". The young Habib soon noticed the low status of women in the beginning of the century.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{learning}} about the deportations, Horthy wrote the following letter to the prime minister:Dear Sztójay: I was aware that the Government in the given forced situation has to take many steps that I do not consider correct, and for which I can not take responsibility. Among these matters is {{the handling of the}} Jewish question in a manner that does not correspond to the Hungarian mentality, Hungarian conditions, and, for the matter, Hungarian interests. It is clear to everyone that what among these were done by Germans or by the insistence of the Germans was not in my power to prevent, so in these matters I was forced into passivity. <b>As</b> <b>such,</b> <b>I</b> was not informed in advance, or I am not fully informed now, however, I have heard recently that in many cases in inhumaneness and brutality we exceeded the Germans. I demand that the handling of the Jewish affairs in the Ministry of Interior be taken {{out of the hands of}} Deputy Minister László Endre. Further more, László Baky's assignment to the management of the police forces should be terminated as soon as possible.Just before the deportations began, two Slovakian Jewish prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfréd Wetzler, escaped from Auschwitz and passed details of what was happening inside the camps to officials in Slovakia. This document, known as the Vrba-Wetzler Report, was quickly translated into German and passed among Jewish groups and then to Allied officials. Details from the report were broadcast by the BBC on 15 June and printed in The New York Times on 20 June. World leaders, including Pope Pius XII (25 June), President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 26 June, and King Gustaf V of Sweden on 30 June, subsequently pleaded with Horthy to use his influence to stop the deportations. Roosevelt specifically threatened military retaliation if the transports were not ceased. On 2 July, Allied bombers executed the heaviest bombings inflicted on Hungary during the war. Hungarian radio accused Jews of guiding the bombers to their targets with radio transmissions and light signals, but on 7 July Horthy at last ordered the transports halted. [...] By that time, 437,000 Jews had been sent to Auschwitz, most of them to their deaths. Horthy was informed about the number of the deported Jews some days later: [...] "approximately 400,000". By many estimates, one of every three people murdered at Auschwitz during its operation was a Hungarian Jew killed between May and July 1944.|$|E
