5|$|Probably {{the best}} known {{pictorial}} representation of Accum was an engraving by James Thomson made in July 1820 for the English journal European Magazine. It shows Accum {{sitting at a table}} close to a gas lamp. Thomson's engraving was probably based on <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> painting by the London portrait painter Samuel Drummond (1765–1844), who had shown Accum in a similar pose in a painting produced a few years prior to this. In addition, Accum's brother-in-law, the artist Wilhelm Strack, painted <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> portrait that shows Accum as a young man.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>oil</b> tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design.

5|$|Arlene {{passed over}} several {{offshore}} oil platforms as it tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, producing gusty winds.

Four other oil platforms experienced gusts or sustained winds of at least gale force.|$|E

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E

5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
