5|$|Even {{with these}} private reservations, when Tchaikovsky {{attended}} Rimsky-Korsakov's nameday party in May 1893, along with Belyayev, Glazunov and Lyadov, Rimsky-Korsakov asked Tchaikovsky personally {{if he would}} conduct four concerts of the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg the following season. After some hesitation, Tchaikovsky agreed. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> Tchaikovsky's engagement, the Russian Musical Society required a list of works {{that he planned to}} conduct. Among the items on the list Tchaikovsky supplied were Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony and Glazunov's orchestral fantasy The Forest.|$|E

With {{the end of the war}} between France and Spain however, the Venetians became encouraged, hoping to receive increased assistance in money and men, especially from the French, whose traditionally good relations with the Porte had soured of late.|$|E

30|$|As for {{mobilization}} theory, mobilization {{networks and}} support from internet opinion leaders are neither necessary nor sufficient <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> protest success. The inter-linked reporting by new media can be regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> success of socially influential protests. Almost all successful protests have been reported by new media. Further analysis shows that new media reports are not <b>a</b> necessary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> the failure of protests, which means that new media reports are not <b>a</b> “trivial” necessary <b>condition.</b> However, new media reports are not <b>a</b> sufficient <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> protest success. <b>As</b> for protest tactics, be it disruptive, violent, or performative, none can be regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sufficient <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> protest success. Similarly, any single protest frame alone cannot be regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sufficient <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> protest success.|$|R
5|$|The dispute {{culminated in}} what has become known as the Toledo War, as Michigan and Ohio militia took up arms in the area. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> {{entering}} the Union, Michigan was forced to accept the eastern three-quarters of the Upper Peninsula in exchange for ceding its claim to the Toledo Strip. After a state convention first rejected this condition, a second convention, assembled under some duress in December 1836, reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26, 1837, with Detroit as its first capital.|$|E
5|$|West Virginia, {{admitted}} to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required {{to provide for the}} gradual abolition of slavery. Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert de Clare {{was the son}} of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester – {{known as}} Gilbert 'the Red' – who in 1290 married Joan of Acre, {{daughter}} of EdwardI. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> the marriage, the earl had to surrender all his lands to the king, only to have them returned jointly to himself and his wife for the lifetime of either. This grant was made on the condition that the lands would pass to the couple's joint heirs, but if they were childless to Joan's heirs from any later marriages. The younger Gilbert was born the next year, around 10May 1291, securing the inheritance for the de Clare family, but his father died only four years later, on 7December 1295, while the boy was still a minor. Because of the joint enfeoffment, Joan kept the custody of the family lands, and did homage to the king on 20January the next year.|$|E

As the study group convenes, Jeff pretends the other members simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited Abed to join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave, and then gets called to the football field by Dr. Duncan. The professor makes a futile attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience, and eventually agrees to provide the answers. Jeff returns to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce and Annie. Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E
5|$|On Wednesday, Assad sent Tlass to Moscow {{to seek a}} {{comprehensive}} air umbrella. The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshall Pavel Stepanovich Kutakhov to Syria {{to find out what}} happened to the Syrian SAMs, fearing that NATO might do the same in Eastern Europe. On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> a ceasefire. US President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6:00 AM, on June 10. By noon on Friday, when the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat. A year after the battle, a US fact-finding mission headed by Lieutenant-General John Chain, then deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia was an unrecognised {{state in}} {{southern}} Africa, {{run by a}} predominantly white minority government headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith. Taking exception to the UK's insistence on majority rule <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> independence, Smith's colonial administration had unilaterally declared independence in 1965 following a long dispute over the terms. International uproar and the first ever United Nations economic sanctions had ensued, making Rhodesia deeply isolated. This quarantine variously extended to sports. Rhodesian athletes, including the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympic squads (which were racially integrated), were barred from international competition on political grounds. Rhodesian cricket and rugby were not greatly affected as these sports largely operated in tandem with South Africa. The Rhodesia cricket team, for example, {{took part in the}} annual Currie Cup tournament against South African provincial sides.|$|E

Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and {{some members of the}} public.|$|E
5|$|Sashadhar Mukherjee, an {{assistant}} sound-engineer at the studio, had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because {{both of them}} were Bengalis and spoke that language with each other. He established contact with the runaway couple and managed to convince Devika Rani to return to her husband. In the India of that era, divorce was legally almost impossible and women who eloped were regarded as no better than prostitutes and were shunned by their own families. In her heart of hearts, Devika Rani knew that she could not secure a divorce or marry Hassan under any circumstances. She negotiated with her husband through the auspices of Sashadhar Mukherjee, seeking the separation of her finances from those of her husband <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> her return. Henceforth, she would be paid separately for working in his films, but he would be required to single-handedly pay the household expenses for the home in which both of them would live. Himanshu agreed to this, in order to save face in society and to prevent his studio from going bankrupt. Devika Rani returned to her marital home. However, things {{would never be the same}} between husband and wife again, and it is said that thenceforth, their relationship was largely confined to work and little or no intimacy transpired between them after this episode.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with rigid formations of mobile autonomous agents that have leader-follower architecture. In a previous paper, Baillieul and Suri gave <b>a</b> proposition <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> stable rigidity. They also gave <b>a</b> separate theorem <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sufficient <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> stable rigidity. This paper suggests an approach to analyze rigid formations that have leader-follower architecture. It proves that the third condition in the proposition given by Baillieul and Suri is redundant, and it proves that this proposition is a necessary and sufficient <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> stable rigidity. Simulation results are also presented to illustrate rigidity. I...|$|R
