500|$|Davil Balls of Digital Spy {{described}} the music video as being [...] "cheeky, seductive <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit ridiculous" [...] {{and said that}} Spears [...] "delivers some killer dance routines". Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly compared the dance in the chair with the music video of [...] "Stronger" [...] and added that [...] "best of all, she actually looks animated in this video {{and appears to be}} having fun". James Montgomery of MTV said that after watching the video [...] "you are overcome with the sudden urge to go to the Big Apple Circus. Or pick up some Curious perfume. Or you know, possibly both". The music video won the category of Best Moves at the MTV Australia Awards 2009. It was also nominated for four VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Art Direction, Best Choreography, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, but lost of all them. It was also nominated for Best Video in the MTV Europe Music Awards 2009, but lost to Beyoncé's [...] "Single Ladies". The video won Best Video of 2009 in Fuse TV, making Spears the only artist to win two years in a row.|$|E
500|$|Time {{contributor}} James Poniewozik was complimentary {{towards the}} casting of Jon Hamm as Tina Fey's love interest, but hoped that Hamm get [...] "fleshed {{out beyond the}} central-casting dreamboat" [...] in the series. Further in his review, Poniewozik said that he most enjoyed episodes in which Liz shows her [...] "evil side" [...] because the show [...] "does {{an excellent job of}} showing how much work it is for her to be assertive and slightly evil, how she's excited yet made nervous by the idea at the same time." [...] As with Poniewozik, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club complimented 30 Rock as they [...] "pulled it off with aplomb" [...] in regards to Liz's actions in this episode. He said that Liz and Drew [...] "are so damned delightful that it's hard not to root for them even if Liz's antics increasingly border on deranged and criminal." [...] Rabin said that the Rohypnol incident was funny [...] "but also sweet <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> romantic." [...] Sassone enjoyed Liz and Drew's scenes, writing that when Fey and Hamm work together they are quite good. Gold said that Liz's unsuccessful attempts of seduction were [...] "hilarious effects". Canning wrote that Liz's [...] "scam" [...] started weakly but that her storyline [...] "grew at a great pace." ...|$|E

With President Franklin D. Roosevelt looking on, O'Hare's wife Rita placed the Medal around his neck. After receiving the Medal of Honor from President Franklin D.

2500|$|Schickel {{also named}} the film {{one of the}} Top 10 Movies of 2007, ranking it at #9, calling Daniel Day-Lewis' {{performance}} [...] "astonishing", and calling the film [...] "a mesmerizing meditation on the American spirit in all its maddening ambiguities: mean and noble, angry and secretive, hypocritical <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> insane in its aspirations." [...] James Christopher, chief film critic for The Times, published a list in April 2008 of his top 100 films, placing There Will Be Blood in second place, behind only Casablanca.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Deadly Impact {{has been largely}} negative. Reviewers for DVD Talk heavily panned the film, with one writing [...] "Rather uninspired <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit predictable, Deadly Impact doesn't really bring much of interest to a genre already riddled with clichés." [...] DVD Verdict also panned Deadly Impact, cautioning readers that it was [...] "one hell of a bomb" [...] and to [...] " [...] waste any time on this dud". Beyond Hollywood was also critical in their review, stating that [...] "Deadly Impact is an almost painful experience to behold, even {{when compared to the}} stuff Steven Seagal and Val Kilmer are pumping out these days. After the film’s mildly intriguing opening number, the production promptly loses its cinematic footing and never recovers." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{owner of}} the Pleasant Street Tenements was of what is usually called {{commanding}} presence. He was tall and broad, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stout.

60|$|When he {{had last}} seen Muriel Gascoyne he had {{considered}} her a comely English girl without imagination or sensibility.

Now, as she came towards him with her eyes shining and the soft colour in her face, which was very gentle, she seemed transfigured and almost radiant. She stooped and kissed Jacinta impulsively.|$|E
60|$|Dane {{felt very}} {{helpless}} {{as they ran}} forward to disperse the mob of terror-stricken black men.

He appeared quietly resolute, though Dane afterward admitted feeling desperately anxious <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> afraid, for the mass of dusky faces with unreasoning fear and its accompanying ferocity stamped upon them was not an encouraging spectacle.

60|$|Affairs {{were in this}} {{condition}} when Clarence Weston crawled out of the swamp one evening {{and sat down on}} a cedar log before he followed his comrades up the track, though he supposed that supper would shortly be laid out in the sleeping-shanty. The sunlight that flung lurid flecks of color upon the western side of the fir trunks beat upon his dripping face, which, though a little worn and grim just then, was otherwise a pleasant face of the fair English type. In fact, though he had been some years in the country, Englishman was unmistakably stamped upon him. He was attired scantily and simply in a very old blue shirt, and trousers, which also had once been blue, of duck; and just then he was very weary, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lame.|$|E
60|$|The mate obeyed, {{following}} his commander towards the same ravine where, {{about four years}} before, they had seen poor Zeppa disappear among the recesses of the mountain. Redford felt a little surprise, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> discomfort, at the peculiar conduct of his captain; but he comforted himself {{with the thought that}} if he should attempt any violence, there was a brace of pistols in his belt, and a cutlass at his side. He even for a moment meditated using the pistols when he looked at Rosco's broad back; but he knew that some {{of the men in the}} boat had a sort of sneaking fondness for their captain, and refrained--at least till he should get out of sight of the boat and into the shelter of the woods where his actions could not be seen, and any account of the affair might be coloured to suit his convenience.|$|E
60|$|Then {{followed}} the second {{feast of the}} day, at which Jacob had {{to pretend to be}} unconscious of the fact that his host and hostess were alternately ecstatically happy and tremulously hysterical. They all waited upon themselves and ate many things the names of which only were familiar to them. Dauncey opened champagne as though he had been used to it all his life. Jacob carved chickens with great skill, but was a little puzzled as to the location of caviare in the meal <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> generous with the pâté-de-foie-gras. The strawberries and real Devonshire cream were an immense success, and Mrs. Dauncey's eyes grew round with pleasure {{at the sight of the}} boxes of bonbons and chocolates. Afterwards the two men wandered out into the garden, a quaint strip of uncultivated land, with wanton beds of sweet-smelling flowers, and separated from the meadow beyond only by an untrimmed and odoriferous hedge, wreathed in honeysuckle. Over wonderful cigars, the like of which neither of them had ever smoked before, they talked for a moment or two seriously.|$|E

6000|$|Our {{situation}} is an intricate one, {{it does not}} admit of a solution neatly done up in a word or a phrase. Yet so powerful is this wish to simplify {{that it is difficult}} to make it clear that one is not oneself a panacea-monger. One writes and people read a little inattentively <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> impatiently, until one makes a positive proposal Then they jump. [...] "So that's your Remedy!" [...] they say. [...] "How absurdly inadequate!" [...] I was privileged to take part in one such discussion in 1912, and among other things in my diagnosis of the situation I pointed out the extreme mischief done to our public life by the futility of our electoral methods. They make our whole public life forensic and ineffectual, and I pointed out that this evil effect, which vitiates our whole national life, could be largely remedied by an infinitely better voting system known as Proportional Representation. Thereupon the Westminster Gazette declared in tones of pity and contempt that it was no Remedy--and dismissed me. It would be as intelligent to charge a doctor who pushed back the crowd about a broken-legged man in the street with wanting to heal the limb by giving the sufferer air.|$|E
6000|$|These schoolmasters {{move through}} my memory as {{always a little}} distant <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> incomprehensible. Except when they wore flannels, I saw them almost always in old college caps and gowns, a uniform which greatly {{increased}} their detachment {{from the world of}} actual men. Gates, the head, was a lean loose-limbed man, rather stupid I discovered when I reached the Sixth and came into contact with him, but honest, simple and very eager to be liberal-minded. He was bald, with an almost conical baldness, with a grizzled pointed beard, small featured and, under the stresses of a Zeitgeist that demanded liberality, with an expression of puzzled but resolute resistance to his own unalterable opinions. He made a tall dignified figure in his gown. In my junior days he spoke to me only three or four times, and then he annoyed me by giving me a wrong surname; it was a sore point because I was an outsider and not one of the old school families, the Shoesmiths, the Naylors, the Marklows, the Tophams, the Pevises and suchlike, who came generation after generation. I recall him most vividly against the background of faded brown book-backs in the old library in which we less destructive seniors were trusted to work, with the light from the stained-glass window falling in coloured patches on his face. It gave him the appearance of having no colour of his own. He had a habit of scratching the beard on his cheek as he talked, and he used to come and consult us about things and invariably do as we said. That, in his phraseology, was [...] "maintaining the traditions of the school." ...|$|E
60|$|First {{of all the}} Duke rose, {{and in a few}} {{hackneyed}} but earnest sentences {{introduced his}} young friend Captain Bartram. The latter, who sprang at once into the middle of his subject, was nervous <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bitter. He explained that he had resigned his commission and was therefore free to speak his mind. He spoke of enormous military preparations in Germany and a general air of tense expectation. Against whom were these preparations? Without an earthly doubt against Germany's greatest rival, whose millions of young men, even in this hour of danger, preferred playing or watching football or cricket on Saturday afternoons to realising their duty. The conclusion of an ill-pointed but earnest speech was punctuated by the furtive entrance into the hall of a small boy selling evening newspapers, and there was a temporary diversion from any interest in the proceedings {{on the part of the}} younger portion of the audience, whilst they satisfied themselves as to the result of various Cup Ties. The Member of Parliament then descended upon them in a whirlwind of oratory and in his best House of Commons style. He spoke of black clouds and of the cold breeze that went before the coming thunderstorm. He pointed to the collapse of every great nation throughout history who had neglected the arts of self-defence. He appealed to the youth of the nation to prepare themselves to guard their womenkind, their homes, the sacred soil of their country, and at that point was interrupted by a drowsy member of the audience with stentorian lungs, who seemed just at that moment to have waked up.|$|E
