"I had to {{take your}} purse and your jewels from you, mejuffrouw," [...] he said with perfect equanimity, [...] "else you might have used them {{for the purpose of}} {{slipping}} through my fingers. Wenches at wayside inns are easily <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bribes,</b> so are the male servants at city hostelries.

60|$|Finally, we {{have the}} {{evidence}} of the only living man, except the King, who was present at the central point of the occurrences. That this man was a most false and evasive character, that he was doubtless <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> <b>bribes,</b> that he was richly rewarded, I freely admit. But I think it can be made probable, by evidence hitherto overlooked, that he really was present on the crucial occasion, and that, with all allowances for his character and position, his testimony fits into the facts, while, if it be discarded, no hypothesis can account for him, and his part in the adventure. In short, the King’s tale, almost incredible as it appears, contains the only explanation which is not demonstrably impossible. To this conclusion, let me repeat, I am drawn by no sentiment for that unsentimental Prince, ‘gentle King Jamie.’ He was not the man to tell the truth, ‘if he could think of anything better.’ But, where other corroboration is impossible, {{by the nature of the}} circumstances, facts corroborate the King’s narrative. His version ‘colligates’ them; though extravagant they become not incoherent. No other hypothesis produces coherency: each guess breaks down on demonstrated facts.|$|E
6000|$|That {{the girl}} was that abominable villain's {{sweetheart}} he was not {{for a moment in}} doubt, her submission just now, at the mere hint of the fellow's danger, showed the depth of her love for him. Stoutenburg felt therefore that his success in obtaining what information he wanted would depend only on how much she knew. In any case she must be <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> a <b>bribe</b> for she seemed wretchedly poor; even in that brief glimpse which he had had of her by the dim light of the street-door lamp, he could not ...|$|R
50|$|Groups {{of prisoners}} pooled their daily beer coupons to take turns {{drinking}} several at a time. They also received two packs of cigarettes {{a day and}} frequently meat, both rationed for American civilians. (Cigarettes were sold in the prisoner canteen for less than outside the camp, so guards were sometimes <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> being <b>bribed</b> with them.) One German later recalled that he gained 57 lb in two years as a prisoner. Despite complaints to International Red Cross inspectors about the alleged inferiority of American white bread and coffee, prisoners recognized that they were treated better in the United States than anywhere else.|$|R
60|$|With {{the note}} {{was a very}} fine steel saw, coiled round and round, and a tiny phial of oil. Ryan gave a cry of delight as he read it; and then hid the saw and the oil bottle in his bed, made up the tiny note into a pellet, and {{swallowed}} it. As he ate his dinner, he pondered over how so much could have been managed. The courtyard of the prison was, he knew, some ten feet higher than the ground outside. Some one must, after nightfall, have climbed up to the passage window and sawn the bars almost asunder, with a saw as fine as {{the one he had}} received. The cuts could hardly have been perceptible, and had probably been filled in with dust or black lead, each night, after the work was done. The difficulty must have been great, for he had learned that sentries patrolled the street outside the prison, and the work could only have been carried on for two or three minutes at a time. How he was {{to get down to the}} courtyard he knew not, but probably a sentry had been found more <b>amenable</b> <b>to</b> a <b>bribe</b> than the old sergeant had been.|$|R
