5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized <b>and</b> <b>revised.</b> A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E

5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have {{had anything to do with}} the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s <b>and</b> <b>revised</b> it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E

In October Carvalho yielded to pressure <b>and</b> <b>revised</b> the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we explore the {{spontaneous}} explanatory models children construct, critique, <b>and</b> <b>revise</b> {{in the context of}} tasks in which children need to predict, observe, and explain phenomena involving magnetism. Our findings indicate that several of the children were able to construct explanatory models. However, of the six children interviewed (three third graders and three sixth graders), only one was consistently able to critique <b>and</b> <b>revise</b> her models to arrive at a consistent, coherent, and sophisticated explanatory model. This research indicates that instruction should help students to become meta-conceptually aware in order to critique <b>and</b> <b>revise</b> explanatory models drawing on both intuitive and conscious knowledge. unpublishedis peer reviewe...|$|R
