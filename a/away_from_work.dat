25|$|In 1746 {{the first}} public concert took place in Russia. This soon became a tradition. Concert life was {{dominated}} by foreign musicians before Russian virtuosos appeared in the 1780–1790s; these included the violinist Ivan Khandoshkin and singer Elizaveta Sandunova. The senator Grigory Teplov was also an amateur musician who printed in 1751 the collection of his songs entitled Idle Hours <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> <b>Work.</b> Publishing music business, sales of foreign sheet music, and music lovers' periodicals flourished from the 1770s onward.|$|E
25|$|Employers are in {{a unique}} {{position}} because they can use the employer-employee relationship as leverage to complement and enforce government policies that require safety belt use, prohibit impaired driving, and prohibit mobile-phone use and other forms of distracted driving. Safe-driving policies implemented in the workplace can promote safer driving <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> In addition, employers, as purchasers of large fleets of vehicles, can spur improvements in vehicle safety, and encourage development of road safety capacity and legislation in the local areas and countries in which they operate, thereby improving road safety for all.|$|E

25|$|Experts agree hand-washing {{can help}} prevent viral infections, {{including}} ordinary and the swine flu infections. Also, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose or mouth with one's hands helps to prevent the flu. Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes, but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops, telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes, nose or mouth. Alcohol-based gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria. Anyone with flu-like symptoms, such as a sudden fever, cough or muscle aches, should stay <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> or public transportation, and should contact a doctor for advice.|$|E
25|$|When Lillywhite {{headed off}} to New Zealand he left Melbourne cricketer John Conway to arrange the match for their return. Conway ignored the cricket {{associations}} in each colony and selected his own Australian team, negotiating directly with the players. Not only was the team he selected of doubtful representation {{but it was also}} probably not the strongest available as some players had declined to take part for various reasons. Demon bowler Fred Spofforth refused to play because wicket-keeper Billy Murdoch was not selected. Paceman Frank Allan was at Warnambool Agricultural Show and Australia’s best all-rounder Edwin Evans could not get <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> In the end only five Australian-born players were selected.|$|E
25|$|The first {{bombing of}} Kjeller by the Allies was planned for 16 November 1943, but {{canceled}} {{because of the}} cloudy weather. Two days later the Eighth Air Force of the United States Air Force carried out an attack on Kjeller, using 102 B-24 Liberators to deliver 838 high-explosive bombs. The civilian workforce was <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> as there was a German military exercise being carried out, under supervision of General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst. This caused the anti-aircraft guns to be loaded with blanks and that no-one suspected {{that it was a}} real attack until the bombs started raining. Russian prisoners of war were used to clear the undetonated shells. Both Daimler-Benz's workshop and one of the halls were destroyed, as were an estimated twelve aircraft {{and the rest of the}} buildings suffered significant damages. German reports concluded with few casualties, while Swedish reports estimate ca. 200.|$|E

25|$|Ease {{of voting}} {{is a factor}} in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through {{separate}} voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts. Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have considered Internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like France, voting is held on the weekend, when most voters are <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{was playing}} a gig at the Brick House in Gretna, Louisiana when he met Daisy Parker, a local prostitute. He started the affair as a client. He {{returned}} to Gretna on several occasions to visit her. Eventually he {{found the courage to}} look for her home in order to see her <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> It was on this occasion that he found out that she had a common-law husband. Not long after this fiasco, Daisy journeyed to Armstrong's home on Perdido Street. They checked into Kid Green's hotel that evening, and the next day, March 19, 1918, at the age of 16, Louis and Daisy married at City Hall. They adopted a 3-year-old boy, Clarence Armstrong, whose mother, Louis' cousin Flora, died soon after giving birth. Clarence Armstrong was mentally disabled (the result of a head injury at an early age) and Louis would {{spend the rest of his}} life taking care of him. Louis' marriage to Parker failed quickly and they separated in 1923.|$|E
25|$|NHTSA has {{produced}} models and guidance {{on the economic}} burden of traffic crashes on employers. Because public and private employers in the U.S. generally subsidize at least a portion of health insurance premium costs for employees and their dependents, employers bear some {{of the costs of}} crashes involving employees and families <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> in addition to at-work crashes. Employers are also liable for damages awarded in the courts for crashes for which employees are found to be at fault. In 1998-2000, motor vehicle crash injuries occurring on and off the job were estimated to cost employers nearly US $60 billion annually. On average, a fatality occurring on the job cost a business over $500,000 USD in direct and liability costs, and each nonfatal injury cost nearly $74,000 USDs. For on- and off-the-job crashes combined, the study estimated the cost of non-use of safety belts at more than $6 billion each year, and the cost of alcohol-related crashes at more than $9 billion each year.|$|E

25|$|FLOC {{was founded}} in September 1967 by Baldemar Velásquez and his father. Velásquez had been deeply {{influenced}} by the ideas of César Chávez, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Initially, his goal was merely to organize the farmworkers {{so that they could}} cooperate with the growers to improve pay, housing, and education for the pickers. Sensing that the farmworkers would not take a 20-year-old student seriously, Velásquez relied on his father to gather the employees and get them to listen to him. He even sent volunteer organizers to Texas during the winter to talk to and organize the workers during their months <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> But the effort largely failed, and in September 1968 Velásquez called a strike against 10 tomato growers in Ohio. Five growers signed contracts recognizing the union, agreeing to a minimum wage and limited health insurance, and promising not to discriminate against union members or union organizers. Within a few weeks, 21 other growers had agreed to contracts with FLOC as well. But in the following year, sustained anti-union opposition from the growers (backed by the American Farm Bureau Federation), the withdrawal of some growers from the tomato market, the refusal of some growers to honor their contracts, and the efforts of some growers to raise wages and improve working conditions (which led employees to abandon the union) caused Velásquez to rethink his organizing strategy.|$|E
500|$|Bradman {{became a}} regular {{selection}} for the Bowral team; several outstanding performances {{earned him the}} attention of the Sydney daily press. Competing on matting-over-concrete pitches, Bowral played other rural towns in the Berrima District competition. Against Wingello, a team that included the future Test bowler Bill O'Reilly, Bradman made 234. In the competition final against Moss Vale, which extended over five consecutive Saturdays, Bradman scored 320 not out. During the following Australian winter (1926), an ageing Australian team lost The Ashes in England, and a number of Test players retired. The New South Wales Cricket Association began a hunt for new talent. Mindful of Bradman's big scores for Bowral, the association wrote to him, requesting his attendance at a practice session in Sydney. He was subsequently chosen for the [...] "Country Week" [...] tournaments at both cricket and tennis, to be played during separate weeks. His boss presented him with an ultimatum: he could have only one week <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> and therefore had to choose between the two sports. He chose cricket.|$|E
500|$|While Susie's {{addition}} helps The Fabulous Baker Boys experience success, it also {{results in}} complications {{among the group}} by disturbing some of the original act's traditions and threatening to come between the two brothers when Jack begins {{to fall in love}} with her. Susie and Jack's growing mutual attraction towards each other eventually threatens the stability of the trio. Having a family of his own, Frank is particularly concerned that if his younger brother Jack pursues Susie he will ultimately disregard her and cause her to leave the group, while Susie insists that she deserves a say in determining what songs the trio will perform, particularly lamenting that she is forced to sing [...] "Feelings" [...] at every scheduled performance. When Frank is pulled <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> for a family emergency around New Year's Eve, Susie and Jack seize the opportunity to make adjustments to their set list and ultimately make love in a late night jazz club after performing alone together. Frank is furious to learn that Susie and Jack have changed the set list without his permission and an argument ensues between Jack and Frank. Susie eventually leaves both the group and Jack due to Jack's refusal to express his true feelings for her, accepting a job singing jingles for television commercials. After mending his relationship with Frank, Susie receives a visit from Jack who apologizes for his behavior towards her; Susie does not clarify if she and Jack will rekindle their romance before walking away.|$|E

2500|$|Strippers can {{sometimes}} be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Strippers with ready access to the Internet <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> have also adopted social media and networks as a less intrusive way of maintaining direct connections with customers. Others {{use the internet to}} generate revenue by performing via webcam, recording premium content, or running their own subscriber-based web site. Online erotic content is pervasive and generally classified as pornography. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they provide during private parties. Aside from advertising for striptease services outside of the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the sex industry. [...] This can include erotic and nude modeling, pornography, escorting, and in some cases prostitution. [...] Outside of the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex-for-hire is much more common and stripping in those settings is viewed as advertising for sexually oriented services that will be performed in either private areas of the club or off-premises.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday afternoon, August 31, a {{crowd of}} 2,700, 800 of them women and children, marched in sweltering heat to pack the Palestra, a [...] "colossal oven," [...] where Moyer {{encouraged}} them to continue early morning picketing, telling them they {{had the right to}} peacefully persuade men to stay <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> The WFM Executive Board fully sanctioned their strike, he told them. He had told reporters that the WFM had all kinds of money, piles and stacks of it. He assured the strikers that benefits would be forthcoming: the WFM had $161,000 [...] "in cash here"; an assessment of $2 had been levied for September on each WFM member—90,000 of them, Moyer had said, doubling the actual membership figure. The $161,000 had included the loans he hoped to procure, but he did not tell them that. Rather, he depicted a financially secure WFM, ready and able to finance the strike, a characterization that was most unreal. The strikers passed resolutions calling for a Senate investigation, protesting the militia, and denouncing the deputies.|$|E
2500|$|Despite an {{agreement}} between the National Union of Mineworkers and the mine, {{a majority of the}} 3,000 striking members from the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union continued to stay <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> NUM's General-Secretary Frans Baleni said there had been a [...] "high level of intimidation" [...] had stopped other miners from returning to work. [...] "The workers are still scared. There have been threats that those who have reported for duty would have their homes torched. Some of the workers also feel threatened by their managers. Peace has not really prevailed at this stage, which is the main reason why workers would stay away." [...] On 11 September, as another deadline to return to work passed, workers continued to stick their ground amid mounting solidarity protests. Following President Jacob Zuma's vow to clamp down on protests at the mine on 14 September, military convoys and other armoured vehicles were seen in the area. The next day, demonstrations turned violent after the representatives of the striking miners refused to hand in their machetes, sticks and pistols. Police then fired tear gas on the protesters in a shantytown. On 17 September, another march was stopped by police. At the same time COSATU was holding its annual congress with the issue on the top of its agenda.|$|E
