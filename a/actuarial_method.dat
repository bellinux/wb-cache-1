We examine the extent to which this variation results from <b>actuarial</b> <b>methods</b> themselves, concluding that about half of the industry’s historical deficiencies and redundancies have resulted from <b>actuarial</b> <b>methods.</b> The deficiencies and redundancies that result from <b>actuarial</b> <b>methods</b> appear to be highly correlated with the economic cycle. At the same time, there is also a strong relationship between the underwriting cycle and carried reserve adequacy.

However, this evidence is derived front comparisons of 'X-marks-the-spot' predictions, which ignore the fact that sonic algorithms provide a prioritization of the offender's area of spatial activity. Using search area as a measure of performance, we examine the predictions of students (N= 200) and an <b>actuarial</b> <b>method</b> under three levels of information load and two levels of heuristic-environment fit. Results show that the <b>actuarial</b> <b>method</b> produces a smaller search area than a concentric search outward from Students' 'X-marks-the-spot' predictions, but that students are able to produce search areas that are smaller than those provided by the <b>actuarial</b> <b>method.</b> Students' performance did not decrease under greater information load and was not improved by adding a descriptive qualifier to the taught heuristic.

40|$|Meta-analyses {{comparing}} {{the accuracy of}} clinical versus actuarial prediction have shown <b>actuarial</b> <b>methods</b> to outperform clinical methods, on average. However, <b>actuarial</b> <b>methods</b> are still not widely used in clinical practice, {{and there has been}} a call for the development of <b>actuarial</b> prediction <b>methods</b> for clinical practice. We argue that rule-based methods may be more useful than the linear main effect models usually employed in prediction studies, from a data and decision analytic as well as a practical perspective. In addition, decision rules derived with rule-based methods can be represented as fast and frugal trees, which, unlike main effects models, can be used in a sequential fashion, reducing the number of cues that have to be evaluated before making a prediction. We illustrate the usability of rule-based methods by applying RuleFit, an algorithm for deriving decision rules for classification and regression problems, to a dataset on prediction of the course of depressive and anxiety disorders from Penninx et al. (2011). The RuleFit algorithm provided a model consisting of 2 simple decision rules, requiring evaluation of only 2 to 4 cues. Predictive accuracy of the 2 -rule model was very similar to that of a logistic regression model incorporating 20 predictor variables, originally applied to the dataset. In addition, the 2 -rule model required, on average, evaluation of only 3 cues. Therefore, the RuleFit algorithm appears to be a promising method for creating decision tools that are less time consuming and easier to apply in psychological practice, and with accuracy comparable to traditional <b>actuarial</b> <b>methods.</b> (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved...|$|R
