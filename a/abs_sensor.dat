This will be achieved by a network of networks where decision-makers, information- and weapon-systems are linked together. As {{a part of the}} development of NBD, we have performed a study of user interface design for a future network-based tool package for analysis of sensor systems, referred to as the C 2 SR-system. This thesis was performed at Ericsson Microwave Systems <b>AB,</b> <b>Sensor</b> and Information Networks, during the autumn 2002. A pre-study concerning the requirements of usability, trustworthiness and functionality of a user interface for the C 2 SR-system was performed. Officers representing the future users in the NBD played an important role when gathering these requirements. Another important part of the pre-study was the evaluation of software that contains parts of the functionality necessary for the C 2 SR-system. On the basis of the results from the pre-study, we have designed a user interface to the future C 2 SR-system. To demonstrate the most important conclusions, a prototype was implemented...|$|R

50|$|Typical bicycle speedometers {{measure the}} time between each wheel revolution, and give a readout on a small, handlebar-mounted digital display. The sensor is mounted on the bike at a fixed location, pulsing when the spoke-mounted magnet passes by. In this way, it is {{analogous}} to an electronic car speedometer using pulses from an <b>ABS</b> <b>sensor,</b> but with a much cruder time/distance resolution - typically one pulse/display update per revolution, or as seldom as once every 2-3 seconds at low speed with a 26-inch (2.07m circumference, without tire) wheel. However, this is rarely a critical problem, and the system provides frequent updates at higher road speeds where the information is of more importance. The low pulse frequency also has little impact on measurement accuracy, as these digital devices can be programmed by wheel size, or additionally by wheel or tire circumference {{in order to make}} distance measurements more accurate and precise than a typical motor vehicle gauge. However these devices carry some minor disadvantage in requiring power from batteries that must be replaced every so often in the receiver (AND sensor, for wireless models), and, in wired models, the signal being carried by a thin cable that is much less robust than that used for brakes, gears, or cabled speedometers.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) is increasingly based upon using the in-wheel technology. In this design, {{the use of}} a separate electric machine at each corner of the vehicle provides unique opportunities for innovative vehicle control strategies. In this paper, a sensorless antilock braking system (ABS) is proposed that eliminates the need for the installation of separate conventional ABS sensors and saves the costs associated with the installation and maintenance of those sensors for in-wheel EVs. The proposed ABS exploits the information carried by the back electromotive force (EMF) of the electric machines of the in-wheel vehicle to obtain accurate wheel speed estimation at each wheel and conduct road identification simultaneously. A wavelet-packet denoising method is used to maintain the accuracy of wheel speed estimation in the presence of noise. In addition to sensorless wheel speed estimation, the proposed ABS is capable of road identification by analyzing the back EMF signal using discrete wavelet transforms. The design was realized and fully tested using actual ABS hardware. The results of the sensorless technique were compared with a commercial <b>ABS</b> <b>sensor.</b> The experimental results showed that the sensorless ABS can adequately replace the conventional <b>ABS</b> <b>sensor</b> in in-wheel EVs and significantly improve the performance of the ABS...|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. he {{suppression}} of the critical current in YBCO Josephson junctions by the Earth's magnetic field strongly affects the operation of SQUIDs outside magnetic shielding. Commonly, one observes a modulation of the SQUID fluxvoltage transfer function amplitude, Vsq. pp, with a period of AB,, leading to an increased white flux noise level or unstable SQUID operation. Here, {{we report on the}} investigation of <b>AB,.,</b> of rf-SQUID <b>sensors</b> based on step edge junctions (SEJ) operated in a flip chip configuration with coplanar resonators with integrated flux concentrators.

40|$|This thesis work {{is about}} further {{developing}} an existing capacitive MEMS sensor for in situ TEM nanoindentation developed by Nanofactory Instrument <b>AB.</b> Today, this <b>sensor</b> uses a parallel plate capacitor suspended by springs {{to measure the}} applied force. The forces are in the micro Newton range. One major issue using with this measurement technique is that the tip mounted {{on one of the}} sensor plates can move out of the TEM image when a force is applied. In order to improve the measurement technique electrostatic feedback has been investigated. The sensor’s electrostatic properties have been evaluated using Capacitance-Voltage measurements and a white light interferometer has been used to directly measure the displacement of the sensor with varying voltage. Investigation of the sensor is described with analytical models with detailed treatment of the capacitive response as function of electrostatic actuation. The model has been tested and refined by using experimental data. The model showed the existence of a serial capacitor in the sensor. Moreover, a feedback loop was tested, by using small beads as load and by manually adjusting the voltage. With the success of controlling the feedback loop manually, it is shown that the idea is feasible, but some modifications and improvements are needed to perform it more smoothly...|$|R
40|$|Low-power, high-speed, {{accurate}} computation of centroid from a pre-defined {{window in}} the image plane is important {{for a number of}} space-based and commercial applications. These include object tracking in robotic systems [l], autonomous navigation, image compression [2], and document copyright protection [3], as well as space guidance and navigation systems [4], and deep-space optical communication systems that require accurate and stable beam pointing for high speed data transfer 151. Off-focal-plane digital processors yield accurate centroid values, but only at the cost of increased latency, power and size. On or near focal plane centroid computation using current mode circuits [6], and neuro-MOS circuits [7] have been implemented. However, neither approaches are integrated with high performance image sensors, nor are they entirely compatible with one. In this paper, we present a CMOS- active Eixel <b>Sensor</b> (<b>AB)</b> with an integrated centroid-computation circuit that allows accurate X and Y centroid computation from a user-selectable window of interest.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a novel road-matching method designed {{to support the}} real-time navigational function of cars for advanced systems applications {{in the area of}} driving assistance. This method provides an accurate estimation of position for a vehicle relative to a digital road map using Belief Theory and Kalman filtering. Firstly, an Extended Kalman Filter combines the DGPS and <b>ABS</b> <b>sensor</b> measurements to produce an approximation of the vehicle's pose, which is then used to select the most likely segment from the database. The selection strategy merges several criteria based on distance, direction and velocity measurements using Belief Theory. A new observation is then built using the selected segment, and the approximate pose adjusted in a second Kalman filter estimation stage. The particular attention given to the modeling of the system showed that incrementing the state by the bias (also called absolute error) of the map significantly increases the performance of the method. Real experimental results show that this approach, if correctly initialized, is able to work over a substantial period without GPS...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the braking system}} of a vehicle equipped with an ABS. In a previous paper we presented a Petri net model of such a device assuming that the sensor that activates the ABS can be aected by a stuck-at-on fault. Here, the {{case in which the}} <b>ABS</b> <b>sensor</b> can be aected by both a stuck-at-on and a stuck-at-o fault is considered. Firstly, we {{consider the}} case in which the braking subsystems of dierent wheels cannot exchange information neither between them, nor with a coordinator. We show that in this local setting, where diagnosis is performed independently at each wheel, faults are not diagnosable. Secondly, we show that in a centralized setting, where the diagnoser can monitor each single wheel, the overall system is diagnosable. Finally, we assume that the braking systems of two wheels {{on the same side of}} the vehicle can exchange information and propose a communication protocol that makes the overall system diagnosable assuming both wheels are always in the same grip condition.

40|$|Herein {{we report}} on an ultrasensitive {{immunosensor}} based on glutathione protected gold nanoparticle (GSH-AuNP) for the electrochemical detection of interleukin 8 (IL- 8), cancer biomarker in calf serum and proof of concept IL- 8 detection in HNSCC cells. GSH-AuNP were bioconjugated to the primary antibodies (Ab 1) and used to capture human IL- 8 in a sandwich electrochemical immunoassay coupled to horseradish peroxidase enzyme labels. Using the optimized concentrations of the primary (Ab 1) and secondary antibodies (<b>Ab</b> 2), two <b>sensor</b> approaches were used to measure ultra low (≤ 500 fg mL- 1) and elevated levels of IL- 8. Biotinylated Ab 2 bound to streptavidin HRP with 14 - 16 labels per antigen {{was used to measure}} high IL- 8 concentration with a DL of 10 pg mL- 1 (1. 0 pM) in 10 L calf serum. The second approach greatly amplified the signal using 1 m magnetic beads coated with over 500, 000 HRP labels providing the highest sensitivity of (1061. 8 nA mL (fg IL- 8) - 1 cm- 2 and the best detection limit of 1 fg mL- 1 (100 aM) for IL- 8 in 10 L calf serum. This represents a 10, 000 -fold and 30, 000 -fold decrease in the DL over the Ab-HRP(14 - 16) system and the industry standard ELISA for IL- 8 respectively. The immuonsensors were also used to accurately measure IL- 8 in HNSCC cell lines with excellent correlation to the standard enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These GSH-AuNP based immuonsensors show great promise for the fabrication of ultrasensitive biosensor microarrays for point-of-care cancer diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the 1 970 s, {{controversy}} centered both on im-munoassay “sensitivity ” per se and on {{the relative}} sensi-tivities of labeled antibody (Ab) and labeled analyte meth-ods. Our theoretical studies revealed that RIA sensitivities could be surpassed only {{by the use of}} very high-specific-activity nonisotopic labels in “noncompetitive ” designs, preferably with monoclonal antibodies. The time-resolved fluorescence methodology known as DELFIA-developed in collaboration with LKB/Wallac-represented the first com-mercial “ultrasensitive ” nonisotopic technique based on these theoretical insights, the same concepts being sub-sequently adopted in comparable methodologies relying on the use of chemiluminescent and enzyme labels. How-ever, high-specific-activity labels also permit the develop-ment of “multianalyte ” immunoassay systems combining ultrasensitivity with the simultaneous measurement of tens, hundreds, or thousands of analytes in a small biological sample. This possibility relies on simple, albeit hitherto-unexploited, physicochemical concepts. The first is that all immunoassays rely on the measurement of Ab occupancy by analyte. The second is that, provided the Ab concentra-tion used is “vanishingly small, ” fractional Ab occupancy is independent of both Ab concentration and sample volume. This leads to the notion of “ratiometric ” immunoassay, involving measurement of the ratio of signals (e. g., fluores-cent signals) emitted by two labeled Abs, the first (a “sensor ” Ab) deposited as a microspot on a solid support, the second (a “developing ” Ab) directed against either occupied or unoccupied binding sites of the <b>sensor</b> <b>Ab.</b> Our preliminary studies of this approach have relied on a dual-channel scanning-laser confocal microscope, permit-ting microspots of area 100 pn 2 or less to be analyzed, and implying that an array of 1 Q 6 Ab-containing microspots, each directed against a different analyte, could, in princi-ple, be accommodated on an area of 1 cm 2. Although measurement of such analyte numbers is unlikely ever to be required, the ability to analyze biological fluids for a wide spectrum of analytes is likely to transform immunodiagnos-tics in the next decade...|$|R
