It is difficult to obtain an <b>ac</b> high <b>magnetic</b> field by using an air-gap coil because of eddy currents. For our device, we can obtain an <b>ac</b> high <b>magnetic</b> field {{by means of the}} magnetic shielding effect of eddy currents.

40|$|We {{identify}} a new {{contribution to the}} chiral magnetic conductivity at finite frequencies [...] the magnetization current. This allows to quantitatively reproduce the known field-theoretic time-dependent (<b>AC)</b> chiral <b>magnetic</b> response in terms of kinetic theory. We evaluate the corresponding <b>AC</b> chiral <b>magnetic</b> conductivity in two flavor QCD plasma at weak coupling. The magnetization current results from the spin response of chiral quasiparticles to magnetic field, and is thus proportional to the quasiparticle's $g$-factor. In condensed matter systems, where the chiral quasi-particles are emergent and the $g$-factor can significantly differ from 2, this opens the possibility to tune the <b>AC</b> chiral <b>magnetic</b> response.

The ground loop constitutes a conductive wire loop {{which may have}} a large area of several square meters. It acts like a short circuited single-turn [...] "transformer winding"; any <b>AC</b> <b>magnetic</b> flux passing through the loop, from nearby transformers, electric motors, or just adjacent power wiring, will induce currents in the loop by induction. Since its resistance is very low, often less than 1 ohm, the induced currents can be large.|$|E
50|$|In the {{traditional}} version of eddy current testing an alternating (<b>AC)</b> <b>magnetic</b> field {{is used to}} induce eddy currents inside the material to be investigated. If the material contains a crack or flaw which make the spatial distribution of the electrical conductivity nonuniform, {{the path of the}} eddy currents is perturbed and the impedance of the coil which generates the <b>AC</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is modified. By measuring the impedance of this coil, a crack can hence be detected. Since the eddy currents are generated by an <b>AC</b> <b>magnetic</b> field, their penetration into the subsurface region of the material is limited by the skin effect. The applicability of {{the traditional}} version of eddy current testing is therefore limited to the analysis of the immediate vicinity of the surface of a material, usually of the order of one millimeter. Attempts to overcome this fundamental limitation using low frequency coils and superconducting magnetic field sensors have not led to widespread applications.|$|E

50|$|A {{ferromagnetic}} material {{will have a}} dimensional change when an external magnetic field is applied. This effect is called magnetostriction. The flux field of a magnet expands or collapses depends on the arrangement of {{ferromagnetic material}} having inducing voltage in a coil {{and the amount of}} change is affected by the magnitude and direction of the field. The AC current in the electric coil induces an <b>AC</b> <b>magnetic</b> field and thus produces magnetostriction at ultrasonic frequency in the material.

This gives it low hysteresis losses when used in <b>AC</b> <b>magnetic</b> circuits.

50|$|In {{the most}} common type of caesium magnetometer, a very small <b>AC</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is applied to the cell. Since the {{difference}} in the energy levels of the electrons is determined by the external magnetic field, there is a frequency at which this small AC field makes the electrons change states. In this new state, the electron once again can absorb a photon of light. This causes a signal on a photo detector that measures the light passing through the cell. The associated electronics use this fact to create a signal exactly at the frequency that corresponds to the external field.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of Nd 0. 85 Sr 0. 15 CoO 3 have been systematically investigated by dc magnetization, <b>ac</b> susceptibility and <b>magnetic</b> relaxation. The dynamics scaling analysis of <b>ac</b> susceptibility and <b>magnetic</b> relaxation give sufficient {{evidence of the}} existence of a spin-glass phase, which can be ascribed to the complicated interactions among Co 3 + and Co 4 + ions in this phase-separated compound. The field-cooled magnetic hysteresis loop displays both horizontal and vertical shifts, i. e., the exchange bias effect, while no shifts are present with increase of the measuring field up to +/- 50 kOe. The results further sustain the picture of the spin-glass phase coexisting with other magnetic regions in the sample. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
