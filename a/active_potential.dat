40|$|Abstract Background In {{health and}} place research, {{definitions}} of areas, area characteristics, and health outcomes should ideally be coherent with one another. Yet current approaches for delimiting areas mostly rely on spatial units "of convenience" such as census tracts. These areas may be homogeneous along socioeconomic conditions but heterogeneous along other environmental characteristics. This heterogeneity {{can lead to}} biased measurement of environment characteristics and misestimation of area effects on health. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the soundness of census tracts as units of analysis for measuring the <b>active</b> living <b>potential</b> of environments, hypothesised to be associated with walking. Results Starting with data at the smallest census area level available, zones homogeneous along three indicators of <b>active</b> living <b>potential,</b> i. e. population density, land use mix, and accessibility to services were designed. Delimitation of zones ensued from statistical clustering of the smallest areas into seven clusters or "types of environment". Mapping of clusters into a GIS led to the delineation of 898 zones characterised by one of seven types of environment, corresponding to different levels of <b>active</b> living <b>potential.</b> Homogeneity of census tracts along indicators of <b>active</b> living <b>potential</b> varied. A greater proportion (83 %) of variation in accessibility to services was attributable to differences between census tracts suggesting within-tract homogeneity along this variable. However, census tracts were heterogeneous with respect to population density and land use mix where a greater proportion of the variation was attributable to within-tract differences. About 55 % of tracts were characterised by a combination of three or more "types of environment" suggesting substantial within-tract heterogeneity in the <b>active</b> living <b>potential</b> of environments. Conclusion Soundness of census tracts for measuring <b>active</b> living <b>potential</b> may be limited. Measuring <b>active</b> living <b>potential</b> with error may lead to misestimation of associations with walking, therefore limiting the correctness of inference about area effects on walking. Future studies should aim to determine homogeneity of spatial units "of convenience" along environment characteristics of interest prior to examining their association with health. Further evidence is needed to assess the extent of this methodological issue with other indicators of environment context relevant to other health indicators. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{constitutive}} model for stochastically distributed fiber reinforced tissues, where the active {{behavior of the}} fibers depends on the relative orientation of the electric field. Unlike other popular approaches, based on numerical integration over the unit sphere, or {{on the use of}} second order structure tensors, for the passive behavior we adopt a second order approximation of the strain energy density of the distribution. The purely mechanical quantities result to be dependent on two (second and fourth order, respectively) averaged structure tensors. In line with the approximation used for the passive behavior, we model the active behavior accounting for the statistical fiber distribution. We extend the Helmholtz free energy density by introducing a directional <b>active</b> <b>potential,</b> dependent on a stochastic permittivity tensor associated to a particular direction, and approximate the total <b>active</b> <b>potential</b> through a second order Taylor expansion of the permittivity tensor. The approximation allows us to derive explicitly the active stress and the active constitutive tensors, which result to be dependent on the same two averaged structure tensors that characterize the passive response. Active anisotropy follows from the distribution of the fibers and inherits its stochastic parameters. Examples of passive and active behaviors predicted by the model in terms of response to biaxial testing are presented, and comparisons with passive experimental data are provided.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Motivational Interviewing (MI) can {{effectively}} stimulate motivation for health behavior change, but the active ingredients of MI {{are not well}} known. To help clinicians further stimulate motivation, {{they need to know}} the active ingredients of MI. A psychometrically sound instrument is required to identify those ingredients. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe and evaluate the capability of existing instruments to reliably measure one or more <b>potential</b> <b>active</b> ingredients in the MI process between clients and MI-therapists. METHODS: We systematically searched MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central, specialised websites and reference lists of selected articles. RESULTS: We found 406 papers, 60 papers were retrieved for further evaluation, based on prespecified criteria. Seventeen instruments that were specifically designed to measure MI or aspects of MI were identified. Fifteen papers met all inclusion criteria, and reported on seven instruments that assess <b>potential</b> <b>active</b> ingredients of the interactive MI process. The capability of these instruments to measure <b>potential</b> <b>active</b> ingredients in detail and as a part of the interactive MI process varies considerably.

40|$|During copper CMP, {{abrasives}} and asperities {{interact with}} the copper at the nano-scale, partially removing protective films. The local Cu oxidation rate increases, then decays with time as the protective film reforms. In order to estimate the copper removal rate and other Cu-CMP output parameters with a mechanistic model, the passivation kinetics of Cu, i. e. the decay of the oxidation current with time after an abrasive/copper interaction, are needed. For {{the first time in}} studying Cu-CMP, microelectrodes were used to reduce interference from capacitive charging, IR drops and low diffusion limited currents, problems typical with traditional macroelectrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to obtain the equivalent circuit elements associated with different electrochemical phenomena (capacitive, kinetics, diffusion etc.) at different polarization potentials. These circuit elements were used to interpret potential-step chronoamperometry results in inhibiting and passivating solutions, notably to distinguish between capacitive charging and Faradaic currents. Chronoamperometry of Cu in acidic aqueous glycine solution containing the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole (BTA) displayed a very consistent current decay behavior at all potentials, indicating that the rate of current decay was controlled by diffusion of BTA to the surface. In basic aqueous glycine solution, Cu (which undergoes passivation by a mechanism similar to that operating in weakly acidic hydrogen peroxide slurries) displayed similar chronoamperometric behavior for the first second or so at all anodic potentials. Thereafter, the current densities at <b>active</b> <b>potentials</b> settled to values around those expected from polarization curves, whereas the current densities at passive potentials continued to decline. Oxidized Cu species typically formed at ‘active’ potentials were found to cause significant current decay at <b>active</b> <b>potentials</b> and at passive potentials before more protective passive films form.
