40|$|The {{small fruit}} tortrix, Grapholita lobarzewskii (Nowicki) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae), {{is a serious}} problem in the organic apple or-chards of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region (northeastern Italy), {{particularly}} in hilly areas. Three trials on mating disruption of G. lobarzewskii were carried out in two organic apple orchards characterized respectively by very high and low population pressure of this carpophagous pest. Red Isomate-OFM (C-plus) ® dispensers, used for the control of the Oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta (Busck), were applied once a year at a rate of 600 dispensers/ha. The pheromone blend released from the dispensers has remarkable analogies with that of G. lobarzewskii. In plots where the dispensers were applied, the male catches in the pheromone traps were very low or null, indirectly confirming the mating reduction. A reduction of eggs laid on <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> was also observed. Mating disruption reduced significantly the percentage of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> attacked by the small fruit tortrix both in the apple orchard with very high population pressure and in the orchard with low population pressure. A not negligible proportion of infested fruit rotted and fell much earlier with respect to harvest time and it suggests partial weight compensation by undamaged <b>apple</b> <b>fruit.</b> In the orchard with a high population pressure, mating disruption was not able to reduce the percentage of attacked <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> to ac-ceptable levels. However, since alternative control methods against the small fruit tortrix are not currently available to organic agriculture, the mating disruption approach must be advised in all the apple-growing areas where this pest causes severe damage.

40|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> Argyresthia conjugella is a {{specialist}} seed predator of rowan Sorbus aucuparia. Large-scale synchronous fluctuation of seed production in rowan (i. e. named masting) drives the <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> to seek alternative host {{plants such as}} apple, during years when rowan berries are not available for oviposition. The role of plant volatile compounds in the attraction of gravid <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> females is studied in a laboratory wind tunnel. Volatiles from rowan branches with green berries stimulate female moths to fly upwind and to land at the odour source. By contrast, females are not attracted to rowan branches without green berries, {{and they are not}} attracted to apple, demonstrating that the chemical stimulus from rowan berries is required for attraction. Attraction to synthetic compounds identified from rowan, anethole and 2 -phenyl ethanol confirms the role of plant volatiles in host finding. These two compounds, however, show a discrepant behavioural effect in wind tunnel and field tests. Field traps baited with 2 -phenyl ethanol capture female moths but anethole does not produce significant captures. Wind tunnel tests produce the opposite results: moths fly upwind towards the anethole lure, whereas 2 -phenyl ethanol is not attractive at all. Wind tunnel attraction to 2 -phenyl ethanol is achieved by adding odour from a rowan branch without berries, which is not attractive on its own. This finding demonstrates that interaction with the background odour contributes to the behavioural effect of plant volatile stimuli in the field...|$|E
40|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Argyresthia conjugella Zell. (Lepidoptera: Argyresthiidae), is {{the most}} {{important}} pest of apples in Scandinavia. In years when its primary host, rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), has little or no berries for egglaying, female A. conjugella fly into apple orchards to lay their eggs. In some years the entire apple crop can be destroyed. Volatiles from apples and rowan have been collected and identified. In GC-EAD tests females have responded to several compounds found in both rowan and apple. Some of these compounds were used in field trapping tests during 2002, and a mixture of two compounds trapped significantly more females and males compared to control traps. However, field trapping results from 2003 indicate that the two-compound blend seem to trap insects too late in the season to prevent egglaying in apples. Several new compounds were also tested in 2003, and some of these gave promising results. The results will be discussed in relation to use attractive plant volatiles as a control method against A. conjugella females...|$|E
40|$|The <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> (Argyresthia conjugella (A. conjugella)) in Norway {{was first}} {{identified}} as a pest in apple production in 1899. We here report the first genetic analysis of A. conjugella using molecular markers. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was applied to 95 individuals from six different locations in {{the two most important}} apple-growing regions of Norway. Five AFLP primer combinations gave 410 clear polymorphic bands that distinguished all the individuals. Further genetic analysis using the Dice coefficient, Principal Coordinate analysis (PCO) and Bayesian analyses suggested clustering of the individuals into two main groups showing substantial genetic distance. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed greater variation among populations (77. 94 %) than within populations (22. 06 %) and significant and high FST values were determined between the two major regions (Distance = 230 km, FST = 0. 780). AFLP analysis revealed low to moderate genetic diversity in our population sample from Norway (Average: 0. 31 expected heterozygosity). The positive significant correlation between the geographic and the molecular data (r 2 = 0. 6700) indicate that genetic differences between the two major regions may be due to geographical barriers such as high mountain plateaus (Hardangervidda) in addition to isolation by distance (IBD) ...|$|E

The following conclusions could be obtained: first, the quantification model can satisfactorily describe the tendency of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> temperature distribution in the cooling process. Then there was obvious difference between <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> temperature and environment temperature. Compared to the change of environment temperature, a long hysteresis phenomenon happened to the temperature of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> body.

40|$|The {{demand of}} <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> has {{experienced}} a rapid increase in recent years. While several researches have been conducted in attempt to address the production inadequacies, very minimal has been done towards solving the consumption patterns/behaviour and related issues. This study therefore, analysed the socio-economic characters that determined <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> demand among consumers in Mubi Metropolis, Adamawa State, Nigeria, as an effort towards filling this gap. A total of 81 <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> consumers were selected randomly from road side apple stalls for the study. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaire and supplemented by oral interviews and group discussion. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis were used in realising the objectives. Results revealed that majority (56. 79 %) of the <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> buyers were males within an age range of 21 - 30 years (37. 04 %) and singles (41. 98 %). While a larger proportion (37. 04 %) were graduates, <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> buyers with household sizes of 1 - 5 members accounted for the majority (74. 07 %). On the occupation basis, civil servants were 43. 21 %, and mainly purchased their <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> from the road side stalls (55. 56 %). Analysis of multiple regression showed that the demand for <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> was largely determined by price of the crop (4. 2556) and income of buyers (4. 2142) of which both coefficients were significant at P< 0. 001. Consumption pattern revealed taste as the most (61. 73 %) preferential factor to demand of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits,</b> with evening period as the main (62. 97 %) time of eating the crop. Major constraints observed among the buyers were high price of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits,</b> poor quality of the crop and sizes of same, among others. It’s therefore, concluded that educated single male respondents were the majority of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> consumers in the study area, and the main determinants of demand among buyers were the price of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> and income of the respondents. Drawing from the findings, it’s recommended that {{both the public and}} private sectors should direct efforts toward providing <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> growers with adequate inputs so as to produce in glut in order to lower the prices.

40|$|In Norway, {{a web-based}} warning system called VIPS has been {{developed}} under a national government funded programme for reduced risk of pesticides used in agriculture. VIPS is a collaboration project between the Norwegian Crop Research Institute, Plant Protection Centre and the Norwegian Agricultural Extension Service. The aim of VIPS is to give open {{access to all the}} information needed for farmers to reduce their reliance on pesticides. VIPS calculates warnings for more than 70 weather stations for several pests and diseases in selected fruits, vegetables and cereals. Registered users may adjust the climatic data used in the models and register field observations to get private warnings and use the system to record farm-practices. VIPS is unique in several aspects: ��A general user-interface for all crops and all pests and diseases; the user gets a quick overview of which pests to look out for. ��Warnings are site specific and linked to an authorized weather station which supplies validated meteorological data. The extension service supplies the validated biological data necessary to run the models. ��The presentation is layered under the weather stations of each county. First level gives information of danger (red), possible danger (yellow) and no danger (green) for each model (past five days/coming five days). The next 3 levels give information of the specific model, historical data and exact values of the input parameters used in the models for the calculations.

We performed a comparative field trial to assess how anthropogenic factors, such as organic and conventional farming practices, influence the microbial community of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits.</b> <b>Apples</b> are an economically important crop in Switzerland. In 2004, we harvested <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> cv. Golden Delicious of five pairs of organic/ conventional farms at five different locations in Switzerland. We combined classical microbiological methods and genetic tools to characterize the cultivable and uncultivable microflora of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits.</b> Morphologically distinct mold and yeast colonies were recovered from <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> surface (epiphytes) or from underneath the skin (endophytes) and recorded on nutrient agar.

The effect of PRD and rootstock vigor on ‘Pink Lady’ <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> quality and aroma profile was studied using solid-phase micro-extraction in headspace and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: PRD irrigation generally did not affect quality attributes, whereas it influenced the aroma of the <b>apple</b> <b>fruit.</b> In particular, PRD improved the aroma of the fruit flesh, while it decreased the volatile fraction in the peel, where most of the compounds are concentrated. Taking into account the relative contribution of the flesh and peel (w/w) to the <b>apple</b> <b>fruit,</b> the volatile content of the entire fruit was increased by PRD irrigation in less vigorous trees on M. 9 rootstock, but reduced in more vigorous trees on MM. 106 rootstock.

SDH isomeric proteins of different pI values were detected in <b>apple</b> <b>fruit.</b> SDH isomers with pI values of 4. 2, 4. 8, 5. 5, and 6. 3 were found in seeds, and SDH isomers with pI values of 5. 5, 6. 3, 7. 3, and 8. 3 were found in cortex. The present work is the first to show that SDH is highly active in apple seed and that SDH genes are differentially expressed in seed and cortex during early development.

40|$|ABSTRACT — The granulovirus of {{codling moth}}, Cydia pomonella L., CpGV, is now com-mercialized for codling moth control in pome fruit in the USA and Canada. It is highly spe-cific for codling moth and related species. Comparative assays of CpGV against neonate larvae of another {{introduced}} tortricid pest, the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta Busck, revealed a 557 and 589 fold lower susceptibility of neonate larvae {{compared with the}} LC 50 and LC 95 values derived for C. pomonella. Since its introduction into North America, the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta Busck, has become a widely established pest of peach, nectarine, apricot, and apple (Rothschild and Vickers 1991). There is little information regarding naturally occurring disease of the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> {{with the exception of}} mi-crosporidia in adults (Simchuk and Komarova 1983) and Bacillus thuringiensis in larva...|$|R
