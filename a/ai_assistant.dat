40|$|The {{problem of}} optimal {{planning}} under uncertainty in collaborative multi-agent domains {{is known to}} be deeply intractable but still demands a solution. This thesis will explore principled approximation methods that yield tractable approaches to planning for <b>AI</b> <b>assistants,</b> which allow them to understand the intentions of humans and help them achieve their goals. <b>AI</b> <b>assistants</b> are ubiquitous in video games, mak- ing them attractive domains for applying these planning techniques. However, games are also challenging domains, typically having very large state spaces and long planning horizons. The approaches in this thesis will leverage recent advances in Monte-Carlo search, approximation of stochastic dynamics by deterministic dynamics, and hierarchical action representation, to handle domains that are too complex for existing state of the art planners. These planning techniques will be demonstrated across a range of video game domains...|$|R

As JorCorp expands, Lex Luthor is invited to work at the company, but comes to resent the perception that he will always be trapped in Jor-El's shadow, feeling that he is being dismissed as the only idea Jor-El has publically credited him with is an accidentally-created formula for hair restoration. To this end, Luthor manipulates Jor-El and Lara's younger son Bru-El- Bru-El and Valora lacking all of Kal-El's superhuman potential due to them having been born on Earth- into allowing Luthor to carry out various experiments that allow Bru-El to absorb and generate power from kryptonite, simultaneously working to upgrade B, Jor-El's <b>A.I.</b> <b>assistant,</b> so that B will act as his 'spy' onto Jor-El's activities by mapping his own brain engrams onto the A.I. He attempts to create a disaster that would threaten Earth's core so that he can save the world and prove himself Jor-El's superior, but his 'upgrade' to B causes the A.I. to sabotage the plan out of resentment at Luthor calling it a slave, but Kal-El- who has chosen to act as Superman in this world- convinces B to sacrifice himself to thwart Luthor's plan because otherwise he would just be remembered as Luthor's slave and accomplice.|$|E

5000|$|While foiling a robbery, a {{young girl}} is accidentally killed. As a result, Miguel nearly comes close to killing the {{criminal}} only stopping from two police officers' urging. This is the final straw for Miguel, who is now considering retirement. He is approached by Peter Parker, who rather than encouraging him to continue, offers Miguel a job at Parker Industries which Miguel accepts. With a new job, Miguel resolves to help improve the world without being Spider-Man again, feeling {{that there are more}} than enough spider-powered heroes to compensate for his 'absence'. However, his use of a time portal he built to investigate the future only continues to reveal a devastated 2099. When Loraine Monroe, the mother of his lover, Tempest, tells Miguel that she is killed as part of an unexplained terrorist attack, Miguel is compelled back into action to track down the man responsible - Doctor Chronos, the man who apparently taught robotics to Victor von Doom before his expulsion - using a new suit Peter created for him. During the subsequent fight, Chronos reveals that he is working for an organization known as [...] "The Fist", before he dies from his injuries. It is later revealed that Tempest's mother lied about her death, and she was really only in a coma. Meanwhile, Roberta Mendez - the Captain America of 2099 - is revealed to have been trapped in the past shortly after the bounty hunter Venture escapes into the present through Miguel's time portal. Despite Miguel and Roberta's best efforts, Venture is retrieved and recruited by the Fist, who claim that their goal is the destruction of the United States. Miguel eventually comes into conflict with the Inhuman Lash when a Parker Industries scientist named Rhonda Flemming is revealed to be an Inhuman when she undergoes accidental Terrigenesis. Upon hatching, Rhonda's judgement is clouded by her newfound power. After sending Lash back to where he came, she teleports herself and Spider-Man 2099 to the Statue of Liberty. Rechristening herself Glorianna, she resolves to become a god, in order to replace God, who she views as a failure. Spider-Man 2099 confronts Glorianna at St. Patrick's Cathedral, who accidentally impales her girlfriend Jasmine and disappears. Miguel later discovers about Tempest from Jasmine and encounters Man Mountain Marko, who was hired by Loraine to stand guard at her room. He manages to distract Marko long enough for Parker Industries to covertly relocate Tempest. Miguel then tracks down Marko and beats him to near-death while demanding to know where Loraine is. Upon arriving at her house, Spider-Man 2099 confronts Loraine where he discovers that she has powers. She then confesses to have killed her second husband, because he was stalking Tempest, and that she wanted Tempest away from Miguel for protection. Miguel then learns that the body of Doctor Chronos has been moved to Denver, Colorado, where he discovers that a scientist named Doctor Sonny Frisco is working on a time travel experiment using Glorianna as a guinea pig. When Venture discovers him, Spider-Man fights him until Glorianna sends him back to 2099. He's then captured by that era's Venom and Doctor Octopus. Miguel later wakes up in Alchemax, which is run by that era's Sinister Six. He's then freed by Kasey, who takes him to his brother Gabe, where he learns that The Fist is responsible for what happened in the future. It's also revealed that the Goblin is actually Father Jennifer D'Angelo, an undercover ally of Kasey. After receiving a message from the Sinister Six, Miguel has his <b>A.I.</b> <b>assistant</b> Lyla to get Roberta to his laboratory, while he and Kasey go to Alchemax to rescue Father Jennifer. Upon escaping, Spider-Man and Father Jennifer arrive at an area where the time door appears, but Jennifer gets killed by Doctor Octopus.|$|E
40|$|Fine-grained image {{labels are}} {{desirable}} for many computer vision applications, such as visual search or mobile <b>AI</b> <b>assistant.</b> These applications rely on image classification models {{that can produce}} hundreds of thousands (e. g. 100 K) of diversified fine-grained image labels on input images. However, training a network at this vocabulary scale is challenging, and suffers from intolerable large model size and slow training speed, which leads to unsatisfying classification performance. A straightforward solution would be training separate expert networks (specialists), with each specialist focusing on learning one specific vertical (e. g. cars, birds [...] .). However, deploying dozens of expert networks in a practical system would significantly increase system complexity and inference latency, and consumes large amounts of computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge Concentration method, which effectively transfers the knowledge from dozens of specialists (multiple teacher networks) into one single model (one student network) to classify 100 K object categories. There are three salient aspects in our method: (1) a multi-teacher single-student knowledge distillation framework; (2) a self-paced learning mechanism to allow the student to learn from different teachers at various paces; (3) structurally connected layers to expand the student network capacity with limited extra parameters. We validate our method on OpenImage and a newly collected dataset, Entity-Foto-Tree (EFT), with 100 K categories, and show that the proposed model performs significantly better than the baseline generalist model...|$|E

We use the principles of decision theory to model the general problem of intelligent assistance. We {{use a combination of}} hierarchical task models and probabilistic relational languages to specify prior knowledge of the computer assistant. The assistant exploits its prior knowledge to infer the user's goals and takes actions to assist the user. We evaluate the decision theoretic assistance model in three different domains including a real-world domain to demonstrate its generality. We show through experiments that both the hierarchical structure of the goals and the parameter sharing facilitated by relational models significantly improve the learning speed of the agent.
