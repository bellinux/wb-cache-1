5000|$|Jones {{obtained}} legislative <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> a state crime commission, {{which consisted}} of the governor, his executive counsel, and the state attorney general. With a $1 million appropriation, the agency was commissioned to pursue those who had stolen state funds or property. Jones suggested that up to $4 million might be recovered. In the state House, Representative James E. Bolin of Minden in Webster Parish sought to reduce the appropriation to $250,000. State Senator Lloyd Hendrick of Shreveport wanted to establish a legislative commission, rather than an executive body. Nevertheless, the measure easily passed both houses and was signed into law. A few lawmakers loyal to then former Governor Earl Long charged that the commission gave too much power to the governor and was [...] "tyrannical" [...] in nature. They sued in the 19th Judicial District Court, which subpoenaed Jones to testify. The governor refused to do so, having cited an executive privilege dating back to U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. The opponents pursued the challenge to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which declared the Jones commission unconstitutional.|$|R

The Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the ruling power in East Germany, viewed May as a writer whose supposedly positive portrayal of the colonization of the Old West by the United States ignored the uprooting and genocide of Native Americans while glorifying the White settlers, making him a promoter and a precursor of an expansionist ideology of [...] "blood and soil" [...] and [...] in the words of Klaus Mann [...] the [...] "Cowboy mentor of the Führer".|$|R

According to a local ordinance regarding the protection of interests relating to minority group villages, a meeting is held where 30% of participants belong to a minority group; if the local government approves of the formation <b>of</b> the new <b>establishment,</b> the region is designated an ethnic village. In Hubei province, villages where minorities account for 50% of the population are designated as minority group villages.|$|R
