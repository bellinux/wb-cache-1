40|$|Abstract—The {{estimation}} and {{the compensation}} of particular <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortions,</b> typically affecting the consumer-grade receivers in broadband satellite communications, are considered. The distortion filter is modeled as a linear {{function of the}} frequency with unknown slope. We present a novel slope estimator, analytically derived by exploiting the spectral properties of the distorted signal, which results to be unbiased and does not exhibit false locks in the scenarios of practical interest. Since an ideal slope compensator would require an unmanageable filtering, we focus on a low-complexity compensation filter that ensures nearly the same performance. Extensive simulation results prove the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed solution, which can also work blindly at very low values of the signal-to-noise ratio.

The level at which harmonic distortion becomes audible depends on the exact nature of the distortion. Different types of distortion (like crossover distortion) are more audible than others (like soft clipping) even if the THD measurements are identical. Harmonic distortion in radio frequency applications is rarely expressed as THD.|$|E

40|$|A {{new design}} for a {{recursive}} DFT analysis-synthesis filter-bank (AS FB) with critical subsampling and near-perfect reconstruction is proposed. The analysis filter-bank consists of allpass polyphase filters to achieve a high frequency selectivity with a low algorith-mic complexity and low signal delay. The condition for perfect reconstruction (PR) leads to either unstable or anti-causal synthesis filters. This problem is solved by stable allpass polyphase synthesis filters which are designed by analytical closed-form expressions. The first design can achieve arbitrarily small aliasing, <b>amplitude</b> and phase <b>distortions</b> in dependence of the tolerable signal delay and algorithmic complexity. The second design avoids aliasing and <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortions</b> and minimizes the phase distortions {{at the expense of}} an increased system delay.

40|$|Nonlinearities of the {{peripheral}} auditory system generate distortion products which {{present to the}} central auditory system as apparent acoustic stimuli. The frequency and <b>amplitude</b> of <b>distortion</b> products reflect the frequency, phase and amplitude relationship {{of the components of}} a complex stimulus. When the stimulus consists of harmonically-related primaries, the amplitudes of the major distortion products are a function of the relative phase of the presented (primary) tones. We have previously shown (McAnally and Calford, 1990) that the variation of <b>amplitude</b> of the <b>distortion</b> {{as a function of the}} relative phase of a pair of harmonically-related primaries is well modelled as a function of the interaction of the multiple modes of distortion which fall at the same frequency (e. g. difference frequency and cubic difference frequency). A possibility raised by this result is that coherence of frequency modulation (that which maintains harmonicity) could be encoded in the <b>amplitude</b> of <b>distortion.</b> This was examined in measurements of both the cochlear microphonic potential (CM) and the responses of auditory nerve fibres in anaesthetized cats. Very small deviations from coherence of frequency modulation produced changes in the amplitude of the CM potential at the frequency of distortion. Also the discharges of auditory nerve fibres tuned to the frequency of distortion were found to be modulated at the same frequency as the amplitude changes observed in the CM. There was no variation in <b>distortion</b> <b>amplitude</b> in the CM and no modulation of auditory nerve discharges when primaries were frequency modulated coherently. It is suggested that <b>amplitude</b> modulation of <b>distortion</b> gives the auditory system its demonstrated sensitivity to minor departures from coherence of frequency-modulated, harmonically-related tones...|$|R

The filter banks are obtained by cosine modulation in this paper, and the prototype filters are interpolated and filtered before modulation. To make sure the significant aliasing distortions are cancelled completely, all prototype filters are designed with consistent transition band performance, using the optimization algorithm.
