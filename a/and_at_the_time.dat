Methods: this cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} Neurosurgery department, BSMMU to observe effect of hematoma and perihematomal edema volume on GCS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of admission in patients with spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia hemorrhage. The duration of study period was from November 2005 to April 2007. Results: a total 48 patients were included in the study and the variables that were analyzed included site of hematoma, volume of hematoma, perihematomal edema and the initial GCS score.
