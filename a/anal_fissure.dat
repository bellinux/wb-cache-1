25|$|Anal sex can {{exacerbate}} hemorrhoids {{and therefore}} result in bleeding; in other cases, {{the formation of}} a hemorrhoid is attributed to anal sex. If bleeding occurs as a result of anal sex, it may also be because of a tear in the anal or rectal tissues (an <b>anal</b> <b>fissure)</b> or perforation (a hole) in the colon, the latter of which being a serious medical issue that should be remedied by immediate medical attention. Because of the rectum's lack of elasticity, the anal mucous membrane being thin, and small blood vessels being present directly beneath the mucous membrane, tiny tears and bleeding in the rectum usually result from penetrative anal sex, though the bleeding is usually minor and therefore usually not visible. By contrast to other anal sexual behaviors, anal fisting poses a more serious danger of damage due to the deliberate stretching of the anal and rectal tissues; anal fisting injuries include anal sphincter lacerations and rectal and sigmoid colon (rectosigmoid) perforation, which might result in death.|$|E

2500|$|An <b>anal</b> <b>fissure,</b> fissure in Ano or rectal fissure is a {{break or}} tear {{in the skin}} of the anal canal. Anal {{fissures}} may be noticed by bright red anal bleeding on toilet paper and undergarments, or sometimes in the toilet. [...] If acute they may cause pain after defecation, but with chronic fissures, pain intensity is often less. Anal fissures usually extend from the anal opening and are usually located posteriorly in the midline, probably because of the relatively unsupported nature and poor perfusion of the anal wall in that location. Fissure depth may be superficial or sometimes down to the underlying sphincter muscle.|$|E

40|$|Anorectal {{disorders}} like haemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, <b>anal</b> <b>fissures,</b> peri-anal fistulae {{and sexually}} transmitted diseases are bothersome benign conditions that warrant special attention. They, however, can all be diagnosed by inspection or proctoscopy (sexually transmitted proctitis). Constipation can play an underlying role in haemorrhoids, rectal prolapse and <b>anal</b> <b>fissures,</b> {{and it is important}} to treat these conditions in order to avoid recurrences. Haemorrhoids and <b>anal</b> <b>fissures</b> are generally treated conservatively and surgery is seldom required. Rectal prolapse and cryptoglandular peri-anal fistulae are treated surgically. In a recurrent peri-anal fistula, the fistular tract needs to be visualised with anal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There are different techniques available for this evaluation, and care must be taken not to damage the anal sphincter. Peri-anal fistulae in Crohn's disease are treated conservatively and surgery is only required in cases with abscesses. Sexually transmitted proctitis needs to be adequately recognised and treated according to the infectious agent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

In older adults, <b>anal</b> <b>fissures</b> may be caused by decreased blood flow to the area. When fissures are found laterally, tuberculosis, occult abscesses, leukemic infiltrates, carcinoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or inflammatory bowel disease should be considered as causes. Some sexually transmitted infections can promote the breakdown of tissue resulting in a fissure. Examples of sexually transmitted infections that may affect the anorectal area are syphilis, herpes, chlamydia and human papilloma virus.|$|R
