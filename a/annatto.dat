5|$|The highly {{specialised}} Manche production {{methods for}} <b>annatto,</b> cacao and vanilla were {{adopted by the}} incoming Q'eqchi' and are still applied on a small scale. Among the modern-day Q'eqchi', a tradition still exists that these orchards belong to their ancestors, the ch'olcuink spirits, who lack salt and swap cacao for it.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol {{lacked a}} complex {{political}} organisation, and possessed no large towns within their territory. Their largest settlement was Manche itself, with about one hundred multi-family houses. Manche {{was also the}} name of the principal lineage at Manche and this lineage was the origin of the populations of the other Manche Ch'ol towns. Nito was another principal settlement, and an important port for maritime trade that maintained strong links with places as far away as the province of Acalan in what is now southern Campeche in Mexico. Otherwise, the Manche Ch'ol lived in generally small settlements governed by one or more chieftains; they were less politically complex than their Lakandon and Itza neighbours, and were not ruled by a principal king or chieftain. They grew relatively little maize, rather concentrating their agricultural production upon the prestige crops of cacao, <b>annatto</b> and vanilla. All the main settlements, both on the coast and inland, were noted for their prodigious cacao and <b>annatto</b> plantations.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main trade routes {{used by the}} Manche Ch'ol; the first went north along the Mopan River to Chacchilan, then {{overland}} to Nojpetén. The second followed the Cancuén River to Yol, and there joined the Pasión River northwards, leaving the river when it turned west and continuing overland to Nojpetén. Xocmo, on the Sacapulas River, was a trading port where the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ols met to trade cacao and <b>annatto.</b> Xocmo had a major fair, still taking place as late as 1676, where traders arrived from various colonial and independent settlements; these included Nojpetén and the towns of Cobán, San Agustín Lanquín and Sacapulas in colonial Verapaz. The Chols traded cacao and <b>annatto</b> into the encomienda towns of Verapaz in exchange for metal tools (particularly axes and machetes) and salt. Other products traded to the Manche by the Q'eqchi' of colonial Verapaz included cotton textiles and quetzal feathers. The Q'eqchi' used this trade to supply products demanded by their Spanish overlords under the repartimiento system. The Manche produced a number of products for trade, manufactured from resources in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize; these included blowguns, bows and arrows, finely sculpted greenstone axes, hammocks, manos and metates, pottery, and cane, {{all of which were}} traded across the southern Maya region.|$|E
5|$|Trade routes {{not only}} {{supplied}} physical goods, they facilitated {{the movement of}} people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Shifts in trade routes occurred with {{the rise and fall}} of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period Manche Ch'ol traded the prestige crops of cacao, <b>annatto</b> and vanilla into colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{integrated}} into a regional trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved the exchange of Manche produce such as cacao, <b>annatto</b> and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch'ol remained subservient to them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cobán and Cahabón).|$|E
25|$|Cheddar {{can be a}} deep to {{pale yellow}} (off-white) colour, or a yellow-orange colour when certain plant {{extracts}} are added. One commonly used spice is <b>annatto,</b> extracted from seeds of the tropical achiote tree. Originally added to simulate the colour of high-quality milk from grass-fed Jersey and Guernsey cows, <b>annatto</b> may also impart a sweet, nutty flavour. The largest producer of Cheddar cheese in the United States, Kraft, uses a combination of <b>annatto</b> and oleoresin paprika, an extract of the lipophilic (oily) portion of paprika.|$|E
25|$|Cheddar {{cheese is}} a {{relatively}} hard, off-white (or orange if spices such as <b>annatto</b> are added), sometimes sharp-tasting (i.e., bitter), natural cheese. Originating in the English village of Cheddar in Somerset, cheeses of this style are produced beyond this region and in several countries around the world.|$|E
25|$|Many {{indigenous}} peoples of Central and South America paint Jagua Tattoos, or designs with Genipa americana juice on their bodies. Indigenous peoples of South America traditionally use <b>annatto,</b> huito, or wet charcoal to decorate {{their faces and}} bodies. Huito is semi-permanent, and it generally takes weeks for this black dye to fade.|$|E
25|$|The {{agricultural}} products are mainly bananas, allspice/pimento, sugar, coconuts, coffee, limes, corn, ginger, sweet potatoes, sensimilia yam, and <b>annatto.</b> The soil is also suitable for citrus and, sisal is cultivated in the drier areas. The parish is also noted for cattle rearing, horses and hogs (swine). Recently, however, agriculture {{has been on}} the decline as farmland is being used for housing and other developments and the cultivated area has decreased.|$|E

She was homeward-bound from Vera Cruz (Mexico) with a cargo of cocoa, cochineal and sugar, and more importantly, specie worth 1,385,292 Spanish dollars (£312,000). The vessel that Triton, Alcmene and Naiad captured was the Santa Brigada, under the command of Captain Don Antonio Pillon. She was carrying drugs, <b>annatto,</b> cochineal, indigo, sugar and some 1,500,000 dollars. Prize money was paid on 14 January 1800.|$|E
25|$|Butter is a water-in-oil {{emulsion}} resulting from an inversion of the cream; in a {{water-in-oil emulsion}}, the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32–35°C (90–95°F). The density of butter is 911g/L (0.950 lb per US pint). It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its unmodified color {{is dependent on}} the animals' feed and genetics but is commonly manipulated with food colorings in the commercial manufacturing process, most commonly <b>annatto</b> or carotene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{state of}} Wisconsin {{produces}} the most Cheddar cheese in the US; other centers of production include: California, Idaho, upstate New York, Vermont, Oregon, Texas, and Oklahoma. It {{is sold in}} several varieties (mild, medium, sharp, extra-sharp, New York-style, white-, and Vermont). New York-style Cheddar is particularly [...] "sharp"/acidic, but tends to be somewhat softer than the milder-tasting varieties. Cheddar that does not contain <b>annatto</b> is frequently labelled [...] "white Cheddar" [...] or [...] "Vermont Cheddar" [...] (regardless of whether it was actually produced there). Vermont's three creameries produce what is regarded as first-class Cheddar cheeses: the Cabot Creamery, which produces the 16-month-old [...] "Private Stock Cheddar", the Grafton Village Cheese Company, and Shelburne Farms.|$|E
2500|$|Saffron's aroma {{is often}} {{described}} by connoisseurs as reminiscent of metallic honey with grassy or hay-like notes, while its taste has also been noted as hay-like and sweet. Saffron also contributes a luminous yellow-orange colouring to foods. Saffron is widely used in Persian, Indian, European, and Arab cuisines. Confectioneries and liquors also often include saffron. Saffron is used in dishes ranging from the jewelled rice and khoresh of Iran, [...] the Milanese risotto of Italy, the paella of Spain, the bouillabaisse of France, to the biryani with various meat accompaniments in South Asia. One of the most esteemed use for saffron is {{in the preparation of}} the Golden Ham, a precious dry-cured ham made with saffron from San Gimignano. Common saffron substitutes include safflower (Carthamus tinctorius, which is often sold as [...] "Portuguese saffron" [...] or [...] "açafrão"), <b>annatto,</b> and turmeric (Curcuma longa).|$|E

6000|$|Mend or end? As it stands, {{the thing}} is a not-even-picturesque mediæval relic. If we English were logical, we would arrange that any man who owned so many {{thousand}} acres of land, or brewed so many million bottles of beer per annum, should ipso facto be elevated to the peerage. Why should not gallons of gin confer an earldom direct, and Brighton A's be equivalent to a marquisate? Why not allow the equal claim of screws and pills with coal and iron? Why disregard the native worth of <b>annatto</b> and nitrates? Baron Beecham or Lord Sunlight is a first-rate name. As it is, we make petty and puerile distinctions. Beer is in, but whiskey is out; and even in beer itself, if I recollect aright, Dublin stout wore a coronet for some months or years before English pale ale attained the dignity of a barony. No Minister has yet made chocolate a viscount. At present, banks and minerals go in as of right, while soap is {{left out in the}} cold, and even cotton languishes. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer put up titles to auction, while abolishing the legislative function of the Lords, there would be millions in it. But as we English are not logical, our mending would probably resolve itself into fatuous tinkering. We might get rid of the sons, but leave the fathers. We might flood the Lords with life peers, but leave the veto. Such tactics are too Britannic. [...] "Stone dead hath no fellow!" ...|$|E
60|$|Besides {{its main}} {{use as an}} article of food, the banana serves {{incidentally}} to supply a valuable fibre, obtained from the stem, and employed for weaving into textile fabrics and making paper. Several kinds of the plantain tribe are cultivated for this purpose exclusively, the best known among them being the so-called manilla hemp, a plant largely grown in the Philippine Islands. Many of the finest Indian shawls are woven from banana stems, {{and much of the}} rope that we use in our houses comes from the same singular origin. I know nothing more strikingly illustrative of the extreme complexity of our modern civilisation than {{the way in which we}} thus every day employ articles of exotic manufacture in our ordinary life without ever for a moment suspecting or inquiring into their true nature. What lady knows when she puts on her delicate wrapper, from Liberty's or from Swan and Edgar's, that the material from which it is woven is a Malayan plantain stalk? Who ever thinks that the glycerine for our chapped hands comes from Travancore coco-nuts, and that the pure butter supplied us from the farm in the country is coloured yellow with Jamaican <b>annatto?</b> We break a tooth, as Mr. Herbert Spencer has pointed out, because the grape-curers of Zante are not careful enough about excluding small stones from their stock of currants; and we suffer from indigestion because the Cape wine-grower has doctored his light Burgundies with Brazilian logwood and white rum, to make them taste like Portuguese port. Take merely this very question of dessert, and how intensely complicated it really is. The West Indian bananas keep company with sweet St. Michaels from the Azores, and with Spanish cobnuts from Barcelona. Dried fruits from Metz, figs from Smyrna, and dates from Tunis lie side by side on our table with Brazil nuts and guava jelly and damson cheese and almonds and raisins. We forget where everything comes from nowadays, in our general consciousness that they all come from the Queen Victoria Street Stores, and any real knowledge of common objects is rendered every day more and more impossible by the bewildering complexity and variety, every day increasing, of the common objects themselves, their substitutes, adulterates, and spurious imitations. Why, you probably never heard of manilla hemp before, until this very minute, and yet you have been familiarly using it all your lifetime, while 400,000 hundredweights of that useful article are annually imported into this country alone. It is an interesting study to take any day a list of market quotations, and ask oneself about every material quoted, what it is and what they do with it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Annatto</b> {{has been}} a {{traditional}} colorant for Gloucester cheese since the 16th century. During the summer, {{the high levels of}} carotene in the grass would have given the milk an orange tint which was carried through into the cheese. This orange hue came to be regarded as an indicator of the best cheese, spurring producers of inferior cheese to use <b>annatto</b> in order to replicate it. The custom of adding <b>annatto</b> then spread {{to other parts of the}} UK, for cheeses such as Chesire and Red Leicester, as well as colored cheddar made in Scotland. Many cheddars are produced in both white and red (orange) varieties, with the latter being more popular despite the only difference between the two being the presence of <b>annatto</b> as a coloring. That practice has extended to many modern processed cheese products, such as American cheese and Velveeta.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Annatto</b> and its {{extracts}} are {{now widely}} used in an artisanal or industrial scale as a coloring agent in many processed food products, such as cheeses, dairy spreads, butter and margarine, custards, cakes and other baked goods, potatoes, snack foods, breakfast cereals, smoked fish, sausages, and more.
