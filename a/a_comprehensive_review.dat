5|$|Many sunscreens use {{nanoparticles}} of {{zinc oxide}} (along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore {{do not appear}} white. There has been concern {{that they might be}} absorbed into the skin. A study published in 2010 found a 0.23% to 1.31% (mean 0.42%) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> of the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E
5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There {{is a great deal}} of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E

25|$|Extinction {{was caused}} by {{persecution}} (mainly for specimens), land use changes, {{and the introduction of}} predators such as cats and stoats. It was generally accepted until the late 20th century that the species' disappearance was due to competition by introduced predators for the kiore, or Pacific rat, a favorite prey of the laughing owl (an idea originally advanced by Walter Buller). However, since the kiore is itself an introduced animal, the laughing owl originally preyed on small birds, reptiles and bats, and later probably utilized introduced mice as well. Direct predation on this unwary and gentle-natured bird seems much more likely to have caused the species' extinction. <b>A</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> of the species' decline and disappearance is presented by Williams & Harrison (1972).|$|E

Following a meeting between the Independent Education Union and Newington College, Scott agreed to not declare senior staff positions vacant and the school continued to negotiate collective arrangements covering salary and working conditions for staff.|$|E
25|$|General Victor-Constant Michel, Vice-President of the Conseil supérieur de la guerre in 1910, {{was more}} {{convinced}} than Lacrois of a German move through Belgium, {{because of the}} obstacle of French defences in Lorraine, the terrain in eastern Belgium and German railway building. Michel thought that the Germans would make their main effort in central Belgium and that covering a longer front would need the organisation of French reserve units and integration with the active army. The council rejected his view in 1911, which caused Michel to resign as he considered that deployment from Belfort to Mézières and an offensive towards Antwerp, Brussels and Namur as the only possible way to respond. Joseph Joffre was eventually appointed and the functions of Vice-President of the Council and Chief of Staff of the army were combined.
