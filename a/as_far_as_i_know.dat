25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E

It contains elements of pop and country music. Spence D. of the website IGN felt that Shakira adopted an [...] "almost modern day country-styled pop aesthetic".

AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the lyrics [...] "You said you would love me until you died/And <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you're still alive" [...] were similar to Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] (1995).|$|E

However, in 2002 editor Simon Wright {{resigned}} as {{he believed that}} the managing director of The Automobile Association intervened to prevent Pétrus from receiving a fifth rosette at the recommendation of the AA's inspectors.

This was followed by the resignation of inspector Sarah Peart over the same issue. The AA eventually relented and awarded Pétrus five rosettes. Wareing said of the issue at the time, [...] "I'm delighted to get the fifth rosette, it's a great achievement. Every AA inspector believed we deserved five rosettes, it was only the guy at the top, Roger Wood, who didn't. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> he still has not eaten at Pétrus and I would not welcome him here now." ...|$|E

He told his publisher, [...] "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to Asa Gray he said, [...] "I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists." [...] Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: [...] "next to the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." [...] However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, [...] "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> has cared for it." [...] The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, when MTV News first {{announced}} that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms, the writer told them in {{interview that he}} had begun looking ahead {{to the possibility of}} a film adaptation, and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz [...] "would be a great idea". Two months prior to the book's release, Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was [...] "early days" [...] in thinking about a potential film adaptation; McCarthy felt, however, that the novel would adapt well. Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero, prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox. Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay. In July 2010 however, the author clarified to California Chronicle, saying [...] "There's no deal, there's no one attached. There's been some vague talk among the cast members... <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> right now nothing's happening." [...] Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved, the film would move straight into production. However, remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through, he admits [...] "I've learned to be cautious about saying oh they'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive, David Lynch kind of movie, but I could be totally wrong about that. I don't know." ...|$|E

Perry states the fact without comment, although many readers, having heard the stories of friction between Catholics and Mason in Australian cricket in the 1930s and 1940s, are sure to wonder if it was a factor in the lifelong personal rift between Bradman and his Catholic team-mates, Bill O’Reilly and Jack Fingleton.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2005, Vincenzo Paglia, the Vatican {{official}} {{in charge of}} the process, announced that Romero's cause had cleared a theological audit by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, at the time headed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later elected Pope Benedict XVI) and that beatification could follow within six months. Pope John Paul II died within weeks of those remarks. Predictably, the transition of the new pontiff slowed down the work of canonizations and beatifications. Pope Benedict instituted changes that had the overall effect of reining in the Vatican's so-called [...] "factory of saints." [...] In an October 2005 interview, Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, was asked if Paglia's predictions of a clearance for Romero's beatification remained on track.

2500|$|Because Voris is {{the owner}} of St. Michael's Media, and had {{contracted}} with Marc Brammer's RealCatholicTV run from South Bend, Indiana (which is under the authority of Bishop Kevin Rhoades), a question of jurisdiction under canon law arose. Brammer noted he had received a letter from the Archdiocese of Detroit acknowledging him as the owner of the website and its name. He responded to the letter by requesting a meeting but got no response. Brammer personally met with Bishop Rhoades, who reassured him that he had no problem with the name RealCatholicTV.com. Voris held that he had made seven attempts to set up a meeting with the archbishop on the matter and had been rebuffed or ignored on each occasion. When asked by reporters if the diocese Marc Brammer lives in had any problems with RealCatholicTV, Fr. Mark Gurtner, judicial vicar of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend in Indiana, responded, [...] "No, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> there is nothing." [...] Gurtner went on, stating that speaking as a canon lawyer (and not speaking on behalf of the diocese) it was his opinion that as the owner of the website lived in Indiana, they had jurisdiction over the matter rather than Detroit. In response, the Archdiocese of Detroit cited its own canon lawyer, Ed Peters (a professor at the local Sacred Heart Major Seminary), who maintained that Detroit was on [...] "firm ground" [...] in its actions concerning Voris.|$|E
