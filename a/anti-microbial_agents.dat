40|$|Periodontitis is an {{infectious}} disease with marked inflammatory response, leading to destruction of underlying tissues. The aim of periodontal therapy is {{to eradicate the}} pathogens associated with the disease and attain periodontal health. This is achieved by non-surgical and surgical therapy; however, mechanical debridement and topical application of antiseptics may not be helpful in all cases. In such cases, adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy remains the treatment of choice. It can reach micro-organisms {{at the base of}} the deep periodontal pockets and furcation areas via serum, and also affect organisms residing within gingival epithelium and connective tissue. Before advising any <b>anti-microbial</b> <b>agent,</b> it is necessary to have knowledge of that agent. The aim of this review article is to provide basic details of each systemic <b>anti-microbial</b> <b>agent</b> used in periodontal therapy. The points discussed are its mode of action, susceptible periodontal pathogens, dosage, its use in treatment of periodontal disease, and mechanism of bacterial resistance to each <b>anti-microbial</b> <b>agent.</b> It might be of some help while prescribing these drugs...|$|R

50|$|Some birds select nesting {{material}} rich in <b>anti-microbial</b> <b>agents</b> that may protect {{themselves and their}} young from harmful infestations or infections.

House sparrows (Passer domesticus) have been observed to line their nests with materials from the neem tree (Azadirachta indica) but change to quinine-rich leaves of the Krishnachua tree (Caesalpinia pulcherrima) during an outbreak of malaria; quinine controls the symptoms of malaria.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Sodium {{hypochlorite}} (NaOCl) {{has long}} been the most preferred root canal irrigant in endodontic treatment, but besides being an effective <b>anti-microbial</b> <b>agent,</b> it is highly cytotoxic. Thus, a search for an alternative herbal irrigant which would be more biocompatible but equally effective led to this study. Aim: To assess the anti-microbial efficacy of garlic extract (GE) against Enterococcus faecalis biofilm and its ability to penetrate into root dentin. Materials and Methods: E. faecalis was cultured and treated with the test agents - normal saline, 5. 25 % of NaOCl, and the three different concentrations of GE (10 %, 40 %, and 70 %). The experiment was done in four groups namely, 24 -h Co-treatment group, 24 -h biofilm treatment group, 1 -week biofilm group, and 3 -week biofilm group. These groups were subjected to microbial viability assay and fluorescence microscopic analysis. The most effective concentration of garlic (70 %) was further tested and compared with 5. 25 % NaOCl for its dentin penetration property using 0. 2 % alizarin red under a fluorescence microscope. Results: The findings revealed that GE was able to disrupt as well as prevent the formation of biofilm produced by E. faecalis. All the concentrations of GE displayed considerable anti-microbial efficacy where 70 % concentration was most effective and exhibited similar anti-microbial efficacy as 5. 25 % NaOCl. In terms of dentin penetration, no significant difference was found between GE and NaOCl. Conclusion: The results indicate that GE has a potential to serve as an alternative herbal root canal irrigant being an effective and biocompatible <b>anti-microbial</b> <b>agent</b> with good dentinal penetration property...|$|R
