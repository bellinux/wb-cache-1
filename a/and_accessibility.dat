5|$|Carol {{had been}} in {{development}} since 1997, when Nagy wrote {{the first draft of}} the screenplay. British company Film4 Productions and its then-chief executive Tessa Ross financed development. The film had a troubled development period, facing problems with financing, rights, scheduling conflicts, <b>and</b> <b>accessibility.</b> Number 9 Films came on board as a producer in 2011, when co-founder Elizabeth Karlsen secured the rights to the novel. The film is co-produced by New York-based Killer Films, which joined the project when co-founder and Haynes's collaborator Christine Vachon approached Haynes to direct in 2013. Principal photography began in March 2014, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lasted 34 days. Cinematographer Edward Lachman shot Carol on Super 16 mm film.|$|E
5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} <b>and</b> <b>accessibility</b> of essential {{information in the}} genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} decade of the 19th century, {{minerals}} such as gold were mined with limited success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed in many areas of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads <b>and</b> <b>accessibility</b> to the region.|$|E

Objective: To examine child and parent perceptions of child proxy agency, home physical activity opportunity, <b>and</b> home <b>accessibility</b> of fruits <b>and</b> vegetables. Methods: Dyads (N = 117) of parents and children completed questionnaires for this cross-sectional study. Results: For child proxy agency, fruits <b>and</b> vegetables <b>accessibility,</b> <b>and</b> physical activity opportunity, the parent and child perceptions were significantly related. Parent ratings of physical activity opportunity and child proxy agency were significantly greater than child ratings. Perceptions of both parents and children for proxy agency were associated with fruits <b>and</b> vegetables <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> physical activity opportunity. Conclusions: Parents and children hold similar, yet distinct perceptions of physical activity opportunity and child proxy agency. Perceptions of child proxy agency are associated with obesity-related home environmental characteristics...|$|R

Multiple reviewers cited the Titan's feeling of grandiosity in the player experience—specifically, the thrill of watching a summoned Titan fall from the sky, but also the feeling of entering the Titan exoskeleton and of scaling a Titan to take it down.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} not fully {{investigated}} {{the role of}} source accessibility versus source quality {{in the selection of}} information sources. It remains unclear what their (relative) importance is. Three different models have been identified: (a) an exclusively accessibility-driven model, (b) a cost-benefit model in which both <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> quality are significant influences, and (c) an exclusively quality-driven model. Moreover, the conditions under which <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> quality are important are not well understood. The goal of our study is to shed more light on both issues by assessing the role of different dimensions of <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> quality and how their importance is affected by time pressure. We conducted a policy-capturing study in which 89 financial specialists participated. Each judged 20 scenarios in which the <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> quality of human information sources, as well as time pressure, were manipulated. Results showed that both <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> quality affect the likelihood of asking a human information source for information. Moreover, although the weights attached to physical <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> the source's perceived technical quality were indeed moderated by time pressure, in both conditions we find support for a cost-benefit model of information seeking, in which both <b>accessibility</b> <b>and</b> quality are significant influences...|$|R
