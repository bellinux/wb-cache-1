5|$|A {{trap crop}} is <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> {{a plant that}} attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|Former player Terry Neill succeeded Mee in 1976. At {{the age of}} 34, {{he became}} the {{youngest}} Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings, and <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (1978, 1979 and 1980), and lost the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final on penalties. The club's only trophy during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final, widely regarded as a classic.|$|E
5|$|John Slade was a grain merchant, {{who claimed}} that Humphrey Morley had agreed to buy <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> wheat and rye from him, paying £16, and had reneged on the agreement. He brought the case before the Assizes in 1596, where it was heard by two judges; one of the Common Pleas, {{and one of the}} King's Bench. It was heard under assumpsit, and the jury found that Morley indeed owed Slade money. Before a {{judgment}} could be issued, Popham had the case transferred to an older version of the Court of Exchequer Chamber, which, sitting in Serjeant's Inn, allowed the King's Bench judges to sit.|$|E

5|$|In North America, California is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of Sauvignon blanc with plantings also found in Washington state and on the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. Sauvignon Blanc is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the Sauvignon blanc grape {{is also known as}} Fumé Blanc. This California wine was first made by Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> particularly good Sauvignon blanc grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fumé Blanc as an allusion to the French Pouilly-Fumé. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked Sauvignon blanc wines have been marketed under the name Fumé Blanc. California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced Sauvignon blanc have more tropical fruit undertones with citrus and passion fruit notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fumé Blanc are more round with melon notes.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> seeds after the local rainy season {{and at this}} time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with {{a few pieces of}} dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E
25|$|The {{music scene}} is {{thriving}} and significant. In 2010, PRS for Music announced that Bristol is the 'most musical' {{city in the}} UK, {{based on the number}} of PRS members born in Bristol relative to its population. From the late 1970s onwards it was home to <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> cultish bands combining punk, funk, dub and political consciousness, including The Pop Group, close friends of The Cortinas, who led the City's punk scene from 1976. Bristol's premier fanzine from this time through until early 1978 was Loaded. It featured all of the Bristol bands as well as those who visited the city, some of whom were promoted by the magazine.|$|E

25|$|When {{the queen}} has {{completed}} her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> virgin queens which {{will leave the}} nest, mate, hibernate and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when cannibalism occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry {{them out of the}} nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.|$|E
25|$|Common {{ostriches}} {{have been}} farmed in South Africa {{since the beginning}} of the 19th century. According to Frank G. Carpenter, the English are credited with first taming common ostriches outside Cape Town. Farmers captured baby common ostriches and raised them successfully on their property, and were able to obtain <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> feathers every seven to eight months instead of killing wild common ostriches for their feathers. It is claimed that common ostriches produce the strongest commercial leather. Common ostrich meat tastes similar to lean beef and is low in fat and cholesterol, as well as high in calcium, protein and iron. Uncooked, it is dark red or cherry red, a little darker than beef. Ostrich stew is a dish prepared using common ostrich meat.|$|E
25|$|Revie {{immediately}} made {{radical changes}} to the club; adopting the all white colours of Real Madrid, and concentrating the club policy on scouting and developing youth talent, rather than just trying to buy players. He appointed experienced coaches like Les Cocker, Maurice Lindley and Syd Owen, and implemented radical techniques like forming a family atmosphere around the club. Revie took on more revolutionary techniques, his pre-match preparation was meticulous for its day, his staff prepared highly detailed dossiers on the opposition before every match and pioneered a highly detailed approach to the way opposing teams could be analysed. Coaches like Les Cocker were also responsible for developing high fitness levels in the Leeds players, using diets and rigorous, military style training programs. Revie forged a completely new team around <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> outstanding youth talents, including Norman Hunter, Paul Reaney, Peter Lorimer, Eddie Gray, Billy Bremner, Paul Madeley, Albert Johanneson and these were backed up by more experienced heads Jack Charlton, and veteran Scottish international central midfielder Bobby Collins. Revie also made a shrewd purchase in acquiring former Busby Babe winger John Giles from Manchester United, who Leeds' coaching staff would mould {{into one of the}} most influential central midfielders of the game. In 1964 this new team won promotion once more to the First Division.|$|E

25|$|Rugby league {{was taken}} into a new {{dimension}} by the 1982 Kangaroos side. The 'Invincibles' became {{the first team to}} win every game of the tour (15 games) including the first test by 40–4 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators at Boothferry Park. The Kangaroos only led 10–4 at half time, but unleashed a second half onslaught that left the British game stunned. Coached by Frank Stanton and captained by Max Krilich, the Kangaroos included veterans such as Craig Young, Steve Rogers, Kerry Boustead, the fiery Les Boyd, Rod Reddy and Ray Price, as well as <b>a</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> young players on their way to superstar status in rugby league including Mal Meninga, tour vice-captain Wally Lewis, Brett Kenny, Peter Sterling, Eric Grothe and Wayne Pearce. The second test in Wigan ended 27–6 to the visitors. During the second half of that game, Kangaroos replacement Wally Lewis fired a bullet like 20 metre pass for Meninga to score in the corner. Soundly thrashed to that point of the series, the play did psychological damage to the Lions who were left wondering just how good the Australians really were if someone who could pass like Lewis couldn't even make the starting XIII. The third test was held at Headingley, Leeds which ended 32–8, though the game was in the balance until the final ten minutes when the Kangaroos superior fitness told and they ran in four late tries. The Lions scored their only try of the series in the second half at Headingley when Hull winger Steve Evans scored. This was the beginning of an era of Australian dominance.|$|E

500|$|A. rubrum {{is one of}} {{the first}} plants to flower in spring. <b>A</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> seeds is {{generally}} produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between [...] in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree [...] in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds. Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples. [...] Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application. The seeds are epigeal and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed forest canopy situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy and though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above. Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.|$|E
