50|$|Like a {{shaded pole}} {{induction}} motor, they use field coils with additional copper shading coils (see the illustration) {{to produce a}} weakly rotating magnetic field. But unlike a shaded pole induction motor (which uses <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>rotor),</b> the synchronous version of this motor uses a magnetized rotor. This rotor rotates synchronously with the rotating magnetic field: if the rotor begins to lag behind the rotating field, driving torque increases and the rotor speeds up slightly until the rotor's position within the rotating field is a point where torque = drag; similarly, if {{the rotation of the}} field slows down, the rotor will advance relative to the field, torque will decline, or even become negative, slowing the speed of the rotor until it again reaches a position relative to the field where torque = drag.|$|E

40|$|In Brazilian {{rural areas}} {{single-phase}} power supply is very common. Single-phase induction motors with reasonable power {{are used to}} run farming activities which often, depending of their size, is not an inexpensive option. The aim of this work is to provide to farmers a simple, inexpensive and reliable option by running a modified three-phase induction motor [3] with as little structural modification as possible in order to run it with the available single-phase power supply. The asymmetrical three-phase induction machine fed by a single phase source, already discussed in previous work [1], has nothing more than <b>an</b> ordinary <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> and <b>a</b> stator where three-phase windings are located. These windings have the ordinary spatial design with a displacement of 1200 between them, but with a different number of turns in each phase. With a proper relation of number of turns in each phase {{and with the help}} of a capacitor (Cap) connected between phases B and C, as in Figure 1, can be possible to make the asymmetrical induction motor to produce nominal power at nominal speed. ...|$|R
40|$|The couped-circuit {{approach}} {{is used to}} derive a mathematical model of a general m-n winding machine in which all MMF harmonics are taken into account. The model which is applicable to <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> or phase-wound <b>rotor</b> has provision for non-integral number of rotor bars per stator pole-pair. A general polyphase to (alpha) -(beta) - 0 components transformation is described. When applied to the stator and rotor of the m-n winding machine, the polyphase to (alpha) -(beta) - 0 transformation divides the harmonics into different groups of harmonics with possible interaction, whereupon each group of harmonics can then be represented by an (alpha) -(beta) or a zero component circuit. This result shows that the usual assumption of representing the <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> by independent harmonics circuits is not valid in general. It is also shown that the polyphase to rotating d-q transformation is applicable when only one harmonic from each (alpha) -(beta) component is to be considered, otherwise a new problem of separating the harmonic voltages within each (alpha) -(beta) component is created. As a special case of the transformation the three phase <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> induction machine is considered. In addition the steady-state equations for asynchronous and synchronous action of <b>a</b> polyphase <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> induction machine are derived. The conditions for synchronous action between two harmonics are identified. It is concluded that every pair of harmonics belonging to {{the same set of}} (alpha) -(beta) components produces synchronous action, conversely every pair of harmonics which produces synchronous action belongs to the same set of (alpha) -(beta) components. This confirms that the harmonics of each set of (alpha) -(beta) components are not separable. Finally, the effects of MMF harmonics on the steady-state and transient behaviors of three sample <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> induction machines with rotors designed to give varying amounts of asynchronous and synchronous torques are studied. The influence of slot opening on the MMF, skew and skin effects are taken into account in the derivation of the parameters for these machines. The computational requirement for the solution of the original phase equations is compared with those of the (alpha) -(beta) and d-q component equations. ...|$|R

40|$|Induction motor faults, such as broken rotor bars, rotor eccentricities, bearing faults, {{mechanical}} misalignments cause harmonic {{changes in}} the permeance of the motor magnetic circuit. A motor vibration at a specific frequency {{will result in a}} current harmonic at a known frequency. The specific relationship between the vibration and the stator current harmonic magnitudes is a complex function. It {{is a function of the}} mechanical system and the magnetic system of the motor itself. The sensors used, increases it's complexity further. In the research, first, the relationship between the vibration and the stator current harmonic magnitudes are studied for a particular machine problem and the critical frequencies in the frequency spectrum of the Induction motor stator current are identified using the Micro log instrument CMVA 60, which is a property of the Mahaweli Complex of Ceylon Electricity Board. Then, the magnitude ratios of the harmonics at critical frequencies to the fundamental component of the stator current are determined by conducting a survey on previous faults found in Induction motors used in Kotmale Power Station and by carrying out an experiment on an Induction motor having <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>rotor</b> with open rotor bars. The •defective Induction motor, which had been used in one of the gear pumps to pressurize the MIV pressure vessels of the three synchronous generators in Victoria Power Station, could be used for the measurements. Next, the results obtained from the case study and the survey are compared with the standards that have been evolved from the past studies and the researches in order to determine the feasibility of setting a limit or standard on the current harmonics at critical frequencies due to motor faults. Finally, the possibility of developing a current monitoring system to identify a rotor problem is investigated for a drainage pump in Kotmale Power Station. The results can then be extended to alarm the fault by integrating the circuit to the existing annunciation system to minimize the interruption of the drainage system, which is very important in the concept of maintenance as well as the safety of the under ground power station, caused by the failure of the machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this work}} is to find good designs for high-speed induction machines. Special {{attention is paid to}} rotors suitable for these machines. Another goal is to find supply voltage waveforms appropriate for a high-speed induction machine with a solid rotor. In order to design good high-speed machines, modeling is modified and verified. A laminated rotor made for high speeds was tested on a 65  kW 30600 1 /min compressor drive. Two <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> solid steel <b>rotors</b> were tested on a 60  kW 60000 1 /min high-speed machine. In both cases, the rotors were compared against a commercially used copper coated solid steel rotor. The results showed that the laminated construction with a cage should be used whenever possible. At higher speeds, <b>a</b> well-designed <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> solid steel <b>rotor</b> would be better than a copper coated solid steel rotor. The copper coated rotor is preferred at very high speeds. Pulse amplitude modulation and pulse width modulation are techniques used to adjust the supply voltage of electric machines. The feasibility of these modulation types for supplying high-speed induction machines was tested. The results show that pulse amplitude modulation is the best choice for a high-speed induction motor drive. For the high-speed machines considered, the 3 D effects made the 2 D modeling of the electromagnetic properties difficult. Two modifications to the current modeling software were made. In the first modification, the end ring inductance was calculated with a separate 2 D FEM model. In the other modification, the flux fringing in the air gap region was also modeled with a separate 2 D FEM model. A discrepancy between electromagnetic loss calculated and electromagnetic loss measured was noticed. The measurements show circulatory currents flowing in the parallel paths of a stator winding of a high-speed machine. These currents produce extra power loss not modeled in the calculations. It is shown that taking circulatory currents into account, the model provides results close to the measured ones. Thus, the model can be used for the designing and optimization of high-speed machines. Genetic optimization software was used to derive the optimal parameters for <b>a</b> <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> solid steel <b>rotor.</b> General topology suitable for a high-speed induction machine was also studied by using optimization. The results show that both the positioning and the volume of conductors in the rotor are important. Considering the electromagnetic performance, the choice between a laminated and a solid rotor core material is less significant for a high-speed induction machine. reviewe...|$|R
