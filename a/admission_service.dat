40|$|There is an {{increasing}} {{need to develop a}} platform for comparing hospital admission planning systems due to a shift in the service paradigm in the health sector. The current service concept of hospital admission planning aims at optimising the use of scarce hospital resources without paying much attention to the level of service offered to patients. As patients nowadays do not accept long waiting times for hospital admission, it becomes necessary to consider alternative <b>admission</b> <b>service</b> concepts. Waiting lists have also become a political issue, and alternative concepts have been advocated such as giving all patients an appointment for admission. A simulation model was built to examine the impacts of extreme <b>admission</b> <b>service</b> concepts in a simplified hospital setting. The alternative concepts considered are based on the ‘zero waiting time’ principle (immediate treatment), and the ‘booked admissions’ principle (using an appointment for admission). The results of these <b>admission</b> <b>service</b> concepts are compared with the results of the current concept, based on the ‘maximising resource use’ principle. The paper deals with the development of a framework and tool that allows evaluating different, somehow conflicting, hospital admission planning concepts and the usefulness of such framework and tool for more refined/real-life approaches to hospital admission planning...|$|E

Methods Aggregate data on applications and admissions were obtained from the Universities and Colleges <b>Admission</b> <b>Service</b> covering 2003 to 2009. Data were extracted, grouped as appropriate and analysed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Results Graduate-entry attracts 10, 000 applications a year. Women form the majority of applicants and admissions to graduate-entry and traditional medicine programmes. Graduate-entry age profile is older, typically 20 's or 30 's compared to 18 or 19 years in traditional programmes. Graduate-entry applications and admissions were higher from white and black UK ethnic communities than traditional programmes, and lower from southern and Chinese Asian groups. Graduate-entry has few applications or admissions from Scotland or Northern Ireland.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} examine whether a {{graduate}} entry course widens access to medicine. Methods: We carried out a retrospective study at the University of Nottingham Medical School of sociodemographic and academic data collected by the Universities and Colleges <b>Admission</b> <b>Service</b> (UCAS). Study participants comprised all applicants to the 5 -year (mainly school-leavers) and 4 -year (graduates only) medical courses for admission in October 2003. Results: In 2002 – 03, there were 2392 applicants for the 5 -year course and 1235 applicants for the 4 -year course. Significantly, applicants for the 4 -year course comprised more males, were more socio-economically deprived and had lower UCAS tariff point scores compared with applicants for the 5 -year course. These differences were preserved in those students who eventually started on either of the 2 courses in October 2003 (254 and 94 students for the 5 - and 4 -year courses, respectively). Comparing entrants with non-entrants (mainly rejected students), those joining the 5 -year course were younger, were less socioeconomically deprived, {{were more likely to}} be White and had higher UCAS tariff point scores than non-entrants, but there were no significant gender differences. Those joining the 4 -year course {{were more likely to be}} White and had higher UCAS tariff point scores than non-entrants.

The objective of the study was to describe the standardizations and variations in the CRHT teams in Norway in order to gain knowledge regarding the structures and processes of CRHT teams. Methods A longitudinal survey of five CRHT teams in Norway was carried out for a period of 18 months with two sets of questionnaires-one for CRHT team profiles for a bi-yearly survey and the other for services and practices of CRHT teams for a monthly survey. Results The five CRHT teams were configured by a set of common basic characteristics in their operations, while at the same time were variant in several areas of the teams' structures and processes. Significant differences among the teams were evident in terms of the structural aspects such as service locality, staffing and team make-up, caseload, service hours, and travel time, and the process aspects such as the number of referrals received, referral source, <b>admission,</b> <b>service</b> duration, and discharge destination. These variations are reflected upon the perspectives regarding the nature of mental health crisis, the conflicting policies in mental health services, and the nature of home-based mental health care. Conclusions The diversity in the way CRHT teams are established and operate needs to be examined further in order to understand the reasons for such variations and their impact on the quality of services to service users and in relation to the total mental health service system in a community. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Little {{is known}} about the {{management}} of acute asthma prior to hospital admission. Pre-hospital treatment of patients referred to hospital with acute asthma was therefore studied in 150 patients divided into three groups: those in the Edinburgh Emergency Asthma <b>Admission</b> <b>Service</b> (EEAAS) who can contact an ambulance and present directly to respiratory services when symptoms arise (n = 38), those under continuing supervision at a hospital respiratory outpatient clinic (n = 54), and those managed solely in primary care (n = 58).  METHODS—Standardised admission forms detailing aspects of pre-hospital management, case records, GP referral letters, and ambulance patient transport forms were analysed.  RESULTS—In each group airflow obstruction had improved upon arrival at hospital, the effect being most marked in patients transported by ambulance (p< 0. 001) and in those receiving nebulised β 2 agonists prior to admission (p< 0. 005). However, 25 % of patients arrived without having nebulised β 2 agonists and 37 % without having glucocorticoids. EEAAS patients were least likely to receive nebulised β 2 agonists before arrival at hospital (p< 0. 05). This observation was attributable to a tendency for these patients to travel to hospital by car rather than by ambulance.  CONCLUSIONS—There is an important shortfall in administration of bronchodilators and glucocorticoids for acute asthma before arrival at hospital. Ambulances equipped with nebulised bronchodilators provide the optimal mode of transport to hospital for patients with acute asthma. In Edinburgh ambulances are not being used by a significant proportion of the population with asthma, possibly because of the mistaken belief that personal transport arrangements reduce journey time to hospital. ...|$|E
