5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
25|$|When morning came, {{the body}} of Captain Ingstrom was {{discovered}} floating in the water below, with a huge gash <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> A coastguard at nearby La Perouse, who had seen their fire during the night, picked up the wounded men and took them to Little Bay Hospital, and also informed the police of Ingstrom's death. Gustavo Ingstrom, a seaman who resided at Balmain, was called upon to identify the remains of his brother.|$|E
500|$|At the apartment, Hanada finds a {{note and}} another film from Number One stating {{he will be}} waiting at a {{gymnasium}} with Misako. Hanada waits at the gymnasium but Number One does not show. As a bedraggled Hanada rises to leave, a tape recorder switches on explaining, [...] "This is the way Number One works", he exhausts you and then kills you. Hanada puts a headband <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and climbs into a boxing ring. Number One appears and shoots him. The headband stops the bullet and Hanada returns fire. Number One slumps to the ground but manages to shoot him a few times before dying. Hanada leaps and staggers around the ring declaring himself the new Number One. Misako enters the arena and, crazed, he instinctively shoots her dead, then falls from the ring.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he slowly}} passed <b>his</b> hand <b>across</b> <b>his</b> {{streaming}} <b>forehead,</b> <b>his</b> breathing became slower and more quiet, the heavy lids {{fell over the}} protruding eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Break {{out about}} our poor boy?" [...] Trevennack asked, with a dreamy air, passing his bronzed hand wearily <b>across</b> <b>his</b> high white <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, Arthur Berkeley {{had stayed}} behind as {{requested}} in Mr. Lancaster's study, {{and waited to}} hear what Mr. Lancaster had to say to him. The editor {{looked up at him}} wearily from his chair, passed his bread hand slowly <b>across</b> <b>his</b> bewildered <b>forehead,</b> and then said the one word, 'Poor?' ...|$|R
2500|$|On 7 April, protesters marched from Victoria Park to Central {{carrying}} placards {{and modified}} images of Li Ka-shing's with devil's horns and the Chinese character for [...] "monster" [...] (å¦–) written <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> Organisers said that 4,000 demonstrators joined the march; police estimated 2,800 at its peak. The Liberal Party's youth committee chairman criticised the CTU for politicising the dispute.|$|E
60|$|Smith {{passed his}} hand <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> with a dazed gesture.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} Mortimer Arbuckle drew his white hand <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} 'll not grow any older," [...] said Singleton, with a flush of sympathy <b>across</b> <b>his</b> large white <b>forehead.</b> [...] "You {{can do it}} if you try." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tony {{had paid}} no heed {{to her at}} first; he had walked across the narrow hall to the oak staircase, and was half-way up the first flight when her last words struck upon his ear ... quite without meaning for the moment ... but {{nevertheless}} he paused, one foot on one tread, {{and the other two}} treads below ... and he turned round to look at the woman, a swift frown <b>across</b> <b>his</b> smooth <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} broad shoulders, and {{continued}} {{to look to the}} priming of his pistols, with a half-defiant and half-uneasy expression. He was a very sturdy, deep-chested man, with a stern, square-jawed face, and a white seam <b>across</b> <b>his</b> bronzed <b>forehead</b> as from a slash with a knife. He wore a gold-edged riding-cap, a jacket of brown sad-coloured stuff much stained by the weather, a pair of high rusty jack-boots, and a small bob-wig.|$|R
60|$|Evan flung his big elbow <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> {{and burst}} into tears.|$|E
60|$|Kenneth looked up, {{then rose}} and sighed, passing his hand wearily <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|He stopped short. He {{passed his}} hand <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> All {{the time the}} woman {{remained}} unmoved.|$|E
60|$|As I put {{my glass}} to my lips, he glanced with {{surprise}} {{at the end of}} his neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew <b>his</b> sleeve <b>across</b> <b>his</b> eyes and <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{beautiful}} green slope, covered with soft grass, short thyme, and cushion-like moss, and overshadowed by a thick, dark yew-tree, shut in by brushwood on all sides, and forming just such a retreat as children love to call their own. Edmund threw himself down at full length on it, laid aside his hat, and passed <b>his</b> hand <b>across</b> <b>his</b> weary <b>forehead.</b> [...] "How quiet!" [...] said he; [...] "but, hark! is that the bubbling of water?" [...] he added, raising himself eagerly.|$|R
60|$|He {{sank back}} exhausted, {{and at that}} moment a gust of wind, fiercer than any which had gone before, leapt down the {{mountain}} gorges, howling with all the voices of the storm. It caught the frail hut and shook it. A cobra hidden in the thick thatch awoke from its lethargy and fell with a soft thud to the floor not a foot {{from the face of the}} dying man--then erected itself and hissed aloud with flickering tongue and head swollen by rage. Leonard started back and seized a crowbar which stood near, but before he could strike, the reptile sank down and, drawing its shining shape <b>across</b> <b>his</b> brother's <b>forehead,</b> once more vanished into the thatch.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} sounded some discordant note in Mr. Tetterby's breast. He ruminated dejectedly, {{and passed}} {{his hand across}} and <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, a French squire and the Bohemian knight {{came rushing}} down the steps, the latter {{bleeding}} from a slash <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
60|$|Saton {{passed his}} hand <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> Her words had touched his keen imagination. The {{horror of the}} scene was upon him, too, once more.|$|E
2500|$|Wayne got {{his first}} tattoo at age 14 of his dad's name and his second was [...] "Cash Money" [...] <b>across</b> <b>his</b> stomach. His tattoos have grown to include a Jay-Z verse on his leg, [...] "I Am Music" [...] on <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and teardrops on his cheeks among many others. His most recent one is [...] "Baked" [...] on <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> stylized as the Baker Skateboards logo.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John slapped <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> {{a mighty}} blow as a {{suspicious}} and dreadful thought flashed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> mind. But next instant {{he drew a}} long breath and smiled again.|$|R
60|$|Then silence follows--the {{silence that}} {{is full of}} the night noises of a great city. A {{stringed}} instrument of some kind is just, and only just, audible. High overhead some one throws open a window, and the rattle of the wood-work echoes down the empty street. On one of the roofs, a hookah is in full blast; and the men are talking softly as the pipe gutters. A little farther on, the noise of conversation is more distinct. A slit of light shows itself between the sliding shutters of a shop. Inside, a stubble-bearded, weary-eyed trader is balancing his account-books among the bales of cotton prints that surround him. Three sheeted figures bear him company, and throw in a remark from time to time. First he makes an entry, then a remark; then passes the back of <b>his</b> hand <b>across</b> <b>his</b> streaming <b>forehead.</b> The heat in the built-in street is fearful. Inside the shops it must be almost unendurable. But the work goes on steadily; entry, guttural growl, and uplifted hand-stroke succeeding each other with the precision of clock-work.|$|R
60|$|His hand passed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> She fancied {{that he made}} {{a motion}} as though to rise to his feet, but she laid her hand upon his.|$|E
6000|$|... "Offended me?" [...] he murmured, passing {{his hand}} <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> for his temples throbbed {{and his eyes}} were burning. [...] "Nay! why should you think so?" ...|$|E
60|$|The student did not answer, {{but again}} passed his hand, confusedly, <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> Redlaw still held {{him by the}} sleeve, when Milly's voice was heard outside.|$|E
60|$|The lawyer made no reply. As Cuthbert {{spoke the}} ruddy color {{on his cheeks}} had been {{replaced}} by a ghastly pallor. An expression of bewilderment had come <b>across</b> <b>his</b> face, the perspiration stood out in big drops on <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
60|$|During {{the day we}} met an old man so {{loaded down}} I could not tell whether he was man, woman, or beast. A sort of cap or wide cloth band went <b>across</b> <b>his</b> head, concealing <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> <b>His</b> huge pack loomed over his shoulders, and as he walked, using two paddles as canes, he seemed some {{anomalous}} four-footed beast of burden.|$|R
6000|$|At last Henri {{heard his}} name {{scarcely}} pronounced by the dying man, and the dull eyes opened, {{though it was}} evident that the film of death had nearly hidden all objects from their view; still {{it was evident that}} he knew who it was that sat by his bed-side, and he faintly returned the pressure of the hand which grasped his own. Henri stooped down his ear to catch the words which might fall from his lips; but for a while he made no farther attempt to speak--an inexpressible look of confused trouble passed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> face and <b>forehead,</b> as he attempted to collect his disordered thoughts, and again he closed his eyes, as though the struggle was useless; at last he again muttered something, and Henri caught the words 'de Lescure,' and 'bridge of Saumur.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} stopped, {{shocked by the}} eagerness of his recoil, and by the sternness of his repulsion; and he passed his hand, thoughtfully, <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{passed his}} hand wearily <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and, rising from his seat, {{took a few}} nervous steps {{up and down the}} room. Then, pausing, he asked abruptly: ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. (Drawing {{his hand}} <b>across</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.)</b> It's {{more than a}} man's meant to bear--it's not right. (Aloud.) Minnie, love, I'd die for you if it would help.|$|E
60|$|While {{his eyes}} were closed in a dreamy sort of half-waking slumber, he felt the rough, hairy coat of an animal brush against <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> The idea of being torn to pieces by wolves flashed {{instantly}} <b>across</b> <b>his</b> mind, and with a shriek of terror he sprang up,--to be almost overwhelmed by the caresses of his faithful dog.|$|R
60|$|Then good-bye and good-bye, {{and charming}} {{occasion}} {{worthy of the}} Golden Age, and more about the flitch of bacon, and the like of that; and Twemlow goes staggering <b>across</b> Piccadilly with <b>his</b> hand to <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> and is nearly run down by a flushed lettercart, and at last drops safe in his easy-chair, innocent good gentleman, with his hand to <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> still, and <b>his</b> head in a whirl.|$|R
60|$|When he {{recovered}} his senses {{he found that}} a native was stooping over him and pressing a cloth to <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> He lay still {{for a minute or}} two, wondering faintly what had become of him. Looking round he could see he was in a small room. An Egyptian of the better class, in buttoned-up frock-coat and light trousers, and with a scarlet fez on his head, was standing looking down at him, and was apparently giving instructions to the native, who was endeavouring to staunch one of his wounds. As soon as he took this in, the thought of <b>his</b> comrades flashed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> mind, and pushing the man's hand back from <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> he struggled into a sitting position.|$|R
