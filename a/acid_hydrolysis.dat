25|$|The 2007 {{federal budget}} {{earmarked}} $150 {{million for the}} research effort – more than doubling the 2006 budget. DOE invested in enzymatic, thermochemical, <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> hybrid hydrolysis/enzymatic, and other research approaches targeting more efficient and lowercost conversion of cellulose to ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Nanocellulose {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from native fibers by an <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> giving rise to highly crystalline and rigid nanoparticles (often referred to as CNC or nanowhiskers) which are shorter (100s to 1000 nanometers) than the nanofibrils obtained through homogenization, microfluiodization or grinding routes. The resulting material is known as nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC or CNC).|$|E
25|$|Fuel lines {{can also}} be {{attacked}} by another form of degradation: hydrolysis. Nylon 6,6 is susceptible to <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> and in one accident, a fractured fuel line led to a spillage of diesel into the road. If diesel fuel leaks onto the road, accidents to following cars {{can be caused by}} the slippery nature of the deposit, which is like black ice.|$|E

25|$|Cellulose nanowhiskers are rodlike highly {{crystalline}} particles (relative crystallinity index above 75%) with {{a rectangular}} cross section. They are {{formed by the}} <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of native cellulose fibers commonly using sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. Amorphous sections of native cellulose are hydrolysed and after careful timing, crystalline sections can be retrieved from the acid solution by centrifugation and washing. Their dimensions depend on the native cellulose source material, and hydrolysis time and temperature.|$|E
25|$|Nitric acid is a {{corrosive}} {{acid and}} a powerful oxidizing agent. The major hazard posed by it is chemical burns, as it carries out <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> with proteins (amide) and fats (ester), which consequently decomposes living tissue (e.g. skin and flesh). Concentrated nitric acid stains human skin yellow due to its reaction with the keratin. These yellow stains turn orange when neutralized. Systemic effects are unlikely, however, and the substance is not considered a carcinogen or mutagen.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene glycol {{is used as}} a {{protecting}} {{group for}} carbonyl groups in organic synthesis. Treating a ketone or aldehyde with ethylene glycol in the presence of an acid catalyst (e.g., p-toluenesulfonic acid; BF3·Et2O) gives the corresponding a 1,3-dioxolane, which is resistant to bases and other nucleophiles. The 1,3-dioxolane protecting group can thereafter be removed by further <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> In this example, isophorone was protected using ethylene glycol with p-toluenesulfonic acid in moderate yield. Water was removed by azeotropic distillation to shift the equilibrium to the right.|$|E

25|$|While known {{aspects of}} {{synthesis}} {{are covered by}} patents, many details are proprietary. Two approaches to synthesis are used commercially. In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is protected by converting it to a functional group that will not interfere in the next reaction. Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the N-protected aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid links to phenylalanine. A process using an enzyme from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, {{which has not been}} used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid, but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried, but not scaled for industrial production.|$|E

500|$|Usage of {{the term}} amino acid in the English {{language}} is from 1898. Proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> In 1902, Emil Fischer and Franz Hofmeister proposed that proteins {{are the result of}} the formation of bonds between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another, in a linear structure that Fischer termed [...] "peptide".|$|E

2500|$|The abomasum is {{the fourth}} and final stomach {{compartment}} in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here {{in much the same}} way. It serves primarily as a site for <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. [...] Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.|$|E
2500|$|Trace {{amounts of}} guanine form by the {{polymerization}} of ammonium cyanide (...) [...] Two experiments conducted by Levy et al. showed that heating 10mol·L−1 [...] at 80°C for 24 hours gave a yield of 0.0007%, while using 0.1mol·L−1 [...] frozen at −20°C for 25 years gave a 0.0035% yield. These results indicate guanine could arise in frozen {{regions of the}} primitive earth. In 1984, Yuasa reported a 0.00017% yield of guanine after the electrical discharge of , , , and 50mL of water, followed by a subsequent <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> However, it is unknown whether the presence of guanine {{was not simply a}} resultant contaminant of the reaction.|$|E
2500|$|Panta bhat {{is often}} contaminated, with almost 90% {{of the samples}} {{containing}} fecal coliforms with a median count of 3.9 log cfu/ml. The contamination was more in the rainy season. Numbers of faecal coliforms increased 10-fold {{when there was a}} delay of more than 4 hours between preparation and consumption; 90% of the samples were eaten more than 12 hours after preparation. In cases of diarrhoea this stale rice is not to be served to the patient. According to another study (ILSI 1998), fermentation improves the bioavailability of minerals such as iron and zinc as a result of phytic <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> and increases the content of riboflavin and vitamin B. Panta bhat has some remedial use. It is considered as a [...] "cold food" [...] by Ayurveda traditions, while boiled rice is neutral. Hence is a preferred food for children with a fever.|$|E

2500|$|To {{get to this}} point, Sanger refined a {{partition}} chromatography method first developed by Richard Laurence Millington Synge and Archer John Porter Martin to determine the composition of amino acids in wool. Sanger used a chemical reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (now, also known as Sanger's reagent, fluorodinitrobenzene, FDNB or DNFB), sourced from poisonous gas research by Bernhard Charles Saunders at the Chemistry Department at Cambridge University. Sanger's reagent proved effective at labelling the [...] N-terminal amino group {{at one end of}} the polypeptide chain. He then partially hydrolysed the insulin into short peptides, either with hydrochloric acid or using an enzyme such as trypsin. The mixture of peptides was fractionated in two dimensions on a sheet of filter paper, first by electrophoresis in one dimension and then, perpendicular to that, by chromatography in the other. The different peptide fragments of insulin, detected with ninhydrin, moved to different positions on the paper, creating a distinct pattern that Sanger called [...] "fingerprints". [...] The peptide from the N-terminus could be recognised by the yellow colour imparted by the FDNB label and the identity of the labelled amino acid at the end of the peptide determined by complete <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> and discovering which dinitrophenyl-amino acid was there.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, <b>acid</b> <b>hydrolysis)</b> was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E
