Mc Lyte and Free are seen at a {{backyard}} barbecue party as Mc Lyte's verse begins and she mingles with the party guests, with Elliott as the party DJ. Again, Beyoncé comes back to sing the chorus of the song, now at the barbecue party, with scenes of her dancing in a room of the mansion and scenes from the movie in which she is singing on a stage in front of a large audience with a group of people behind her. With the end of the final chorus, the song moves back to Elliott and Lyte, with the former on her rollerskates as in the beginning and the latter {{in front of the}} semi-circle of men. The video ends with the four of them sitting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> table at the barbecue party as two small girls clap hands on the opposite bench.|$|E

During dinner, Crosby never spoke to the girl on his left, breaking decorum. By some accounts, Crosby {{fell in love with the}} buxom Mrs. Peabody in about two hours, confessing his love for her in the Tunnel of Love at the amusement park. Two weeks later they went to church together in Manchester-by-the-Sea and spent the night together. Their public relationship was a scandal among blue-blood Boston.|$|E
25|$|Freedom at {{last from}} the prison of The Maze would come with Kurelek's later {{conversion}} to Roman Catholicism; this evolution is depicted in the film William Kurelek's The Maze. In 1971, he painted Out of the Maze which he presented {{as a gift to}} Maudsley Hospital. The work depicts Kurelek with his wife and four children saying grace <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> near a pond on the prairie. Ostensibly an image of peace, the painting holds reminders of a darker Kurelek vision. In the bottom left corner, a bisected skull reminds the viewer of the artist's troubled past.

500|$|Gittings {{was an avid}} music lover, most {{interested}} in Baroque and Renaissance music. She sang in choral groups {{for most of her}} life, spending over 50 years in the Philadelphia Chamber Chorus. She was also a hiking and canoeing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist.

500|$|In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> on Chartiers Creek that {{attracted}} {{many young people}} from the Canonsburg area. Como, who attended the cookout with another girl, did not spot Roselle until everyone was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close. When it came Como's turn to sing, he chose [...] "More Than You Know", with his eyes on Roselle for the entire song. The teenage sweethearts were married July 31, 1933. They raised three children, Ronnie, David, and Terri, with traditional, non-show-business values. Because Perry Como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate, he declined repeated interview requests from Edward R. Murrow's Person to Person.|$|E
500|$|Before it {{was legal}} to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown was {{operating}} the Lone Tree Ferry to bring settlers from Council Bluffs, Iowa {{to the area}} that became Omaha. Brown is generally credited as having the first vision for a city where Omaha now sits. The passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 was presaged by the staking out of claims around the area to become Omaha by residents from neighboring Council Bluffs. On July 4, 1854, the city was informally established <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> on Capital Hill, current site of Omaha Central High School. Soon after, the Omaha Claim Club was formed to provide vigilante justice for claim jumpers and others who infringed on the land {{of many of the}} city's founding fathers. Some of this land, which now wraps around Downtown Omaha, was later used to entice Nebraska Territorial legislators to an area called Scriptown. The Territorial capitol was located in Omaha, but when Nebraska became a state in 1867, the capital was relocated to Lincoln, [...] south-west of Omaha. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled against numerous landowners whose violent actions were condemned in Baker v. Morton.|$|E

500|$|Everyone {{is pleased}} to welcome the new {{neighbours}} at first, but things soon get out of control. [...] The new bears unwittingly make a huge mess of everything (especially when the huge mansion they asked for causes pollution). Then, after a confrontation with them <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>picnic</b> ("Get a Lot") Wish Bear accidentally wishes Twinkers away to the new bears; they soon abuse the star's power with an amusement park focusing on Me Bear, a mud pie for Messy Bear, and a huge noisy motorcycle for Too Loud Bear. [...] Once the new bears finally realise their problem, they try to fix it with more wishes, but to no availCare-a-lot becomes a blank white space (wishing {{that all of this}} was gone), the bears begin to glow in color (wishing for everything to be back how it was, but with more color), Grumpy Bear turns black and white (wishing for less color), and Messy Bear turns into Messy Cub (wishing for everything to be like it used to be). [...] When they try to wish Twinkers back to Wish Bear, the star ultimately loses his power from exhaustion (because they had been pushing him much too hard). [...] Wish Bear uses Grumpy Bear's rocket to bring him to the Big Wish, a grandmother star, in the sky. Big Wish restores his power, but not before Wish Bear assures her that she has learned her lesson, which is wishing is fun, but it is far more important to work hard to achieve your dreams.|$|E

2500|$|Nathaniel Hawthorne and {{his family}} had moved to a small red {{farmhouse}} near Lenox, Massachusetts, at the end of March 1850.

Melville wrote [...] an unsigned review of Hawthorne's short story collection Mosses from an Old Manse titled [...] "Hawthorne and His Mosses", which appeared in The Literary World on August 17 and 24.

They embraced a bohemian and decadent lifestyle, living off Harry's trust fund of US$12,000 a year (or about [...] $ in today's dollars), had an open marriage with numerous ongoing affairs, a suicide pact, frequent drug use, wild parties, and long trips abroad.
