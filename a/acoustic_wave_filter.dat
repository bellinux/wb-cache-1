We {{study the}} concept of a mixed matrix in {{connection}} with lin-ear fractional transformations of lossless and passive matrix-valued rational functions, and show that they can be parametrized by sequences of elemen-tary chain matrices.

The issue of optimal design of such filters –as yet unsolved – naturally raises a Darlington synthesis problem with both symmetry and interpolation constraints whith control on the McMillan degree.

40|$|Abstract: The {{structural}} design of Double Mode Surface acoustic wave (DMS) filters, {{which are used}} widely for modern cellular phones, can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Even though the local search is usually efficient to solve the combinatorial optimization problem, the running time spent by the local search increases drastically when it is applied to a large-scale problem instance. Therefore, in order to solve the large-scale design problem of complex DMS filter in a short period, a new optimization technique named Free & Freeze method is proposed. Since Free & Freeze method {{is a kind of}} the divide-and-conquer method, it divides the search space of an optimization problem into two segments repeatedly, namely free-segment and freeze-segment, considering the problem landscape, and applies an efficient local search to the free-segment intensively.

The frequency response {{characteristics of the}} balanced SAW filters are governed primarily by their geo-metrical structures. Besides, specifications for a balanced SAW filter is given by using several criteria. Therefore, in order to realize desirable frequency response characteristics, the structural design of the balanced SAW filter is formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Then a recent Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO) algorithm, which is called Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GED 3), {{is applied to the}} multi-objective optimization problem. Furthermore, in order to clarify the tradeoff relationship among the ob-jective functions of the multi-objective optimization problem, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to assess the set of the non-dominated solutions obtained by GDE 3.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of thickness shear waves in a periodically corrugated quartz crystal plate is investigated {{in the present}} paper using a power series expansion technique. In the proposed simulation model, an equivalent continuity of shear stress moment is introduced as an approximation to handle sectional interfaces with abrupt thickness changes. The Bloch theory is applied to simulate the band structures for three different thickness variation patterns. It is shown that the power series expansion method exhibits good convergence and accuracy, in agreement with results by finite element method (FEM). A broad stop band can be obtained in the power transmission spectra owing to the trapped thickness shear modes excited by the thickness variation, whose physical mechanism is totally different from the well-known Bragg scattering effect and is insensitive to the structural periodicity.

40|$|We are {{reporting}} on the latest experimental results achieved with an event timing device using a surface <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>filter</b> as a time interpolator. During the tests of {{the first version of}} the device, the noise of the filter excitation was identified as the dominant source of the measurement error. Therefore a new concept of the excitation with very low level of the noise energy was designed. This new solution led to considerable improvement of the device performance. It results from the experimental measurements that the single shot precision is repeatedly lower than 500 fs RMS when time marks generated synchronously with the time base are measured. When asynchronous time marks are split into two event timers and the resulting time difference is measured, the single shot precision is below 700 fs RMS per channel. In this case the measurement is affected not only by random errors, but also by non-linearity of the time interpolation. The temperature dependence is below 0. 1 ps/K.

40|$|Abstract: Acoustic wave {{devices have}} gained {{enormous}} interest for sensor applications. In the current practice, the {{surface acoustic waves}} are usually generated and measured by piezoelectric transducers. In this work, however, we propose to generate the acoustic waves by using a magnetostrictive transducer using magneticstrictive nickel strip gratings and a sensing coil. The coil encircling the gratings converts the magnetic flux change induced by the strain of the strips into voltage change, and vise versa. The main motivation using magnetostrictive transducers, not piezoelectric transducers, is that the wave generation and measurement can be achieved without direct wiring to the magnetostrictive nickel gratings. In addition, the transducer can be costeffective. It is shown that the grating distance can be so tuned to the center frequency that narrow-band wave signals can be effectively excited and measured. Introduction: Most of currently-available acoustic wave filters use piezoelectric transducers (1). In this work, however, we will consider {{the possibility of using}} alternative magnetostrictive transducers to develop an <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>filter.</b> The magnetostrictive effect refers to the coupling phenomena between the mechanical field and the magnetic field.

40|$|Acoustic filters for signal {{filtering}} {{are used}} in wireless technologies operating at gigahertz frequencies for communication systems such as next generation cell phones. Multilayered porous silicon structures have been fabricated from silicon wafers to create the Bragg mirror section of a bulk <b>acoustic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>filter.</b> These porous silicon multilayers have been designed for use from 500 MHz – 20 GHz with primary focus on frequencies at 1 GHz. The porous silicon multilayers consist of alternating layers {{of high and low}} acoustic impedance layers on a bulk silicon substrate. They are fabricated using electrochemical etching where the current density during the etch determines the porosity and hence acoustic impedance of each layer. Bragg mirrors, FabryPerot filters, microcavities and rugate filters can be produced in this way due to the control of the tuneable porosity profile throughout the structure. The porosity of the layer modifies the elastic constants of the layer such as the Young’s modulus and hence the velocity of the bulk acoustic waves travelling through it. The behaviour of bulk acoustic waves through silicon is known but in order to fabricate porous silicon acoustic filters, the dependence of the longitudinal wave velocity as a function of porosity must also be known. This has been studied using acoustic transmission measurements on single porous silicon layers and then extended to multilayered structures. Rugate filters are single frequency filters that have not previously been studied for acoustic applications. In this study the first acoustic rugate filters have been fabricated using porous silicon material that exhibit only one stopband near 1 GHz. Bragg mirrors have been made with acoustic transmission measurements showing the locations of the stopbands. Porous silicon microcavities have also been fabricated along with filters that have apodisation functions. This work could form the basis of future efforts to produce and incorporate allSi multilayers into acoustic filters that are easily fabricated at a high level of quality and reliability that will serve to be efficient and cost effective.
