40|$|Inspired by {{the recent}} July Package of WTO {{agricultural}} trade negotiations, this paper argues that it is feasible for the EU to undertake the largest cuts to its final bound AMS and total trade distortion domestic support (by respectively 60 and 70 percent). These cuts can be accommodated by the current reform programs of the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU. Based on this, a tiered reduction formula for other WTO members is proposed and preliminary analysis show that other member countries, including the US, have the possibility to meet this proposal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{comprehensive}} review of Japan’s agricultural domestic policy since 1995 in the context of the current international negotiations in the WTO Doha Round, which has as one aim further reductions of trade-distorting support among member countries. An overwhelming majority of farmers in Japan own small plots of rice paddy fields and earn their living mainly on their off-farm income. They go out into rice paddy fields in their spare time as a subsidiary business. Traditional small farming communities are powerful voting groups that seek to maintain their political power. By exerting political pressures on the authorities, farmers can obtain large returns through the manipulation of farmland use regulations, even though such manipulation causes social harm by preventing efficient land use. These inefficiencies in land use are a major reason why Japan is the only country whose food self-sufficiency rate keeps declining in spite of its heavy agricultural protection. In this sense, Japan is in sharp contrast to European and North American countries, where heavy agricultural domestic supports have resulted in an increased output of agricultural commodities and subsequent distortions in international markets. Apparently, Japan’s attitude towards agricultural domestic policy reform is one of compliance with the WTO, which requests member countries to reduce their Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) through trimming trade-distorting (<b>amber</b> <b>box)</b> support and/or transforming traditional-type agricultural subsidies to decoupled-type ones. Japan reduced its <b>amber</b> <b>box</b> support by nearly 80 percent between 1995 and 2000. This drastic reduction is mainly attributable to Japan’s removal of rice from the <b>amber</b> <b>box</b> in 1998. In addition, following the WTO’s principle of decoupling, Japan launched an extensive agricultural subsidy reform in 2007. This paper, however, shows the ironical realities of Japanese agricultural policy. Neither a sharp reduction of <b>amber</b> <b>box</b> support nor Japan’s 2007 reform necessarily mean there will be a reduction of trade-distorting effects. On the contrary, the 2007 reform may in fact stimulate domestic rice production. In 2007, Japan’s AMS is as little as 18 percent of its commitment level from the Uruguay Round WTO agreements. In addition, this paper projects that Japan’s overall trade-distorting support (OTDS) for 2013 will be 469 billion yen, which is much less than the limit of 1, 635 billion yen that is proposed in the modalities under discussion in July 2008 for the WTO Doha Round. Thus, the WTO Doha Round negotiations on domestic support policy are unlikely to restrict Japan’s domestic agricultural support policy.

Employing a detailed baseline scenario and a plausible Doha outcome, we examine the long run costs for the European Union, in particular focusing on Spain. Moreover, we implement recent CAP reforms through explicit modelling of CAP mechanisms to provide greater credibility in assessing the long run asymmetric budgetary and welfare impacts on EU member states. The estimates forecast resource substitution effects between Spanish agro-food sectors and resource shifts from agro-food ac-tivities into manufacturing and services production. In Spain, the impacts of proposed <b>Amber</b> <b>box</b> re-ductions on fishing subsidies and the relatively smaller GDP contribution result in negative CAP bud...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{compatibility}} of U. S. agri-environmental programs with the Green Box provisions of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (AoA). If a new WTO agreement is concluded under the current Doha round of negotiations, {{it is likely that}} the amount of payments that can be provided to farmers under the <b>Amber</b> and Blue <b>box</b> categories will be reduced. As a result, greater attention will be directed to the use of the Green Box, which is unlikely to be subject to such a requirement. Payments under the Green Box are supposed to generate no or minimal distortions in production or trade. Those made under environmental programs are restricted to providing compensation for the additional costs incurred or income foregone in meeting program standards or conditions. Payments that are designed to provide incentives for producers to participate in environmental programs are not covered and appear potentially subject to legal challenge. More generally, a recent WTO panel ruling appears to imply that a strict interpretation of decoupling will be applied to Green Box payments. Income support payments that can be shown to be linked to production or land use decisions also appear potentially subject to challenge. These two factors imply that it may be difficult to design WTO-compatible programs that result in the appropriate supply of environmental attributes, when that supply is linked to the volume of agricultural production or land use. If Green Box payments are to be used to achieve environmental objectives, current criteria will have to be modified. The difficulty is how to achieve this without the risk that environmental programs will become the preferred mechanism for providing production and trade distorting subsidies to farmers. Several modifications to existing Green Box criteria may help to avoid this. These include requirements for transparency, explicit (measurable) program criteria, and limits on incentive payments. Enhanced monitoring and surveillance could help to minimize abuse. These changes would impose some constraints on the design of environmental programs in the United States and other countries. However, the clarification of Green Box criteria would be in the long-term interests of those who would like to see the further development of agri-environmental programs, while limiting the potential for international trade distortions.

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} the market access and domestic support pillars in the Doha Round negotiations. It analysed both {{the implications for}} Brazil of reducing its own tariffs and reforming domestic support for agriculture; and the likely benefits Brazilian exporters {{can be expected to}} gain. The analysis demonstrates that Brazil will not have to make major changes to its tariffs and subsidies. This is not only because the country has an adequate amount of overhang between bound and applied tariffs, and sufficient water in its de minimis support, but also because tariffs have not been used as income policy in Brazil, and trade-distorting domestic subsidies are few in comparison to the size of Brazilian agriculture. The gains for Brazil, therefore, will come from the contribution of this round to the growth of Brazilian agricultural exports and to the reduction of the trade-distorting effects of domestic support. An undeniable achievement of the Doha Round will be the creation of productspecific caps for <b>Amber</b> and Blue <b>Box</b> subsidies. Product-specific disciplines are necessary to avoid the negative impacts of domestic support in the world market, {{as was the case with}} US subsidies for grain and oilseeds between 1999 and 2002. Product caps will serve to reduce world price suppression, especially if prices go back to 1999 - 2002 levels. Product caps only make sense if they are capable of preventing the adverse effects of domestic subsidies on world prices. The effectiveness, therefore, depends on the level of the cap and the implied adverse effects on prices. This study has shown that the proposed caps, with the exception of cotton, can constrain price suppression in situations of very low world prices. However, caps will not be effective if prices are at more normal levels. Brazil’s market access gains in developed countries are most likely to be constrained by the continuation of the SSG and the extent to which disciplines will achieve effective TRQ expansion. The continuation of the SSG will be an escape clause for countries seeking to maintain protection for specific sectors. The SSG will thus provide an additional layer of protection over and above the TRQ system, which itself is already a protectionist measure. Taking as an example the cases of beef, chicken and sugar in the EU, the compensation to be provided for selecting these products as sensitive will not be enough to create new trade. TRQ expansion will, at most, internalize over-quota trade: because there will not be any meaningful results in terms of import price reduction, imports will not increase. A reduction in over-quota tariffs would be the most effective way to create new trade. In the case of developing countries, the SSM is the central concern. There is a potential risk of increasing levels of protection beyond the tariff levels that were bound in the Uruguay Round leading to deterioration in current market access opportunities. Two topics now appear as “deal-breakers” for Brazil: the creation of new tariff rate quotas that will not be effective in creating new market access opportunities and an SSM that will lead to an increase in the level of protection consolidated before the Doha Round.

40|$|The {{elements}} of a new agreement relating to domestic support for agriculture are {{set out in the}} WTO Framework document of July 2004. This introduces the concept of the Overall Trade Distorting Support (OTDS), which is to be disciplined and subject to reduction. In addition, some of the individual components of the OTDS will be subject to minimum required reductions and other elements will be capped. The caps and reduction percentages will define each country's future "entitlement" to <b>Amber</b> and Blue <b>Box</b> support. A base period OTDS will be calculated as the sum of the current bound Total Aggregate Measure of Support (TAMS), resulting from the Uruguay Round Agreement, plus an allowance for product specific and non-product specific de minimis, plus an additional allowance for Blue Box support. The latter three elements will be defined {{as a percentage of the}} total value of agricultural production in the base period. There will also be caps on the product specific AMS. Information from the Framework document and the Harbinson modalities are combined with data from notifications to the WTO to examine the implications of the overall reductions in the OTDS and its components for a selection of countries [...] Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Norway and the United States. Detailed analysis reveals that the new approach has the potential to increase significantly the constraints on support entitlements for WTO countries. The implications of the new rules are complex, and may create new opportunities for strategic behavior on the part of individual countries. The likelihood that the approach will actually constrain domestic support policies in WTO countries will vary considerably, depending on a country's future composition of support and how this will relate to support entitlement at the end of the implementation period. The analysis indicates that significant reduction percentages of 60 percent or more in the permitted OTDS and the Total AMS binding will be required to create the need for significant reform of existing agricultural policies in many countries. In addition, the rules for calculating the AMS may need to be strengthened in order to prevent countries from making strategic changes in domestic policies that would allow them to avoid effective reductions in that component of support. Many developed countries have increased the use of Green Box payments in recent years. The Framework proposes a tightening of the rules for inclusion. Changes in some income support measures will be required as a result of the Cotton Case ruling in the WTO, but important issues relate to the eligibility of other support measures and environmental payments. A formal WTO review process would seem to be desirable in order to determine whether any particular payment actually qualifies for inclusion in the Green Box. Developing countries will face less stringent restrictions and reduction requirements for domestic support in a new agreement, and will have a longer period in which to phase in reductions in their support entitlements. Whether all developing countries should be treated equally in this regard is an important question. Large middle income developing countries that wish to increase the support they provide to agriculture will have some flexibility to do so under the new rules, and this could create problems for the trading system in the future.

The GTAP model is extended to incorporate an explicit representation of the market price support element of the AMS. The results from these extensions of the standard database and model support the view that the impact of an agreement to reduce domestic support will be limited and lower than conventionally estimated.

40|$|An {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} the agreed CAP-reform measures on EU trade and production was published by FAPRI (the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, Missouri) in September 2003, following its commissioning by a member of the US Senate. The analysis is complicated by the degree of flexibility allowed to EU members states in implementing the agreed reforms. To address this, two scenarios are explored: a 'MOST' scenario, where EU member states choose the maximum level of decoupling and a 'LEAST' scenario where they choose the minimum level of decoupling allowed. The major findings were as follows: for major commodities, the reforms would have modest impacts on supply, consumption, trade and prices; for the commodities where current payment programmes are most closely tied to production, the reforms could have larger impacts, for example reducing EU beef production by 4 % by 2012 compared to what it would have been under a continuation of current policies; reforms will allow the EU to shift much of its internal support for producers from the WTO 'blue box' to the 'green box'; as a result of reform EU support in the 'blue box' will be reduced to less than 5 % of the value of production, a level consistent with the recent joint EU-US negotiating proposal; projected EU 'amber support' would be less than 50 % of the negotiated Uruguay ceiling. The analysis is however very sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar, and its conclusions need to be judged in this light. In terms of WTO disciplines the paper notes that the EU's single farm payment scheme is 'structured to fit the current definition of green box income support'. The reforms agreed will bring about 'a dramatic reduction in blue box spending'. Under the LEAST scenario 'blue box spending falls to € 7 billion annually by 2007 '. Under the MOST scenario 'blue box spending is reduced to € 0. 4 billion annually after 2004. The paper notes that 'under both scenarios, annual <b>amber</b> <b>box</b> spending falls slightly, to about 32 billion euro. Projected levels of <b>amber</b> <b>box</b> support under both reform scenarios 'are approximately 52 % below the current WTO limit'. What is more 'the projected level of blue box support even under the LEAST scenario, is below the limit of 5 % of the value of production suggested in the recent EU-US joint proposal'. This implies that 'the European Union could negotiate a sizeable reduction in amber spending limits, abide by new limits on blue box spending and still maintain the policy structure just approved'. Comment: It should be borne in mind that the changes in production noted in the report are calculated not with reference to current levels of production but to the production which would arise over the period 2007 - 2012 were existing policies to be continued. The value of current WTO disciplines on 'amber support' is illustrated by the fact that EU 'amber box' expenditures could almost double from those that will prevail under the reform scenario, and still remain within WTO disciplines.

40|$|This article reviews current US {{agricultural}} {{programs as}} revised under the Fsri Act of 2002. Attention {{focuses on the}} commodity programs and their compatibility with international commitments. Subsequent to the fall in the international prices of major agricultural commodities, the US Congress decided {{to bring an end}} to relying solely on decoupled payments, and to restore a safety net for farm incomes based on countercyclical payments. In short, under the 2002 farm bill growers of program crops can be eligible for (1) direct contract payments not tied to current production or prices; (2) market loss assistance payments not tied to current production but justified by low commodity prices; and (3) marketing loan benefits tied directly to current production of a specific commodity and calculated to offset low prices for that commodity. Thus, with the new farm bill a significant portion of payments varies with market price levels, and by consequence it is impossible to determine ahead of time what the total level of payments will be in future years. Under the Uruguay round Agreement on Agriculture, the United States agreed to limit spending on domestic support programs considered trade-distorting (<b>amber</b> <b>box</b> spending) to $ 19, 1 billion per year. Early estimates suggested that the US was likely to exceed this limit in the 2002 marketing year by about 30 %. Should this prove to be the case and, above all, if a stricter limit on domestic support is negotiated in Cancun, the Secretary for agriculture will have to exercise his authority to limit payments.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{agricultural}} policy changes in China and presents estimates of domestic {{support for the}} period 1996 - 2005. A set of relevant alternative subsidy-definition scenarios and their effects on the calculated levels of support are analyzed, and a projection of domestic support through 2013 is presented. The paper concludes {{with a discussion of}} new WTO rules that may be negotiated in the Doha Round and their implications for China. Based on standard WTO subsidy calculation methods, our results indicated that China's domestic support for the period 1996 - 2005 has been well below the limits agreed at its WTO accession. The market price support (MPS) component of the aggregate measure of support (AMS) in China has been below zero, and this has dwarfed the relatively small but positive non-product specific AMS and led to a zero current total AMS after de minimis. China has no AMS commitments but can provide trade-distorting domestic support to agricultural producers up to 8. 5 percent of the value of production (or RMB 561 billion). Thus there appears to be substantial room for China to extend its <b>amber</b> <b>box</b> subsidy measures through heavy use of the de minimis provision. We project domestic support notifications through 2013 based on specified assumptions about domestic policies, including changes in administered prices and commodity program coverage. New rules potentially negotiated in the Doha Round are expected to provide more constraints on subsidies. Due to China's developing country status, with no AMS commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture the impacts of these new constraints are shown to be limited, although our projections indicate that China may exceed its WTO commitment levels under certain price and commodity coverage scenarios.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the third pillar of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the {{discipline}} of agricultural domestic support. The paper examines the current definition of agricultural domestic support used by the WTO, focusing on the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) {{and other forms of}} support that are less to least distorting (Blue and Green Box payments). The analysis looks at the recent experience of four member states (the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Brazil). The structure of recent support varies considerably by country. Some countries, notably the United States, have strategically used the de minimis exemption to deflate their support figures substantially in order to remain within AMS limits, even though total support has exceeded these limits. The paper investigates the possible effects of changing the definition of the AMS so that it better reflects current support conditioned by market forces. If market prices (world and/or domestic) were to be used to compute current market support, a greater variability of the AMS would result, and violations of AMS limits would be more likely given the anticyclical nature of policies included in the AMS, especially for the United States and European Union. We also identify possible changes that would lead to more substantial trade reforms. In particular, we argue for phasing out the de minimis exemption and Blue Box support, adding a generous Green Box definition, which would allow countries to move quickly away from trade-distorting policies (<b>Amber</b> <b>Box</b> and the most trade-distorting Blue Box policies), followed by a phase-down of Green Box payments over time.

40|$|In {{his meeting}} with the Chair of the Agricultural negotiations, Stuart Harbinson, EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler sought to {{highlight}} the importance of differentiating between the trade-distorting impact of different forms of agricultural support measures. He expressed {{the view that the}} key issue in the negotiations was the direction of movement in the degree of trade distortion arising from agricultural support and not the level of support per se. Commissioner Fischler urged the use of more discerning tools for assessing the trade-distorting impact of different agricultural support tools rather than the simple level of agricultural support and drew attention to the work that the OECD was undertaking on this issue. Commissioner Fischler's remarks were aimed at US agricultural support, which he maintained, was increasing trade-distorting forms of support, while the EU has systematically been shifting to less trade distorting and non-trade-distorting forms of agricultural support (moving from <b>amber</b> <b>box</b> to more blue box measures). The press release of Commissioner Fischler's speech following {{his meeting with}} Stuart Harbinson provides a number of graphics in PDF format setting out the EU's case. Comment: To a certain extent the extent of trade distortion is an academic point. From an ACP perspective the issue is simple enough: do EU agricultural-support programmes allow EU companies to win markets from ACP producers which they would not otherwise be able to supply in the absence of agricultural support (either because they could not compete on price, or because there would be a lower level of total EU production). If WTO rules tolerate EU agricultural-aid instruments which are judged less trade-distorting than US agricultural-aid instruments, yet this still allows EU companies to win markets away from ACP producers, then the new WTO rules on agricultural support bring no material benefits to ACP countries. This forms part of the EU's efforts to secure international recognition of the definitions it is using of what are trade distorting, less trade distorting and non-trade distorting forms of support. It should be borne in mind that these EU definitions do not always accurately reflect the trade impact of individual measures.

40|$|Critics of the U. S. {{proposal}} to the World Trade Organization (WTO) made in October 2005 are correct when they argue that adoption of the proposal would significantly reduce available support under the current farm program structure. Using historical prices and yields from 1980 to 2004, we estimate that loan rates would have to drop by 9 percent and target prices would have to drop by 10 percent {{in order to meet}} the proposed aggregate <b>Amber</b> <b>Box</b> and Blue Box limits. While this finding should cheer those who think that reform of U. S. farm programs is long overdue, it alarms those who want to maintain a strong safety net for U. S. agriculture. The dilemma of needing to reform farm programs while maintaining a strong safety net could be resolved by redesigning programs so that they target revenue rather than price. Building on a base of 70 percent Green Box income insurance, a program that provides a crop-specific revenue guarantee equal to 98 percent of the product of the current effective target price and expected county yield would fit into the proposed aggregate Amber and Blue Box limits. Payments would be triggered whenever the product of the season-average price and county average yield fell below this 98 percent revenue guarantee. Adding the proposed crop-specific constraints lowers the coverage level to 95 percent. Moving from programs that target price to ones that target revenue would eliminate the rationale for ad hoc disaster payments. Program payments would automatically arrive whenever significant crop losses or economic losses caused by low prices occurred. Also, much of the need for the complicated mechanism (the Standard Reinsurance Agreement) that transfers most risk of the U. S. crop insurance to the federal government would be eliminated because the federal government would directly assume the risk through farm programs. Changing the focus of federal farm programs from price targeting to revenue targeting would not be easy. Farmers have long relied on price supports and the knowledge that crop losses are often adequately covered by heavily subsidized crop insurance or by ad hoc disaster payments. Farmers and their leaders would only be willing to support a change to revenue targeting if they see that the current system is untenable in an era of tight federal budgets and WTO limits. farm safety net, revenue targeting, U.

40|$|A report {{based on}} the {{hearings}} of the International Development Committee of the UK House of Commons on December 4 th 2003 is now available on the internet. The report which is entitled ‘Trade and development at the WTO: learning the lessons of Cancun to revive a genuine development round' reviews what happened in Cancun, the lessons to be drawn, {{and what can be}} done to revive a genuine ‘development round'. It makes a number of recommendations on the WTO process in the light of the new alliances which have emerged. On issues of substance it notes that ‘without agreement on agriculture, there will be no development round' and maintains that ‘the developed world failed to offer sufficiently radical or quick reforms of its agricultural policies' and that ‘the EU's failure on agriculture was an own goal resulting from a lack of coherence between its policies on trade, development and agriculture'. It argues that ‘the developed world must accept that if its agricultural policies harm developing countries – and trade-distorting domestic support and export subsidies clearly do - then they must be changed'. It notes that ‘if agricultural subsidies keep farmers in business, and their products are exported, then these subsidies are trade distorting'. It was also critical of ‘the condescending refusal of the USA to negotiate on cotton'. The committee maintains that the lesson of Cancun is simple: ‘developing countries' concerns should be listened to carefully and taken seriously'. On specific issues linked to agriculture the report argued that ‘the peace clause should not be extended'. It welcomed the ‘EU-inspired proposal to remove export subsidies for products of particular interest to developing countries'. It maintained, however, that ‘the farmers of developing countries who suffer the effects of the dumping of agricultural products, are poorly served by the EU's agreement on CAP reform'. It observed that ‘the reform may be substantial in terms of EU politics, but that does not mean that it will make a substantial difference in developing countries'. It argued that ‘partially decoupled agricultural support will still keep European farmers in business at the expense of farmers in developing countries. If agricultural subsidies keep farmers in business, and their products are exported, then those subsidies are trade distorting'. The report observes that ‘agricultural negotiations at the WTO revolve around definitions', noting that ‘unfettered use of green-box measures is crucial for the EU; moving agricultural support from the <b>amber</b> <b>box</b> and the blue box to the green box is central to maintaining progress with CAP reform and consequentially with multilateral negotiations. ' It records Pascal Lamy's' view that capping the green box would be a disincentive to further CAP reform and as such, according to both the Commission and the UK government, it is not politically realistic. However, as the Committee report notes, for the G 20 and others ‘if green-box subsidies keep farmers in the business of exporting their produce then they are trade distorting and should be subject to limits and reduction commitments'. Against this background the Committee report poses the question ‘is the green box a stepping stone or a stumbling block towards fundamental development-friendly agricultural reform, within the EU and internationally?' It notes that Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy dismissed questions about whether green-box support is trade distorting as ‘a very interesting academic question'. However the Committee report argues that for ‘poor farmers in developing countries and to exporters in less poor but still developing countries, it is more than academic'. The report calls for an independent review of the trade-distorting nature of green-box measures based on objective criteria ‘rather than political bargaining' and suggests that the World Bank could conduct such a review. The report's section on agriculture concludes that development-friendly agricultural trade rules cannot be built simply on what is ‘politically feasible from an EU perspective', since multilateral rules are meant to be about creating a level playing field. In this context the Committee calls on the UK government to move beyond ‘an exercise which tries to hide trade-distorting subsidies in a different coloured box'. Comment: The report constitutes a radical critique of the process of CAP reform to date, questioning as it does the definitions of the trade-distorting nature of different forms of support. It postulates and supports the basic premise that if agricultural aid, in whatever form, affects farmers' production decisions and allows them to grow more than they would otherwise grow in the absence of such aid, and if this production is then traded, then these forms of aid are effectively trade-distorting. This strikes at the heart of the process of CAP reform, which is designed to enhance the price competitiveness of EU agricultural and value-added food-product exports through shifting patterns of EU aid between different types of ‘boxes' of support which are subject to different WTO disciplines. In this context it remains to be seen whether any of the report's recommendations will be taken up by the UK government, other member states, and subsequently the European Commission. Looking beyond the report itself, it also remains to be seen whether policy developments that the report welcomed, such as the Commission's offer to remove export subsidies on all products of export interest to developing countries, would include export subsidies on such EU products as sugar or whether they would not be allowed onto any list of products important to developing countries.
