30|$|Since the {{recently}} proposed GKE protocols [20 – 22] for wireless network environment are non-authenticated ones. By its very nature, a non-authenticated group key exchange protocol cannot provide participant and message authentication, {{so it must}} rely on the authenticated network channel [1, 3] or use other schemes [23 – 25] to provide <b>authentication</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> Here, as like {{the recently}} proposed GKE protocols [20 – 22], we assume that each mobile client and the powerful node have already authenticated mutually. Here, {{we focus on the}} design of a non-authenticated GKE protocol. In this article, we propose a new group key exchange protocol with the dynamic property for wireless network environments. Under several security assumptions, we will prove that the proposed protocol is secure against passive attack and provides forward/backward secrecy for dynamic member joining/leaving. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol also satisfies the contributiveness property. As compared with the recently proposed GKE protocols, our protocol provides better performance in terms of computational cost, round number, and communication cost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the growing}} {{importance}} of personal identification and <b>authentication</b> <b>in</b> today’s highly <b>advanced</b> world where most business and personal tasks are {{being replaced by}} electronic means, {{the need for a}} technology that is able to uniquely identify an individual and has high fraud resistance saw the rise of biometric technologies. Making biometric-based solution mobile is a promising trend. A new set of palm print image database captured using embedded cameras in mobile phone was created to test various segmentation techniques on their robustness. The improved square-based palm print segmentation method was successfully implemented and integrated into the current application suite. Comparing to the two segmentation methods that are based on boundary tracking of the overall hand shape that has limitation of being unable to process palm print images that has one or more fingers closed, the system can now effectively handle the segmentation of palm print images with varying finger positioning. The high flexibility makes palm print matching mobile to be possible. Index Terms—Palm print; segmentation; mobility; I...|$|R
40|$|In key-recovery methods using smart cards, a {{user can}} recover the disk {{encryption}} key {{in cooperation with}} the system administrator, even if the user has lost the smart card including the disk encryption key. However, the disk encryption key is known to the system administrator <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> most key-recovery methods. Hence user 2 ̆ 7 s disk data may be read by the system administrator. Furthermore, if the disk encryption key is not known to the system administrator <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> it is difficult to achieve a key <b>authentication.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose a scheme which enables to recover the disk encryption key when the user 2 ̆ 7 s smart card is lost. In our scheme, the disk encryption key is not preserved anywhere and then the system administrator cannot know the key before key-recovery phase. Only someone who has a user 2 ̆ 7 s smart card and knows the user 2 ̆ 7 s password can decrypt that user 2 ̆ 7 s disk data. Furthermore, we measured the processing time required for user <b>authentication</b> <b>in</b> an experimental environment using a virtual machine monitor.
