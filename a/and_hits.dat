5|$|Fighters such as Bob Probert and Boogaard {{have been}} posthumously {{diagnosed}} with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative {{disease of the}} brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.|$|E
5|$|Furious, Presto {{tries to}} attack Alec, {{but in an}} act to defend himself, Alec puts an offstage ladder into the wizard hat, and Presto is hit between his legs. Presto {{attempts}} to hit Alec with it, but it misses <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> a backstage door, and Presto ends up getting pushed across the stage. Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp {{with a piece of}} the ladder.

Reynolds led the AL in walks with 130 in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Sudeep takes Bindu to {{his home}} and Nani follows them. Nani seriously injures Sudeep with a needle. The latter clips Nani's wing and fatally stabs him with the same needle. Nani jumps through the flame of a burning match then into a loaded cannon, which fires. The {{projectile}} passes through Sudeep <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> an oxygen cylinder, which explodes and kills him. Bindu takes the fly's wing and makes an amulet with it.

5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E

5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves.

She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> him on the head.|$|E
5|$|Chapman and Vause get {{revenge on}} Doggett and trick her {{into believing that}} she has faith healing powers, {{eventually}} culminating in her {{being sent to the}} psychiatric ward. Although Chapman aids in Doggett's release from the psychiatric ward, Doggett still bears a grudge against her. Doggett's lawyer encourages her to evangelize to Chapman instead and this leads to Chapman 'converting' but then refusing to be baptized. Doggett sees this as disrespectful and expresses a wish to kill Chapman. The two have a confrontation {{at the end of the}} season's final episode. Doggett attacks Chapman with a shiv made from a wooden cross; Chapman throws Doggett to the ground <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> her repeatedly.|$|E

He took a 12-start (five-decision) undefeated streak, dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals, into his first start off the disabled list, but he took the loss in a 5–0 defeat, which was again against the Cardinals.

5|$|On April 15, 2009, Kershaw pitched seven innings, {{striking}} out 13 batters while allowing only one hit (a solo home run) against the rival San Francisco Giants.

He pitched six solid innings of a one-run ballgame and struck out six while walking three batters. Richard would make his next start four days later. Richard again pitched more than six innings but earned no decision after the Astros' bullpen gave up nine runs during the top of the ninth inning.|$|E
