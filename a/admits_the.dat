25|$|The purge of Haig’s staff continued, {{with the}} {{appointment}} on 22 January of Herbert Lawrence as BEF Chief of Staff, {{in place of}} Lt-Gen Launcelot Kiggell. Lawrence was a much stronger character than Kiggell, and having made money in business and having no plans {{to stay in the}} Army after the War, was not beholden to Haig - actually in time the two men made a good team. Haig also lost the Deputy Chief of General Staff, Maxwell (QuarterMaster General), the engineer in chief and the director-general of medical services.

25|$|Shenhav focuses his multiculturalist program {{mostly on}} around the postcolonialist discourse, but also {{includes}} the postmodernist and feminist ones. For Shenhav, identity is a dynamic, constructivist, random and non-primordial concept, and seeks to deconstruct {{the social and cultural}} constructions (which he sees as basically European) in order develop a perspective that would advance identity politics. Shenhav <b>admits</b> <b>the</b> existence of an asymmetry between the way in which he negates a substantive identity and criticizes the formation of a Hegemonic identity, while encouraging the formation of another substantive identity he wants to liberate within his identity politics. In his opinion, this can be morally justified since an analogy cannot be made between the oppressors and the oppressed and between the rulers and the ruled.|$|E
