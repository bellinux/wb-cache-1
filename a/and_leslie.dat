5|$|Eric <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E

5|$|Gregg Allman became {{interested}} in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it. His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the Allman Brothers Band, and he was presented with a brand new B-3 <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls the instrument was cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance. Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|Joy Ibsen, {{a retired}} journalist, died in 2008, leaving three children: Michael, Jeff <b>and</b> <b>Leslie.</b> On 24 August 2012, her son Michael (born in Canada in 1957, a cabinet maker based in London) gave a mouth-swab sample to the {{research}} team to compare with samples from the human remains found at the excavation. Analysts found a mitochondrial DNA match between the exhumed skeleton, Michael Ibsen, and an unnamed second direct maternal line descendant, who shares a relatively rare mitochondrial DNA sequence, mitochondrial DNA haplogroup J1c2c.|$|E
5|$|Leslie gives Jess an art kit on his birthday, {{much to his}} delight.

Afterwards, Jess apologizes to Leslie by giving her a puppy, whom she names Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll resembling Janice, and a squirrel-like creature resembling Hoager, whom they name the 'Sqoager'.

When it starts raining, they decide to go home, and Jess looks on smiling as Leslie runs away.|$|E

50|$|To {{ensure that}} all key players {{are on the same}} page, it is {{important}} to have communication between managers, resource users, scientists, government bodies <b>and</b> other stakeholders (<b>Leslie</b> <b>and</b> McLeod 2007). Proper engagement between these groups will enable the development of management initiatives that are realistic <b>and</b> enforceable (<b>Leslie</b> <b>and</b> McLeod 2007) as well as effective for ecosystem management.|$|R

5|$|Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, {{the cynical}} {{director}} of the parks department and Leslie's boss. Due to his incredibly negative view of politics, he regularly works to make his department as inefficient as possible. This leads him to butt heads with Leslie {{on a number of}} occasions, as her philosophy regarding politics is the polar opposite. Despite that, both he <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> have a large amount of respect for one another.|$|E
5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> C. Gray examine how gendered social norms {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E
5|$|Sabo {{was born}} in Kufstein, Austria on 22 February 1948 to Elizabeth <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> Sabo Sr., who had been members of an upper-class Hungarian family.

5|$|The 1950s and 1960s {{was a good}} {{period for}} Grade and his brothers, Bernard Delfont <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> Grade, and their companies. Pye Records had major artists of the period under contract. The Searchers, The Kinks, Donovan, Mungo Jerry, and Petula Clark {{were some of the}} artists that {{recorded}} for Pye Records. Pye also had contracts with several US companies, allowing them to manufacture and distribute records in the UK. Chess Records was among those, and counted Chuck Berry as one of its top artists.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} forecast further intensification to 60mph (95km/h), {{although the}} agency {{also noted that}} the circulation could dissipate, due its fast forward motion toward the east-northeast. Ultimately, wind shear prohibited significant strengthening, <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> attained peak winds of 45mph (70km/h). The storm interacted with an approaching cold front and became extratropical on October7, 375mi (600km) north of Bermuda. It accelerated to the northeast and passed over Newfoundland on October8. The remnants of Leslie turned to the east, then southeast, strengthening to near-hurricane-force winds before losing its identity near Ireland on October10.|$|E
5|$|The group's early {{sound was}} geared more towards {{psychedelic}} rock with only occasional classical influences. Following O'List's departure, Emerson's {{control over the}} band's direction became greater, resulting in more complex music. The absence of a guitar in the band and Emerson's redefining {{of the role of}} keyboard instruments in rock set the Nice apart from many of its contemporaries. He used a combination of Marshall Amplification <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> speakers in order to project a full sound to compensate for the lack of a guitarist.|$|E
5|$|A remorseful Leslie (Amy Poehler) tells a {{group of}} Recreation Center {{teachers}} the Pawnee budget has been cut by $1,000, and five of their classes {{will have to be}} cut, but exactly which classes has not yet been determined. Later, Leslie and Justin Anderson (Justin Theroux), who have been dating for weeks, have another excellent date in Indianapolis. At the end of the night, they decide their next date will be in Pawnee, <b>and</b> <b>Leslie</b> feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with Ann (Rashida Jones), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites Mark (Paul Schneider), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ron (Nick Offerman), specifically excludes Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and asks Andy (Chris Pratt) to work as the waiter. Andy agrees, even though he hates Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend.|$|E
