40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore how weather risk affects the value of nitrogen fertilizer use <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> seed variety adoption to Sub-Saharan African (SSA) maize farmers. It contributes to the literature by providing additional broad support for the hypothesis that low rates of fertilizer use <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> seed variety adoption {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the SSA landscape is heterogeneous, so fertilizer <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> seed are not always advantageous, especially when considering the potentially high cost to farmers of obtaining fertilizer <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> seed. The analysis finds a synergy between nitrogen fertilizer <b>and</b> <b>improve</b> seed varieties. While the benefits of nitrogen tend to increase overtime without <b>improved</b> seed varieties <b>and</b> the benefits of improved seed varieties tend to decrease overtime without nitrogen, combining the two provides more sustained productivity benefits. Therefore, securing both nitrogen use <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> variety adoption is important for promoting sustained productivity increases across most of SSA. The research also contributes to the literature a methodology for calculating willingness to pay bounds that assess the importance of farmers’ risk tolerances as a barrier to fertilizer use or improved seed variety adoption.

5|$|A {{review of}} the National Waymarked Trails in Ireland by the National Trails Office in 2010 {{acknowledged}} these shortcomings and recommended that the Wicklow Way be selected as one of fourteen trails to be upgraded to a National Long Distance Trail.

It would require sections on unsuitable roads to comprise less than 10% of the total trail and for appropriate support services – accommodation, meals, transport, luggage transfer etc. – to be available.
