50|$|A {{track plate}} is kept {{at the bottom}} of the machine. Packages, which supply axial yarns, are kept beneath the track plate. Bobbins are mounted on the carrier, which is pushed by horn gears over the track plate. Braiding yarns are fed from these bobbins. The {{relative}} motion of the braiding yarns and the <b>axial</b> <b>yarn</b> determines the pattern and the structure of the braid.The 3D braiding process is a minor modification of 2D braiding process, where the standing ends are added to the braiding yarns that are moving.

40|$|A {{microstructure}} {{model of}} 2 -D braided composite is developed. The fiber volume and crimp angle are evaluated by this model and are compared with experimental results. The maximum fiber volume fraction is also obtained. Effective stiffness of 2 -D braided composite is obtained {{in a close}} form by the analysis of elastic deformation energy in repeat-unit-cell of braided composites. Effective stiffness consists of contributions of <b>axial</b> <b>yarn,</b> braiding yarn, and matrix material. Each of them takes a different weight in the effective stiffness. The weights of contribution of <b>axial</b> <b>yarn,</b> braiding yarn, and matrix material are χ Vf/k, (1 -χ) Vf/k, and (1 -Vf/k) respectively, where Vf is the fiber volume fraction, χ is the <b>axial</b> <b>yarn</b> content in a braided composite, and k is the filament packing fraction. The results of effective stiffness from theoretical prediction are very good as compared with test data from experiments. Effective coefficients of thermal and hygro expansion are analyzed by virtual energy method. The independent parameters in design and analysis of braided composites are successfully separated from all other parameters. This greatly reduces the difficulties of design and analysis of 2 -D braided composites. Objected-oriented Matlab programs are built for the parameter analysis...|$|E
40|$|Braided {{composite}} materials {{are currently being}} evaluated for wing skin stiffeners on commercial aircraft. These carbon-fiber/epoxy materials allow for low-cost manufacturing while maintaining high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. The proposed braid architecture consists of axial carbon fiber yarns and braider carbon fiber yarns making 60 deg to 70 deg angles {{with respect to the}} axial yarns. These 2 -D triaxial braids are produced as long, continuous tubes, which are flattened, cut, and stacked to produce the desired part thickness and shape. When infiltrated with epoxy resin and cured under a compaction pressure, the fiber yarns become crimped, allowing for higher fiber packing. Although high fiber packing is desirable, yarn crimping (especially in the axial fiberyarns) is undesirable. Significant <b>axial</b> <b>yarn</b> crimp angles (greater than 10 deg) have been measured in braided composites. Comparable levels of crimping have been found to produce significant compressive strength reductions in laminated composites consisting of planar fiber sheets. Thus, <b>axial</b> <b>yarn</b> crimping is suspected of producing significant reductions in compressive strength allowables for braided composites. The objective of this research is to quantify the reduction in compressive strength as a function of <b>axial</b> <b>yarn</b> crimp severity. Since crimp severity can be reduced by lowering the compaction pressure during curing, the resulting compressive strengths may be used to determine optimum processing conditions. A 'cure-on-the-loom' manufacturing process was developed to produce braided composites with controlled levels of crimping. This method allowed for controlled levels of tension to be placed on the axial yarns and maintained during the curing process. With increasing tension, the crimp severity in the axial yarns was reduced. Thus, varying crimp severities were produced ranging from conventional levels (greater than 10 deg) to virtually straight axial yarns. Test results indicate that a 30 % increase in compressive strength is obtainable by eliminating <b>axial</b> <b>yarn</b> crimping. Further compression testing is underway to quantify the relationship between crimp severity and compressive strength. Additional testing is planned to investigate the effect of crimping on the open-hole compressive strength, often considered a more significant design allowable...|$|E
5000|$|Braided {{composites}} have superior toughness {{and fatigue}} strength {{in comparison to}} filament wound composites. Woven fabrics have orthogonal interlacement while the braids can be constructed {{over a wide range}} of angles, from 10 to 858. An additional set of <b>axial</b> <b>yarns</b> can be introduced to the braiding process to produce triaxial braids (Fig. 1); triaxial braids are more stable and exhibit nearly isotropic properties. [...] Braids can be produced either as seamless tubes or flat fabrics with a continuous selvedge. Composites produced with the braided preforms exhibit superior strength and crack resistance in comparison to broadcloth composites, due to fiber continuity; Composites with braided holes (Fig.2) exhibit about 1.8 times the strength in comparison to drilled holes, again due to fiber continuity.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of novel braided structures using polyamide 6. 6 fibers for application as artificial anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs). The developed structures were circular braids, axially reinforced with either a number of core yarns or braided structures. Tensile behavior of these structures was characterized {{and the effects of}} number of <b>axial</b> <b>yarns</b> or braids and, the number of yarns used in the axial braids were thoroughly investigated. From the experimental results, it was observed that the braided structures with axial braids could mimic the load-elongation behaviour of native ACL. The average breaking extension and strain at toe region were 30 % and 4. 3 % respectively, which are in the range of native ACLs. The maximum breaking force and stiffness achieved with 7 axial braids, each produced using 6 yarns were 274 N and 13. 5 N/mm respectively and, both breaking force and stiffess showed linear increase with the number of axial braids as well as number of yarns used in the axial braids. Therefore, it is possible to design an artificial graft using these novel braided sturctures with mechanical properties similar to that of native ACLs, through adjustment of these structural parameters, as these braided structures have much smaller diameter (0. 5 mm) than native ACLs (11 mm) ...|$|R
30|$|An {{alternative}} to {{this approach is}} to use the FE method to directly replicate the braiding process. For example, Pickett et al. (2009) investigated the effect of different machine settings in the braiding of carbon tows over an irregular-shape preform. Shell elements were used to model the tooling surfaces whilst bar and beam elements were used for bias and unidirectional <b>axial</b> <b>yarns,</b> respectively. Material properties such as friction coefficients for yarn-to-yarn contact and yarns-to-tooling contact, and yarn bending were included in the modelling. Good correlation was found with respect to the experimental observations. Van Ravenhorst and Akkerman (2014) proposed an inverse-kinematic solution for the modelling and simulation of a circular braiding machine. They simulated the braiding process over a mandrel with an irregular cross-section and centre of symmetry. Models showed good correlation with experimental results, although the difference in braid angle was as high as 10 ∘ in certain regions of the overbraided mandrel. The assumptions made, such as no yarn interaction, no friction between yarns and other machine parts, zero yarn thickness and immobility of the yarns after being deposited, are deemed to be the cause of mismatch between prediction and experimental observations. As described in (Goyal et al. 2005; Pickett et al. 2009), it is challenging to capture the effective lenticular cross-sectional geometry of the bias yarns. The use of beam elements with a circular cross-section could lead to model inaccuracies at micro-scale level. For example, the lenticular shape the yarn adopts within a braid cannot be captured with such elements. Large errors, especially in the calculation of the transverse properties of the braid, may occur when the lenticular yarn shape is not properly modelled. Wang and Sun (2001); Wang et al. (2004, 2010) introduced the concept of “digital-elements” for the virtual manufacture of textile fabrics. Filaments in a yarn are discretised as a sequence of rod-elements connected by frictionless pins. This approach allows the simulation of a variety of textile manufacturing processes such as weaving or braiding, and investigation of the shape that the filaments assume during the conversion into a textile. Numerical results matched well with experimental observations.|$|R

Microscopic evidence of the microstructure reveals that the cross-sections of the <b>axial</b> <b>yarn</b> are variable along its central axial due to the lateral compression from the adjacent braiding yarns. On the basis of microscopic observations, a dense but non-intersecting geometry internal unit cell model of 3 D five-directional braided composites is established.
