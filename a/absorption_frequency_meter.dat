40|$|Cyclopentasilane (CPS) and polydihydrosilane, which {{consist of}} {{hydrogen}} and silicon only, are unique materials {{that can be}} used to produce intrinsic silicon film in a liquid process, such as spin coating or an ink-jet method. Wettability and solubility of general organic solvents including the above can be estimated by Hamaker constants, which are calculated according to the Lifshitz theory. In order to calculate a Hamaker constant by the simple spectral method (SSM), it is necessary to obtain <b>absorption</b> <b>frequency</b> and function of oscillator strength in the ultraviolet region. In this report, these physical quantities were obtained by means of an optical method. As a result of examination of the relation between molecular structures and ultraviolet <b>absorption</b> <b>frequencies,</b> which were obtained from various liquid materials, it was concluded that ultraviolet <b>absorption</b> <b>frequencies</b> became smaller as electrons were delocalized. In particular, the <b>absorption</b> <b>frequencies</b> were found to be very small for CPS and polydihydrosilane due to σ-conjugate of their electrons.

30|$|As we have {{discussed}} before, the increase of peak absorption rate and <b>absorption</b> <b>frequency</b> slows down {{with the increase of}} line width and remains unchanged when the line width is bigger than a certain value. Now, it becomes clear that, this effect is not only attributed to the change of line width, the increase of line width will lead to the decrease of spacing in the case of constant outside diameter of spiral antenna. The peak absorption rate and <b>absorption</b> <b>frequency</b> increase with the increase of line width, while it has opposite change trend with the increase of spacing.|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  2 a that the peak {{absorption}} rate and the <b>absorption</b> <b>frequency</b> near 3  THz decrease with the increase of rotation angle when n[*]=[*] 1.0 ~ 1.3. Figure  2 b suggests that when n[*]=[*] 1.3 ~ 1.7, there is a very weak absorption near 3  THz. The peak <b>absorption</b> <b>frequency</b> at higher frequency decreases with the increase of rotation angle. The peak absorption rate increases when n[*]=[*] 1.3 ~ 1.5 and then decreases when n[*]=[*] 1.5 ~ 1.7 due to increasing rotation angle. Figure  2 c indicates that the peak absorption rate increases and the <b>absorption</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases near 3  THz with the increase of rotation angle when n[*]=[*] 1.8 ~ 2.1. Figure  2 d, e shows the THz wave absorption curves of microbridge structures with different rotation angles (360 *n) when n[*]=[*] 2.1 ~ 2.4 and n[*]=[*] 2.5 ~ 2.8, respectively. It is clear that the effects of rotation angle on THz wave absorption when n[*]=[*] 2.1 ~ 2.3, n[*]=[*] 2.3 ~ 2.5, and n[*]=[*] 2.5 ~ 2.8 are similar to the effects when n[*]=[*] 1 ~ 1.3, n[*]=[*] 1.3 ~ 1.5, and n[*]=[*] 1.5 ~ 1.8, respectively. This can also be concluded from Fig.  2 f, which shows the variation of peak absorption rate and <b>absorption</b> <b>frequency</b> when n changes in 1 ~ 2.8.

40|$|Detecting the {{frequency}} of the mains supply is a crucial component of maintaining the grid frequency at its nominal level. Most frequency counters enable the user to monitor frequencies but monitoring frequency variations at a high resolution is often expensive. Electronic systems that measure frequency also have to generate a local time base to calculate {{the frequency}} upon. All time bases suffer from the effect of frequency jitter, which makes the timing source deviate from the nominal second by a quantified amount. Modern systems have improved drastically and have relatively insignificant jitter for most timing applications, but high-precision applications require a quantification of this source of timing error. The purpose of this thesis is to document the background, implementation, testing, results and identified future improvements for a <b>frequency</b> <b>meter</b> that can record minor fluctuations of the grid frequency. By achieving this objective, the grid supply and demand data can be logged and used for several applications, such as network forecasting or maintaining nominal grid frequency. An extensive research period was required to determine key design facets pertaining to the <b>frequency</b> <b>meter.</b> Key identified tasks included choosing a timing source, finding a suitable software development platform and associated hardware, developing a graphical software implementation that displays real-time frequency fluctuations, contingency alarming for nominal frequency deviation events, communications design between the <b>frequency</b> <b>meter</b> and the PC, quantifying clock precision and evaluating the performance of the final <b>frequency</b> <b>meter.</b> A GPS time source was chosen to provide an accurate source of 1 second pulses. An Arduino Due microcontroller used a KX- 7 quartz crystal oscillator to maintain its time base and the accuracy of the KX- 7 ’s time base was analysed against the Trimble Copernicus II and GlobalSat EM 406 -A GPS receivers’ time base. When analysed relative to the GPS receivers’ accurate time base, the KX- 7 maintained a low time base variation, well within it’s data sheet specifications. The Arduino Due microcontroller was programmed and provided relevant frequency data to a LabVIEW PC terminal, which allowed frequency visualisation, data storage, grid frequency contingency detection, recovery time logging, GPS initialisation data and cross-platform communication protocols. Frequency data was logged on the <b>frequency</b> <b>meter</b> and was able to provide a microHertz resolution. The primary limitation of the design was low-level noise on the mains supply line as this affected the designed electronics when logging frequency measurements below the milliHertz range.
