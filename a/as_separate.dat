5|$|A {{number of}} subgenera have been {{proposed}} over the years. For instance in the 1870s and 1880s John Gilbert Baker considerably reorganised Hippeastrum. In 1878 he described nine sections of the genus, but by 1888 he included seven subgenera, namely (number of species in parentheses) Habranthus (10), Phycella (3), Rhodophiala (5), Macropododastrum (1), Omphalissa (6), Aschamia (10) and Lais (3), {{some of which have}} since been treated <b>as</b> <b>separate</b> genera (Habranthus, Rhodophiala). Baker both reduced the original number of species of Herbert, but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as Habranthus, Phycella, Rhodophiala and Rhodolirion (also called Rhodolirium, and subsequently moved to Rhodophilia), which he included <b>as</b> <b>separate</b> sections of Hippeastrum. In addition, he included many new species being discovered in South America, particularly Chile. His 1878 classification included 47 species, reduced to 38 by 1888.|$|E

5|$|Historically both {{wide and}} narrow {{interpretations of the}} genus have been proposed. In the nineteenth century genus {{splitting}} was common, favouring the narrow view. Haworth (1831) using a narrow view treated many species <b>as</b> <b>separate</b> genera, as did Salisbury (1866). These authors listed various species in related genera such as Queltia (hybrids), Ajax(=Pseudonarcissus) and Hermione(=Tazettae), sixteen in all in Haworth's classification. In contrast, Herbert (1837) took a very wide view reducing Harworth's sixteen genera to six. Herbert, treating the Amaryllidacea as an 'order' as was common then, considered the narcissi to be a suborder, the Narcisseae, the six genera being Corbularia, Ajax, Ganymedes, Queltia, Narcissus and Hermione and his relatively narrow circumscription of Narcissus having only three species. Later Spach (1846) took an even wider view bringing most of Harworth's genera into the genus Narcissus, but <b>as</b> <b>separate</b> subgenera. By the time that Baker (1875) wrote his monograph all of the genera with one exception were included as Narcissus. The exception was the monotypic group Tapeinanthus which various subsequent authors have chosen to either exclude (e.g. Cullen 1986) or include (e.g. Webb 1978, 1980). Today it is nearly always included.|$|E

The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of marbled newts and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian crested newt was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|E

In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed {{as a consequence of the}} geometry of spacetime.|$|E

40|$|Pure Rabbit’s IgG {{was used}} in this study to raise donkey anti rabbit’s sera to be used <b>as</b> <b>separating</b> agent in radioimmunoassay. Two healthy donkeys have been immunized. The anti rabbit’s sera have been titrated as (i) crude, (ii) {{purified}} and (iii) purified and dialyzed coupled to magnetic particles. Then this antibody was used <b>as</b> <b>separating</b> agent in a radioimmunoassay kit for measurment of human prolactin (PRL). Coupled Sudanese donkey anti rabbit’s sera (Sud- DARS) was used as 1 / 8 titre using Chelsea RIA kit for human prolactin while 1 / 200 of liquid Sud-DARS was found to be the best titre using the Chinese kit. The best conditions for estimation of the prolactin were optimized by determining the suitable incubation time and temperature. The assay can be done at room temperature but it should be incubated for 6 hours as recommended by the Chinese kit. Validity tests were done. The regression coeffecients were 0. 994 and 0. 999 for linearity and recovery tests respectively. Measurment of human PRL was found to be reproducible using Sud-DARS <b>as</b> <b>separating</b> agent since the Coefficient of variation (C. V. %) was found to be less than 15 % for both within batch and between assays. Comparing Sud-DARS to the Chinese kit <b>separating</b> agent <b>as</b> reference agent, regression coeffecient was found to be 0. 977 which indicates that Sud-DARS can be used <b>as</b> <b>separating</b> agent. Prolactin in Sudanese subjects was determined using the Chinese kit with the Sud- DARS <b>as</b> <b>separating</b> agent. The ranges were 74 – 398 mIU/L in males and 102 – 414 mIU/L in the preovulatory phase for the females while in the post ovulatory phase it was 114 – 442 mIU/L.
