50|$|JPTS {{stands for}} Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (high thermal stability, high {{altitude}} fuel), and was created specifically as {{fuel for the}} Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. It is officially called Thermally Stable <b>Aviation</b> <b>Turbine</b> <b>Fuel.</b> JPTS has a lower freeze point, higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard Air Force fuels. In 1999 the United States Air Force spent approximately $11.3 million on fuel for the Lockheed U-2 aircraft, and {{was looking for a}} lower cost alternative. The U-2 has used JPTS since the aircraft's development in the 1950s. The high viscosity is needed to overcome the partial solidification of the fuel in low temperatures. The fuel also serves as coolant of engines and aerodynamically heated surfaces. As the fuel flow at U-2 operation altitude at cruising flight is about sixteen times lower than at sea level, the dwell time over hot surfaces is longer and increases the chances of thermal breakdown; high thermal stability is therefore desired to avoid coking and deposition of varnishes in the piping.|$|E
50|$|On June 4 1968, {{the second}} {{prototype}} of the XV-4B Hummingbird rolled out. Just like the XV-4A, the XV-4B used vertical takeoff and landing systems (VTOL) as well as conventional flight methods. Upon takeoff the aircraft weighed 5706 kg. The wingspan was 7.8m, {{and it had a}} top speed of 883 km/h with a cruising speed of 630 km/h (.68 mach). It had a range of 965 km and was able to climb at a rate of 3660m/minute. The XV-4B was 10.36m long. The heaviest part of the plane was the propulsion system, which weighed in at 1466 kg. The initial service life of the aircraft was intended to be 500 hours, but the aircraft was destroyed in 1969 during testing, long before the designated goal. The fuel tanks were located internally, with boost pumps and jet ejectors, along with the associated valves. The tanks were located {{in the front of the}} fuselage and could hold a total of 740 gallons of <b>aviation</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>fuel.</b> Because of the forward position of the tanks, fuel had to be consumed evenly. An unbalance in the fuel tanks of over 100 gallons ran the risk of destabilizing the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{interest}} {{in research and}} technology concerning <b>aviation</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>fuels</b> and their properties was prompted by recent changes in the supply and demand situation of these fuels.

In addition, there were occasional local supply disruptions and gradual shifts in delivered values of certain fuel properties. Dwindling petroleum reserves and the politically sensitive nature of the major world suppliers make the continuation of these trends likely.
