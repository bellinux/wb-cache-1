The first concert included Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, B.B. King, Roy Orbison, and Neil Young among many others, and raised over $9million for America's family farmers.

25|$|As {{early as}} 1809 Amish were farming {{side by side}} with Native <b>American</b> <b>farmers</b> in Pennsylvania.

25|$|The crucial trap for the {{development}} of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the Fertile Crescent since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, <b>American</b> <b>farmers</b> had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, teosinte.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many white}} <b>American</b> <b>farmers,</b> the white {{businessmen}} of Hawaii {{had their own}} motives for determining {{how to deal with}} the Japanese Americans, but they opposed internment. Instead, these individuals gained passage of legislation to retain in freedom the nearly 150,000 Japanese Americans who would have been otherwise sent to internment camps within Hawaii. As a result, only 1,200 to 1,800 Japanese Americans in Hawaii were interned.|$|E
25|$|He took {{a leading}} part in {{developing}} agricultural co-operation, {{of which he}} had learned from isolated <b>American</b> <b>farmers,</b> taking account of Scandinavian models of co-operation and the invention of the steam-powered cream separator. Working with a few colleagues, including two members of the clergy, and advocating self-reliance, he set his ideas into practice first among dairy farmers in the south of Ireland, who established Ireland's first cooperative at Doneraile, County Cork. He also opened the first creamery in Dromcollogher, County Limerick.|$|E
25|$|The weak central {{government}} could not back its policies with military strength, embarrassing it in foreign affairs. The British refused to withdraw their {{troops from the}} forts and trading posts in the new nation's Northwest Territory, as they had agreed {{to do in the}} Treaty of Paris of 1783. British officers on the northern boundaries and Spanish officers to the south supplied arms to Native American tribes, allowing them to attack American settlers.

25|$|In the 17th century, Pilgrims, Puritans, and Quakers fleeing {{religious}} persecution in Europe {{brought with them}} plowshares, guns, and domesticated animals like cows and pigs. These immigrants and other European colonists initially farmed subsistence crops like corn, wheat, rye, and oats as well as rendering potash and maple syrup for trade. Due to the more temperate climate, large-scale plantations in the American South grew labor-intensive cash crops like sugarcane, rice, cotton, and tobacco requiring native and imported African slave labor to maintain. Early <b>American</b> <b>farmers</b> were not self-sufficient; they relied upon other farmers, specialized craftsman, and merchants to provide tools, process their harvests, {{and bring them to}} market.|$|E
25|$|First {{steps were}} taken into {{politics}} {{in the fall of}} 1890, with a Nationalist state ticket put forward in the state of Rhode Island and at least one candidate running for office under the Nationalist banner in California. The possible emergency of a Nationalist Party was undercut by the birth of a new political organization in the field, however, with the People's Party ("Populists") immediately gaining the support of a broad segment of <b>American</b> <b>farmers</b> across the Midwest, South, and West. The violent Homestead Strike of 1892 also served as a catalyst for oppositional politics in the United States. These events served to politicize not only the Nationalist Clubs but Bellamy himself and he entered the political fray.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, they {{required}} paying in hard currency, not in worthless Soviet rubles. Stalin desperately wanted their weapons, including anti-aircraft guns, howitzers, anti-tank guns, machine guns etc., {{but he was}} critically short of money. As Russia had been a major wheat exporter before the First World War, he decided to expel his recalcitrant kulak peasant farmers to the wastes of Siberia and create huge collective farms on their land like the 50,000 hectare farm that Krupp had created in the North Caucasus. Thus, in 1930 and 1931, a huge deluge of Soviet wheat at slave labour prices flooded unsuspecting world markets, where surpluses already prevailed, thereby causing poverty and distress to North <b>American</b> <b>farmers.</b> However, Stalin secured the precious foreign currency to pay for German armaments.|$|E

25|$|When the British {{evacuated}} New York City in 1783, {{they took}} many Loyalist refugees to Nova Scotia, while other Loyalists went to southwestern Quebec. So many Loyalists {{arrived on the}} shores of the St. John River that a separate colony—New Brunswick—was created in 1784; followed in 1791 by the division of Quebec into the largely French-speaking Lower Canada (French Canada) along the St. Lawrence River and Gaspé Peninsula and an anglophone Loyalist Upper Canada, with its capital settled by 1796 in York, in present-day Toronto. After 1790 most of the new settlers were <b>American</b> <b>farmers</b> searching for new lands; although generally favorable to republicanism, they were relatively non-political and stayed neutral in the War of 1812. In 1785 Saint John, New Brunswick became the first incorporated city in what would later become Canada.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Ralph Nader, {{with the help}} of law and {{graduate}} students, sought to expose disquieting and sometimes corrupting relationships between industry and government regulatory agencies, whose duty it was to act in the public interest. Notorious among those relationships were the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and United States railroads. Members of Congress, such as Senators Lee Metcalf (Montana) and Warren Magnuson (Washington), also had exposed the relationship and its harmful effects on <b>American</b> <b>farmers,</b> consumers and shippers. This public and congressional scrutiny occurred during the tumult of the Vietnam War, especially in Washington, D.C., and the fledgling environmental movement led, in Congress, by Senators Edmund Muskie (Maine) and Henry Jackson (Washington). Among the laws enacted was the National Environmental Policy Act, effective January 1, 1970.|$|E
25|$|The demand had {{increased}} so much after 1776, that many farmers {{were unable to}} meet the demands for exports, which increased the prices of tobacco even further. With a desire {{to increase the amount of}} tobacco available, many <b>American</b> <b>farmers</b> took out credit loans from the British to increase the size of their landholdings as well as increase the number of slaves they owned. Much of this credit went to gentleman farmers, but the desire for tobacco was so strong that even middle class farmers found it easy to receive loans to increase their farm production. Many of these farmers opted not to pay back these loans however, and many in turn found themselves jailed toward the end of the century for not paying their debts. Many of these debtors were small farmers, causing a further consolidation of smaller farms into larger ones.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} {{to pressure from}} some <b>American</b> <b>farmers</b> and agribusiness, the embargo was relaxed by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, which {{was passed by the}} Congress in October 2000 and signed by President Bill Clinton. The relaxation allowed the sale of agricultural goods and medicine to Cuba for humanitarian reasons. Although Cuba initially declined to engage in such trade (having even refused U.S. food aid in the past, seeing it as a half-measure serving U.S. interests), the Cuban government began to allow the purchase of food from the U.S. as a result of Hurricane Michelle in November 2001. These purchases have grown since then, even though all sales are made in cash. In 2007, the U.S. was the largest food supplier of Cuba, which nevertheless is largely self-sufficient, and its fifth largest trading partner.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single [...] "We Are the World". He {{also joined}} Artists United Against Apartheid {{providing}} vocals for their single [...] "Sun City". On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe they can just {{take a little bit of}} it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." [...] His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt-ridden <b>American</b> <b>farmers.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the 86th United States Congress, McGovern was {{assigned}} to the House Committee on Agriculture. The longtime chair of the committee, Harold D. Cooley, would subsequently say, [...] "I cannot recall a single member of Congress who has fought more vigorously or intelligently for <b>American</b> <b>farmers</b> than Congressman McGovern." [...] He helped pass a new food-stamp law. He was one of nine representatives from Congress to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly conferences of 1958 and 1959. Along with Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, McGovern strongly advocated a reconstruction of Public Law 480 (an agricultural surplus act which had come into being under Eisenhower) with a greater emphasis on feeding the hungry around the world, the establishment of an executive office to run operations, and the goal of promoting peace and stability around the world. During his time in the House, McGovern was regarded as a liberal overall, and voted in accordance with the rated positions of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) 34 times and against 3 times. Two of the themes of his House career, improvements for rural America and the war on hunger, would be defining ones of his legislative career and public life.|$|E
