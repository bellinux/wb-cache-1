The center <b>and</b> <b>surround</b> responses were also decomposed into their linear and nonlinear components so that the response dynamics of the linear and nonlinear components could be measured. We found that the concentric organization of the receptive field was determined by linear components, i. e., the first-order kernels generated by the center <b>and</b> <b>surround</b> were of opposite polarity. Both the center <b>and</b> <b>surround</b> generated second-order kernels with similar signatures, i. e., the second-order components formed a monotonic receptive field.
