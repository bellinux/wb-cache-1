5|$|Defenders of Ardania is a tower defense {{game that}} also has {{offensive}} real-time strategy elements.

The game is won if units spawned by the player get past the opponent's towers <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> the opponent's base before the opponent's units get past the player's towers <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> the player's base.|$|E

After several bases have been destroyed in succession, new and increasingly hazardous varieties of flying aliens assault the player. Each base must be destroyed within a strict time limit. If this limit expires before the base is destroyed, two missiles are launched from the base—one for Earth, the other for Jetman's rover. The player will be given a limited time to intercept <b>and</b> <b>destroy</b> the missiles whilst still in flight, thus preventing a game over.|$|E
