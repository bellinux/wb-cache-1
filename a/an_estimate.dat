5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination {{of the speed of}} light). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with <b>an</b> <b>estimate</b> for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain <b>an</b> <b>estimate</b> of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E
5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to <b>an</b> <b>estimate</b> by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides <b>an</b> <b>estimate</b> of the date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>estimate</b> of a horse's age can be {{made from}} looking at its teeth. The teeth {{continue}} to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Brown put {{the odds}} for the {{existence}} of Planet Nine at about 90%. Greg Laughlin, one of the few researchers who knew in advance about this paper, gives <b>an</b> <b>estimate</b> of 68.3%. Other skeptical scientists demand more data in terms of additional KBOs to be analysed or final evidence through photographic confirmation. Brown, though conceding the skeptics' point, still thinks that there is enough data to mount a search for a new planet.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the outcome}} of the {{continental}} migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives <b>an</b> <b>estimate</b> that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodiversity}} of the prokaryotes is unknown, {{but may be}} very large.
