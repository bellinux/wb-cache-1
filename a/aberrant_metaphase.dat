40|$|ABSTRACT A temperature-sensitive Syrian hamster {{mutant cell}} line, ts- 745, exhibiting novel mitotic events has been isolated. The cells show normal growth and mitosis at 33 °C, the {{permissive}} temperature. At the nonpermissive temperature of 39 °C, mitotic progression becomes <b>aberrant.</b> <b>Metaphase</b> cells and those cells {{still able to}} form a metaphase configuration continue through and complete normal cell division. However, cells exposed to 39 °C for longer than 15 min can not form a normal metaphase spindle. Instead, the chromosomes are distributed in a spherical shell, with microtubules (MT) radiating to the chromosomes from four closely associated centrioles {{near the center of}} the cell. The cells progress from the spherical monopolar state to other monopolar orientations conical in appearance with four centrioles in the apex region. Organized chromosome movement is present, from the spherical shell state to the asymmetrical orientations. Chromosomes remain in the metaphase configuration without chromatid separation. Prometaphase chromosome congression appears normal, as the chromosomes and MT form a stable monopolar spindle, but bipolar spindle formation is apparently blocked in a premetaphase state. When returned from 39 ° to 33 °C, the defective phenotype is readily reversible...|$|E
40|$|International audienceZFPIP (Zinc Finger Pbx 1 Interacting Protein) {{has been}} {{recently}} identified in our laboratory in a yeast two hybrid screen using an embryonic mouse cDNA library and PBX 1 as a bait. This gene encodes a large protein (250 kDa) {{that contains a}} bipartite NLS, numerous C 2 H 2 zinc fingers and is highly conserved amongst vertebrates. In order to address the role of ZFPIP during embryonic development, we analysed the expression pattern of the gene and performed morpholinos injections into Xenopus laevis embryos. We first showed that the ZFPIP protein was maternally present in oocytes. Then, ZFPIP was detected from morula to neurula stages in {{the nucleus of the}} cells, with a gradient from animal to vegetal pole. By injection of ZFPIP morpholinos, we showed that morphant embryos were unable to undergo proper gastrulation and subsequently exhibited a persistent opened blastopore. Analysis of molecular and cellular events that were altered in morphant embryos highlighted an impairment of cell division processes as illustrated by atypical mitosis with <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphase,</b> anaphase or telophase, incomplete chromosome segregation or conjointed nuclei.

40|$|SummaryMetaphase {{describes}} {{a phase of}} mitosis where chromosomes are attached and oriented on the bipolar spindle for subsequent segregation at anaphase. In diverse cell types, the metaphase spindle is maintained at characteristic constant length [1 – 3]. Metaphase spindle length is proposed to be regulated by a balance of pushing and pulling forces generated by distinct sets of spindle microtubules (MTs) and their interactions with motors and MT-associated proteins (MAPs). Spindle length is further proposed to be important for chromosome segregation fidelity, as cells with shorter- or longer-than-normal metaphase spindles, generated through deletion or inhibition of individual mitotic motors or MAPs, showed chromosome segregation defects. To test the force-balance model of spindle length control {{and its effect on}} chromosome segregation, we applied fast microfluidic temperature control with live-cell imaging to monitor the effect of deleting or switching off different combinations of antagonistic force contributors in the fission yeast metaphase spindle. We show that the spindle midzone proteins kinesin- 5 cut 7 p and MT bundler ase 1 p contribute to outward-pushing forces and that the spindle kinetochore proteins kinesin- 8 klp 5 / 6 p and dam 1 p contribute to inward-pulling forces. Removing these proteins individually led to <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphase</b> spindle length and chromosome segregation defects. Removing these proteins in antagonistic combination rescued the defective spindle length and in some combinations also partially rescued chromosome segregation defects...|$|E

40|$|Sulfasalazine (SAZ), a {{prescribed}} drug for inflammatory bowel disease, {{is a potent}} scavenger of reactive oxygen species. The present study was undertaken to ascertain its ability to protect against gamma radiation-induced dam-age. Acute toxicity of the drug was studied taking 24 -h, 72 -h and 30 -day mortality after a single intraperitoneal injection of 400 – 1200 mg/kg body weight (b. wt.) of the drug. The drug LD 50 for 24 - and 72 -h/ 30 -day survival {{were found to be}} 933 and 676 mg/kg b. wt., respectively. The optimum time of drug administration and drug dose-dependent effect on in vivo radiation protection of bone marrow chromosomes was studied in mice. Injection of 30 – 180 mg/kg SAZ 30 min before gamma irradiation (RT) with 4 Gy produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in the RT-induced percent <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h after exposure, with a corresponding decrease in the different types of aberrations. The optimum dose for protection without drug toxicity was 120 mg/kg b. wt. At this dose, SAZ produced> 60 % reduction in the RT-induced percent <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> and micronucleated erythrocytes. SAZ also produced {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to normochromatic erythro-cytes from that of irradiated control. Injection of 120 mg/ kg of the drug 60 or 30 min before or within 15 min after 4 Gy whole-body RT resulted in a significant decrease in the percent of <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h post-irradiation; the maximum effect was seen when the drug was administered 30 min before irradiation. These results show that SAZ protect mice against RT-induced chromosomal damage and cell cycle progression delay. SAZ also protected plasmid DNA (pGEM- 7 Zf) against Fenton’s reactant-induced breaks, suggesting free radical scavenging as one of the possible mechanism for radiation protection...|$|R

40|$|Cryopreservation {{of female}} {{reproductive}} cells allows preservation of fertility and provides materials for research. Although freezing protocols have been optimized, {{and there is}} a high survival rate after thawing, the in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy rate is still lower in cycles with cryopreserved oocytes, thus highlighting the importance of identifying intrinsic limiting factors characterizing the cells at time of freezing. The aim of the present study is to investigate in the mouse model the impact of reproductive aging and postovulatory aging on oocyte biological competence after vitrification. Metaphase II oocytes were vitrified soon after retrieval from young and reproductively old mice. Part of the oocytes from young animals was vitrified after 6 h incubation (in vitro aged oocytes). All classes of oocytes showed similar survival rate after vitrification. Moreover, vitrification did not alter chromosomal organization in young cells, whereas in vitro aged and old oocytes presented an increase of slightly <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphase</b> configurations. Compared to fresh young oocytes, in vitro aged and old oocytes showed increased ROS levels which remained unchanged after vitrification. By contrast, cryopreservation significantly increased ROS production in young oocytes. Both the aging processes negatively impacted oocyte ability to undergo pronucleus formation and first cleavage after vitrification by stimulating cellular fragmentation. These results could be helpful for establishing the correct time table for cryopreservation in the laboratory routine and improving its application in reproductively old females.

40|$|The {{partner and}} {{localiser}} of BRCA 2 (PALB 2) plays {{important roles in}} the maintenance of genome integrity and protection against cancer. Although PALB 2 is commonly described as a repair factor recruited to sites of DNA breaks, recent studies provide evidence that PALB 2 also associates with unperturbed chromatin. Here, we investigated the previously poorly described role of chromatin-associated PALB 2 in undamaged cells. We found that PALB 2 associates with active genes through its major binding partner, MRG 15, which recognizes histone H 3 trimethylated at lysine 36 (H 3 K 36 me 3) by the SETD 2 methyltransferase. Missense mutations that ablate PALB 2 binding to MRG 15 confer elevated sensitivity to the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) and increased levels of <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphase</b> chromosomes and DNA stress in gene bodies, which were suppressed by preventing DNA replication. Remarkably, the level of PALB 2 at genic regions was frequently decreased, rather than increased, upon CPT treatment. We propose that the steady-state presence of PALB 2 at active genes, mediated through the SETD 2 /H 3 K 36 me 3 /MRG 15 axis, ensures an immediate response to DNA stress and therefore effective protection of these regions during DNA replication. This study provides a conceptual advance in demonstrating that the constitutive chromatin association of repair factors {{plays a key role}} in the maintenance of genome stability and furthers our understanding of why PALB 2 defects lead to human genome instability syndromes...|$|E

40|$|The anti-tumor {{effects of}} {{chemotherapy}} and radiation {{are thought to}} be mediated by triggering G 1 /S or G 2 /M cell cycle checkpoints, while spindle poisons, such as paclitaxel, block metaphase exit by initiating the spindle assembly checkpoint. In contrast, we have found that 150 kilohertz (kHz) alternating electric fields, also known as Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), perturbed cells at the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Cells exposed to the TTFields during mitosis showed normal progression to this point, but exhibited uncontrolled membrane blebbing that coincided with metaphase exit. The ability of such alternating electric fields to affect cellular physiology is likely to be dependent on their interactions with proteins possessing high dipole moments. The mitotic Septin complex consisting of Septin 2, 6 and 7, possesses a high calculated dipole moment of 2711 Debyes (D) and plays a central role in positioning the cytokinetic cleavage furrow, and governing its contraction during ingression. We showed that during anaphase, TTFields inhibited Septin localization to the anaphase spindle midline and cytokinetic furrow, as well as its association with microtubules during cell attachment and spreading on fibronectin. After <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphase</b> exit as a consequence of TTFields exposure, cells exhibited aberrant nuclear architecture and signs of cellular stress including an overall decrease in cellular proliferation, followed by apoptosis that was strongly influenced by the p 53 mutational status.

40|$|Mitosis is a {{key event}} {{in the life of}} a cell, where {{duplicated}} chromosomes are separated into the daughter cells. Defects associated with chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer. Chromosome segregation is achieved by the mitotic spindle, which is composed of microtubules (MTs), motors and microtubule associated protein (MAPs). Motors such as kinesins generate forces within the spindle while MAPs perform functions such as organize the spindle pole and maintain the bipolar spindle. Both motors and MAPs contribute to spindle mechanics. Here I used the relatively simple fission yeast to address how defects in spindle mechanics affect chromosome segregation. The metaphase spindle is maintained at a constant length by an antagonistic force-balance model yet how the regulation of metaphase spindle length contribute to subsequent chromosome segregation remains unexplored. To test the force-balance model, I applied gene deletion and fast microfluidic temperature-control with live-cell imaging to monitor the effect of deleting or switching off different combinations of antagonistic forces in the fission yeast metaphase spindle. I show that kinesin- 5 cut 7 p and MT bundler ase 1 p contribute to outward pushing forces, and kinesin- 8 klp 5 / 6 p and dam 1 p contribute to inward pulling forces. Removing these proteins individually led to <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphase</b> spindle length and chromosome segregation defects. Removing these proteins in antagonistic combination rescued the defective spindle length and, in some combinations, also partially rescued chromosome segregation defects. ^ Motors and MAPs cooperate to focus MTs at the spindle pole. Defects in MT focusing lead to defects in chromosome segregation, resulting in aneuploidy. The mechanism behind these observations is not well understood. Here I identified a new mechanism for aneuploidy in fission yeast. Kinesin- 14 pkl 1 p and MAP msd 1 p localize to the spindle poles and focus the MT minus ends. Their absence leads to pole and MT defocusing, resulting in protrusion of MT minus ends due to cut 7 p-dependent pushing forces at the spindle midzone. Infrequent long MT minus end protrusions can push the already separated chromosome mass back to the cell center, where cytokinesis will 2 ̆ 7 cut 2 ̆ 7 the chromosome mass, creating two daughter cells with unequal chromosome content. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} summary {{represents a}} {{consensus of the}} working group, except where noted. The goal of this working group was to identify the minimal requirements needed to conduct a scientifically valid and practical in vivo chromosomal aberration assay. For easy reference, the items discussed {{are listed in the}} order in which they appear in OECD guideline 475. Specific disagreement with the current and/or proposed OECD guideline is presented in the text. Introduction, purpose, scope, relevance, application, and limits of test: This test would not be appropriate in situations where there was sufficient evidence to indicate that the test article or reactive metabolites could not reach the bone marrow. Test substances: Solid and liquid test substances should be dissolved, if possible, in water or isotonic saline. If insoluble in water/saline, the test substance should be dissolved or homogeneously suspended in an appropriate vehicle (e. g. vegetable oil). A suspension was not considered suitable for an intravenous injection. The use of dimethyl sulfoxide as an organic solvent was not recommended. The use of any uncommonly used solvent/vehicle should be justified. Freshly prepared solutions or suspensions of the test substance should be employed unless stability data demonstrate the acceptability of storage. Selection of species: Any commonly used rodent species was deemed acceptable but rats or mice were preferred, with no strain preference. Number and sex: A consensus could not be reached as to the requirement for both sexes versus one sex in this assay. It was suggested that a single sex should be used unless pharmacokinetic and/or toxicity data indicated a difference in metabolism and/or sensitivity between males and females. The size of the experiment (i. e. number of cells per animal, number of animals per treatment group) should be based on statistical considerations. Lacking a formal analysis, it was agreed that at least 100 metaphase cells should be scored per animal while at least five animals of any one sex should be evaluated per treatment group. Recently, a formal analysis of the numbers of cells to score per animal and numbers of animals to score per treatment group was conducted at a workshop on statistics for in vivo mutagenicity tests (Adler et al. 1994). The conclusion of this workshop was that, based on a type I error of 0. 05 and a power of 80 % to detect at least a doubling in the control frequency, the minimal number of cells to score per animal was 200 and the minimal number of animals to score per sex per treatment group was four. Treatment schedule: Both single and multiple treatment regimens were considered acceptable, as long as a genotoxic effect had been demonstrated or, for a negative study, as long as toxicity had been demonstrated or the limit dose (2000 mg/kg/day for 1 - 14 days, 1000 mg/kg/day for greater than 14 days) had been used. Dose levels: The dose-finding test should be conducted in the same sex, strain, and species, using the same treatment protocol and solvent/vehicle as proposed for the chromosomal aberration test. The maximum testable dose should be determined independently in males and females. The highest dose tested should be based on mortality, bone marrow cell toxicity, or clinical symptoms of toxicity related to the test compound. If the selection of the highest dose is based on mortality or toxicity, then at least three dose levels spaced by a factor of between 2 and/ 10 should be used. However, a single 'limit dose' was deemed acceptable if {{there was no evidence of}} mortality or toxicity. Controls: A negative control group must be included at all sampling times, while a concurrent positive control group must be included in each test. Performance of the test: When a single treatment protocol is used, bone marrow samples should be collected at two sample times (12 - 18 h, 36 - 44 h) after treatment. When a multiple treatment schedule (i. e. two or more administrations) is used, a single sample should be obtained between 12 and 18 h after the last treatment. Analysis: All slides should be coded prior to scoring. The acceptable range of chromosome counts for scorable metaphase cells is 2 N ± 1, where N is the haploid number of chromosomes for that species. During scoring, a record should be maintained of the various classes of chromosomal aberrations among cells. The laboratory should state the system of classification being used for scoring aberrations, and provide a clear definition of each type of aberration scored, including gaps. The minimal classes of aberrations to score and categorize would be chromatid-type versus chromosome-type and, among these two categories, gaps, breaks, and rearrangements. Treatment of results: To assess the clastogenicity of the test article, the number of metaphase cells containing at least one chromosomal aberration (including or excluding gaps depending on the criteria used for classifying gaps) should be evaluated. It was agreed that an appropriate statistical analysis combined with scientific judgement and experience was needed to evaluate the experimental results. A consensus could not be reached as to the merit of one statistical method or another. However, it was agreed that any statistical test for the analysis of clastogenic activity should be one-tailed. The historical negative control data should be used to determine if the concurrent control response was acceptable. Evaluation of results: An experimental test response would be classified as positive if the frequency of <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphase</b> cells was significantly increased in at least one dose group and if the increase was dose-dependent. If either, but not both, of these conditions were met, the experimental results would be classified as equivocal. If neither of these conditions was met, the experimental results would be classified as negative. A confirmatory test would be required whenever different interpretations of the results are likely. © 1994. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Here we demonstrate that antiapoptotic BCL- 2 family proteins promoted tumor formation of transformed baby mouse kidney (BMK) epithelial cells by antagonizing BAX- and BAK-dependent apoptosis. Cell death in vivo correlated with hypoxia and induction of PUMA (p 53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis). Strikingly, carcinomas formed by transformed BMK cells in which apoptosis was blocked by aberrant BCL- 2 family protein function displayed prevalent, highly polyploid, tumor giant cells. Examination of the transformed BMK cells in vivo revealed <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> and ploidy changes in tumors as early as 9 d after implantation, which progressed in magnitude during the tumorigenic process. An in vitro ischemia system mimicked the tumor microenvironment, and gain of BCL- 2 or loss of BAX and BAK was sufficient to confer resistance to apoptosis and to allow for accumulation of polyploid cells in vitro. These data suggest that in vivo, even in cells in which p 53 function is compromised, apoptosis is an essential response to hypoxia and ischemia in the tumor microenvironment and that abrogation of this response allows the survival of cells with abnormal genomes and promotes tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{antioxidants}} during chemotherapy {{has been}} shown to reduce or prevent the undesirable effects experienced by healthy cells. Micronutrient selenium is well known for its antioxidant properties; however, selenium exhibits a bimodal nature in that both its beneficial and toxic properties lie within a limited and narrow dose range. The present study investigated the possible protective effects of selenomethionine (SM) on the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and clastogenicity of the chemotherapic doxorubicin (DXR), a key chemotherapic used in cancer treatment. Human peripheral lymphocytes were treated in vitro with varying concentrations of SM (0. 25 mu M, 0. 5 mu M, 1. 0 mu M and 2. 0 mu M), tested in combination with DXR (0. 15 mu g/mL). SM alone was not cytotoxic and when combined with DXR treatment, reduced the DNA damage index significantly, the frequency of chromosomal aberrations, the number of <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> and the frequency of apoptotic cells. The mechanism of chemoprotection of SM may be related to its antioxidant properties as well as its ability to interfere with DNA repair pathways. Therefore this study showed that SM is effective in reducing the genetic damage induced by the antitumoral agent DXR. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an {{inherited}} disorder {{caused by a}} single nucleotide substitution in the P-globin gene. The clinical heterogeneity observed in SCD patients {{has been attributed to}} environmental and genetic factors. The patients are subjected to increased oxidative stress, particularly during vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest pain. Another possible cause of oxidative stress in SCD is the high concentration of iron in the patients` plasma. The increase in oxidative stress could be a relevant risk factor for mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Studies on the frequency of basal chromosomal aberrations in cultured lymphocytes from SCD patients have not been reported so far. In order to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} role of the different biomarkers and their relationship with the extremely variable clinical manifestation of SCD, we investigated the frequency of chromosome damage in peripheral lymphocytes from sickle cells patients and healthy controls. We found an increased frequency of chromosome damage and percentage of <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> in these patients when compared with control subjects, even at basal values (p < 0. 05). In the cytogenetic sensitivity assay, the results showed that these patients presented a marked decrease in the mitotic index values compared with healthy controls. Cisplatin-induced chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from these patients was significantly higher than the frequency measured in healthy controls. The results obtained in the present study showed that more investigations are needed in order to elucidate the susceptibility to genomic instability of SCD patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Traditional {{medicine}} and herbal prescriptions {{are becoming more}} popular, and they account for {{a large share of}} the worldâs healthcare research studies, developments, and market demands. Increasing scientific evidence of the substantive efficacies such as preventive health keeping pharmaceutical materials and dietary supplements can be found elsewhere. Above all, safety should be the critical premise for considering developmental materials such as pharmaceuticals without side effects and toxicity. Methods: The authors formulated KIOM 2012 H (K 2 H) using four herbs that were reported to have medicinal effectsâincluding anticancer, antiaging, antimicrobial, inflammation, and neuroprotective properties. In order to examine the toxicity, single and repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicities of bacterial mutation, micronucleus, and chromosomal aberration assays were conducted. Results: All experimental observations and results showed normal findings. Toxicities or abnormal signs were not observed in all experimental assays, including oral administration, animal behavior, clinical findings, and changes in body weight in vivo. In vitro bacterial cultures produced no revertant colonies, and no increased numbers of structural or numerical <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> were found in the metaphase chromosomes examined. Moreover, no significant increased frequency of micronucleus was observed in any of the doses used. Overall, no acute toxicity or genotoxicity was found in all analysis parameters in all the assays conducted. Conclusion: Reviewing the results as a whole, K 2 H extract was regarded as a safe material with no toxicity, and can be applied for the research and development of complementary and alternative medicines with improved efficacy in current therapeutic healthcare, based on traditional {{medicine and}} herb resources.

40|$|Asbestos is {{the main}} cause of human {{malignant}} mesothelioma (MM). In vivo, macrophages phagocytize asbestos and, in response, release TNF-α and other cytokines that contribute to carcinogenesis through unknown mechanisms. In vitro, asbestos does not induce transformation of primary human mesothelial cells (HM); instead, asbestos is very cytotoxic to HM, causing extensive cell death. This finding raised an apparent paradox: How can asbestos cause MM if HM exposed to asbestos die? We found that asbestos induced the secretion of TNF-α and the expression of TNF-α receptor I in HM. Treatment of HM with TNF-α significantly reduced asbestos cytotoxicity. Through numerous technical approaches, including chemical inhibitors and small interfering RNA strategies, we demonstrate that, in HM, TNF-α activates NF-κB and that NF-κB activation leads to HM survival and resistance to the cytotoxic effects of asbestos. Our data show a critical role for TNF-α and NF-κB signaling in mediating HM responses to asbestos. TNF-α signaling through NF-κB-dependent mechanisms increases the percent of HM that survives asbestos exposure, thus increasing the pool of asbestos-damaged HM that are susceptible to malignant transformation. Cytogenetics supported this hypothesis, showing only rare, <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> in HM exposed to asbestos and an increased mitotic rate with fewer irregular metaphases in HM exposed to both TNF-α and asbestos. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the paradoxical inability of asbestos to transform HM in vitro, elucidate and underscore the role of TNF-α in asbestos pathogenesis in humans, and identify potential molecular targets for anti-MM prevention and therapy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluoride is an {{essential}} trace element but also an environmental contaminant with major sources of exposure being drinking water, food and pesticides. Previous studies showed that sodium fluoride (NaF) at 5 mM or more is required to induce apoptosis and chromosome aberrations and proposed that DNA damage and apoptosis {{play an important role}} in toxicity of excessive fluoride. The aim of this study is directed to understand the nature of DNA-lesions induced by NaF by allowing its interaction with radiation induced DNA-lesions. NaF 5 mM was used after observing inability to induce DNA damages and apoptosis by single exposure with 50 μM or 1 mM NaF. Co-exposure to NaF and radiation significantly increased the frequency of <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> and exchange aberrations in human lymphocytes and arrested the cells in G 1 stage instead of apoptotic death. Flow cytometric analysis, DNA fragmentation and PARP-cleavage analysis clearly indicated that 5 mM NaF together with radiation (1 Gy) induced apoptosis in both U 87 and K 562 cells due to down regulation of expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, like Bcl 2 in U 87 and inhibitors of apoptotic proteins like survivin and cIAP in K 562 cells. This study herein suggested that single exposure with extremely low concentration of NaF unable to induce DNA lesions whereas higher concentration induced DNA lesions interact with the radiation-induced DNA lesions. Both are probably repaired rapidly thus showed increased interactive effect. Coexposure to NaF and radiation induces more apoptosis in cancer cell lines which could be due to increased exchange aberrations through lesions interaction and downregulating anti-apoptotic genes...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous V 79 Chinese hamster {{cells were}} exposed in G_ 1 -phase to either X-rays or 4. 6 MeV/u Ar-ions (LET: 1840 keV/#mu#m) and the {{induction}} of chromosomal damage was measured at 5 sampling times ranging from 14 to 30 hours after treatment. To distinguish between {{cells in the}} first and second postirradiation cycle the Fluorescence-plus-Giemsa technique was applied. The experiment showed that the time course of the appearance of damaged cells is markedly influenced by radiation induced cell cycle delays and depends on both radiation quality and dose. The yield of <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> and the number of aberrations per metaphase was found to increase with sampling time, but this increase was more pronounced for Ar ions. These differences in the yield time profiles of X-ray and Ar ion induced chromosomal damage are particularly important for an accurate determination of the RBE for particles. Our data clearly indicate that meaningful RBE values can only be obtained, if chromosomal damage is analyzed at several postirradiation samping times and the complete time course of the expression of chromosomal damage is taken into account. Besides these qualitative differences, differences in the spectrum of chromosomal lesions were observed for X-rays and Ar ions. The experimental results are interpreted {{on the basis of the}} different pattern of energy deposition by sparsely and densely ionizing radiation. In addition, a statistical analysis based on the Neyman type A distribution is performed, which takes into account the specific stochastic properties of practile irradiation. (orig.)

40|$|We {{performed}} a multicentric study {{to assess the}} impact of two different culture procedures on the detection of chromosomal abnormalities in 217 consecutive unselected cases with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) referred for routine analysis either at the time of diagnosis (n = 172) or during disease evolution (n = 45). Parallel cultures of peripheral blood or bone marrow were set up with the addition of either the conventional B-cell mitogen 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) or a combination of CpG oligonucleotide (CpG) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). Cytogenetic analyses were performed on both cultures. Clonal abnormalities were identified in 116 cases (53 %). In 78 cases (36 %), the aberrant clone was detected in both cultures. Among these, the percentages of <b>aberrant</b> <b>metaphases</b> were similar in both conditions in 17 cases, higher in the CpG/IL- 2 culture in 43 cases, and higher in the TPA culture in 18 cases. Clonal aberrations were detected in only one culture, either in CpG/IL- 2 or TPA in 33 (15 %) and 5 (2 %) cases, respectively. Taken together, abnormal karyotypes were observed in 51 % with CpG/IL- 2 and 38 % with TPA (P < 0. 0001). Application of FISH (n = 201) allowed the detection of abnormalities not visible by conventional cytogenetic analysis in 80 cases: del(13 q) (n = 71), del(11 q) (n = 5), + 12 (n = 2), del(14 q) (n = 1), and del(17 p) (n = 1). In conclusion, our results confirm that CpG/IL- 2 stimulation increases the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in CLL compared with TPA and that further improvement can be obtained by FISH. However, neither conventional cytogenetics nor FISH detected all aberrations, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of an 84 years old {{prostate}} cancer patient with severe side effects after radiotherapy in 2006. He was cytogenetically analysed in 2009 and in 2012 in a comparative study for individual radiosensitivity of prostate cancer patients. No other patient had clonal aberrations, but this patient showed ring chromosomes in the range of 21 – 25 % of lymphocytes. He received 5 cycles of 5 -fluorouracil/folic acid for chemotherapy of sigmoid colon carcinoma in 2003, three years before radiotherapy of prostate cancer. Blood samples were irradiated ex vivo with Cs- 137 γ-rays (0. 7 Gy/min) in the G 0 -phase of the cell cycle. 100 FISH painted metaphases were analysed for the control and the irradiated samples each. Multicolour in situ hybridisation techniques like mFISH and mBand as well as MYC locus, telomere and centromere painting probes were used to characterise ring metaphases. Metaphase search and autocapture was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope followed by scoring and image analysis using Metafer 4 /ISIS software (MetaSystems). In 2009 chromosome 8 rings were found in about 25 % of lymphocytes. Rings were stable over time and increased to about 30 % until 2012. The ring chromosome 8 always lacked telomere signals and a small amount of rings displayed up to four centromere signals.

40|$|Chromosomes are dynamic {{structures}} that are reorganized during the cell cycle to optimize them for distinct functions. SMC and non-SMC condensin proteins associate into complexes {{that have been}} implicated {{in the process of}} chromosome condensation. The roles of the individual non-SMC subunits of the complex are poorly understood, and mutations in the CAP-G subunit have not been described in metazoans. Here we elucidate a role for dCAP-G in chromosome condensation and cohesion in Drosophila. We illustrate the requirement of dCAP-G for condensation during prophase and prometaphase; however, we find that alternate mechanisms ensure that replicated chromosomes are condensed prior to metaphase. In contrast, dCAP-G is essential for chromosome condensation in metaphase of single, unreplicated sister chromatids, suggesting that there is an interplay between replicated chromatids and the condensin complex. In the dcap-g mutants, defects in sister-chromatid separation are also observed. Chromatid arms fail to resolve in prophase and are unable to separate at anaphase, whereas sister centromeres show <b>aberrant</b> separation in <b>metaphase</b> and successfully move to spindle poles at anaphase. We also identified a role for dCAP-G during interphase in regulating heterochromatic gene expression...|$|R

Caspase- 3 Combretastatin A- 4 (CA- 4), {{a natural}} stilbenoid isolated from Combretum caffrum, {{is a new}} vascular targeting agent (VTA) known for its antitumor activity due to its anti-tubulin properties. We investigated the molecular mechanisms leading to cell death in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} H 460 cells induced by natural (CA- 4) and synthetic stilbenoids (ST 2151) structurally related to CA- 4. We found that both compounds induced depolymerization and rearrangement of spindle microtubules, as well as an increasingly <b>aberrant</b> organization of <b>metaphase</b> chromosomes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Prolonged exposition to ST 2151 led cells to organize multiple sites of tubulin repolymerization, whereas tubulin repolymerization was observed only after CA- 4 washout. H 460 cells were arrested at a pro-metaphase stage, with condensed chromosomes and a triggered spindle assembly checkpoint, as evaluated by kinetochore localization of Bub 1 and Mad 1 antibodies. Persistent checkpoint activation led to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) alterations, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase- 9 and - 3, PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. On the other hand, caspase- 2, and - 8 were not activated by the drug treatment. The ability of cells to reassemble tubulin in the presence of an activated checkpoint may be responsible for ST 2151 -induced multinucleation, a recognized sign of mitotic catastrophe. In conclusion, we believe that discovery of new agents able to trigger mitotic catastrophe cell death as a result of mitotic block and prolonged spindle checkpoint activation is particularly worthwhile, considering that tumor cells have a high proliferative rate and mitotic failure occurs irrespective of p 53 status...|$|R
40|$|Combretastatins are tubulin binding agents, {{structurally}} {{related to}} colchicines {{and with a}} high potential as vascular targeting agents for their capability to induce vascular-mediated tumour necrosis. Molecular mechanisms leading to checkpoint apoptosis have been investigated in endothelial primary cells (HUVEC) and tumor cancer cells (H 460) after treatment with ST 2151 or combretastatin CA 4. We found that both compounds induce depolymerisation and rearrangement of spindle microtubules and an increasingly <b>aberrant</b> organization of <b>metaphase</b> chromosomes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Both H 460 and HUVEC cells were arrested at the pro-metaphase stage at different extent (44, 0 % vs 17, 8 % for CA 4; 42, 6 % vs 18, 8 % for ST 2151, respectively) with consequent p 53 accumulation and spindle assembly checkpoint activation as evaluated by kinetochore localization of Bub- 1 and MAD 1 antibodies. Prolonged checkpoint activation led to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) alterations, partial activation of caspase- 3 and – 9, PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. On the other hand caspase- 2 and - 8 were not activated by drug treatment. Interestingly, after 24 h exposure the percentage of cell death was far higher in H 460 compared to HUVEC (94, 5 % vs 31, 5 % for CA 4; 59, 3 % vs 20, 3 % for ST 2151). The presence of multinucleated cells, strongly supported the notion that combretastatin, particularly the ST 2151 triggers a mitotic catastrophe pathway. Furthermore, we found persistence of cell death induction as evaluated at 24 - 72 hours from drug washout (in H 460 cells persistence of 80 - 85 % cell death). Experiments are in progress, to ascertain the activation of checkpoints at long times from drug removal. Hundred % of cells arrested in metaphase after drugs washout displayed mitotic chechkpoint activation The different pharmacological behaviour of ST 2151 respect to CA- 4 does not simply correlate with an anti-tubulin mechanism, suggesting that additional molecular targets may be involved, or alternatively, ST molecules might have different binding site or mode of interaction with tubulin...|$|R
