The usual approach in the literature on the topic is to observe the impact of trade openness on growth.

In our empirical analysis we use the TSLS (two stage least squares) estimator, whereby in the first step we use the standard growth regression that includes, among other variables, openness, and in the second step we include different determinants to instrument openness. Our research, in general, shows that openness is an important determinant of growth in a set of investigated countries. Trade openness and financial openness influence growth positively. The influence of institutions on growth is manifested mainly indirectly – through its influence on trade and financial openness...|$|R

It deals with the question: do something like coherent national types à la Esping-Andersen still exist, and must Germany always be classified as a conservative, corporative type, or should politically and theoretically relevant differences and similarities be examined along policy lines? This question also applies to a specific level of policy on which a study concentrates. Most contributions in this issue follow qualitative methods instead of a quantitative analysis of aggregate data. The second theme is the broad concept of the welfare-state. This means that not only the central aspects of the welfare-state will be examined, like social insurance, additional areas like social assistance, labour-market policy, but <b>also</b> <b>socio-political</b> activities on the local level.

40|$|Abstract: Pervasive {{environmental}} monitoring implies {{a wide range}} of technical, but <b>also</b> <b>socio-political</b> challenges, and this applies especially to the sensitive context of the city. In this paper, we elucidate issues for bringing out pervasive urban sensor networks and associated concerns relating to fine-grained information provision. We present the Common Scents project, which is based on the Real-time Geo-awareness approach, and show how it can overcome these challenges. As opposed to hitherto sensing networks, which are mostly built up in monolithic and closed systems, the Common Scents approach aims to establish an open, standards based and modular infrastructure. This ensures interoperability, portability and flexibility, which are crucial prerequisites for pervasive urban sensing. The implementation – a real-time data integration and analysis system for air quality assessment – has been realised on top of the CitySense sensor network in the City of Cambridge, MA US together with the city’s Public Health Department responding to concrete needs of the city and its inhabitants...|$|R

Challenges the project has faced have included: simple access to the network; legal issues involved in the storage and dissemination of the captured information, which may be personal; the volume of data captured and the rate at which this data appears at store. To this end the MASTS system will have established four monitoring points each capturing packets on a high speed link.

40|$|Living Labs {{have been}} {{established}} as real-life pilot settings in which IT innovations are developed and validated. Once these steps have been completed, these innovations are ready to be {{moved out of the}} Living Lab environment into the real world. In many cases Living Lab innovations require not only technological but <b>also</b> <b>socio-political</b> and institutional changes to be made {{in order for them to}} be adopted. The need of socio-political and institutional changes becomes especially visible in cases where Living Lab participants attempt to propose innovative solutions for domains that are highly regulated. The reason for that is that in such cases, often the existing legal requirement would need to be adjusted first, in order to create grounds for the further adoption of the innovation. The question as to how to achieve such legal changes related to Living Lab innovations in a highly regulated environment has received vey limited attention. In this paper, we specifically focus on understanding of framing processes and how they are used by the Living Lab participants in a politically savvy way to mobilize a multi-level network of actors in their attempts to bring institutional change. We further investigate this framework through a case study involving a variety of framing processes that took place in the Beer Living Lab. The Beer Living Lab is part of the ITAIDE project that aims to develop and test an eCustoms solution for international trade. In addition to our contribution of the conceptual framework and the accompanying empirical case study, we also identify further implications for practitioners who are involved in similar Living Labs in highly regulated environments...|$|R
40|$|Defense date: 30 / 06 / 2009 Examining Board: Prof. Neil Walker, University of Edinburgh (Supervisor) Prof. Bruno de Witte, European University Institute Prof. Samantha Besson, University of Fribourg Prof. Stephen Weatherill, University of OxfordThis thesis {{lays down}} in seven {{chapters}} a revised theoretical foundation for European integration - {{the theory of}} European Bund. Relying on a social constructivist meta-theoretical methodological approach, it starts off with an observation that European integration, as a social phenomenon, has been socially constructed through the activities of social actors, which have been conducted {{on the basis of}} certain narratives - the narratives of European integration. As the process of integration has run into problems this has been, following the social constructivist maxima, due to its deficient narratives. Because of the complex discontinuity of European integration and in particular due to the narratives' intrinsic reliance on the monistic mindset, these have in their battle for domination through institutionalization not only failed to grasp the existing nature of European integration, but have moreover and because of that furnished it with unfeasible, incoherent and hence undesirable normative guidance. The proposed theory of European Bund splits with the monistic mindset. It is based on three founding pillars: legal-institutional, socio-political and philosophical, which constitute its distinct character and set it apart from the other theoretical approaches in the field. As such, the theory of European Bund not only provides a better descriptive and explanatory account of European integration, but it also comes with advantageous normative prescriptions for the integration's long term viability that make the best of it, given its unique, above all legal, but <b>also</b> <b>socio-political</b> pedigree. Last but not least, the theory of European Bund is not a constitutional theory, it shall not be addressed as such, and consequently the nature of European integration ought not to be regarded as constitutional either...|$|R

This situation is best explained by the fact that from the point of view of the East Syrian Church structure the archdeacon had an ecclesiastical function, but from that of the St Thomas Christian community he had <b>also</b> a <b>socio-political,</b> princely function, representing the unity of the Christian nation, or caste(s), of Hindoo (India).

The construction of the castagnetu, the Corsican chestnut (Castanea sativa mill.) forest, as a social-ecological system is based on a constantly evolving compromise between wild and domestic attributes, but <b>also</b> on <b>socio-political</b> resistance, incorporation, and innovation. We argue that the castagnetu's resilience, beyond its social-ecological qualities and its economic profitability, is closely linked to a constant incorporation of identity and cultural values into chestnut trees and gardens, but also to the role assigned to the castagnetu by its supporters in the political positioning of their relations to both central power and outside actors...|$|R
