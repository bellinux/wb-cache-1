5000|$|A tension meter is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} tension in wires, cables, textiles, belts and more. Meters {{commonly}} use a 3 roller system where the material travels through the rollers causing deflection in the center roller that is connected to an <b>analog</b> <b>indicator</b> or load cell on digital models. Single roll tension sensors and sonic tension meters are other types of tension meters. Tension may also be inferred from the frequency of vibration of the material under stress by solving the [...] "Vibrating String Equation". Tension meters are available as handheld devices or as equipment for fixed installations. These are basically necessary {{to build up a}} tension-controlled closed loop.|$|E
40|$|Companies seek to {{continuously}} {{improve their}} processes {{in order to}} provide the market with competitive products. In this scenario, manufacturing plays a key role to achieve the results, and so the need arises to establish indicators to know the actual efficiency of the production process and foster this process of continuous improvement. Based on this premise, the aim {{of this paper is to}} use an <b>analog</b> <b>indicator</b> for Overall Equipment Effectiveness, the Overall Line Effectiveness, whose structure has been modified from the original indicator to identify losses not considered by the primitive indicator. The case study was conducted in a bottling line of a wine industry, and was able to show the real process efficiency and identify opportunities for improvements in this process. Research limitations and future work opportunities were highlighted...|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} motors’ {{test benches}} are greatly used by electric motors manufacturers and drive system designers. In this paper it is described the conversion process {{of an older}} manually controlled test bench, in an automatic digitally controlled one with integrated data acquisition system. The renewed test bench is based in a two quadrant eddy current electromagnetic brake, in which the manual torque controller and <b>analog</b> <b>indicator</b> {{have been replaced by}} an automatic digital controller, by which is possible to predefine a torque profile for the test. With the data acquisition system it is possible the acquisition and recording of speed, torque and internal temperature on the brake. Special focus is given to the power converter used to control the current in the electromagnetic brake and to the torque data acquisition system, namely, the calibration of the load cell.

40|$|The {{impact of}} various formats {{used in the}} design of visual {{displays}} was investigated in two reaction-time (RT) experiments. Analog, digital, and verbal formats were employed with nu-merical judgmem tasks requiring either the integration or non integration of display ele-ments. As predicted by multiple resource theory, the dual task (nonintegration) benefited from a mixed-format display. Integration tasks, however, revealed a contrasting benefit of pure-format displays. Generally speaking, <b>analog</b> <b>indicators</b> were responded to more quickly than were digital or verbal indicators. Three guidelines for display design are suggested...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} 32 {{subjects}} performed a flight-control task while responding to {{between one and}} four <b>analog</b> <b>indicators</b> that were formatted as either command or status-decision aid displays. The results obtained indicate {{the advantage of the}} status format when subjects are required to verbally support the state of the indicator(s), in part, because the command format 'bypasses' the representation of the indicator's state from which the command was derived. No advantage is noted for either format in the case where the subjects are required to manually correct the state indicated. The importance of consistency in system-design efforts may exceed that of compatibility...|$|R

40|$|In four {{experiments}} {{we examined}} the effect of varying the types of display coding (analog, verbal, digital) used in a visual monitoring task. In pure display condi-tions all indicators within a display were of the same type, and in mixed conditions display type varied across indicators. Subjects performed either integration tasks, which required responses based on information contained in two indicators, or nonintegration tasks, in which responses could be made based on a single indicator value. Results replicated previous findings of the superiority of <b>analog</b> <b>indicators</b> in tasks of this type and also indicated that the integration/nonintegration task distinction is not an important variable {{to take into account}} when designing dis-plays. It is suggested that detailed analyses of decision task demands are required in designing visual displays...|$|R
50|$|The {{layout and}} design of these {{instruments}} have evolved {{over the years by}} being implemented as digital readouts rather than the traditional <b>analog</b> dial-type <b>indicators.</b> Depending on the type of vehicle, more specialized instruments may be used such as a trip computer, fuel economy gauge, or battery level display.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{contrast}} display-control movement relations {{defined in terms of}} stimulus-response (physical) compatibility with those defined by stimulus-cognitive compatibility, and we relate these findings to the issue of command versus status levels of decision aid support. A second issue addressed is the cost of inconsistency across multiple display-control mappings. Subjects performed a flight control task while responding to one to four <b>analog</b> <b>indicators,</b> formatted as either command or status displays. The results suggest that there is an advantage for the status format when subjects are required to verbally report the state of the indicator(s), but no advantage was found for either format when subjects were required to manually correct the indicated state. The data point to the importance of display-control consistency and suggest that it may even outweigh that of compatibility...|$|R
5000|$|Series 1 {{is fairly}} common, and is {{normally}} seen in Otis Elevonic 401 and some hydraulic elevators {{in the early}} 1980s up to the mid-2000s. It has a very distinctive look. Older Series 1 buttons are flush with the panel. It has black plastic trim with either a silver or bronze face plate. The indicator is slanted down towards the floor. Some elevators may also have a slanted up panel with {{some or all of}} the floor buttons on it. There is also flat Series 1, with a flat panel, and no plastic around the edge of the panel. The indicator is green and is often a digital, but sometimes a segment indicator is used for buildings with four floor or less. Two vertical rows of floor buttons are used on hydraulic elevators, and three vertical rows of floor buttons, and the bottom part of the panel slanted forward are used on traction elevators, and also very rarely on hydraulic elevators. This information does not apply for flat Series 1. In the mid 1990s, Otis Series 1 fixtures were redesigned. The buttons now protrude from the panel, <b>analog</b> <b>indicators</b> were completely dropped, the door open/close buttons were made white from green, and the alarm button was made white from yellow. Otis also called these their [...] "Advanced Fixtures".|$|R
50|$|Both the SUV-VEP and SUV-P {{systems were}} adopted {{to upgrade the}} single seat Su-27SK in Chinese inventory, and a joint team of Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design (NIIP) and State Instrumentation Plant at Ryazan was named as the primary contractor. The {{modified}} SUV-VEP system adopted to upgrade Chinese Su-27SK was designated as SUV-VE, while the modified SUV-P system adopted to upgrade Chinese Su-27SK was designated as SUV-PE. The original <b>analog</b> dial <b>indicator</b> on flight dashboard of Su-27SK were replaced by two 6 in x 6 in MFI-10-6M and a MFIP-6 LCD MFDs.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on patient recovery has indicated {{significant improvement in}} the conditions of patients treated in sunny rooms compared to those treated in shaded rooms. In this study, the amount of sunlight received in patient rooms with different orientations and opening positions was observed. Desktop Radiance 1. 02 software was used to simulate the conditions in a typical double patient room. The area and location of sunlight patches on room surfaces were considered as <b>analog</b> <b>indicators</b> for the investigation. Seven orientations and three positions of standard window openings were studied on an hourly basis in different combinations at solstices and equinoxes from sunrise to sunset. Data were statistically analyzed for advantageous combinations of orientation and opening positions. Results indicated that rooms with right- and left-shifted openings receive direct sunlight more than rooms with centered openings, and these have sunlight mostly on walls, while those with centered openings have it mostly on floors. The study revealed that opening positions rather than orientation {{is crucial to the}} design of patient rooms regarding the penetration of sunlight. Orientation is effective only when the room surfaces are studied individually. The study enabled sun patches to be visualized in relation to patient beds, which is a significant determinant that can affect the location of the bed, and so patient in the room. The paper concludes with four proposals of an informal choice from these combinations that both admits sunlight and protects the patient from glare and excessive heat gain. © 2008 University of Sydney.

40|$|The United States (U. S.) nuclear industry, like similar {{process control}} industries, has moved toward {{upgrading}} its control rooms. The upgraded control rooms typically feature digital control system (DCS) displays {{embedded in the}} panels. These displays gather information from the system and represent that information on a single display surface. In this manner, the DCS combines many previously separate <b>analog</b> <b>indicators</b> and controls into a single digital display, whereby the operators can toggle between multiple windows to monitor and control {{different aspects of the}} plant. The design of the DCS depends on the function of the system it monitors, but revolves around presenting the information most germane to an operator at any point in time. DCSs require a carefully designed human system interface. This report centers on redesigning existing DCS displays for an example chemical volume control system (CVCS) at a U. S. nuclear power plant. The crucial nature of the CVCS, which controls coolant levels and boration in the primary system, requires a thorough human factors evaluation of its supporting DCS. The initial digital controls being developed for the DCSs tend to directly mimic the former analog controls. There are, however, unique operator interactions with a digital vs. analog interface, and the differences have not always been carefully factored in the translation of an analog interface to a replacement DCS. To ensure safety, efficiency, and usability of the emerging DCSs, a human factors usability evaluation was conducted on a CVCS DCS currently being used and refined at an existing U. S. nuclear power plant. Subject matter experts from process control engineering, software development, and human factors evaluated the DCS displays to document potential usability issues and propose design recommendations. The evaluation yielded 167 potential usability issues with the DCS. These issues should not be considered operator performance problems but rather opportunities identified by experts to improve upon the design of the DCS. A set of nine design recommendations was developed to address these potential issues. The design principles addressed the following areas: (1) color, (2) pop-up window structure, (3) navigation, (4) alarms, (5) process control diagram, (6) gestalt grouping, (7) typography, (8) terminology, and (9) data entry. Visuals illustrating the improved DCS displays accompany the design recommendations. These nine design principles serve as the starting point to a planned general DCS style guide that can be used across the U. S. nuclear industry to aid in the future design of effective DCS interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Paleo {{relative}} sea-level (RSL) indicators formed {{during the}} Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 e {{have been reported}} by {{a large number of}} studies worldwide. Despite this, three main aspects are seldom reported: (1) use of high-precision survey techniques applied to MIS 5 e RSL indicators; (2) application of modern analogs to understand the indicative meaning of MIS 5 e RSL indicators; (3) estimates of the effects of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) on the MIS 5 e records. In this study, we show how the three points above have been addressed in a focused study on Last Interglacial outcrops on the island of Mallorca. We measured the elevation of several RSL indicators with high-accuracy differential GPS (vertical accuracies down to 0. 1 m) and we established the relationship between each RSL indicator and the paleo sea level through calculation of the indicative meaning for each RSL indicator. In particular, we present a novel technique to calculate the indicative meaning of fossil beach deposits with a phase-averaged morphodynamic model (CSHORE). We show how this approach helps overcoming difficulties with the survey of the modern <b>analogs</b> for these <b>indicators.</b> Our results show that two paleo RSLs are imprinted in Mallorca at + 2. 9 ± 0. 8 m and + 11. 3 ± 1. 0 m. We then compare our field-based results with modelled paleo RSL, calculated from the predictions of the ice-earth coupled ANICE-SELEN model, using few different ice-sheet melting scenarios during MIS 5 e. We conclude that indicative ranges can be derived from relatively simple morphodynamic models and that the comparison of field-derived and modelled RSL values is a good method to validate possible scenarios of MIS 5 e sea-level variability, especially in absence of precise dating...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{alteration}} is {{the change}} in composition of a rock, produced in response to interactions with H 2 O-bearing ices, liquids, and vapors by chemical weathering. A variety of mineralogical and geochemical indicators for aqueous alteration on Mars have been identified {{by a combination of}} surface and orbital robotic missions, telescopic observations, characterization of Martian meteorites, and laboratory and terrestrial <b>analog</b> studies. Mineralogical <b>indicators</b> for aqueous alteration include goethite (lander), jarosite (lander), kieserite (orbiter), gypsum (orbiter) and other Fe-, Mg-, and Ca-sulfates (landers), halides (meteorites, lander), phyllosilicates (orbiter, meteorites), hematite and nanophase iron oxides (telescopic, orbiter, lander), and Fe-, Mg-, and Ca-carbonates (meteorites). Geochemical indicators (landers only) for aqueous alteration include Mg-, Ca-, and Fe-sulfates, halides, and secondary aluminosilicates such as smectite. Based upon these indicators, several styles of aqueous alteration have been suggested on Mars. Acid-sulfate weathering (e. g., formation of jarosite, gypsum, hematite, and goethite), may occur during (1) the oxidative weathering of ultramafic igneous rocks containing sulfides, (2) sulfuric acid weathering of basaltic materials, and (3) acid fog (i. e., vapors rich in H 2 SO 4) weathering of basaltic or basaltic-derived materials. Near-neutral or alkaline alteration occurs when solutions with pH near or above 7 move through basaltic materials and form phases such as phyllosilicates and carbonates. Very low water:rock ratios appear to have been prominent at most of the sites visited by landed missions because there is very little alteration (leaching) of the original basaltic composition (i. e., the alteration is isochemical or in a closed hydrologic system). Most of the aqueous alteration appears to have occurred early {{in the history of the}} planet (3 to 4. 5 billion years ago); however, minor aqueous alteration may be occurring at the surface even today (e. g., in thin films of water or by acid fog) ...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{automotive}} {{instrument panels}} are often equipped with numeric readout and digital bargraph displays instead of traditional analog displays. An informal survey of 1990 model cars revealed wide disparity in automotive displays. Three major classes of displays were in use: (1) traditional <b>analog,</b> (2) binary <b>indicators,</b> and (3) readout displays. The present work reports results from four experiments of display monitorability. Twelve computer-simulated displays {{were designed for}} evaluation by dual-task methodology. Subjects were required to maintain performance on a demanding tracking task while monitoring configurations of four-displays for "critical readings. " Subjects' latencies to respond to such readings and their tracking error scores were collected. Experiment 1 examined displays in homogeneous clusters. Orientation, configuration and class were studied. Experiment 2 compared displays in heterogeneous configurations. Experiment 3 studied the addition of color to the displays to facilitate the detection of a critical reading. Static color (i. e., a "red zone") {{was added to the}} analog displays while dynamic color was added to the bargraph displays. Finally, Experiment 4 examined the effect of check-readable layouts for analog and bargraph displays. Older subjects were slower to respond to all displays and exhibited poorer tracking performance. They also had more variability than younger subjects on both of these measures. This result was likely due to age-related slowing rather than changes in cognitive processes. No class of displays studied emerged as superior, but the binary indicator (a modified warning lamp) generated the fastest responses. Although no evidence was found for effects of orientation, configuration or check-readability, support was found for color facilitation. Male subjects tended to respond faster when static color was present, and age-related facilitation was found for dynamic color. The addition of dynamic color to displays monitored by subjects in the middle and older age groups approximately compensated for age-related RT decrements. It is likely that displays which incorporate dynamic color elements will be most useful for presenting rate information as well as calling attention to off-normal readings. Pending further study, it is recommended that designers use new display technology with caution...|$|R
