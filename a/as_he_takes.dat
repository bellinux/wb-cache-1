5|$|As the Decepticons {{retreated from}} Earth, with a {{critically}} injured Megatron, {{it created a}} void among the Decepticon ranks. Many of Megatron's former generals take turns trying to gain power. Others go rouge, like Overlord <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> control of the Garrus 9 penal facility and turns it into an extermination camp. A new team of Wreckers is sent by Prowl to retake the prison. They manage, however, at a heavy price with most members dead or critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|At the Post's home, Hal Dunton {{sits down}} with his love {{interest}} Sue Post, cautiously {{checking to see if}} they are alone. Hal then proposes to Sue and in the excitement, her father comes into the room. He is outraged and believes his daughter is too young to be married and promptly makes Hal leave before scolding his daughter. Before departing, Hal meets and pleads with the father <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> the daughter away by car. The father refuses and Hal is knocked down before the father and daughter depart to a boarding school. The father meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her care, much to Sue's distress.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Marthandan {{arrives at}} Ratnapuri. Vijayavarman asks {{him to stay}} in an {{isolated}} palace on the outskirts and tells him that he should not meet his wife Manohari until the coronation, as the current moment is inauspicious. On entering a hotel in Ratnapuri, Veerangan and Sagayam beat up a gang of rowdies. Hired by Vijayavarman, they mistake Veerangan for Marthandan. Veerangan is chased by palace guards and ends up in Marthandan's room. Marthandan and Veerangan meet face to face. Veerangan tells him of the pathetic state the people of Ratnapuri, and Marthandan agrees to set everything right as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> charge. On the eve of the coronation, Vijayavarman arranges for Marthandan to be poisoned. He carries out his plan with the help of Karmegam, a royal advisor. Marthandan swoons after drinking a few sips of the poisoned beverage, but is soon saved by Veerangan and Ratnapuri's commander-in-chief. However, Marthandan is still unconscious and incapacitated. The commander-in-chief, and one of the ministers, persuade Veerangan to take Marthandan's place to ensure that the coronation takes place as scheduled. A reluctant Veerangan agrees {{to do so in the}} interests of the state, and arrives just in time for the coronation. It takes place smoothly and Veerangan, as Marthandan, becomes Ratnapuri's new king. Vijayavarman and Pingalan are taken aback and send men to investigate. They find the unconscious Marthandan and kidnap him.|$|E
5|$|Issued by MI6 with an Aston Martin DB Mark III, Bond trails Goldfinger <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> his vintage Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (adapted with {{armour plating}} and armour-plated glass) via air ferry to Switzerland, driven by Oddjob.

When the car reaches Goldfinger's factory in Switzerland (Enterprises Auric AG), he recasts the gold from the armour panels into aircraft seats and fits them to the Mecca Charter Airline, in which he holds a large stake. The gold is finally sold in India at a vast profit.

On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape.

25|$|In the mines, Emma {{interrupts}} the dwarves' work {{by taking}} Happy's pickaxe. This infuriated the dwarves, {{causing them to}} take their complaints to David and Mary Margaret. They interrupt David, Mary Margaret and Regina from researching what they were searching for in Camelot: The Crimson Crown. Following the dwarves' complaints, David blames himself for not saving Emma. However, David is interrupted by Arthur, who tells David that key items from his camp, including a magic bean that would take the displaced Camelot residents home, is missing.

500|$|Sleeping Dogs melee combat {{has been}} {{compared}} to that of : it consists of attack, grapple and counter-moves and can be performed with or without weapons. These three basic commands are chained together with the character's movement to execute attacks. The player's face meter fills up faster when enemies are defeated with different moves in rapid succession or with environmental attacks. Environmental attacks are performed by dragging enemies to certain objects, which Shen uses to eliminate opponents. Melee weapons such as knives and tyre irons are available, but they break with extended use. Players can perform [...] "action hijacks" [...] while driving vehicles. These cause Shen to leap from his vehicle to steal another in motion. In combat, Shen loses health <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> damage. This can be mitigated by taking cover where available. If the health bar is depleted, the character will respawn at a hospital.|$|E
500|$|... "Power" [...] {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from [...] music critics upon release, many calling it West's best single in years. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave a positive review to the song, describing it as West's best single since [...] "Stronger", writing that West [...] "rides a torrid whipsaw beat, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> on his spelunking media image, pinballing from self-aware ('I'm an asshole') to defiant ('Kiss my asshole'). The sentiment is classic Kanye, but he hasn't melted down this brilliantly {{in a long}} time." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard praised the song, saying, [...] "with its stunning mix of rock-leaning production, memorable rhymes and unadulterated attitude, new single 'Power' is a pissed-off shot of adrenaline that plays upon all of the controversial rapper's strengths. Rhyming over a soulful vocal harmony and an abrasive sample of King Crimson's [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man," [...] West dismisses his doubters, takes a shot at Saturday Night Live and shrugs off his recent hiatus from hip-hop." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media dubbed the track 'Best New Music' in June 2010, and viewed it as an adequate response to West's self-imposed exile and public scrutiny.|$|E

[...] Other newspapers of national distribution where the earthquake was reported on its main page included Las Ãšltimas Noticias (which featured a photograph of President PiÃ±era aboarding a helicopter in military dress), Publimetro, and La NaciÃ³n, whose main headline said [...] "Emergency measures marked start of PiÃ±era" [...] ("Medidas de emergencia marcan partida de PiÃ±era").|$|E

However, McGarrett initially refuses and goes to his father's home to investigate the crime scene. While searching the house he finds that Hesse has an accomplice, and also notices a tool box marked [...] "Champ" [...] (in {{the beginning of the}} episode, John referred to his son as [...] "champ" [...] despite never calling him that before). <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> the box, which has evidence on a case John must have wanted his son to solve, he is confronted by the lead detective in the case, Danny Williams (Scott Caan), a divorcee from New Jersey who moved to Hawaii to be close to his daughter Grace (Teilor Grubbs) after she moved with her mother and her new husband. Despite initial friction between the two, McGarrett decides to accept Jameson's offer, and appoints a reluctant Danny as his partner.
