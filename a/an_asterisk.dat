40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that when iterative-deepening <b>A</b> <b>asterisk</b> (IDA asterisk) {{is applied to}} one type of resource allocation problem, it uses far less storage than <b>A</b> <b>asterisk,</b> but opens far more nodes and thus has unacceptable time complexity. This is shown to be due, at least in part, to the low-valued effective branching factor that is a characteristic of problems with real-valued cost functions. The semi-optimal, epsilon-admissible IDA asterisk sub epsilon search algorithm that the authors described was shown to open fewer nodes than both <b>A</b> <b>asterisk</b> and IDA asterisk with storage complexity proportional to {{the depth of the}} search tree...|$|R

40|$|The authors have, for {{the first}} time, {{demonstrated}} photovoltaic detection for an multiple quantum well (MQW) detector. With a blocking layer, the MQW detector exhibits Schottky I-V characteristics with extremely low dark current and excellent ideality factor. The dark current is 5 times 10 (exp - 14) A for an 100 x 100 square micron 10 micron detector at 40 K, 8 to 9 orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} a similar 10 micron MQW detector without blocking layer. The ideality factor is about 1. 01 to 1. 05 at T = 40 to 80 K. The measured barrier height is consistent with the energy difference between first excited states and ground states, or the peak of spectral response. The authors also, {{for the first}} time, report the measured effective Richardson constant (<b>A</b> <b>asterisk</b> asterisk) for the GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction using this blocking layer structure.

5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using <b>an</b> <b>asterisk.</b> The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{possibility}} arose of his father's record of 257hits {{in a season}} being surpassed by Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. Living in Dallas, Texas at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season. Both had mixed feelings about the record chase; they were happy that George Sisler's name was being talked about and that people were re-discovering him as a player, but both were hoping that, if the record was not broken in 154games, there would be <b>an</b> <b>asterisk</b> noting that it took Ichiro more games to achieve it. Ichiro finished the season with 262hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at Safeco Field. The younger Sisler was prevented by an emergency heart procedure from travelling to Seattle. Both remarked that the Mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (<b>an</b> <b>asterisk</b> denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} table {{includes all}} those who have won medals, including as part of relay teams.

Those who swam in the heats only are marked with <b>an</b> <b>asterisk,</b> multiple times if multiple medals were awarded for swimming in heats only. Malcolm Champion, a member of the 4√ó200m freestyle relay team in 1912, was a New Zealander, competing as part of the combined Australasia team.

5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with <b>an</b> <b>asterisk</b> for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
