5000|$|In {{a parody}} of The Balled of Davey Crockett, Scott is hunting for a bear. He begins his quest at the then-new Disney's Wilderness Lodge. And unlike other great frontiersmen like Davey Crockett, Jim Bowie, or in Scott's words [...] "David Bowie", Scott is looking for [...] "a razor-clad, foaming at the mouth, {{hopefully}} vegetarian bear". After finding {{his way out of}} there, Scott heads to the Pirates of the Caribbean at the Magic Kingdom to play a game. The game's rules are simple: memorize the ride's theme song [...] "(Yo Ho Yo Ho) A Pirate's Life For Me". Scott then introduces the guests that are participating. The guests then go on the ride. After the guests get off the ride, Scott tells the participants to sing the theme song. First up were Stephanie King from Tarpon Springs, Florida and Jodi Berman from Seminole, Florida. Next up were Jeff and Kristi Palmer from Orlando, Florida. Then Julie Avarista and Lou Avsrista Jr. from Greenville, Rhode Island took a crack at it. Finally Dave Ironman from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida went up. Scott tells Dave that Star Search auditions are tomorrow. After the guests are done memorizing the song, Scott introduces Dave Ironman as the winner by [...] "using cultural references". The big prize for Dave is a stuffed parrot. Along with Dave, every guest received a T-shirt. Scott and the guests then went on the ride again. (With Scott sitting next to Dave) Scott then heads to Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground to have a chat with Gary Wade a blacksmith for the horses. After questioning about the difference between a Percheron and a Clydesdale, Scott asks Gary about the difference between a Percheron and a Buick. Gary tells Scott that the Percheron is one horsepower and the Buick is more than that. (200 hp) Gary then hammers the horseshoe on the horse. Scott says after the horse swatted at him [...] "Hey why the long face?" [...] with the horse thinking [...] "Why the old joke?". Then Scott heads to Disney MGM Studios to check out Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!. Scott interviews Mike West the director; Show concepts for Walt Disney Imagineering. Then Scott interviews Daryl Sterner who plays the German Mechanic. Next Scott interviews Todd Warren who plays Indiana Jones. Finally Scott interviews the extras chosen for the show, or as Scott calls them [...] "The Pastel Peasants". After those interviews, Scott tries something that he always wanted to do: Running from the huge ball in the temple set. Scott heads to Epcot '94 to talk about Innoventions. Scott doesn't know much about it but Bill Nye does because [...] "he's a science guy". Then Bill Nye exclaims the products that became a part of our everyday lives and the innoventions of today. Scott says that [...] "Innovations+Inventions=Innoventions" [...] and that the future looks [...] "mighty nice" [...] and that is [...] "innoventive". Scott heads back to Disney MGM Studios at The Magic of Disney Animation {{to take a look at}} The Lion King. Once inside while looking at his own drawing, Scott is informed by animator Aaron Blaise that they don't actually paint by number. Aaron then tells Scott about the making of The Lion King [...] "in 30 seconds". Later Aaron presents Scott of a drawing of him and a bear. Aaron then tells Scott that the big bears [...] "are attracted to dark pink shirts" [...] but Scott is wearing a light pink shirt. The Magic Kingdom is Scott's next stop to see Nancy Kerrigan. After showing off her moves on the ice, Nancy asks Scott if he ever skated. To which Scott (wearing a Speed Skating suit) says he never skated before. Before Nancy offers to show Scott how it's done, Scott asks Nancy if she's ever timed herself of how many spins in the air. Nancy says [...] "No" [...] and Scott offers to time her. After Scott says [...] "Go', Nancy begins spinning. While Nancy is spinning Scott was reading the newspaper comics, checking the stopwatch, ordering pizza, shaving and eating ice cream. After Nancy is done, Scott then tells Nancy to let him give it a try. But Scott leaped from the Magic Kingdom to Disney MGM Studios. Scott comes back to Disney's Wilderness Lodge to warm up by the fire and says that it [...] "gets the chill out of your bones". It's revealed that three Frontiersmen were singing the song all along. The frontiersmen tell Scott that he's <b>almost</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and he has to go down to Pleasure Island to check out the Jazz Club. After the frontiersmen were done singing, Scott asks the viewers if they ever remember them opening for Led Zeppelin back in '74. As told, Scott heads to the Jazz Club and explain that the Jazz Club is one of then-eight great clubs on Pleasure Island and also you can listen to the great jazz of yesterday and today. After the Jazz Club, Scott plays some midway carnival games. (where he cheats on the Test Your Strength game) Then Scott checks out the New Year's Eve countdown held every night. Then Scott and the viewers once again check up on what is coming up in the months ahead at Walt Disney World. Coming soon in July The Lion King is turned into the Legend Of The Lion King stage show. Later experience the thrilling drops of The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. [...] "Is that the Stop button?" [...] Mickey Mania marches down Main Street U.S.A. And so ends Episode 2 and Scott's search for a bear. While Scott is talking, he is interrupted when he sees Winnie the Pooh (character) walking by. Scott thinks he has finally found his bear and runs towards Pooh saying that he [...] "just wanted an autograph".|$|E
6000|$|Trevennack {{looked down}} upon her with a strange tender look on his face, in which {{gentleness}} and condescension were curiously mingled. [...] "Yes," [...] he answered, musing; [...] "for dear Cleer's sake I will always keep my peace about it. I'll say not a word. I'll never tell anybody. And yet it's hard to keep it in; very hard, indeed. I have to bind myself round, as it were, with bonds of iron.
