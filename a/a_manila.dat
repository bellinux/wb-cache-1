25|$|In 1997, {{one copy}} of this episode's script was donated by George Wendt to the Handel and Haydn Society, a Boston music institution. It {{contained}} the autographs of eight cast members, including of Shelley Long, Woody Harrelson, and George Wendt. On February 15, 1997, it was stolen from the Boston Four Seasons Hotel. The high bid for it at the benefit auction was $1,000 before it was stolen. About one week later, the stolen script, in <b>a</b> <b>manila</b> envelope, was left at a church; the Society then retrieved it. In March 1997, the autographed copy of the episode's script was sold to the Bull and Finch Pub (now Cheers Beacon Hill) for $10,000.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{accident}} Whymper asked Taugwalder to see the rope and to his surprise he {{saw that it was}} the oldest and weakest of the ropes they brought and it was only intended as a reserve. All those who had fallen had been tied with <b>a</b> <b>Manila</b> rope, or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was never done.|$|E

Oscar F. Williams, the United States Consul in Manila, had provided Dewey with detailed information {{on the state of}} the Spanish defenses and the lack of preparedness of the Spanish fleet.

25|$|At the June 1994, {{grand jury}} hearing, Ross Cutlery {{provided}} store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305mm) stiletto knife {{six weeks before}} the murders. The knife {{was determined to be}} similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that store employees had sold their story to The National Enquirer for $12,500. The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in <b>a</b> <b>manila</b> envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating the knife had never been used. The police searched Simpson's Rockingham estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it was in the house and it was promptly recovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in production costs between the Philippines and other manufacturing {{countries such as}} China are a huge factor in {{the decline of the}} textile industry in the Philippines. <b>A</b> <b>Manila</b> based company selling materials and clothing to the Gap brand costs up to fifty cents more in production costs compared to if the garment was manufactured in China. Many of the former Filipino workers in the textile industry left to work in other manufacturing or service industries. Some workers decided to focus on making clothes, garments, and textiles for domestic markets, although the instability of these markets has weakened their potential income. As for supervisors and factory managers, some have found employment in other countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka where {{there is a need for}} supervisors and factory managers. Government initiatives such as the Save Our Industries Act offer potential solutions to the failing industry, such as sending American textiles to the Philippines and repurposing them as garments made from the Philippines, but also has many uncertainties as the bill lacks bipartisan support within the U.S. Congress.|$|E

In a series of masterful and coordinated surface attacks, an American battleship, cruiser, and destroyer force met and destroyed enemy ships in the Battle of Surigao Strait early on 25 October. Surviving Japanese ships retreated into the Mindanao Sea pursued by destroyers, PT boats, and after sunrise by carrier-based bombers and fighters.|$|R
500|$|Stead {{began writing}} First Light in 2002, {{but had no}} {{experience}} prior to that. The first draft turned out confusing and unorganized. To help her, Stead met with Wendy Lamb, an editor Stead had met in a workshop a few years before. Lamb suggested that Stead meet with a [...] "critique group" [...] who would help read and revise the drafts Stead wrote. After Stead created a revised copy of the novel in 2005, she sent it to Lamb again and a contract was drawn up. More revisions were made {{in order to make}} the new world created in the novel easier to understand. Stead found it hard [...] "to maintain a sense of 'the whole'. Over and over I mapped out the book out for myself using post-its in <b>a</b> <b>manila</b> folder, trying to get a sense of where the tension went". The novel took three years to complete.|$|E
500|$|The Raid on Manila of January 1798 was a Royal Navy false flag {{military}} operation during the French Revolutionary Wars intended to scout {{the strength of}} the defences of Manila, capital of the Spanish Philippines, capture <b>a</b> <b>Manila</b> galleon and assess the condition of the Spanish Navy squadron maintained in the port. Spain had transformed from an ally of Great Britain in the War of the First Coalition into an enemy in 1796. [...] Thus the presence of a powerful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the China Fleet, an annual convoy of East Indiaman merchant ships from Macau in Qing Dynasty China to Britain, which was of vital economic importance to Britain. So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during 1797, but had been called off following the Treaty of Campo Formio in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore.|$|E
500|$|Cooper did {{not serve}} in the {{military}} during World War II due to his age and health, but like many of his colleagues, he got involved in the war effort by entertaining the troops. In June 1943, he visited military hospitals in San Diego, and often appeared at the Hollywood Canteen serving food to the servicemen. In late 1943, Cooper undertook a [...] tour of the South West Pacific with actresses Una Merkel and Phyllis Brooks, and accordionist Andy Arcari. Traveling on a B-24A Liberator bomber, the group toured the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Queensland, Brisbane—where General Douglas MacArthur told Cooper he was watching Sergeant York in <b>a</b> <b>Manila</b> theater when Japanese bombs began falling—New Guinea, Jayapura, and throughout the Solomon Islands. The group often shared the same sparse living conditions and K-rations as the troops. Cooper met with the servicemen and women, visited military hospitals, introduced his attractive colleagues, and participated in occasional skits. The shows concluded with Cooper's moving recitation of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech. When he returned to the United States, he visited military hospitals throughout the country. Cooper later called his time with the troops the [...] "greatest emotional experience" [...] of his life.|$|E

500|$|The system's roots {{date back}} to 1878, when an {{official}} from Spain's Department of Public Works for the Philippines submitted a proposal for <b>a</b> <b>Manila</b> streetcar system. [...] The system proposed was a five-line network emanating from Plaza San Gabriel in Binondo, running to Intramuros, Malate, Malacañan Palace, Sampaloc and Tondo. The project was approved and in 1882, Spanish German businessman Jacobo Zóbel de Zangroniz, Spanish engineer Luciano M. Bremon, and Spanish banker Adolfo Bayo, founded the Compañia de los Tranvias de Filipinas to operate the concession granted by the Spanish colonial government. The Malacañan Palace line was later replaced with a line linking Manila to Malabon, and construction began in 1885. [...] Four German-made steam-operated locomotives and eight coaches for nine passengers each, composed the initial assets of the company. [...] The Manila-Malabon line was {{the first line of}} the new system to be finished, opening to the public on October 20, 1888, {{with the rest of the}} network opening in 1889. From the beginning it proved to be a very popular line, with services originating from Tondo as early as 5:30a.m. and ending at 7:30p.m., while trips from Malabon were from 6:00a.m. until 8:00p.m., every hour on the hour in the mornings, and every half-hour beginning at 1:30p.m. in the afternoon.|$|E

Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states [...] "Cool! I broke his brain."

Do you really think this was funny, this horrible experience?" [...] The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was [...] "an obvious" [...] reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne).
