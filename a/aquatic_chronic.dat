50|$|Chronic toxicity, the {{development}} of adverse effects {{as a result of}} long term exposure to a contaminant or other stressor, is an important aspect of aquatic toxicology. Adverse effects associated with chronic toxicity can be directly lethal but are more commonly sublethal, including changes in growth, reproduction, or behavior. Chronic toxicity is in contrast to acute toxicity, which occurs over a shorter period of time to higher concentrations. Various toxicity tests can be performed to assess the chronic toxicity of different contaminants, and usually last at least 10% of an organism’s lifespan. Results of <b>aquatic</b> <b>chronic</b> toxicity tests can be used to determine water quality guidelines and regulations for protection of aquatic organisms.|$|E

After use, surfactants {{as well as their}} products are mainly discharged into sewage treatment plants and then dispersed into the environment through effluent discharge into surface waters and sludge disposal on lands. Surfactants have different behavior and fate in the environment. Nonionic and cationic surfactants had much higher sorption on soil and sediment than anionic surfactants such as LAS. Most surfactants can be degraded by microbes in the environment although some surfactants such as LAS and DTDMAC as well as alkylphenols may be persistent under anaerobic conditions. LAS were found to degrade in sludge amended soils with a half-lives of 7 to 33 days.

Algae and higher aquatic plants, possessing high and constant amounts of VLCFAs are the most prone organisms to damage. Mohr et al, for example, showed that single exposure of several aquatic macrophytes to metazachlor at nominal concentrations of > 5  µg/L, had pronounced long-term effects on the aquatic biota [14]. In this study, even after 140 – 170  days, the macrophytes did not recover from punctual metazachlor treatments. Applied metazachlor concentrations of 20  µg/L in pond- and stream mesocosms led to a decrease in macrophyte wet weight of 25 and 77 %, respectively. In the same study [14], it was shown that filamentous green algae dominated by Cladophora glomerata and Spirogyra spec. were also extremely sensitive to metazachlor with EC 50 values of 3 and 9  µg/L (median effective concentration) in stream- and pond indoor mesocosms, respectively. These algae were replaced by the filamentous yellow–green algae Vaucheria spec, but only at metazachlor concentrations higher than the ones observed in the lake of the Upper-Sûre (> 80  µg/L).

The aim of this study was to determine the aquatic fate and effects of a selection of HFFRs that are currently being applied in polymers as alternatives of hazardous brominated flame retardants. To this end, we have identified the current state of knowledge on PBT properties of a selection of HFFRs and prioritized those for further research.

Here passive sampler extracts were used in experimental contamination of laboratory channels, to investigate their effects on natural biofilm communities. A realistic mixture of pesticides extracted from POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers) was used to expose biofilms in laboratory channels to total pesticide concentrations averaging 0. 5 ± 0. 1 µg•l- 1. The level of exposure was representative of field conditions in terms of relative proportions of the substances but the exposure concentration was not maintained (decreasing concentrations between contamination occasions). The impact on the structural {{as well as the}} functional characteristics of the autotrophic and heterotrophic components was determined, using biofilm grown in uncontaminated conditions (reference site) and in sites exposed to pesticides (contaminated site). The exposure imposed did not significantly modify the structure or functions of reference biofilms, nor did it modify tolerance as measured by mixture EC 50 (EC 50 mix). In contrast, the communities from the more contaminated downstream section lost tolerance following decreased dose exposure, but community composition remained fairly stable. Overall, these results indicate that low levels of contamination did not lead to strong changes in community structure, and 14 -day changes in tolerance seemed to depend mainly on physiological adaptation, suggesting that other environmental factors or longer-lasting processes prevailed.

In April 2016, two new test guidelines with two mollusc species representing different reproductive strategies were approved by OECD member countries. One test guideline describes a 28 -day reproduction test with the parthenogenetic New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. The main endpoint of the test is reproduction, reflected by the embryo number in the brood pouch per female. The {{development of a new}} OECD test guideline involves several phases including inter-laboratory validation studies to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed test design and the reproducibility of the test results. Therefore, a ring test of the reproduction test with P. antipodarum was conducted including eight laboratories with the test substances trenbolone and prochloraz and results are presented here. Most laboratories could meet test validity criteria, thus demonstrating the robustness of the proposed test protocol. Trenbolone did not {{have an effect on the}} reproduction of the snails at the tested concentration range (nominal: 10 - 1000 ng/L).

This paper presents a field-scale study in which synoptic sampling and PCA are employed in a mineralized watershed (Lion Creek, Colorado, USA) under low flow conditions to (i) quantify the impacts of mining activity on stream water quality; (ii) quantify the spatial pattern of constituent loading; and (iii) identify inflow sources most responsible for observed changes in stream chemistry and constituent loading. Several of the constituents investigated (Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) fail to meet <b>chronic</b> <b>aquatic</b> life standards along most of the study reach. The spatial pattern of constituent loading suggests four primary sources of contamination under low flow conditions. Three of these sources are associated with acidic (pH < 3. 1) seeps that enter along the left bank of Lion Creek. Investigation of inflow water (tracemetal and major ion) chemistry using PCA suggests a hydraulic connection between many of the left bank inflows and mine water in the Minnesota Mine shaft located to the north-east of the river channel. In addition, water chemistry data during a rainfall-runoff event suggests the spatial pattern of constituent loading may be modified during rainfall due to dissolution of efflorescent salts or erosion of streamside tailings. These data point to the complexity of contaminant mobilisation processes and constituent loading in mining-affected watersheds but the combined synoptic sampling and PCA approach enables a conceptual model of contaminant dynamics to be developed to inform remediation...|$|R

Efforts to restore water quality began in 1995, and by 2002 Cu levels had been reduced by about 90 %, with incremental declines since. Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were early colonizers, quickly expanding their range as areas became habitable when Cu concentrations dropped below about 3 X the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s biotic ligand model (BLM) based <b>chronic</b> <b>aquatic</b> life criterion. Anadromous Chinook Salmon (O. tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) have also reoccupied Panther Creek. Full recovery of salmonid populations occurred within about 12 -years after the onset of restoration efforts and about 4 -years after the Cu chronic criteria had mostly been met, with recovery interpreted as similarity in densities, biomass, year class strength, and condition factors between reference sites and mining-influenced sites. Shorthead Sculpin (Cottus confusus) were slower than salmonids to disperse and colonize. While benthic macroinvertebrate biomass has increased, species richness has plateaued at about 70 to 90 % of reference despite the Cu criterion having been met for several years. Different invertebrate taxa had distinctly different recovery trajectories. Among the slowest taxa to recover were Ephemerella, Cinygmula and Rhithrogena mayflies, Enchytraeidae oligochaetes, and Heterlimnius aquatic beetles. Potential reasons for the failure of some invertebrate taxa to recover include competition, and high sensitivity to Co and Cu...|$|R
40|$|An {{environmental}} assessment of long-chain alcohols (LCOH) {{has recently been}} conducted under the OECD SIDS High Production Volume (HPV) Program via the Global International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) Aliphatic Alcohols Consortium. LCOH are used primarily as intermediates, as a precursor to alcohol-based surfactants and as alcohol per se {{in a wide variety}} of consumer product applications. Global production volume is approximately 1. 58 million metric tonnes. The OECD HPV assessment covers linear to slightly branched LCOH ranging from 6 to 22 alkyl carbons (C). LCOH biodegrade exceptionally rapidly in the environment (half-lives on the order of minutes); however, due to continuous use and distribution to wastewater treatment systems, partitioning properties, biodegradation of alcohol-based surfactants, and natural alcohol sources, LCOH are universally detected in wastewater effluents. An environmental risk assessment of LCOH is presented here by focusing on the most prevalent and toxic members of the linear alcohols, specifically, from C 12 - 15. The assessment includes environmental monitoring data for these chain lengths in final effluents of representative wastewater treatment plants and covers all uses of alcohol (i. e., the use of alcohol as a substance and as an intermediate for the manufacturing of alcohol-based surfactants). The 90 th percentile effluent discharge concentration of 1. 979 ?g/L (C 12 -C 15) was determined for wastewater treatment plants in 7 countries. <b>Chronic</b> <b>aquatic</b> toxicity studies with Daphnia magna demonstrated that between C 13 and C 15 LCOH solubility became a factor and that the structure–activity relationship was characterized by a toxicity maximum between C 13 and C 14. Above C 14 the LCOH was less toxic and become un-testable due to insolubility. Risk quotients based on a toxic units (TU) approach were determined for various scenarios of exposure and effects extrapolation. The global average TU ranged from 0. 048 to 0. 467 depending on the scenario employed suggesting a low risk to the environment. The fact that environmental exposure calculations include large fractions of naturally derived alcohol from animal, plant, and microbially mediated biotransformations further supports a conclusion of low risk...|$|R
40|$|Florida is a hotspot for cyano- and microalgal harmful algal blooms (HABs) {{with annual}} red-tide events {{off-shore}} and blooms of Lyngbya spp. commonly observed in both marine and freshwater environments. This region also provides extensive foraging habitat for large populations of herbivorous green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris). The exposure of aquatic organisms to HAB toxins {{is not well}} known and whilst acute exposures are better understood, the vulnerability of <b>aquatic</b> animals to <b>chronic</b> exposure from multiple HAB toxins over prolonged periods has rarely been addressed. This study aimed to identify the presence of toxic compounds produced by HAB species commonly found in Florida (brevetoxins, okadaic acid, saxitoxins and Lyngbya toxins) in tissues and gut samples from manatee and green sea turtles that stranded in Florida, USA. Muscle, liver and alimentary tract samples were opportunistically collected from 14 manatees and 13 green turtles that stranded on the Florida shoreline between December 2003 and February 2006. Samples from each animal were assessed {{for the presence of}} brevetoxin, okadaic acid, lyngbyatoxin-A and saxitoxin. Nine (64 %) manatees and 11 (85 %) turtles were found to have been exposed to {{one or more of the}} HAB toxins. Okadaic acid and saxitoxin were only found in alimentary tract samples, whereas brevetoxin was more widely distributed. No lyngbyatoxin-A was observed in any tissue samples. The majority of turtles (13) stranded on the Atlantic coast between St. Johns and Monroe counties, with one on the Gulf coast at Bay County, whereas nine manatees were stranded on the Gulf coast between Levy and Lee counties, with the remaining five between Volusia and Brevard counties on the Atlantic coast. This HAB toxin screen has identified that a large proportion of a random sample of turtles and manatees that stranded in Florida in 2003 – 2006 were exposed to HAB toxins. Most of the concentrations measured were low, and the toxins were directly linked to the death of only three of these animals. However, the presence of these compounds, and in some cases the presence of multiple HAB toxins in individual animals, indicates that turtles and manatees in Florida are exposed to deleterious compounds at sub-lethal levels in their environment, which could ultimately compromise their health...|$|R
