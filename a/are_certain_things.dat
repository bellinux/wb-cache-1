There <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> that are usable, forceful and vital about commercial art." [...] Rebecca Bengal at PBS wrote that Whaam!s graphic clarity exemplifies the ligne claire style associated with Hergé, a cartoonist whose influence Lichtenstein acknowledged. Lichtenstein {{was attracted to}} using a cool, formal style to depict emotive subjects, leaving the viewer to interpret the artist's intention. He adopted a simplified color scheme and commercial printing-like techniques. The borrowed technique was [...] "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of Ben Day dots used in newspaper printing, and surrounding these with black outlines {{similar to those used}} to conceal imperfections in cheap newsprint." [...] Lichtenstein once said of his technique: [...] "I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental." ...|$|E

Adam had more scenes in the original cut. A scene that showed Jigsaw regretting his actions was also cut. Bell said, [...] "I'm glad they cut that scene. This guy knows exactly what he's doing.
