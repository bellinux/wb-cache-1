5|$|Goaltenders {{have participated}} in the offence, albeit in a limited way, since the {{earliest}} days of the sport. Before the creation of the NHL in 1917, there were some instances recorded of goaltenders rushing down the ice to participate in the play, occasionally scoring a goal. This practice has since been outlawed (goalies are not allowed to cross the centre red line to play the puck) after the Toronto Maple Leafs' Gary Smith was injured on such a rush in the 196667 NHL season. During the history of the league, there had been some near-misses by goaltenders, including attempts by Chuck Rayner by aiming <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> net, or joining the attack. In 1977, Rogatien Vachon briefly became the first goaltender to score a goal after being credited following an own goal by the opponent, before it was given instead to a teammate by later video review.|$|E

25|$|Jandek {{performed}} {{twice in}} September 2006. The first show, in Toronto, was performed at Centre of Gravity, a renovated Vaudeville theatre/circus rehearsal space and continued the semi-classical/jazzy aspects of Glasgow Monday, this time using a unique lineup of cymbals, double bass and a guitar played more for sound patterns than melody. The artist himself played the Korg keyboards again (as {{he had in}} Manhattan), and the performance was one extended piece. By contrast, three days later he played a high-amped rock set <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Empty</b> Bottle in Chicago with bassist Josh Abrams and Tortoise drummer/producer John McEntire that featured lyrics recounting a prison stay. Jandek played a show in Seattle, Washington at On the Boards on October 27, 2006 with the same lineup as the Portland performance earlier that year, and he ended 2006 with a concert in Indianapolis on December 9, 2006 in a church sanctuary attached to the Harrison Center for the Arts. That show included Nathan Vollmar of the band Rivulets on drums, and a female vocalist who also played viola and sang lead on a few tracks and a flute player, a first.|$|E

In the photograph, Marky is featured peering out the subway window—Marky was positioned this way after Johnny asked DuBose to do so because [...] "they were kicking him out of the band, but he didn't know it yet."

500|$|The powder lots of D-846 {{were among}} the oldest on board Iowa, dating back to 1943–1945, and were {{designed}} to fire 1900lb (861.8kg) shells. In fact, printed on each D-846 powder canister were the words, [...] "WARNING: [...] Do Not Use with 2,700-pound projectiles." [...] D-846 powder burned faster than normal powder, which meant that it exerted greater pressure on the shell when fired. [...] Skelley explained that the experiment's purpose was to improve {{the accuracy of the}} guns. [...] Skelley's plan was for Turret Two to fire ten 2,700-pound practice (no explosives) projectiles, two from the left gun and four rounds each from the center and right guns. [...] Each shot was to use five bags of D-846, instead of the six bags normally used, and to fire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> ocean [...] away.|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} Madonna <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> {{suite of}} an abandoned hotel, a similar setting to her [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] music video. It was shot in a single frame, with the camera approaching Madonna, as she stands behind a pillar. She rotates around it and sings the song, as air blows through the room. The video ends with Madonna looking up towards the camera the last time, and then closing her eyes. It was treated with sepia color. Carol Vernallis, author of Experiencing music video: aesthetics and cultural context felt that the video was {{a good example of}} how image can direct the viewer's attention towards the shift in instrumentation and arrangement of the song. She noted the aimless movement of the camera towards her as [...] "bringing focus to the main subject, with the viewer's attention fully captured." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held {{a series}} of hearings, as part of the ongoing [...] "War on Poverty." [...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [...] would have a chance to go and just look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> cupboards in the Delta and {{the number of people who}} are going around and begging just to feed their children." ...|$|E

500|$|The U.S. {{played with}} renewed {{confidence}} {{as the second}} half opened, creating another scoring opportunity in the 54th minute. In the 59th minute England was awarded a direct free kick but Mortensen's shot was well saved by Borghi. But England began threatening again, and it was fifteen minutes before the Americans {{were able to get}} another shot. With eight minutes left, Charlie Colombo brought down Mortensen with an illegal tackle {{at the edge of the}} penalty area. England pleaded for a penalty kick, but the referee ruled it was outside the box. From Alf Ramsey's resulting free kick, Jimmy Mullen headed the ball for what he thought was a goal, but Borghi tipped it away at the last instant, and despite the protests of the English players, the referee ruled that the ball had not crossed the line and thus there was no goal. England did not threaten again, but the U.S. had one final chance in the 85th minute: Frank [...] "Peewee" [...] Wallace drew Williams out of position and fired a shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> net, only to be denied by a sliding goal line clearance by Ramsey.|$|E

2500|$|According to Matthew 4:11, after Jesus spent 40 {{days in the}} desert, [...] "...the devil {{left him}} and, behold, angels came and ministered to him." [...] In Luke 22:43 an angel comforts Jesus Christ during the Agony in the Garden. In Matthew 28:5 an angel speaks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> tomb, {{following}} the Resurrection of Jesus and the rolling back of the stone by angels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of iconography of the Resurrection {{occurred at the}} same time as the ecumenical councils of the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, that were specifically devoted to Christology. The next stage in the {{development of}} the image was the use of the [...] secondary event of the visit of the Three Marys (usually two in early depictions), or the Myrrhbearers as they are known in Eastern Orthodoxy, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> tomb of Jesus to convey the concept of the Resurrection; this was included in all four Gospels. [...] One of the earliest depictions of the scene is an ivory plaque of c. 400 AD, already including the sleeping guards who were to become a standard element in later depictions, with an Ascension scene above.|$|E
2500|$|Fourteen of the Monza and Bobbio ampullae combine on one face Crucifixions {{above the}} Women <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> tomb, {{which are also}} on the two faces in other examples. [...] Two of the flasks, one each at Bobbio and Monza, show a large Christ walking on water and rescuing Saint Peter from drowning, as the other apostles watch from a boat, perhaps {{reflecting}} the anxieties of the sea voyages many pilgrims faced as they returned home. Another Bobbio scene shows a Virgin Orant flanked by John the Baptist and his father Zacharias. Figures that appear to be images of pilgrims, as a kind of generalised donor portrait, appear in many scenes, usually kneeling, as part of the emphasis on the pilgrim experience noted above in discussing the Doubting Thomas scenes.|$|E

2500|$|Early royal {{inscriptions}} {{from the}} third millennium BCE mention [...] "the reeds of Enki". Reeds were an important local building material, used for baskets and containers, and collected outside the city walls, where the dead or sick were often carried. This links Enki to the Kur or underworld of Sumerian mythology. In another even older tradition, Nammu, the goddess of the primeval creative matter and the mother-goddess portrayed as having [...] "given birth to the great gods," [...] {{was the mother of}} Enki, and as the watery creative force, was said to preexist Ea-Enki. Benito states [...] "With Enki it is an interesting change of gender symbolism, the fertilising agent is also water, Sumerian [...] "a" [...] or [...] "Ab" [...] which also means [...] "semen". In one evocative passage in a Sumerian hymn, Enki stands <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> riverbeds and fills them with his 'water'". This may be a reference to Enki's hieros gamos or sacred marriage with Ki/Ninhursag (the Earth) (see below).|$|E
2500|$|The Resurrection of Jesus, usually {{represented}} by the Women <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> tomb, with the tomb {{represented by}} the [...] "aedicula" [...] or shrine built by Constantine I within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on what {{was believed to be}} the appropriate spot. [...] This is now covered or replaced by later accretions, and its 6th century appearance is only known from such representations. [...] Typically, two women approach from the left of the tomb, while an angel sits to its right. [...] One of the women, perhaps to be identified as Mary Magdalene, often seems to be carrying a censer, suggesting to scholars a reflection of the contemporary rituals performed at the tomb. The door or lid of the tomb, which has been pushed aside by the angel to allow Christ to exit, may be represented by a lozenge shape, as in the mosaic at right, apparently reflecting the contemporary display in the aedicula.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} manuscripts of the Gospel of Mark (the {{oldest of}} the canonical gospels, composed c. 70 CE) break off abruptly at , when the men <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> tomb announce Jesus' resurrection, lacking post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. 16:9–20 {{does not appear in}} the earliest manuscripts. Many modern translations of Mark end at 16:8 with for they were afraid, sometimes adding 16:8–20 in italics, or in a footnote. For example, the New Revised Standard Version gives both the [...] "long ending," [...] i.e., 16:8–20, and another variant [...] "short ending" [...] after [...] Scholars disagree about whether the original work ended at 16:8, or whether the last part, perhaps the last page, is missing. John Fenton writes that if the author of Mark intended to end at 16:8, {{this does not mean that}} he [...] "did not believe that Christ was risen," [...] as he refers to the resurrection directly and indirectly on numerous occasions throughout the work. Reginald Fuller believes that the [...] "writer seemed to know such appearances, apparently to Peter and the others in Galilee." [...] Members of the Jesus Seminar believe that Mary Magdalene, Paul, and probably Peter had genuine visionary experiences of the risen Jesus.|$|E
