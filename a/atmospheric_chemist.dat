The polar stratospheric clouds in Antarctica are only formed when there are very low temperatures, as low as −80°C, and early spring conditions.

40|$|The {{most serious}} energy, {{economic}} and environmental problems {{are related to the}} use of fossil and nuclear fuels, which are rapidly diminishing and highly polluting, and many distinguished <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chemists,</b> including Dr. James Hanson at NASA, Dr. Steven Chu, the director of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and Professor Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences have documented that climate changes are now occurring much faster than predicted just a few years ago.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in alkylfurans as potential biofuels. Recent work has highlighted {{the need for further}} study of the atmospheric oxidation mechanism of 2 -methylfuran (2 MF). This study utilizes the high level composite computational methods, G 4 and CBS-QB 3, to determine the bond dissociation energies for the C-H bond in 2 MF and the reaction enthalpies and barrier heights of several of the known possible initiation reaction pathways. This study also investigates the possible subsequent low temperature reaction pathways following the addition of OH and then O 2 onto the 2 MF ring. The placement of the OH and O 2 on the ring, either cis or trans to each other, dictates the viability of subsequent reactions. Of particular interest is the observation that 1, 4 H-migrations that abstract the hydrogen bound to the same carbon as the OH have abnormally low barrier height. This dramatic decrease puts the reaction barrier lower than concerted eliminations and 6 -membered ring Waddington-type reactions. In addition, a novel reaction type, described as a Waddington concerted elimination, is reported herein. This reaction, when viable, is generally more favorable than other reactions.

40|$|Advances in {{analytical}} {{understanding of}} the biogeochemical cycles of the Biosphere have spawned the concepts of Gaia and Noosphere. Though seldom acknowledged today. it was the natural scientist Vladimir Vernadsky who first {{drew attention to the}} increasing scale of human intervention into planetary biogeochemical cycles. He did so in his book "Biosfera", published in 1926. In concert with the Jesuit paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Vernadsky developed the notion of Noosphere [...] an evolving collective human consciousness on Earth which was exerting an increasing influence on biogeochemical processes.

40|$|Large {{progress}} has been made in the past few years towards quantifying and understanding climate variability during past centuries. At the same time, present-day climate has been studied using state-of-the-art data sets and tools with respect to the physical and chemical mechanisms governing climate variability. Both the understanding of the past and the knowledge of the processes are important for assessing and attributing the anthropogenic effect on present and future climate. The most important time period in this context is the past approximately 100 years, which comprises large natural variations and extremes (such as long droughts) as well as anthropogenic influences, most pronounced in the past few decades. Recent and ongoing research efforts steadily improve the observational record of the 20 th century, while atmospheric circulation models are used to underpin the mechanisms behind large climatic variations. Atmospheric chemistry and composition are important for understanding climate variability and change, and considerable {{progress has}} been made in the past few years in this field.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) fluxes, and thus biologically weighted irradiances, were higher on Archaean Earth than on present-day Earth {{has been a}} pervasive influence on thinking concerning the nature of early Earth. It directly influences calculations concerning protection strategies {{that may or may}} not have been required by early life. Our knowledge of the Earth's changing UV radiation climate over time depends upon our knowledge of a diversity of factors, the magnitudes of which are uncertain. Here these uncertainties are explored. During the Archaean Era, calculations of the surface photobiological environment span a three order of magnitude difference in DNA-damage weighted irradiances with consequences for our assumptions concerning the environment for exposed surface life and the role of UV radiation as a mutagen. These differences are primarily caused by uncertainties in the concentrations of trace gases and the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that affect scattering in the atmosphere. To a lesser extent, the luminosity of the Sun in the UV region is also a factor. During the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic, when we know that an ozone column existed, these uncertainties drop to two orders of magnitude and are primarily caused by poor knowledge about the frequency and atmospheric effects of potentially ozone-depleting agents such as volcanism, impact events and supernovae explosions as well as the effects of global temperatures on ozone concentrations and thus surface UV irradiance. Changes in other atmospheric constituents during this time have less of an effect on photobiological consequences, which include a Palaeozoic oxygen pulse. Understanding the cause of photobiological uncertainties and their consequences constitutes a current challenge for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>chemists</b> and photobiologists...|$|R
