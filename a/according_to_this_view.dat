5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{does not}} say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but one recent history asserts that Beornwulf was almost {{certainly}} the one who attacked. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> Beornwulf may {{have taken advantage of}} the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia in the summer of 825. Beornwulf's motivation to launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to support this view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E
5|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E

5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will {{eventually}} have to explain such experiences. This follows from an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the belief that}} an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward. In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures. This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} {{signed a}} non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany in August 1939. But after the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers formed {{an alliance of}} convenience. Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied both Britain and the Soviets through its Lend-Lease Program. However, Stalin remained highly suspicious and {{he believed that the}} British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, Willard Van Orman Quine, George Santayana, {{and other}} {{philosophers}} {{argued that the}} success of naturalism in science meant that scientific methods should also be used in philosophy.

25|$|After Tacitus' {{mention of}} the Suiones, the sources are silent about them until the 6th century as Scandinavia still was in pre-historic times.

25|$|According to Rabbi Jose b. Hanina, {{each of the}} Patriarchs instituted one prayer: Abraham the morning, Isaac the {{afternoon}} and Jacob the evening prayers. This view is supported with Biblical quotes indicating that the Patriarchs prayed at the times mentioned.

25|$|In many Gnostic systems, God {{is known}} as the Monad, the One. God is the high source of the pleroma, the region of light. The various emanations of God are called æons. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> Hippolytus, <b>this</b> <b>view</b> was {{inspired}} by the Pythagoreans, who called the first thing that came into existence the Monad, which begat the dyad, which begat the numbers, which begat the point, begetting lines, etc.|$|R

25|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> {{the story}} of Jacob's visit to Laban to obtain a wife {{originated}} {{as a metaphor for}} this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt. According to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal matriarchs whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|Sverdlov {{approaches}} the question from a morphological standpoint. Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words {{can take the}} form of a genitive or a bare root, he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> all kennings are formally compounds, notwithstanding widespread tmesis.|$|E
25|$|This invasion, {{combined}} with the later Mongol rule, were speculated to have caused China's advance into capitalism to fall behind by several centuries; although the Ming dynasty later restored the old order, their own fall to the Manchus were to stagnate China once more.

50|$|Roger Collins {{cites the}} work of Pierre Guichard to argue that Berber groups in Iberia {{retained}} their own distinctive social organization. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> traditional <b>view</b> of Arab and Berber culture in the Iberian peninsula, Berber society was highly impermeable to outside influences, whereas Arabs became assimilated and Hispanized. Some support for the view that Berbers assimilated less comes from an excavation of an Islamic cemetery in northern Spain, which reveals that the Berbers accompanying the initial invasion brought their families with them from north Africa.|$|R
25|$|Many {{commentators}} have since rejected {{this understanding of}} Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> opposing <b>view,</b> Hume's empiricism consisted in {{the idea that it}} is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims <b>to</b> knowledge on <b>this</b> basis.|$|R
