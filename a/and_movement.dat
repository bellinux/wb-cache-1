50|$|The {{second and}} third {{chapters}} of the title concerns political parties <b>and</b> <b>movements,</b> <b>and</b> establishes special protection for opposition parties. The right of all citizens to establish, organize and develop parties <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> {{as well as their}} freedom to join or leave them is guaranteed. Political parties <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> are democratically organized with transparency, objectivity, morality, gender equality and the duty to present and disseminate their political programs as their guiding principles.|$|R
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{national}} emergency has an {{adverse effect on}} these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly <b>and</b> <b>movement,</b> etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the President may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.|$|E
5|$|Access <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> {{within the}} {{protected}} areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} funding of {{political}} parties <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> in the Czech Republic for twenty-five years. The main aim of the thesis is to assess how state funding {{of political parties}} <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> represented in the Chamber of Deputies can differ from the smaller parties which are entitled to state contributions. The first chapter, which is more theoretical, deals with models of funding of political parties. The rules of funding of political parties <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> in the Czech Republic are described in the second chapter. The analysis of total incomes and expenditures of political parties <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> {{can be found in}} the third part of the thesis, but also a comparison of these data between the selected parties. The last part of the thesis deals with the new regulation and its contribution to the system of funding of political parties <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> in the Czech Republic...|$|R

These {{may be of}} the same species, as in sexual selection, or of different species, as in cleaning symbiosis. Signals, which often combine colour <b>and</b> <b>movement,</b> may be understood by many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited by different species of fish, and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E
5|$|During these missions, {{objectives}} and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects and environments in the game. The tutorial system used to demonstrate routine gameplay {{elements such as}} object interaction <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> is disguised as the first level of Gravity Bone. Here, the player is tasked with the delivery of a contaminated drink to an unspecified non-player character. After the first level is completed, the player {{is sent to the}} second level of the game, which follows the pattern of the first; the player is assigned a set of actions and goals involving platforming sequences.|$|E

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed <b>and</b> <b>movement.</b> In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E

One Type 96 turned back with engine trouble, leaving 31bombers in the attack force.

Television {{producer}} Helena Harris, {{who had worked}} on Bananas in Pyjamas, co-created Hi-5 as a concept for a new television show. She and co-producer Posie Graeme-Evans (The Miraculous Mellops, Mirror, Mirror) developed the series as preschool entertainment, incorporating educational trends with a pop music appeal, using music <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> to capture the attention of children. Featuring five performers, the cast are intended to act as older siblings of viewers, rather than adults teaching children. The name of the group {{was derived from the}} high five gesture.|$|E

5|$|In one experiment, when offered live {{fruit flies}} (Drosophila virilis), {{salamanders}} choose {{the larger of}} 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3. Frogs can distinguish between low numbers (1 vs 2, 2 vs 3, but not 3 vs 4) and large numbers (3 vs 6, 4 vs 8, but not 4 vs 6) of prey. This is irrespective of other characteristics, i.e. surface area, volume, weight <b>and</b> <b>movement,</b> although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area.|$|E
5|$|In the Diptera (true flies), {{there is}} only one pair of {{functional}} wings, with the posterior pair of wings are reduced to halteres, which help the fly to sense its orientation <b>and</b> <b>movement,</b> as well as to improve balance by acting similar to gyroscopes. In Calyptratae, the very hindmost portion of the wings are modified into somewhat thickened flaps called calypters which cover the halteres.|$|E
