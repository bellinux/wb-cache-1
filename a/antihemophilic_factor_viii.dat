40|$|Bovine {{vascular}} endothelial cells do {{not grow}} when cultured at low density unless fibroblast growth factor {{is included in}} the culture medium. When endothelial cells obtained from the intimal surface of fetal and adult aortas were seeded at low density (8 cells per cm 2), they formed small colonies of large, irregular, vacuolated cells. At very low density (0. 3 cells per cm 2) they did not survive. The addition of fibroblast growth factor to endothelial cells maintained at such low densities resulted in the formation of vigorously growing colonies of small, uniform cells. Electron microscopy showed that the cultured endothelial cells had the fine structure characteristics of endothelial cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (<b>Factor</b> <b>VIII)</b> antigen in the cells. Our results demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor permits the survival of endothelial cells plated at extremely low cell density. With the use of fibroblast growth factor, endothelial cell clones are easily produced...|$|R
40|$|Aggregation {{of human}} {{platelets}} by bovine plasma was recently {{recognized as a}} marker {{for the study of}} the antihemophilic and von Willebrand factors. A similar marker in porcine plasma is shown to be specific for the platelet-active von Willebrand factor of plasma, but not for the <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (<b>factor</b> <b>VIII).</b> A new quantitative assay for the von Willebrand factor is based on the dose-response relationship observed between the concentration of von Willebrand factor and platelet aggregation times determined macroscopically. Bleeder swine, homozygous for von Willebrand disease, had no detectable platelet aggregating activity, while heterozygotes, carriers of the disease, had reduced levels of approximately 50 % of normal. Exact detection of non-obligate carriers, hitherto impossible, becomes readily feasible because of the gene dosage relationship to the von Willebrand factor plasma levels. Transfusion of bleeder swine with normal plasma results in an immediate post-transfusion rise of the von Willebrand factor, followed by a rapid falloff. At 24 hr post-transfusion, no von Willebrand factor is detectable at a time when the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> response is at its maximum. The discordance in plasma levels of this platelet-active von Willebrand <b>factor</b> and <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> in carrier animals and in the bleeder animals after transfusion suggests a different molecular and genetic basis for these two biological activities...|$|R

40|$|The {{virus that}} causes the {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), human T lymphotropic virus/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV), was incubated at temperatures from 37 degrees to 60 degrees C and virus titer (ID- 50) was determined over time by a microculture infectivity assay. The rate of thermal decay was consistent with first-order kinetics, and these data were used to construct a linear Arrhenius plot (r = 0. 99), which {{was used to determine}} inactivation time as a function of temperature. In the liquid state, thermal decay was little affected by matrix (culture media, serum, or liquid Factor VIII). In the lyophilized state, the time required to reduce virus titer 10 -fold (1 log) at 60 degrees C was 32 min compared with 24 s in the liquid state.

40|$|In plasma, <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (<b>factor</b> <b>VIII)</b> {{exists as}} a 200 -kilodalton heavy-chain {{polypeptide}} {{in a metal}} ion association with an 80 -kilodalton light-chain polypeptide. This complex is bound by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions to a large multimeric glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (vWF). Accumulation of secreted human <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> activity expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells requires the addition of serum in the growth medium, which provides vWF. Here we report that coexpression of vWF with <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in increased stable accumulation of <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> activity {{in the absence of}} serum in the growth medium. In the coexpressing cells, the vWF cDNA transcription unit was transcribed to yield mRNA which was efficiently translated. vWF was properly processed and secreted to yield disulfide-bonded high-molecular-weight multimers similar to those observed in vWF secreted from human endothelial cells. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> gene was transcribed at a level {{similar to that of the}} vWF gene, but the mRNA did not accumulate to high levels in the cytoplasm. In addition, although the translation efficiency of the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> mRNA was similar to that of vWF, the processing and secretion of the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> primary translation product was dramatically reduced compared with vWF. These results demonstrate that in Chinese hamster ovary cells both <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> mRNA accumulation and the processing and secretion of the primary <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> translation product are inefficient processes...|$|R

The staining pattern was observed in endothelial cells of arteries, capillaries, and veins as well as the cells lining hepatic and splenic sinusoids. Specific fluorescence was limited to these endothelial cells in sections of kidney, liver, spleen, lymph node, cardiac and smooth muscle, thyroid, umbilical cord, and skin.

Immediately after each infusion the various activities <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor,</b> von Willebrand platelet aggregating factor, and Factor VIII-related antigen, were elevated in approximate proportion to dose and the bleeding time was shortened. There was a late secondary rise in <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor.</b> During the period after infusion, there was a differential fall-off of the various activities, with the bleeding time effect lost first, followed by the von Willebrand platelet aggregating factor {{and then by the}} Factor VIII-related antigen. The plasma from swine with von Willebrand's disease late after infusion contained high levels of <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> without other detectable activities of the complex. <b>Antihemophilic</b> <b>factor,</b> free of the other components, obtained from plasma from swine with von Willebrand's disease either before or late after infusion eluted from agarose gel columns both as high and lower molecular weight material, unlike normal <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor,</b> which had a high molecular weight.

AHF-like antigen was present in normal human serum. In contrast, material antigenically related to AHF was found in decreased amounts in the concentrates prepared from the plasma of 11 patients with von Willebrand's disease. The experiments described suggest that von Willebrand's disease is a disorder in which a true deficiency of AHF exists.

40|$|Isolation and {{characterization}} of rat glomerular epithelial cells in vitro. Rat glomeruli were isolated by a graded sieving technique, {{and the nature}} and purity of the preparation were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A {{great majority of the}} glomeruli (86. 0 ± 6. 0 %) were not encapsulated, and there was very little contamination of the preparations with tubular fragments. By supplementing tissue culture medium with conditioned medium (CM) and insulin, we were able to grow single cells from dissociated rat glomeruli. From these single cells, we were able to clone and maintain in culture three distinct cell types. Also, with this specialized medium, we were able to clone these three cell types from outgrowths of whole golmeruli. One of these cell types was characterized as glomerular epithelial cells (GEC). GEC, as opposed to the other two cloned cell types obtained in this study, had cilia on their surfaces and also possessed receptors for complement (C 3) in vitro. Low concentrations of the aminonucleoside of puromycin (AMNS), which {{have been shown to be}} specifically cytotoxic to GEC in vivo, were found to be cytotoxic to GEC but not to the other two glomerular cells in vitro.

40|$|When {{purified}} <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (<b>Factor</b> <b>VIII)</b> was rechromatographed on 4 % agarose in 0. 15 M NaCl or 1. 0 M NaCl, {{a single}} protein peak, containing both procoagulant activity and von Willebrand factor activity, {{as defined by}} ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation, was eluted in the void volume. Purified <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> immediately lost about 30 % of its procoagulant activity when dissolved in 0. 25 M CaCl 2, and when rechromatographed on 4 % agarose in 0. 25 M CaCl 2, the protein peak and von Willebrand factor activity remained coincident in the void volume; however, {{most of the remaining}} procoagulant activity was eluted after the void volume. The elution position of <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> procoagulant activity from 4 % agarose in 0. 25 M CaCl 2, and hence its apparent molecular weight, varied with the protein concentration applied to the column; at low protein concentrations it was eluted close to the inner volume. Yet on Sephadex G- 200 in 0. 25 M CaCl 2, the protein and procoagulant activity were eluted together in the void volume. These observations suggested that the <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> procoagulant activity was not eluting according to size or shape, but was adsorbing to some extent to the agarose. Isolated activity peak material from the 0. 25 M CaCl 2 columns contained protein and had a typical ultraviolet spectrum. Even at high concentrations, the protein contained no thrombin, Factors IX, X, or Xa activity, or detectable phospholipid. In addition to <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> procoagulant activity, which could be inactivated by a human antibody to <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII,</b> the activity peak protein also contained von Willebrand factor activity. Like native <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> and the void volume protein, the activity peak contained protein that did not enter a sodium dodecyl sulfate 5 % polyacrylamide gel in the absence of reducing reagent. After reduction of disulfide bonds, several subunits ranging from 195, 000 to 30, 000 daltons were observed. These results indicate that the protein in the shifted <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> procoagulant activity peak is large and that its anomalous elution pattern from 4 % agarose in 0. 25 M CaCl 2 results from interaction with the agarose. The Factor VIII-like properties of the activity peak protein and its electrophoretic pattern on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels suggest that it is a species of <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> modified by proteolytic cleavage. These results allow an interpretation that is different from the recently proposed "carrier protein-small active subunit" hypotheses for the structure-function relationships of the <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> molecule...|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{localization}} of <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF, <b>factor</b> <b>VIII)</b> antigen and fibrinogen by immunofluorescent microscopy {{was determined}} in 146 specimens of normal and diseased kidneys. AHF antigen {{was present in}} the endothelial cells of glomeruli, peritubular capillaries, arteries, and veins of normal kidneys; a distribution {{similar to that in}} other tissues. In scleroderma and malignant hypertension, deposition of AHF antigen and fibrinogen was limited to the markedly thickened endothelial layers of arteries. More extensive intense deposition of both AHF antigen and fibrinogen in glomeruli and in arterial walls were present in hyperacute renal homograft rejection, hemolyticuremic syndrome, postpartum renal failure, and in some cases of acute homograft rejection. In contrast, deposition of fibrinogen was observed in glomerular epithelial cresents in severe proliferative glomerulonephritis, but AHF deposition was not present in these lesions. Glomerular deposition of fibrinogen without increased AHF standing was also detected in renal tissue from patients with anaphylactoid purpura nephritis and in recurrent macroscopic hematuria with focal glomerulonephritis. Increased staining of peritubular capillaries with anti-AHF was seen in diseased kidneys irrespective of etiology.

40|$|<b>Antihemophilic</b> {{globulin}} (AHF, <b>factor</b> <b>VIII)</b> {{levels were}} {{measured by a}} standard coagulation assay and by an immunological technique before and serially after infusion of fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate into patients with von Willebrand's disease. Initial levels of AHF, measured both as procoagulant and as antigen, were low. Immediately after transfusions, the rise in levels of AHF-like antigen was compatible with the quantity of antigen present in the infused plasma or cryoprecipitate. Thereafter, levels of antigen declined rapidly and reached preinfusion values in approximately 24 hr. In contrast, procoagulant activity remained elevated, and sometimes continued to rise, {{for longer periods of}} time. One possible explanation of this finding is that the AHF molecule produced by patients with von Willebrand's disease, in response to transfusion of as yet unidentified factors, lacks the antigenic site associated with the normal AHF molecule or the inactive molecule produced by patients with hemophilia A...|$|R
40|$|The human-platelet {{aggregating}} {{factor in}} preparations of bovine plasma and bovine <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> {{has been reported}} to be an activity of bovine <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor.</b> However, we show that activities of aggregating <b>factor</b> and <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> are present in varying proportion in different preparations of <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor.</b> Aggregating factor activity is more stable on storage than is <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> activity and can be selectively adsorbed by human platelets. Further, <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> activity free of aggregating activity was eluted from DEAE-Sephadex. The factors were also separated during agarose chromatography in 0. 25 M CaCl 2, which yields a small-molecular-weight moiety with <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> activity; aggregating factor activity continued to elute in the void volume. Thus, aggregating factor activity is clearly separable from <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> activity. The usual physiologic platelet-aggregating reactions require fresh platelets.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, {{we showed that}} the abnormality of ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma in 10 patients with von Willebrand's disease could be corrected by a factor in normal plasma that was present in the same fractions as <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> procoagulant activity (<b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor,</b> AHF, VIIIAHF) when prepared by chromatography on Bio-Gel 5 M (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.). This observation suggests that patients with this disorder are deficient in a plasma factor, associated with the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> molecule, that is necessary for normal platelet function. In the present paper, we describe, an assay for this factor, the von Willebrand factor (VIIIVWF), based on the observation that a log-log relationship exists {{between the amount of}} ristocetin-induced aggregation of washed, normal platelets and the concentration of normal plasma present in the test system. We assayed the activity of VIIIVWF as well as <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> procoagulant activity (VIIIAHF) and <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> antigen (VIIIAGN) in 15 patients with von Willebrand's disease and 20 normal subjects. A highly significant correlation (r ∼ 0. 80) between VIIIVWF and both VIIIAHF was found in normal subjects and in patients with von Willebrand's disease. This finding, in addition to the observation that agarose gel chromatography fractions that have VIIIAHF procoagulant activity also have VIIIVWF activity, strongly suggests that the von Willebrand factor is associated with the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> molecule. VIIIVWF in normal plasma was not inhibited by human anti-VIII, and VIIIVWF levels were normal in hemophilic plasma. Thus, the VIIIVWF site on the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> molecule appears to be different from that determining VIIIAHF. Finally, the activity of VIIIVWF appeared to correlate better with the bleeding time than either VIIIAHF or VIIIAGN. This suggests that VIIIVWF assayed in this study may be the “anti-bleeding factor” that is deficient in von Willebrand's disease. These findings are consistent with a decreased synthesis of the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> molecule in von Willebrand's disease and suggest the possibility of additional abnormalities of the site on the molecule that determines the activity of VIIIVWF...|$|R

The advent of effective clotting factor replacement therapy for patients with hemophilia {{is considered one of}} the foremost medical advances of the 20 th century. The last 3 decades of experience in hemophilia care have witnessed the effectiveness of the care of patients with hemophilia within specialized comprehensive care centers, advances in factor replacement therapies, the benefits of prophylaxis over on-demand replacement therapy, and the role of aggressive management of joint disease to prevent dysfunction. Ongoing challenges, including the management of inhibitors to factor therapies and the consequences of thousands of patients with hemophilia becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus in the 1980 s from contaminated plasma-derived factor concentrates, have highlighted the need for vigilance with respect to clotting factor product safety, access to care, and a full complement of choice of factor replacement therapies.

The bleeding time is also long. Venom coagglutinin, a Bothrops factor that causes platelet aggregation in vitro, depletes the plasma of its von Willebrand factor. The rate of platelet aggregation {{is a function of}} the amount of the coagglutinin present. Based on this observation, a sensitive and quantitative assay for the venom coagglutinin was developed. We administered the purified Bothrops factor to normal pigs and dogs and induced a von Willebrand syndrome similar to the inherited disease. The plasma von Willebrand factor was severely depleted; the <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> and the Factor VIII-related antigen were not depleted as much. The bleeding time was normal. During the induction phase of the syndrome, transient thrombocytopenia with a long bleeding time occurred. The pig was less sensitive than the dog to the effect of coagglutinin. The severity of the syndrome is determined by the amount of venom coagglutinin administered. It is suggested that the syndrome could be induced in any mammalian species because the plasma of all mammals tested in vitro is sensitive to the venom factor. This model provides another avenue for the study of the heterogeneity of the <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> complex and the pathophysiology of its components...|$|R

In 2003, octocogalpha, <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (recombinant), plasma/albumin-free method (ADVATE®) was introduced, providing the first third-generation recombinant <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> (rFVIII) concentrate. Completed clinical trials have demonstrated ADVATE® to be safe and effective in adult and pediatric subjects utilizing both prophylactic and on-demand treatment regimens, and for perioperative hemostatic coverage. In the five completed studies involving more than 200 previously treated patients (PTPs), a single incidence of low-titer, non-persistent inhibitor was reported. Active post authorization safety surveillance (PASS) is being performed to expand the efficacy and safety profile of ADVATE® in routine clinical practice. Laboratory studies have documented the storage and post-reconstitution stability of ADVATE®, conferring the desired versatility for home treatment. The evolving real-world experience and ongoing studies will provide further insight into ADVATE® pharmacokinetics, alternative prophylactic dosing regimens, methods for perioperative hemostatic management, and utility in immune tolerance induction. Experience with ADVATE®, and its place in today’s treatment paradigm, is the focus of this article. Keywords: ADVATE®, <b>factor</b> <b>VIII,</b> hemophilia, octocog-alph...|$|R
40|$|The {{antibiotic}} ristocetin, in {{concentrations of}} 1. 0 - 1. 5 mg/ml, aggregated normal platelets in citrated platelet-rich plasma by a mechanism {{in which the}} release reaction played only a minor role. Platelet aggregation by ristocetin in a concentration of 1. 2 mg/ml was absent or markedly decreased in 10 patients with von Willebrand's disease. Lesser degrees of abnormality were obtained with a concentration of 1. 5 mg/ml. The magnitude of the defect in ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation correlated well with the degree of abnormality of the bleeding time and the levels of <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF, VIIIAHF) procoagulant activity. In all patients, the defect in ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation was corrected in vitro by normal plasma. Correction was also obtained with a fraction of normal cryoprecipitate that eluted in the void volume with VIIIAHF after chromatography on a gel that excludes molecules larger than 5 × 106. A similar fraction, devoid of VIIIAHF activity, obtained from patients with von Willebrand's disease had no corrective effect, but fractions obtained from patients with hemophilia were just as effective as those obtained from normal subjects. The correction activity of plasma and partially purified <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> was inhibited by a rabbit antibody to human <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> but not by a human antibody against VIIIAHF procoagulant activity. The studies provide further evidence that patients with von Willebrand's disease are deficient in a plasma factor that is necessary for normal platelet function. The activity of this factor appears {{to be associated with}} <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> but is unrelated to VIIIAHF procoagulant activity...|$|R
40|$|Botrocetin, {{originally}} called venom coagglutinin, is a Bothrops {{factor that}} causes aggregation of blood platelets {{in the presence}} of the von Willebrand component of the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> macromolecular complex. The complex consists of a series of multimers with a molecular weight of about 1 - 20 x 10 (6). Ristocetin, another agent that causes platelet aggregation dependent on von Willebrand factor, reacts with only the higher molecular weight multimers. We report on the reactivity of botrocetin in relation to the multimeric structure of the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> complex. Several plasmas or plasma fractions with abnormal distribution of the multimeric sizes were examined, including variant von Willebrand disease type IIA with lack of the higher molecular weight forms, commercial <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> concentrates with a preponderance of lower molecular weight forms, cryoprecipitate-free plasma containing mainly the smaller multimers, and a chromatographic fraction of plasma containing only the highest molecular weight polymers. Factor VIII-related antigen content was adjusted to 25 - 100 %. All of the preparations lacking the high molecular weight forms caused prompt platelet aggregation with botrocetin, but none of them caused aggregation in the ristocetin test made isochronal with the botrocetin test. The very high molecular weight polymers were equally effective with botrocetin and ristocetin. These findings indicate that the Bothrops factor is reactive with a broad spectrum of high to low molecular weight forms of the <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> complex, suggesting that bioassays of von Willebrand factor with botrocetin should correlate better with immunoassays for factor VIII-related antigen and could reflect better the full platelet-aggregating function of the complex than do ristocetin determinations...|$|R
