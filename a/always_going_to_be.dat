You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip {{it and make it}} so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E

25|$|With Luton's spell {{in the top}} flight finally over, it was <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{difficult}} to keep hold of prize assets. So it proved when Mick Harford signed for Chelsea for £300,000. The first season in the new, three-division Football League almost saw Luton drop into the third tier of English football. The team was not helped by the involvement of Scottish duo Paul Telfer and Darren Salton in a motor accident {{early on in the}} season – under-21 international defender Salton was nearly killed, and never played again. Luton were bottom of the table shortly into the New Year, and Pleat reacted by procuring a loan deal to bring Luton-born England international Kerry Dixon to the club on loan from Southampton. Dixon gelled well alongside Phil Gray up front, and Luton stayed up.|$|E

60|$|And the old couple--have they no comfort or {{enjoyment}} of existence? See them among their grandchildren and great-grandchildren; how garrulous they are, how they compare one with another, and insist on likenesses {{which no one}} else can see; how gently the old lady lectures the girls on points of breeding and decorum, and points the moral by anecdotes of herself in her young days--how the old gentleman chuckles over boyish feats and roguish tricks, and tells long stories of a 'barring-out' achieved at the school he went to: which was very wrong, he tells the boys, and never <b>to</b> <b>be</b> imitated of course, but which he cannot help letting them know was very pleasant too--especially when he kissed the master's niece. This last, however, is a point on which the old lady is very tender, for she considers it a shocking and indelicate thing to talk about, and always says so whenever it is mentioned, never failing to observe that he ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very penitent for having been so sinful. So the old gentleman gets no further, and what the schoolmaster's niece said afterwards (which he <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell) <b>is</b> lost <b>to</b> posterity.|$|R

60|$|Mr. George went to New York {{to engage}} the passage for the children. And inasmuch {{as many of the}} readers of this book who reside in the country may never have had the {{opportunity}} of witnessing the arrangements connected with Atlantic steamers, they may perhaps like to know how this was done. In the first place, it <b>was</b> necessary <b>to</b> get a permit to go on board the ship. The crowds of people in New York, who <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> and fro, <b>are</b> so great, and the interest felt in these great steamships is so strong, that if every body were allowed free access and egress to them, the decks and cabins of the vessels would be always in confusion. So they build a barricade across the great pier at which the ships lie, with ponderous gates, one large one for carts and carriages, and another smaller one for people on foot, opening through it, and no one is admitted without a ticket. Mr. George went to the office in Wall Street and procured such a ticket, which one of the clerks in attendance there gave him, on his saying that he wished to go on board to select a state room for some passengers.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Snooks {{saw them}} off from Rome with that pathetic {{interrogative}} perplexity {{still on his}} face, and {{if it had not}} been for Helen he would have retained Miss Winchelsea's hold-all in his hand as a sort of encyclopaedic keepsake. On their way back to England Miss Winchelsea on six separate occasions made Fanny promise to write to her the longest of long letters. Fanny, it seemed, would be quite near Mr. Snooks. Her new school--she <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> new schools--would <b>be</b> only five miles from Steely Bank, and it was in the Steely Bank Polytechnic, and one or two first-class schools, that Mr. Snooks did his teaching. He might even see her at times. They could not talk much of him--she and Fanny always spoke of [...] "him," [...] never of Mr. Snooks,--because Helen <b>was</b> apt <b>to</b> say unsympathetic things about him. Her nature had coarsened very much, Miss Winchelsea perceived, since the old Training College days; she had become hard and cynical. She thought he had a weak face, mistaking refinement for weakness as people of her stamp <b>are</b> apt <b>to</b> do, and when she heard his name was Snooks, she said she had expected something of the sort. Miss Winchelsea <b>was</b> careful <b>to</b> spare her own feelings after that, but Fanny was less circumspect.|$|R

[...] Kevin Hoskins of Jesus Freak Hideout rated the album three-and-a-half stars, saying that [...] "there are more positives than negatives to ATLast, so most will enjoy spinning this."

60|$|Another {{element of}} comfort {{may have been}} the fact, that in the rough {{education}} of the forest, only the strong and healthy children lived, while the weakly died off young, and so the labour-market, as we should say now, was never overstocked. This is the case with our own gipsies, and with many savage tribes--the Red Indians, for instance--and accounts for their general healthiness: the unhealthy being all dead, in the first struggle for existence. But then these gipsies, and the Red Indians, do not increase in numbers, but the contrary; while our forefathers increased rapidly. On the other hand, we have, at least throughout the middle ages, accounts of such swarms of cripples, lepers, deformed, and other incapable persons, as to make some men believe that there were more of them, in proportion to the population, than there are now. And it may have been so. The strongest and healthiest men <b>always</b> <b>going</b> off <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed in war, the weakliest only would be left at home to breed; and so an unhealthy population might spring up. And again--and this is a curious fact--as law and order enter a country, so will the proportion of incapables, in body and mind, increase. In times of war and anarchy, when every one is shifting for himself, only the strongest and shrewdest can stand. Woe to those who cannot take care of themselves. The fools and cowards, the weakly and sickly, are killed, starved, neglected, or in other ways brought to grief. But when law and order come, they protect those who cannot protect themselves, and the fools and cowards, the weakly and sickly, are supported at the public expense, and allowed to increase and multiply as public burdens. I do not say that this is wrong, Heaven forbid! I only state the fact. A government is quite right in defending all alike from the brute competition of nature, whose motto is--Woe to the weak. To the Church of the middle age is due the preaching and the practice of the great Christian doctrine, that society <b>is</b> bound <b>to</b> protect the weak. So far the middle age saw: but no further. For our own times has been reserved the higher and deeper doctrine, that it is the duty of society to make the weak strong; to reform, to cure, and above all, to prevent by education, by sanitary science, by all and every means, the necessity of reforming and of curing.|$|R
