40|$|Abstract Background Influenza virus (IV) {{infections are}} {{a major threat to}} human welfare and animal health worldwide. Anti-viral therapy {{includes}} vaccines and a few anti-viral drugs. However vaccines are not always available in time, as demonstrated by the emergence of the new 2009 H 1 N 1 -type pandemic strain of swine origin (S-OIV) in April 2009, and the acquisition of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors such as Tamiflu ® (oseltamivir) is a potential problem. Therefore the prospects for the control of IV by existing anti-viral drugs are limited. As an alternative approach to the common anti-virals we studied in more detail a commercial standardized extract of the widely used herb Echinacea purpurea (Echinaforce ®, EF) in order to elucidate the nature of its anti-IV activity. Results Human H 1 N 1 -type IV, highly pathogenic avian IV (HPAIV) of the H 5 - and H 7 -types, as well as swine origin IV (S-OIV, H 1 N 1), were all inactivated in cell culture assays by the EF preparation at concentrations ranging from the recommended dose <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>consumption</b> to several orders of magnitude lower. Detailed studies with the H 5 N 1 HPAIV strain indicated that direct contact between EF and virus was required, prior to infection, in order to obtain maximum inhibition in virus replication. Hemagglutination assays showed that the extract inhibited the receptor binding activity of the virus, suggesting that the extract interferes with the viral entry into cells. In sequential passage studies under treatment in cell culture with the H 5 N 1 virus no EF-resistant variants emerged, in contrast to Tamiflu ®, which produced resistant viruses upon passaging. Furthermore, the Tamiflu ® -resistant virus was just as susceptible to EF as the wild type virus. Conclusion As a result of these investigations, we believe that this standard Echinacea preparation, used at the recommended dose <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>consumption,</b> could be a useful, readily available and affordable addition to existing control options for IV replication and dissemination. </p...|$|R

This however has been without recourse to its safety. Therefore,aqueous stem extract of M. acuminata was evaluated for its effects on somefunction indices of the liver of male rats. Methods: Sixty, male rats were grouped into 4 (A, B, C and D) such that Group A(control) was orally administered 1 cm 3 of distilled water while those in groups B, Cand D received orally 1 cm 3 of extract corresponding to 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kgbody weight respectively. Some biochemical parameters of liver function wereevaluated in the animals after 1, 7 and 21 daily doses. Results: The extract significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) the activity of alkalinephosphatase in the liver of rats throughout the experimental period. This decreasewas accompanied by corresponding increase in the serum enzyme. In contrast, allthe doses of the extract increased the activities of both the AST and ALT in the liverand serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase as well asthe concentrations of serum total bilirubin, protein and albumin.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of ethanol extracts of Vitexagnus-castus on placental histomorphology in rat models. Methods: In the present experimental study, fourty pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups (n= 10). A control group received only distilled water and three experimental groups were treated with extract of Vitexagnus-castus at doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg at days of six to the seventeenth of intraperitoneally administration. On day of 18 of gestation, after anesthesia with chloroform half the animals in each group were killed and histomorphological study was calculated. After delivery the resulting offspring of the other half of animals in each group was counted and survival rates at days 5, 15, 25 and 42 after birth were decreased. The results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test. Results: Treatment with 50 mg/kg VAC extract reduced the size and number of trophoblast giant cells, and significantly increased trophoblast cells glycogen. Treatment with 75 mg/kg extract induced massive hyperemia in the labyrinth interhemal membrane.

5000|$|The agent under {{investigation}} is an octadentate ligand consisting of four cross-linked dipicolinic acid moieties (Figure 2). This molecule {{is unique in}} having the potential <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>consumption</b> in humans. It would function by coordinating as a chelating ligand with toxic actinides in the body before they can cause significant damage. In theory, once the chelating ligands have bound to the actinides, the heavy metal complexes can exit the body naturally by urination.The chelator of interest exhibits higher affinity for lanthanides in vivo than DTPA due to its octadentate structure, and thus it has shown greater efficacy in radionuclide decorporation in living systems. The ligand has shown favorable selectivity for plutonium, americium, uranium, and neptunium decorporation (with no observed toxicity in either in vitro tests on human tissue or in vivo experiments on rodent models), which is also an improvement over the currently accepted DTPA. Finally, in a separate study, Abergel evaluated the purity of this molecule for potential drug applications, ultimately bringing this effort closer {{to the development of}} a deployable treatment solution.An additional research project by Abergel’s group involved testing the effectiveness of other analogs containing dipicolinic acid in eliminating plutonium (Figure 3). Results showed that both of the compounds were successful in removing plutonium over a seven-day period in mice. Overall, this work, along with further studies focusing on lanthanide and actinide chelation, has important implications for medicinal and environmental chemistry.|$|R
50|$|A major {{inconvenience}} for {{the future}} clinical development of betulinic acid and analogues resides in their poor solubility in aqueous media such as blood serum and polar solvents used for bioassays. To circumvent this problem of hydrosolubility and to enhance pharmacological properties, many derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activity. One study showed C-20 modifications involve the loss of cytotoxicity. Another study demonstrated {{the importance of the}} presence of the -COOH group, since compounds substituted at this position, such as lupeol and methyl betulinate, were less active on human melanoma than betulinic acid. Moreover, some C-28 amino acids and C-3 phthalates derivatives exhibited higher cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines with improved selective toxicity and water solubility. Chatterjee et al. obtained the 28-O-β-D-glucopyranoside of betulinic acid by microbial transformation with Cunninghamella species, while Baglin et al. obtained it by organic synthesis. This glucoside did not exhibit any significant in vitro activity on human melanoma (MEL-2) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell lines, which confirms the importance of the carboxylic acid function to preserve the cytotoxicity. Recently, Gauthier et al. synthesized a series of 3-O-glycosides of betulinic acid which exhibited a strongly potent in vitro anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines.A source of soluble and ingestible betulinic acid (and its precursor, betulin) is the chaga (Inonotus obliquus), a slow-growing medicinal fungus found as a parasite on birch trees in the coldest regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This mushroom converts the betulin present in the bark of the birch into a soluble and ingestible form of betulinic acid. Using a proper extraction protocol (alcohol/ethanol extraction) will make the compounds available <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>consumption.</b> The slow-growing nature of the fungus (7-10 years minimum) and because it cannot be cultivated without losing most of its properties make this an unreliable source, though.|$|R

Traditional methods of reducing populations of these pests involve poisons that can cause accidental exposures in other animals and humans. Fertility management with nonlethal chemicals would be an improved method of rat pest population control. Two chemicals known to target ovarian function in female rats are 4 -vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) and triptolide. Additionally, triptolide impairs spermatogenesis in males. A liquid bait containing no active ingredients (control), or containing triptolide (0. 001 %) and VCD (0. 109 %; active) was prepared to investigate the potential use of these agents for wild rat pest population control. Liquid bait was made available to male (n = 8 control; n = 8 active) and female (n = 8 control; n = 8 active) Sprague Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>consumption</b> prior to breeding. Whereas, control bait-treated females produced normal-sized litters (10. 0 ± 1. 7 pups/litter), treated females delivered no pups. Wild Norway male (n = 20) and female (n = 20) rats (Rattus norvegicus) were trapped, individually housed, and one group given free access to control bait, one group to active bait. Following three cycles of treatment-matched mating pairs, females consuming control bait (control) produced normal litter sizes (9. 73 ± 0. 73 pups/litter). Females who had consumed active bait (treated) produced no litters on breeding cycles one and two; however, 2 of 10 females produced small litters on the third mating cycle. In a fourth breeding cycle, control females were crossmated with treated males, and treated females were crossmated with control males. In both groups, some dams produced litters, while others did not. The differences in response reflect a heterogeneity in return to cyclicity between females. These results suggest a potential approach to integrated pest management by compromising fertility, and could provide a novel alternative to traditional poisons for reducing populations of wild rat pests...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop the lactic acid {{bacterium}} (LAB) Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS 1 as delivery vector for a human mucosal vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). LAB are known for their wide use in the food industry, especially in food and beverage preservation, and are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. L. plantarum WCFS 1 has probiotic and immunomodulating effects and can persist in the human tract for up to seven days. L. plantarum and other LAB are regarded as safe <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>consumption</b> and are thus subjects of extensive research regarding their potential as in situ delivery vectors for heterologous proteins. In several previous studies on the ability of recombinant bacteria to activate an immune response through the mucosal immune system, specific immune responses have been detected. In the present study, the HIVp 24 fusion protein consisting of a HIV antigen and a cytokine, was expressed and anchored to the surface of L. plantarum WCFS 1 using different anchors: a lipoanchor, an LPxTG-type anchor and a LysM-type anchor. Expression and surface display of the fusion protein was achieved, but with varying results depending on the anchor type. The variation in results emphasises the need to optimise the combination of signal peptide, anchor type, target protein and host strain for each heterologous protein that one wishes to express and display. A replicon change, presumably leading to higher plasmid copy numbers, was performed to increase production of HIVp 24. Production was increased, but surface display of HIVp 24 decreased. Surface display was analysed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The surface structure of the various recombinant strains was closer investigated through scanning electron microscopy, which showed that strains producing HIVp 24 fused to an anchor sequence, and in particular the strain expressing HIVp 24 with the LPxTG-type anchor, had a disrupted, blistery surface. Finally, the recombinant strains were tested in a mouse model. ELISPOT analysis indicated development of tolerance, but final conclusion cannot be made before additional experiments have been done. Our data show that L. plantarum WCFS 1 is able to express and anchor the HIVp 24 fusion protein to the surface using homologous signal peptides and anchors, which is an important achievement in its own right. So far, immune responses in mice have not been detected for any of the recombinant strains, but further analyses are in progress.

40|$|Dr Gillian Craig (1) {{has argued}} that palliative {{medicine}} services have tended to adopt a policy of sedation without hydration, which under certain circumstances may be medically inappropriate, causative of death and distressing to family and friends. We welcome this opportunity to defend, with an important modification, the approach we proposed without substantive background argument in our original article (2). We maintain that slowing and eventual cessation of oral intake is {{a normal part of}} a natural dying process, that artificial hydration and alimentation (AHA) are not justified unless thirst or hunger are present and cannot be relieved by other means, but food and fluids <b>for</b> (natural) <b>oral</b> <b>consumption</b> should never be 'withdrawn'.

30|$|Currently, KCl syrup is {{the only}} option {{available}} in India for paediatric and geriatric patients. The taste of this formulation is considered unacceptable clinically. While developing liquid oral formulations, taste masking of a drug {{is of paramount importance}} to enhance acceptance and compliance to the therapy by the patient (Faisal et al., 2018; Kaushik & Dureja, 2014). Depending on the extent of unacceptable taste, various approaches like addition of sweeteners, flavoring agents and viscosity builders (Thoke et al., 2012), complexation with cyclodextrins (Mahesh et al., 2010; Dinge & Nagarsenker, 2008; Prabhakaran et al., 2016), granulation (Pawar & Joshi, 2014), spray drying (Amelian et al., 2017 a), ion exchange resins (Kouchak et al., 2018), hot melt extrusion (Pimparade et al., 2015) or conversion to a prodrug (Karaman, 2013) are employed for the taste-masking. Microencapsulation {{is one of the leading}} techniques for the taste-masking of a variety of drugs. Microencapsulation creates a physical barrier between the drug and the taste receptors in the form of a polymeric film thus leading to efficient taste masking. Although there are several ways to achieve microencapsulation, fluid bed processing is one of the most efficient, fast and economic techniques to achieve microcapsules with high yield, uniform coating and better entrapment efficiency leading to improved taste masking (Stange et al., 2014; Keser et al., 2018; Ghimire et al., 2018). In the present study, we sought to develop dry syrup formulation containing microencapsulated KCl which would not only mask the taste but also offer the advantages such as convenience of handling, lesser weight per container and overall better stability. We explored the potential of Eudragit E 100 to coat and mask the taste of highly crystalline inorganic salts such as KCl which is hitherto not reported. We used commercially viable technique such as fluid bed coating to achieve Eudragit E 100 coating. Eudragit E 100 is a cationic amino alkyl methacrylate copolymer which solubilizes below pH[*] 5.5 but remains insoluble at pH greater than 5.5. These solubility characteristics make it ideal for taste masking applications wherein the polymer would not dissolve in saliva (pH- 6.8 to 7.4) thus maintaining the physical barrier between the drug and the taste buds. Upon entering the stomach, it would dissolve in gastric fluids thus releasing the drug. It is safe <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>consumption</b> and approved by the regulatory authorities (Rowe et al., 2009; Maniruzzaman et al., 2012). A number of reported studies have used this polymer for taste masking of various drugs by employing techniques like hot melt extrusion (Keating et al., 2017), spray-drying (Khan et al., 2007), spray congealing (Shah et al., 2008), granulation (Albertini et al., 2004), solvent evaporation (Douroumis et al., 2011) and fluid bed coating (Amelian et al., 2017 b).|$|R
