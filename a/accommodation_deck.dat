40|$|For {{the past}} years {{statistics}} have shown {{an increase in the}} number of people that go to the Balearic Islands to spend a month’s holiday. During that period they do not set themselves a budget, as they rather enjoy as much as possible without any financial reservations. After considering thoroughly the type of vessel to be designed, the decision fell upon a Sport Cruiser for the Balearics. The designer has spent most of his summer holidays in Menorca and, therefore, he feels he has a good knowledge of this archipelago, its islands and the boats that operate during the above period. The intention is to design a vessel that will fulfil all of the requirements this type of customer would want to have onboard. The aim of this design is to create a boat that will allow the owner to move from one island to another in the same day. The vessel is not designed to live in, but will allow the owners to spend a weekend or even longer periods onboard, if desired. The vessel should achieve 45 knots to cross to an island in the morning and return at night. A sport cruiser is a type of pleasure craft that must compromise between a very good performance in terms of high speed and good handling, and largesse of comfort in the accommodation area or exterior. The preliminary proposal will cover all the main subjects of the design spiral -hull form, weight estimation, propulsion, <b>accommodation,</b> <b>deck</b> lay-out, etc- each of these with their respective requirements. ...|$|E
50|$|The St. Sunniva {{was a great}} {{commercial}} success as a cruise ship. However, in 1907-1908, the North Company {{reduced the number of}} the ship's cruises, and entirely withdrew from the market at the end of August 1908. It was subsequently decided to convert the ship into a ferry and to that end the lower <b>deck</b> <b>accommodation</b> was removed and cargo holds created. The main <b>deck</b> <b>accommodation</b> was also completely remodelled and the superstructure was extended.|$|R
5000|$|To {{allow more}} <b>accommodation</b> below <b>decks</b> {{for the extra}} {{personnel}} required for her design use as a task force flagship, South Dakota was constructed with eight twin 5"/38 gun mounts instead of the ten mounts carried by her sister ships. To compensate for the reduction in 5" [...] fire power, she received additional light anti-aircraft guns.|$|R

40|$|Ship {{structural}} design is done today resorting to powerful numerical tools. Ship structures {{come out to}} be optimal regarding load and failure mechanisms; {{in spite of this}} they come to lose that residual capability which in past gave a valuable benefit to overcome certain undesirable side effects. Such effects are not acceptable when ship’s structures are prone to develop high levels of vibrations excited by propulsion plant or other sources. In this frame, the paper investigates a river ship case, where preliminary calculations of structural dynamic response to vibrations induced by on board sources gain a relevant role in defining the minimum thickness of plates and supporting structures’ topology. River ship hulls have indeed light structures due to low demanding environments, which lead to an increase of vibration effects on <b>accommodation</b> <b>decks.</b> The approach here discussed is based on direct calculations of the hull’s structures dynamic response, performed in the frequency range where first harmonic frequencies of main excitation sources play a relevant role in inducing local and global vibration effects. The critical aspect of interaction between structure and fluid will be dealt with by an implicit modeling of the surrounding water around the hull. The aim of the study is to give the reader basic tools to implement, in the ship’s hull preliminary design stage, free and forced vibration analyses in order to support decision making about the hull scantling when vibration effects are not negligible...|$|R
50|$|Of drive-through design, Isle of Arran has an {{open plan}} car deck with space for 76 cars in five lanes. She is {{fitted with a}} bow visor and bow and stern ramps. The open stern allows her to carry tankers and other large {{vehicles}} {{at the same time}} as passengers. There is insufficient height for lorries and coaches down either side of the car deck due to a gallery deck. From the car deck one must go outside to access the passenger <b>accommodation.</b> On <b>Deck</b> 3 there is a sheltered seating area, access to car deck and passenger lounges and a luggage area. There was originally a TV lounge with a children's room, but these were taken away in 2009 to boost crew accommodation.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship has}} eleven <b>decks,</b> with {{passenger}} <b>accommodation</b> located on <b>decks</b> 2 to 3 and 6 to 8.

25|$|In 2013, two new shell {{doors on}} deck 3, and two new <b>accommodation</b> ladders on <b>deck</b> 5 were {{designed}} and installed by Taranaki engineering firms ITL and EHL. Marine Industrial Design and Babcock NZ made the necessary structural changes. The RHIB {{was able to}} be relocated {{as a result of the}} innovative design of the new accommodation ladders which can stow compactly inside the ship (5x2.5x2.5m), rather than being externally stored alongside the ship as before. Improved design of the ladders and the relocation of the RHIB has increased the safety and capability of the ship is no longer compromised.|$|R
50|$|In May 1961 Patagonia Star {{was sold}} to Gregory Maritime Ltd, London and renamed Eirini. With the {{introduction}} of IMO Numbers, she was allocated number 5099032. Eirini served with Gregory's for nine years. She was sold in 1970 to Angila Shipping Co Ltd, Cyprus and renamed Byzantium. On 29 September 1970, she put into Gibraltar with damaged machinery and was laid up. On 6 February 1971, she caught fire. The <b>accommodation</b> and bridge <b>deck</b> were gutted.
