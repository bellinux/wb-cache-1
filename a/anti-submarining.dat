40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study and a case report was to {{demonstrate}} seat belt webbing induced injury due to seatbelt submarining during the frontal motor vehicle crash. Submarining is an undesired phenomenon during a frontal crash scenario and is dependent on design features of the seat pan and seatbelt system. The lack of adequate <b>anti-submarining</b> features at any seating position with three-point restraint can cause abdominal solid and hollow organ injuries. This paper reports a case of submarining and factors that exacerbated this phenomenon leading to critical occupant abdominal injury. This case report and the following injury causation analysis demonstrate the shortcomings of a cantilever seat pan design in context to the occupant safety. The inadequate seat pan <b>anti-submarining</b> feature in association with lack of seatbelt load-limiter and Pretensioner reduces the level of occupant protection offered by the seat belt system in the rear seat. This case report shows the dangers of cantilever seat pan design and its association with increased risk of submarining causing severe abdominal injuries...|$|E

50|$|The Royal Navy's {{primary mission}} during the Cold War, {{excluding}} its nuclear deterrent role, involved <b>anti-submarine</b> warfare (ASW). The {{development of the}} Invincible-class <b>anti-submarine</b> carriers stemmed from this doctrine: their primary mission involved <b>anti-submarine</b> warfare using Sea King helicopters. The Type 23 frigate originated as a pure ASW platform; its mission expanded following the Falklands War of 1982.|$|R
