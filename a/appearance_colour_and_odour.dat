It can damage the nervous system, gastrointestinal track, encephalopathy with pretreatment damage, kidneys and reproductive system particularly in children (Viraraghavan and Rao 1991; Mohan and Singth 2002; Adeogun et al. 2010). Manganese polluted water is annoying in all respects, since the <b>appearance,</b> <b>colour,</b> taste <b>and</b> <b>odour</b> are affected. At low concentration, it stains everything and it comes in contact with including fabrics. The recommended limit in drinking water is 0.05  mg L− 1 and between 0.01 and 0.02  mg L− 1 in water meant for industrial purposes. It has been implicated for neurological disorder when inhaled {{at a rate of about}} 10  mg day− 1 (Adeogun et al. 2011). These justify the need for the removal of Pb(II) and Mn(II) ions from wastewater.|$|R

Therefore the evaluation results may be closely reflecting the opinions of common consumers. The samples of kefir were subjected to sensory evaluation by the ranking test and the pleasantness of chosen properties (<b>appearance,</b> <b>colour,</b> texture, <b>odour</b> <b>and</b> taste) was evaluated using a seven-point scale, as well as the overal acceptability of samples.

In both species, samples stored in headless condition in ice had longer shelf life than that of stored in head-on condition. Physical changes were evaluated by determining expressible moisture and breaking strength of sample of muscles. The expressible moisture increased continuously in both samples with the lapse of storage period. The expressible moisture increased up to around 44 % in 4 - 5 days of ice stored M. rosenbergii muscle while it was around 40 % in 8 - 9 days ice stored P. monodon. At the end of 9 days of ice storage, the expressible moisture content in M. rosenbergii increased up to 60 %, while {{it was up to}} 47 % in P. monodon after 11 days of ice storage. The breaking strength declined from 0. 78 kg/cm² to 0. 53 kg/cm² in tiger shrimp after 8 days of ice storage, while in case of immediately killed prawn, the breaking strength of muscle was 0. 8 kg/cm² which declined to 0. 43 to 0. 35 kg/cm²...|$|R

40|$|The hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, uses both <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> <b>odour</b> to find flowers when {{foraging}} for nectar. In {{the present}} study we investigated how vision and olfaction interact during learning. Manduca sexta were equally attracted to a scented blue coloured feeding target (multimodal stimulus) as to {{one that does not}} carry any scent (unimodal stimulus; visual) or to an invisible scented target (unimodal stimulus; odour). This naive attraction to multimodal as well as to unimodal stimuli could be manipulated through training. Moths trained to feed from a blue, scented multimodal feeding target will, when tested in a set-up containing all three feeding targets, select the multimodal target as well as the scented, unimodal target, but ignore the visual target. Interestingly, moths trained to feed from a blue, unimodal visual feeding target will select the visual target as well as the scented, multimodal target, but ignore the unimodal odour target. Our results indicate that a multimodal target is perceived as two separate modalities, <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> <b>odour,</b> rather than as a unique fused target. These findings differ from earlier studies of desert ants that perceive combined visual <b>and</b> <b>odour</b> signals as a unique fused stimulus following learning trials...|$|R

Catfish waste became by-product from fish processing industry and utilization of these by-products to produce valuable collagen can give benefit to the entire world.

40|$|Abstract: Herby {{cheese is}} a salted {{traditional}} cheese manufactured from sheep’s and cow’s milk in the Eastern and South-eastern of Turkey. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the influence of different salt concentrations (4, 5 and 6 %) on the ripening characteristics of Herby cheese. Pasteurized whole cow's milk (3. 7 % fat) was used for Herby cheese manufacture. The cheese samples were ripened under soil at 7 ± 1 C o for 90 days. The samples were characterized in terms of microbiological, chemical and sensory properties. The ripening time had a significant (P< 0. 05) effect on all parameters except for protein, fat, total aerobic bacteria (TAB), <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>colour,</b> body <b>and</b> texture, and flavour. In addition, salt concentration had a significant influence on dry matter, salt, titratable acidity, micrococci and staphylococci, proteolytic bacteria, yeasts <b>and</b> moulds, <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>colour,</b> <b>and</b> saltiness. As a result, we concluded that increasing the salt concentration in cheese samples contributed to reducing the number of microorganisms and increased the acceptability in terms of <b>appearance</b> <b>and</b> <b>colour,</b> <b>and</b> body and texture from sensory properties...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{evidence that}} pollen <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> <b>odour</b> {{may be used}} as cues in resource-location by pollen feeding insects; namely, the pollen beetle, Meligethes aeneus, a pest of cruciferous crops such as oilseed rape, Brassica napus (OSR), and the honey bee, Apis mellifera, an economically important generalist pollinator. Pollen beetle adults were attracted to both the <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> <b>odour</b> of OSR flowers in a wind tunnel, and linear track olfactometer studies showed that part of the attractive floral odour emanated from pollen. Beetles were attracted to OSR floral odour throughout their life cycle, indicating that 'innate' search images may be important in location of hosts upon which they can reproduce. Responses to floral odours from plants upon which the beetles do not reproduce varied according to the beetle's sex, life cycle phase and feeding history. There was some evidence for the use of pollen cues in oviposition, when oviposition incidence in male-fertile buds containing pollen and male-sterile buds without pollen were compared in the field. In feeding studies conducted in the laboratory, larvae displayed obligatory requirements for the resources from OSR flowers; they were unable to develop in field bean, Vida faba (FB) flowers. Although pollen consumption was not obligatory for larval survival and development, it reduced developmental time, and improved survival and 'fitness'. Restrained honey bees were able to learn the <b>odours</b> of OSR <b>and</b> FB pollens associatively, and could discriminate between them in the conditioned proboscis extension bioassay. This ability was confirmed in more natural conditions; free-flying bees discriminated between OSR and FB pollens {{on the basis of their}} odour, but showed a colour preference for the yellow OSR pollen over the grey pollen of FB. The relative importance of pollen as an attractive signal in OSR and FB is discussed...|$|R
30|$|Vegetable {{oils and}} fats are {{important}} constituents of human foodstuffs. Approximately 70 % of all oils produced {{in the world are}} of vegetable origin. In modern society, the consumers do not like to use crude oils directly without proper processing due to unpleasant <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> <b>odour.</b> Generally, vegetable oils contain minor components, which affect the end-product quality by alteration of its taste, <b>colour</b> <b>and</b> process efficiency. Water, free fatty acids (FFA), pigments, phosphatides, partial glycerides, oxidation products, and some trace elements such as iron, copper, sulphur and halogens are undesirable substances of oil. These impurities can be removed at various steps in the conventional chemical refining, which includes degumming, neutralization, washing, drying, bleaching, filtration and deodorization. Therefore, efficient industrial processing involves removing these impurities with the least possible effect on the desired components and the least possible loss of neutral oil [1, 2, 3, 4].|$|R

The use of different sensory modalities by lemurs is marginally predicted in one case by fruit traits—fruits with higher overall smell signals are sniffed less than fruits with lower overall smell signals. When controlling for all fruit traits, fruit size is the only signif-icant predictor of fruit foraging efficiency—lemurs forage more rapidly on smaller fruits relative to larger fruits...|$|R
