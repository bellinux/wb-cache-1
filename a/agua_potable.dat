5|$|Free basic water. Inspired by the Human Right to Water, two {{important}} cities in Colombia make a basic {{amount of water}} (Minimo Vital de <b>Agua</b> <b>Potable)</b> available to their poorest residents free of charge. In 2009, Medellin made 2.5 cubic meters of water per month and per person - or 10 cubic meters {{for a family of}} four - available for free to all urban residents in class 1. The city wants to reach 45,000 households and has budgeted 25 billion Pesos (USD 14 million) to finance free basic water and associated awareness campaigns. In February 2012 Bogota also introduced 6 cubic meters of free basic water per household for households in classes 1 and 2, covering more than 1.5 million households or 39% of all households. The annual cost is estimated at 60 billion Pesos (USD 33 million).|$|E

25|$|Since 2001, the Proyecto de <b>Agua</b> <b>Potable</b> y Saneamiento para Comunidades Rurales y Pequeños Municipios (PRAGUAS or Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project) {{became the}} government's primary {{instrument}} {{to face the}} sector's challenges, influencing key options about policy (see above), extending coverage and giving incentives to improve quality, efficiency and cost recovery of the service.|$|E
25|$|In December 2001 the Government of Hugo Chávez {{passed a}} new Water and Sanitation Law (Ley Orgánica para la Prestación de los Servicios de <b>Agua</b> <b>Potable</b> y Saneamiento). This law was not passed by Parliament. Instead, {{together}} with 45 other laws {{it was passed}} by the Executive based on an Enabling Act that temporarily gave the President powers to enact laws and bypass Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Water Framework Law (Ley Marco Del Sector <b>Agua</b> <b>Potable</b> Y Saneamiento) and decree No. 118 of 2003 {{constitutes}} a jurisdictional framework {{for planning and}} organizing the management and integrated use of national water resources. A notable strategy of the framework is to reduce poverty through proper {{management of water resources}} and by promoting sustainable development. The framework also decentralized management of water away from SANNA to the municipalities.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility {{for policy}} {{setting in the}} Nicaraguan water and {{sanitation}} sector is vested in the National Council for Drinking Water and Sanitation - Comisión Nacional de <b>Agua</b> <b>Potable</b> y Alcantarillado Sanitario (CONAPAS). CONAPAS includes the Secretariat of the Presidency, whose representative presides the Council, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Environment, the national utility ENACAL, the regulatory agency INAA, the Institute for Territorial Studies (INETER) and the Social Investment Fund FISE.|$|E

Created by Executive Decree 51 in 1998 and later modified by Decrees 33 and 75 in 2002 and 2003 respectively. CONAPAS includes the Secretariat of the Presidency SEPRES, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Environment, the national utility ENACAL, the regulatory agency INAA, the Institute for Territorial Studies (INETER) and the Social Investment Fund FISE.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, the Executive Unit of the Rural Aqueduct Program (Unidad Ejectora del Programa de Acueductos Rurales) (UNEPAR) and the Highlands Drinking Water and Sanitation Project (Proyecto de <b>Agua</b> <b>Potable</b> y Saneamiento del Altiplano) (PAYSA), {{programs}} for rural {{water and sanitation}} that had formerly been under the Ministry of Health, were placed under the management of INFOM. Although UNEPAR is placed under INFOM it continues to have separate financing from the national budget {{as well as the}} German Development Bank KfW. UNEPAR also manages the data base of SAS.|$|E
25|$|Financing and Subsidies Urban {{water and}} {{sanitation}} systems do not receive direct subsidies and are financed through the capital market, and ultimately through user fees. However, Chile has an innovative system of means-tested subsidies that allows qualifying poor households to receive a subsidy administered by the municipalities to pay parts of their {{water and sanitation}} bills. Rural water systems receive a partial investment subsidy that is defined in the Ley del Subsidio al <b>Agua</b> <b>Potable</b> y Saneamiento. By law, the subsidy can cover 25-85 percent of a household's water and sewer bill up to 15m³ per month. The client pays {{the rest of the}} bill. Beyond 15m³, households are charged full price. The subsidy is meant to target only those households that are unable to buy water at a subsistence level and is based on willingness to pay. In 1998, about 13% of households benefited at a level of ~$10 per month. The total cost of the program in 1998 was US $36million. Opponents argue this subsidy program can act as a regressive policy and actually hurt the poor because a false assumption is made that high consumption is positively correlated to high income. On the contrary, poor families {{do not have access to}} efficient methods of using water in cooking, cleaning, and washing.|$|E
500|$|Responsibility for {{regulating}} water {{services is}} vested {{in two separate}} institutions at the national level. [...] The Comisión de Regulación de <b>Agua</b> <b>Potable</b> y Saneamiento Básico (CRA) or Potable Water and Basic Sanitation Regulatory Commission defines criteria for efficient service provision and sets the rules for tariff revision, but is not in charge of controlling the application of these rules. [...] The latter {{is the responsibility of}} the Superintendencia de Servicios Públicos Domiciliarios (SSPD) or Superintendency for Residential Public Services, a multi-sector regulatory agency.|$|E
