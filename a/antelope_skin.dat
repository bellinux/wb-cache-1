60|$|Purun Dass {{swept the}} stone floor clean, smiled at the {{grinning}} statue, made himself a little mud fireplace {{at the back of}} the shrine, spread his <b>antelope</b> <b>skin</b> on a bed of fresh pine-needles, tucked his bairagi--his brass-handled crutch--under his armpit, and sat down to rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come kiss me, Licinia," [...] {{she said}} slowly after a while. [...] "I'll to rest now. To-morrow I shall see my kinsman the Cæsar again, after a year's absence from him. I {{desire to be}} very {{beautiful}} to-morrow, Licinia, for mayhap I'll to the games with him. That new tunic worked with purple and gold. I'll wear that and my new shoes of <b>antelope</b> <b>skin.</b> In my hair the circlet of turquoise and pearls ... dost think it'll become me, Licinia?" ...|$|E
6000|$|So thinking, his {{untrimmed}} {{hair fell}} down about his shoulders, the stone slab {{at the side}} of the <b>antelope</b> <b>skin</b> was dented into a little hole by the foot of his brass-handled crutch, and the place between the tree-trunks, where the begging-bowl rested day after day, sunk and wore into a hollow almost as smooth as the brown shell itself; and each beast knew his exact place at the fire. The fields changed their colours with the seasons; the threshing-floors filled and emptied, and filled again and again; and again and again, when winter came, the langurs frisked among the branches feathered with light snow, till the mother-monkeys brought their sad-eyed little babies up from the warmer valleys with the spring. There were few changes in the village. The priest was older, and many of the little children who used to come with the begging-dish sent their own children now; and when you asked of the villagers how long their holy man had lived in Kali's Shrine at the head of the pass, they answered, [...] "Always." ...|$|E
50|$|The patrol team hunts down {{a family}} of poachers and learns from them the {{whereabouts}} of their gunman and leader. But the long journey means {{they can no longer}} afford to follow on with the entire team and captured poachers. They release the poachers and send one of the cars, driven by Liu Dong (played by Qi Liang), back with the injured and sick team members to the hospital. He did not have sufficient funds for the medical fee and Ritai tells him to sell some <b>antelope</b> <b>skins</b> to raise the money. Ga questioned the sales of <b>antelope</b> <b>skins</b> and learns from Ritai that they have received no funds from the government for at least a year.|$|R
50|$|Throughout history, the Tuareg were renowned and {{respected}} warriors. Their decline {{as a military}} might came {{with the introduction of}} firearms, weapons which the Tuareg did not possess. The Tuareg warrior equipment consisted of a takoba (sword), allagh (lance) and aghar (shield) made of <b>antelope's</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|R
5|$|The folios {{are made}} of vellum {{parchment}} primarily from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. (Tischendorf himself thought that the parchment had been made from <b>antelope</b> <b>skins,</b> but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.) Most of the quires or signatures contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the folios of this codex. As {{for the cost of}} the material, time of scribes and binding, it equals the lifetime wages of one individual at the time.|$|R
60|$|At night his <b>antelope</b> <b>skin</b> {{was spread}} where the {{darkness}} overtook him--sometimes in a Sunnyasi monastery by the roadside; sometimes by a mud-pillar shrine of Kala Pir, where the Jogis, who are another misty division of holy men, would receive {{him as they}} do those who know what castes and divisions are worth; sometimes {{on the outskirts of}} a little Hindu village, where the children would steal up with the food their parents had prepared; and sometimes on the pitch of the bare grazing-grounds, where the flame of his stick fire waked the drowsy camels. It was all one to Purun Dass--or Purun Bhagat, as he called himself now. Earth, people, and food were all one. But unconsciously his feet drew him away northward and eastward; from the south to Rohtak; from Rohtak to Kurnool; from Kurnool to ruined Samanah, and then up-stream along the dried bed of the Gugger river that fills only when the rain falls in the hills, till one day he saw the far line of the great Himalayas.|$|E
60|$|Even in {{populated}} India a man cannot a day {{sit still}} before {{the wild things}} run over him {{as though he were}} a rock; and in that wilderness very soon the wild things, who knew Kali's Shrine well, came back to look at the intruder. The langurs, the big gray-whiskered monkeys of the Himalayas, were, naturally, the first, for they are alive with curiosity; and when they had upset the begging-bowl, and rolled it round the floor, and tried their teeth on the brass-handled crutch, and made faces at the <b>antelope</b> <b>skin,</b> they decided that the human being who sat so still was harmless. At evening, they would leap down from the pines, and beg with their hands for things to eat, and then swing off in graceful curves. They liked the warmth of the fire, too, and huddled round it till Purun Bhagat had to push them aside to throw on more fuel; and in the morning, as often as not, he would find a furry ape sharing his blanket. All day long, one or other of the tribe would sit by his side, staring out at the snows, crooning and looking unspeakably wise and sorrowful.|$|E
60|$|Behind him, as {{he walked}} through the city gates, an <b>antelope</b> <b>skin</b> and brass-handled crutch under his arm, and a begging-bowl of {{polished}} brown coco-de-mer in his hand, barefoot, alone, with eyes cast on the ground--behind him they were firing salutes from the bastions in honour of his happy successor. Purun Dass nodded. All that life was ended; and he bore it no more ill-will or good-will than a man bears to a colourless dream of the night. He was a Sunnyasi--a houseless, wandering mendicant, depending on his neighbours for his daily bread; and so long as there is a morsel to divide in India, neither priest nor beggar starves. He had never in his life tasted meat, and very seldom eaten even fish. A five-pound note would have covered his personal expenses for food through any one of the many years in which he had been absolute master of millions of money. Even when he was being lionised in London he had held before him his dream of peace and quiet--the long, white, dusty Indian road, printed all over with bare feet, the incessant, slow-moving traffic, and the sharp-smelling wood smoke curling up under the fig-trees in the twilight, where the wayfarers sit at their evening meal.|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} skins to {{manufacture}} puppets - antelope, spotted deer and goat. <b>Antelope</b> <b>skins</b> {{are reserved for}} making {{a limited number of}} auspicious characters such as the gods and epic heroes. Deer skin, noted for its strength and resistance to rough handling, is employed in the figures of warrior, Bhima; the ten-headed demon king, Ravana. All other puppets are made from goat skin, readily available locally. Most puppets are made from a single skin, though some require more. At least four skins are necessary for Ravana -one for his body, one for his legs, and one to make each set of five arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Crow {{country is}} {{exactly in the}} right place. It has snowy {{mountains}} and sunny plains; all kinds of climates and good things for every season. When the summer heats scorch the prairies, you can draw up under the mountains, where the air is sweet and cool, the grass fresh, and the bright streams come tumbling out of the snow-banks. There you can hunt the elk, the deer, and the <b>antelope,</b> when their <b>skins</b> are fit for dressing; there you will find plenty of white bears and mountain sheep.|$|R
5000|$|The kaganu is the {{smallest}} and highest pitched drum used by the Ewe, but its sound does incorporate some bass as well. It is around 20 inches tall. Like all Ewe drums, the kaganu has a drumhead made of <b>antelope</b> or deer <b>skin.</b> The body of the drum is made of wood and is often decorated with carvings. The kaganu is played with two long skinny wooden sticks, usually with the drummer sitting down. Like the gankokui and axatse, its pattern does not change {{for the duration of}} the piece. In Agahu, for example, the rhythm it plays are two notes on the upbeats. Because Agahu is played was in the 4/4 time, then the kaganu would play two notes on the [...] "ands" [...] of beats 1, 2, 3, and 4. The kaganu also gives energy and drive to the music.|$|R

50|$|Drums play an {{important}} role in Garifuna music. The main drum is the Segunda (bass drum). The drums are normally made by hollowing out logs and stretching <b>antelope</b> <b>skin</b> over them.|$|E
50|$|Traditional koras feature 21 strings, eleven {{played by}} the left hand and ten by the right. Modern koras made in the Casamance region of {{southern}} Senegal sometimes feature additional bass strings, adding up to four strings to the traditional 21. Strings were traditionally made from thin strips of hide, for example <b>antelope</b> <b>skin</b> - now most strings are made from harp strings or nylon fishing line, sometimes plaited together to create thicker strings.|$|E
50|$|The Udu is {{the most}} common and popular drum. This {{instrument}} is also known as Nkwa, Egwe, or Egede, depending {{on the part of the}} country.These drums are not talking drums. Although they produce a sound which is tonal, syncopated, and generally melodious - they have never been known as talking drums and are not spiritual in nature or usage. Igbo people speak. The body of the drum is usually constructed from a hollowed out pear or cotton tree which is very durable yet malleable. The drum is then covered with <b>antelope</b> or cow <b>skin.</b> The hide is fastened tightly to the top and bottom of the instrument with seven to eight studs, and with rope in a decorative manner. The studs are able to be adjusted for tuning purposes and sound accommodation. If the studs are tightened a high pitch is emitted. The opposite effect is heard if the studs are loosened. Typically, more than one Igba is played by several drummers at a time. The drum can be played by using four fingers from each hand. The right hand is used to beat the head of the drum, and the left hand is used to stop the vibration. If the musician stops the vibration closer to the edge of the drum head,a low pitch will be emitted. If the musician stops the vibration closer to the center, then a higher pitch will be emitted. The Igba can also be played using a curved drum stick, which can be found wrapped in fiber to produce a soft sound,or “naked” to produce hard sound. This drum is very versatile and is usually played during celebrations, festivals, weddings, male and female rites of passage, and sometimes funerals.|$|R
5000|$|... “Even if you {{are just}} passing though, stop off at this old hotel {{and take a look}} around the {{restored}} lobby. Once inside, your every move is watched by the beady glass eyes of elk, buffalo, long-horned sheep, deer, foxes, and porcupines mounted on the walls.”. [...] Within the hotel, guests are greeted with original rustic pine floors and a multitude of fine world-class deer and elk mounts. Most of the Meeker Hotel’s elk have joined the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation's national World Record Elk Tour and many guests make the pilgrimage just to see them. “I found a picture of the Meeker Hotel Lobby taken back in 1906…The large bull elk is a big typical 427 3/8. In the hotel there is another great elk that had fallen off the wall over the years and has two large bolts through the antlers holding them onto the old mount. Unfortunately this is another great record elk that cannot officially go into record book because of its cracked skull. It is a 9x8 typical with a gross score of B&C 460 netting about 450. Just think about that the little town of Meeker with two world record Elk greater than records of today, dating from the turn of the century. I will be displaying them both in the 1999 World Record Elk Tour.”. Alongside these giants are a collection of different animals from the area slowly collected by a succession of owners. A mountain lion, coyotes, regional foxes, <b>antelope,</b> a bear <b>skin</b> and even porcupines are stuffed and on display. The first owner and current owner have also contributed two moose and a caribou from Alaska. Sitting beside the stairway is an enormous elk that has been observing the lobby since 1904. It is the set of antlers that is now displayed proudly on the hotel’s stationery, bumper stickers and T-shirts. All animals depicted in their merchandise come from their collection.|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} than twenty {{different}} types of masks that function within the men's initiation society. Mwaash aMbooy mu shall {{is one of the}} three most important and represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba believe themselves to be descended. Mwaash aMbooy mu shall masks are worn by the nyimi, or king, of the Kuba or by chiefs in villages. The nyimi's mask is usually made of leopard skin, while those of chiefs are made of <b>antelope</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two other {{individuals}} performed important tasks. The zum loa was an orator who {{gave a speech}} {{at the end of the}} rite detailing the sponsor's sins that had required the rite to the held. His regalia included an <b>antelope</b> <b>skin,</b> iron bracelets, a red hat, and a long spear. The zum loa was renowned for his abilities as a public speaker. His prestige was such that others bowed to him, a courtesy not afforded to even village headmen. The mfek Sso (holder of the Sso sack) was responsible for the actual running of the Sso rite. His name made reference to his sack of traditional medicines that would later be eaten or drunk during the rite.|$|E
5000|$|For {{a life of}} a Hamsa monk, {{states the}} text, he should renounce by remembering the Om, cutting his topknot tuft of hair, cutting the sacred thread he wears, throw all this into the water before him, undress and say, [...] "Om, I have renounced, I have renounced, I have renounced, Om!". Then he must say, [...] "I give safety to all beings! Svaha!". Thereafter, he leaves, heading towards north, remembering [...] "Om, I am Brahman, Om Tat tvam asi". This method is repeated, for a {{different}} context, in chapter 4 of the text. The renouncer then wears an old garment, or bark and <b>antelope</b> <b>skin</b> and proceeds on the journey of renunciation.|$|E
50|$|The ennanga, nanga, nnanga or enanga {{is a type}} of arched harp {{played by}} the Ganda people of Uganda. The sound box is made of a single piece of wood and roughly hemispherical. The top of the box is a {{stretched}} resonant membrane made of <b>antelope</b> <b>skin,</b> tied to a piece of hide {{at the bottom of the}} box. The neck is attached to the inside of the box, exits through a small round opening on the membrane, and curves upward for about 60 to 70 cm. Seven or eight strings are attached to a piece of wood inside the box, and extend through the skin to tuning pegs inserted along the neck. Sometimes small metallic rattling pieces are attached to the pegs, to color the sound. It is usually used to accompany men's singing.|$|E

50|$|The most {{noteworthy}} find at Uan Muhuggiag is the well-preserved mummy of a {{young boy}} of approximately 2 1/2 years old. The child was in a fetal position, then embalmed, then placed in a sack made of <b>antelope</b> <b>skin,</b> which was insulated by a layer of leaves. The boy's organs were removed, as evidenced by incisions in his stomach and thorax, and an organic preservative was inserted to stop his body from decomposing. An ostrich eggshell necklace was also found around his neck. Radiocarbon dating determined the age of the mummy to be approximately 5600 years old, which makes it about 1000 years older than the earliest previously recorded mummy in ancient Egypt. In 1958-1959, an archaeological expedition led by Antonio Ascenzi conducted anthropological, radiological, histological and chemical analyses on the Uan Muhuggiag mummy. The specimen was determined to be that of a 30-month old child of uncertain sex, who possessed Negroid features. A long incision on the specimen's abdominal wall also indicated that the body had been initially mummified by evisceration and later underwent natural desiccation. One other individual, an adult, was found at Uan Muhuggiag, buried in a crouched position. However, the body showed no evidence of evisceration or any other method of preservation. The body was estimated to date from about 7500 BP.|$|E
50|$|There were a {{total of}} 719 items in this classification. 23 moccasins were {{recovered}} from Hogup Cave, in three categories: Hock moccasins, Fremont moccasins, and Hogup moccasins. The 3 hock moccasins recovered were made from bison hide by removing the hock of an animal through girdling the leg at two points and removing the hide {{in the form of}} a skin tube. The tubes were specially cut so that the natural L-shaped angle of the hide served as the heel of the moccasin. 16 Fremont moccasins were made of either deer or <b>antelope</b> <b>skin.</b> According to Aikens, the Fremont moccasins were first described by Morss, with the single difference between the moccasins recovered from Hogup Cave and Morss' being no seam at the heel joining the two upper pieces. The moccasins found in the cave had two flaps formed by the heel ends of the uppers that could have been folded over one another at the back of the heel and ankle and held in place by securing the ankle with a long string. 4 moccasins were classified as Hogup moccasins due to their distinct pattern. They were made from a single piece of hide that is folded over the foot and sewn together across the toe. A separate outer sole was added to the basic piece and an ankle wrap was sewn around the upper part to give the moccasin a bootlike appearance. Also recovered from the caves were 2 fur robes, both of which were rectangular in shape, one of which still had fur on the hide while the other had about 40% of the fur retained.|$|E
