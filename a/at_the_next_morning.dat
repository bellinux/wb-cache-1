6000|$|On {{my return}} to the village I {{was told that the}} same kind of ground {{extended}} for many miles in every direction, and I at once decided that Wayapo was not a suitable place to stay <b>at.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> early we waded back again through the mud and long wet grass to our boat, and by mid-day reached Cajeli, where I waited Ali's return to decide on my future movements. He came the following day, and gave a very bad account of Pelah, where he had been. There was a little brush and trees along the beach, and hills inland covered with high grass and cajuputi trees--my dread and abhorrence. On inquiring who could give me trustworthy information, I was referred to the Lieutenant of the Burghers, who had travelled all round the island, and was a very intelligent fellow. I asked him to tell me if he knew of any part of Bouru where there was no [...] "kusu-kusu," [...] as the coarse grass of the country is called. He assured me that {{a good deal of the}} south coast was forest land, while along the north was almost entirely swamp and grassy hills. After minute inquiries, I found that the forest country commenced at a place called Waypoti, only a few miles beyond Pelah, but that, as the coast beyond that place was exposed to the east monsoon and dangerous for praus, it was necessary to walk. I immediately went to the Opzeiner, and he called the Rajah. We had a consultation, and arranged for a boat to take me the next evening but one, to Pelah, whence I was to proceed on foot, the Orang-kaya going the day before to call the Alfuros to carry my baggage.|$|E

Garwood claims he was ambushed when he got lost when driving alone in a jeep to pick up an officer. He says his jeep was torched and he was stripped naked. Marine Corps records show on 28 September 1965, Garwood was absent at the 2300 bed check. No unauthorized absence (UA) was reported, since he was thought to have had a [...] "late run." [...] He was reported UA when he failed to appear at formation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The next morning, {{they are}} woken up by a loud bell, and {{are made to}} wash using an outside hose pipe. They are then taken to a glue factory, where they learn the hard way how glue is made. That afternoon, Maxxie, after being {{reminded}} of his conflict with Anwar by Tony, has a furious argument with him, calling Anwar a hypocrite for ignoring the rules of his religion when it suits him (his {{drug and alcohol abuse}} and lack of respect for women), but refusing to ignore his faith for his best friend. In a rage, Maxxie begins to pound walls and kick doors. He accidentally kicks one door open and is confronted by Chris and Angie having sex, causing him to hastily pull it shut in shock. Attracted by the noise, the owner of the hostel, Mrs Rynkowski, yells at him to stop, but softens when she notices how upset he is. She warms up to him greatly when she sees his Neil Diamond t-shirt, and invites him to her private quarters to share some vodka and listen to some Neil Diamond records. Meanwhile, Anwar sees the Russian girl again, but this time, so does Sid. They see that she is being hit by an older man they assume to be her father, and decide to rescue her. Jal and Michelle, bored, decide to go out to meet Russian men, and the four meet awkwardly in the hall. Michelle and Jal go to a small and gritty tavern, where they are immediately chatted up by some Russian policemen. Meanwhile, Sid and Anwar reach the house and manage to smuggle the Russian girl, whose name is Anka, back to the hostel. Sid, who did not leave in time, tries to distract the [...] "father," [...] only to give himself away, forcing him to flee through a nearby forest, pursued by the crazed man with a shotgun. At the hostel, Anwar discovers that Anka can speak English quite fluently, clearly having learned it from watching the American show Friends ("I learn from, like, the best American show ever! How you doin'?"), although the name of the show is never explicitly mentioned. She then persuades him to have sex with her. Tony, hearing them from his room, comes in and sees them, before running off and telling everyone else. At that moment, Sid arrives back, followed by Anka's shotgun-bearing 'father,' whom she reveals is actually her husband. Realising at once that they have been having sex, the husband draws his shotgun on Anwar, but it is grabbed from him by Maxxie, who has heard the commotion from the hostel owner's quarters. After he draws a pistol, the two find themselves in a standoff, which is soon fixed when the gang of policemen Jal and Michelle met at the tavern arrive and arrest him. Jal and Michelle return, drunk, and Tom is forced to pay the fee for armed response. Anka, acting as a translator, reveals that they will also have to cut the trip short and leave the next morning for their troubles. Maxxie attempts to make amends with Anwar, who confesses to being a hypocrite, but still cannot accept Maxxie's sexuality. In his room after this, Tony hits on Maxxie again. Maxxie gives in and allows Tony to perform fellatio on him, not noticing that Michelle, who was passed out on Tony's bed, has woken up and is watching the whole thing in horror. When finished, Maxxie notes he has finally found something Tony isn't good <b>at.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> on the plane, Michelle tries to get Tony to confess to having oral sex with Maxxie, but he doesn't. Sid finally begins to get over his constipation, but is informed, to his dismay, that Heathrow security is very tight, and {{it would be better to}} keep the drugs until they get through.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Twenty-two workers {{exposed to}} styrene and acetone in two {{fiberglass}} industries were monitored on Monday and Thursday for 8 hours using passive dosimeters. Urine {{samples were collected}} {{at the end of}} the workshift and before the start of the work on the next morning (Tuesday and Friday). The charcoal disks of the passive dosimeters were analysed by gas-chromatography. Mandelic acid (MA) and phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA) were measured using a HPLC method; values were expressed in mg/g of creatinine. The 8 -h TWA exposure values for styrene and acetone ranged respectively from 22 to 522 mg/m 3 and 40 - 1581 mg/m 3 on Monday; 25 - 423 mg/m 3 and 55 - 579 mg/m 3 on Thursday. Styrene TWA exposure values significantly correlate with the sum of metabolites at the end of workday (r = 0. 70 on Monday and r = 0. 95 on Thursday) and also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> (r = 0. 86 on Tuesday and r = 0. 85 on Friday). A styrene exposure level of 213 mg/m 3 (ACGIH-TLV) was associated with an excretion of metabolites (MA+PGA) higher on Thursday (803 mg/g creat) than on Monday (570 mg/g creat). The same result was found on Friday (459 mg/g creat) compared with Tuesday (305 mg/g creat). Moreover our data show that the simultaneous exposure to acetone does not modify the excretion of MA. In conclusion the TLV of styrene is associated with different values of metabolites at the beginning and {{at the end of the}} work-week...|$|E
