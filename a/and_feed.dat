5|$|A few nemerteans are scavengers, {{and these}} {{generally}} have good distance chemoreception ("smell") {{and are not}} selective about their prey. A few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> on micro-organisms filtered out by the host.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> on the scalp, while body lice live on clothing <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of}} the date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E

5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E

Between October 1997 and August 1998, 236 specimens were captured during six bimonthly 24 hour gillnet surveys. Significantly {{elevated levels of}} movement <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> activity during the day are registered.

5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators.

This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E

40|$|Problematic <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> {{sleeping}} is an unrelenting {{issue for}} many parents. Research has identified that childhood obesity {{may be related}} to both areas. These are two aspects of development very heavily influenced by parents. This study therefore addresses the question “is there a relationship between problematic sleeping <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> in infants?” It further considers whether parenting style is a common link between the two. Nineteen parents of children aged between 18 and 48 months were interviewed about their parenting strategies in general, and more specifically about <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping behaviours of their children. They also completed diaries and questionnaires. The data was analysed to ascertain whether there was a relationship between <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping problems and whether these problems related to a number of parenting measures. Strategies utilised by parents to handle <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping problems were also ascertained. The sample that volunteered for this study did not report sleeping <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> problems so information about these problems was derived from diary measures. <b>Feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping problems were evident on these measures and parents employed numerous different strategies to handle them. There was no difference evident in the strategies adopted by parents of preschoolers with and without sleep <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> problems. There was no evidence that problems in sleeping <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> were correlated <b>and</b> there were no correlations between <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> sleeping problems and any of the other parental measures...|$|R

5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing {{in two to}} six weeks. They are born carnivores, feeding instinctively on small {{invertebrates}} that move in their field of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase their chances for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> upon their own brood mates.|$|E

5|$|Some protein {{complexes}} {{contain a}} large central cavity that is {{isolated from the}} remainder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the proteasome.
