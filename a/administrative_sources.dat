40|$|<b>Administrative</b> data <b>sources</b> are an {{important}} component of population data collection and they have been used in census data production in the Nordic countries since the 1960 s. A large amount of information about the population is already collected in <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources</b> by governments. However, there are some challenges to using <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources</b> to estimate population counts by age, sex, and geographical area as well as population characteristics. The main limitation with the <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources</b> is that they only collect information from a subset of the population about specific events, and this may result in either undercoverage or overcoverage of the population. Another issue with the <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources</b> is that the information may not have the same quality for all population groups. This research aims to correct an inaccurate <b>administrative</b> data <b>source</b> by combining aggregate-level administrative data with more accurate marginal distributions or two-way marginal information from an auxiliary data source and produce accurate population estimates {{in the absence of a}} traditional census. The methodology developed is applied to estimate population counts by age, sex, and local authority area in England and Wales. The <b>administrative</b> data <b>source</b> used is the Patient Register which suffers from overcoverage, particularly for people between the ages of 20 and 50...|$|R

50|$|Modern historians {{make use}} of the large amount of <b>administrative</b> <b>sources</b> {{available}} now, however things were very different in the past. Pre-modern writers too many times give numbers without naming sources, and there are few cases in which we can be sure they are actually using any administrative source. That is especially true when they speak about enemy armies, in which the access to <b>administrative</b> <b>sources</b> was in any case problematic. Besides that, {{there are a number of}} additional problems concerning pre-modern historians; they could be very biased in their reports, as inflating the number of enemies has been one of the favourite propagandistic resources of all times. Even when presenting a balanced account, many historians did not possess military experience, thus they lacked the technical judgement to properly assess and critique their sources. On the other hand, they had access to first hand accounts that could be very interesting, although in the subject of numbers were rarely accurate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Statistical {{time series}} derived from {{administrative}} data sets form key indicators in measuring progress in addressing disadvantage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in Australia. However, inconsistencies in {{the reporting of}} Indigenous status can cause difficulties in producing reliable indicators. External data sources, such as survey data, provide a means of assessing the consistency of administrative data and {{may be used to}} adjust statistics based on <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources.</b> Methods We used record linkage between a large-scale survey (the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey), and two <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources</b> (the Western Australia (WA) Register of Births and the WA Midwives’ Notification System) to compare the degree of consistency in determining Indigenous status of children between the two sources. We then used a logistic regression model predicting probability of consistency between the two sources to estimate the probability of each record on the two <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources</b> being identified as being of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander origin in a survey. By summing these probabilities we produced model-adjusted time series of neonatal outcomes for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander births. Results Compared to survey data, information based only on the two <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources</b> identified substantially fewer Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander births. However, these births were not randomly distributed. Births of children identified as being of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander origin in the survey only {{were more likely to be}} living in urban areas, in less disadvantaged areas, and to have only one parent who identifies as being of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander origin, particularly the father. They were also more likely to have better health and wellbeing outcomes. Applying an adjustment model based on the linked survey data increased the estimated number of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander births in WA by around 25 %, however this increase was accompanied by lower overall proportions of low birth weight and low gestational age babies. Conclusions Record linkage of survey data to administrative data sets is useful to validate the quality of recording of demographic information in <b>administrative</b> data <b>sources,</b> and such information can be used to adjust for differential identification in administrative data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Governments require {{information}} about population counts and characteristics {{in order to}} make plans, develop policies and provide public services. The main source of this information is the traditional population censuses. However, they are costly, and the information collected by the decennial censuses goes out-of-date easily. For this reason, this thesis has two main aims: to develop methodologies to combine administrative data sources to estimate population counts in the absence of both a traditional census, and to produce uncertainty estimates for the estimated population counts. Although, the methodologies are illustrated using administrative data sources from England and Wales, they can easily be applied to other countries' administrative data sources. The most comprehensive <b>administrative</b> <b>sources</b> in England and Wales are the NHS Patient Register and the Customer Information System. However, it is known that both of these sources exceed the census estimates. Therefore, it is crucial to use another source to adjust the bias to estimate population counts using these <b>administrative</b> <b>sources.</b> Three substantial chapters assessing methodologies to combine <b>administrative</b> <b>sources</b> with the auxiliary information are presented. The first of these chapters presents a basis methodology, log-linear models with offsets, which is extended in the following chapters. The second chapter extends these models by using individually linked <b>administrative</b> <b>sources.</b> The third chapter improves on the basis models to produce measures of uncertainty. This thesis evaluates different log-linear models in terms of their capacity for producing accurate population counts for age group, sex and local authority groups both within the classical and the Bayesian framework. On the other hand, it also presents a detailed perspective to understand which population groups tend to be missed by the administrative data in England and Wales, and how much they can be improved just by combining them with the specific association structures obtained from auxiliary data sources. <br/...|$|E

In this work, we present some preliminary results on using multivariate methods, Mahalanobis distance in particular, for this purpose in business surveys. Our emphasis is on the examination and utilization of the internal relationships and structures of the tax data themselves for identifying records that have large differences between the two sources and that should be treated in producing business statistics. Our results demonstrate the utility of multivariate methods in at least three key areas: direct replacement of survey response by tax data, modelling of survey response by tax data, and identification of misclassified tax records...|$|E

This paper presents a model for coordinating external communication among bots located within the same switched network.
