The heroic resistance of the island was marked by the award of the George Cross medal to the island.|$|E
25|$|Death of a {{child can}} {{take the form of}} a loss in infancy such as {{miscarriage}} or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS, or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it. Intervention and comforting support can make <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.|$|E

The next day, the Red Sox tagged knuckleballer R.A. Dickey for 7 runs to improve to 3-1. However, the Sox lost the third game of the series as two runs given up by Steven Wright in the first inning proved to make <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> as the Red Sox failed to score 6+ runs in a game {{for the first time this}} season.|$|E
25|$|During {{the third}} {{race of the}} 2011 season, Kenseth {{captured}} his fifth pole of his career by setting a new track record at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. A few races later, Kenseth snapped a 76-race winless streak at Texas Motor Speedway by winning the race on April 9, 2011. Kenseth also won the FedEx 400 benefitting Autism Speaks at Dover International Speedway. On a late caution, Kenseth and crew chief Jimmy Fennig called an audible in the pits and decided to go with two tires instead of four. That proved to be <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> as Kenseth won {{for the second time}} in 5 races. Once he made the Chase for the Sprint Cup, he won the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway for his third win of the season. Kenseth's second championship hopes went south after several altercations with Brian Vickers.|$|E
25|$|In United's next match, {{home cooking}} {{seemed to make}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference,</b> as the team won 3–2 on their return to RFK for United's first home match in 5 weeks. Playing at home in front of over 19,000 fans was {{probably}} a boost to the team, but an even bigger boost {{might have been the}} sight of the team's new striker tandem of Espindola and Saborio. The game started horribly for the home side as the Philadelphia Union scored in the first and fourth minute to take what might have seemed a commanding 2–0 lead. United began to claw their way back into the game as Saborio scored on his United debut, with a 37th minute volley of a Korb cross. The game was tied midway through the second half when Nick DeLeon finished a rebound of an Espindola shot. D.C. United finally went ahead on an Espindola header, with Chris Korb getting his second assist of the match. DeLeon's goal was his first in over a year in a regular season match.|$|E

25|$|In {{his prime}} Simpson {{was known for}} his {{technical}} correctness. At slightly below average height, his noted ability to bat for long periods was attributed to his high fitness and concentration levels. He had a wide array of shots, in particular off the back foot. Along with Bill Lawry, he formed an opening partnership that was {{regarded as one of the}} finest in Test history. Simpson was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Simpson's stance was easy and his style attractive, the result of a change of technique in the late 1950s when he turned from playing too square-on to side-on. Simpson found that it made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> to him in dealing effectively with the in-dipper and going-away balls. Standing 179cm and 13stone, Simpson was most effective as an attacking batsman. Simpson was best known for his straight-drive and powerfully hit square-cut, as well as an on-drive taken from his toes. He rarely played the hook shot, regarding it as risky, and used the pull shot in moderation. Early in his career, Simpson had a square-on stance but converted to a more side on position, finding it easier to deal with swing bowling.|$|E

Terry Lee Rioux, Kelley's biographer, noted that the film proved [...] "that it was the character-driven play that made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in Star Trek".

Though size makes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in a bikini, early bikinis often covered the navel. When the navel showed in pictures, it was airbrushed out by magazines like Seventeen. Navel-less women ensured the early dominance of European bikini makers over their American counterparts. By {{the end of the decade}} a vogue for strapless styles developed, wired or bound for firmness and fit, along with a taste for bare-shouldered two-pieces called Little Sinners.

500|$|In the yeshiva setting, {{students}} {{prepare for}} and review the shiur (lecture) with their chavrusas during morning, afternoon, and evening study sessions known as sedarim. On average, a yeshiva student spends ten {{hours per day}} learning in chavrusa. Since having the right chavrusa makes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between having a good year and a bad year, class rebbis may switch chavrusas eight or nine times {{in a class of}} 20 boys until the partnerships work for both sides.

In women's yeshiva programs, teachers are on hand to guide the chavrusas.|$|E

His colleague Hoberman added the film to a [...] "10 Best" [...] list for 1994. Berardinelli draws a parallel between An Unforgettable Summer and Before the Rain, by Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski, noting that, for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in setting and approach, they deal with similar subjects.
