Al Trautwig, commentating for American TV network ABC, likened Findeisen to [...] "a ragdoll" [...] after the fall. Former ski jumper Jeff Hastings, co-commentating, said: [...] "I'm feeling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sick</b> to my stomach, Al... I can't believe this. I've never seen ski flying like this... So many falls." [...] Findeisen was barely conscious and had to be stretchered away, later going into cardiac arrest but surviving.|$|E

My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sick,</b> but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E

5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>sick</b> of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing.

50|$|Harrisburg, March 28, 1856; Friend Still: Your {{last letter}} came {{to hand in}} due season, and I am happy to hear of the safe arrival of those gents. I have before me the Power of Attorney of Mr. John S. Fiery, son of Mr. Henry Fiery, of Washington County, Maryland, the owner of those three men, two women and three children, who arrived in your town on the 24th or 25th of March. He graciously condescends to {{liberate}} the oldest in a year, and the remainder in proportional time, if they will come back; or to sell them their time for $1300. He is sick of the job, and is ready to make any conditions. Now, if you personally can get word to them {{and get them to}} send him a letter, in my charge, informing him of their whereabouts and prospects, I think it will be the best answer I can make to him. He will return in a week or two, to know what can be done. He offers $500 to see them. Or if you can send me word where they are, I will endeavor to write to them for his special satisfaction; or if you cannot do either, send me your latest information, for I intend to make him spend a few more dollars, and if possible get <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sicker</b> of this bad job. Do try and send him a few bitter pills for his weak nerves and disturbed mind. Yours in great haste, Joseph C. Bustill.|$|R

60|$|There were no {{directions}} {{for him to}} give.

The mass circulation tabloid, The Sun, ran the story: [...] "If Kinnock will tell lies about <b>a</b> <b>sick</b> <b>little</b> girl, will he ever tell the truth about anything?". This was one of several anti-Kinnock headlines that the tabloid ran {{in the run-up to the}} 1992 general election, and it has often been said that The Sun's unshakeable support for the Tories and opposition to Labour helped win the election for the Tories. The story though was broken by Peter Hitchens, then of the Daily Express.|$|R

They could grow no fruit in these storm-swept islands; they drank neither wine nor mead, and they had no flesh meat, except perhaps <b>a</b> <b>little</b> for the <b>sick.</b> St Enda himself died in old age around the year 530.|$|R

Stephenson also points out that research, particularly as conducted at the Royal Society, resulted in a changing of views in some cases:If you read the records of the Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people - and I think Hooke was one of them - became <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit disgusted with themselves and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen.
