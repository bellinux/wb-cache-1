40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to evaluate the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> methods in the construction sector. Data were collected from different contractors, consultants & clients to analyses the contractor's financing state {{and the effect of}} the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> methods on the contractor's finance. Interviews and the documentary research are the two methods adopted for the data collection. From the data analysed during this research {{it is clear that the}} almost of all contractors are facing to cash flow problems during the projects. The existing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> practice of providing 20 % advance at the beginning of the project is not sufficient to overcome these cash flow problems. Therefore improvement in the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system is urgently required for the development of the construction sector in Sri Lanka. The main conclusions of the research were that a better <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposal couldn't be generalize. The three advance payment" proposals considered in the research were: A. Providing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> of 20 % at the beginning. B. 20 % advance at the beginning and another 10 % advance at the middle third of the project; and C. Providing 20 % advance & the material advances for the main construction materials. The suitable <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposal has a greater bearing on the variable factors for the contractors finance. These variable factors and their effect on each of these <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposals are analysed and presented. By observing in to the data analysed it's clear that the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system for each and every contract, must be decided by considering limitations of the contractors finance. Presently the client & the consultant decide the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> method. But this system has to be modified, as the contractor will be able to request for his preferred <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option. By looking in to the other possible alternatives available for the contractors,(for to find the finance); going for his preferred <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system is profitable for the contractor even after allowing of a discount to the client. Therefore the existing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system can be used to improve the contractors finance without increasing the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> percentage. However allowing the selection of the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option to the contractor may create an another difficulty in evaluation of the contracts at the tendering stage. If the request for discount percentages, for each and every <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option &their modifications (Delayed <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> recovery or reduced payback period) are included in the tender document the evaluation of the tender can be done under the grounds of equity...|$|R

Under federal law, a surety faces possible liability under a Miller Act <b>Payment</b> <b>Bond</b> to laborers for the bonded principal’s failure to pay wages. Union trusts may also recover against a surety under a Miller Act <b>Payment</b> <b>Bond</b> for the bonded principal’s failure to remit union dues and benefit fund contributions. Still further, liability may arise under a Miller Act Performance Bond to the federal government for the bonded principal’s failure to remit withholding taxes on employee wages. A surety is also exposed to wage liability under the Davis-Bacon Act for the bonded principal’s failure to pay the prevailing wage rate to laborers on a bonded project. Importantly, however, unlike a direct action against a surety under a Miller Act <b>Payment</b> <b>Bond,</b> an action against a surety predicated on a Davis-Bacon Act violation requires exhaustion of administrative remedies delineated in the Davis-Bacon Act prior to a laborer seeking judicial relief...|$|R

However the financial arrangement between Gordon and Bruce became a major issue - Bruce was expecting an <b>advance</b> <b>bond</b> <b>payment</b> for the tour (which would cover cancellations), but the perennially cash-strapped Gordon was offering a profit-share arrangement, which meant there was no money. Students from the University of New South Wales and University of Sydney (including future Oz magazine editors Richard Neville and Martin Sharp) tried to support Bruce by organising shows at campus venues, but these were also cancelled by university authorities, as was a planned interview on ABC Television. Bruce also faced the challenge of supporting his well-known heroin habit - no mean feat in the full glare of the media spotlight in conservative Sydney in 1962 - and he not surprisingly drew the attention of Sydney's Vice Squad. He remained holed up in his Kings Cross hotel, reportedly sleeping {{most of the day}} and mainly eating ice cream. However Bruce's local acquaintance, folk singer Tina Date put him in contact with Sydney 'society' doctor Rocky Meyers, an associate of the left wing intellectual group the Sydney Push, and Meyers was able to provide prescription drugs for him.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} determination {{as to whether}} the Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is actually necessary in the Sri Lankan construction industry, its effect on contractors' cash flow and whether it is a motivation for the contractors. Accurate cash flow forecasting is essential to all contractors in the construction Industry for successful operation and existence in the long run. At initial stages of a project the cash flow aspect of the contractor is negative. The main role of project financing is to cover up this negative flow in a beneficial, cost effective manner. Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> enhances the quality and productivity in the construction industry. It improves the performance and cost efficiency of the contractors as well as the clients. Cash data in relation to thirty projects were collected. Three criteria, no Mobilization Advance, 20 % of the initial contract sum as the Mobilization Advance paid at the inception of the project and 20 % of the initial contract sum as Mobilization Advance given in stages, were identified to determine the differences in the effects of cash flow. The effect of these different criteria on the cumulative cash flow was examined. Further Scheduled Performance Index was calculated for further analysis. Results show and confirm that Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> has a big bearing on the contractors' existence and their motivation towards attaining objectives of the project. Research confirms that Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is a necessity in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Further it can be confirmed that the provision of Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is very essential for the Sri Lankan contractors.
