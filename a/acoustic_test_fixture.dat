Comparative data for the finite element simulation was provided from a series of experiments using a shock tube, <b>acoustic</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture,</b> ear canal simulator and partial head form. The numerical model comprised a finite element mesh of fluid and porous materials in order to model the earmuff hearing protector coupled to the auditory canal.

The article presents the results of noise reduction by HC- 98 headphone for steady state and impulsive noise. Two methods of research were used: sound attenuation measurements with participation of subjects and transmission loss measurements with the use of <b>acoustic</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> — device reflecting the properties of the head. Data for headphone were compared with noise reduction of two different, commonly used earmuffs (one light, the other strong limiting noise). The results indicated that measured headphone meets the requirements that allow for treating it as hearing protection, however, this headphone does not provide hearing protection such as earmuffs. Relatively low values of attenuation of acoustic impulses through the headphone versus the results for earmuffs were observed. Furthermore, in the case of headphone, in the frequency range 63 - 2000 Hz, the lower values of steady state noise sound attenuation, from about 2 up to even a 19 dB with respect to the attenuation of ear muffs were measured.

40|$|Impulse peak {{insertion}} loss (IPIL) was studied with two acoustic test fixtures and four hearing protector {{conditions at the}} E-A-RCAL Laboratory. IPIL {{is the difference between}} the maximum estimated pressure for the open-ear condition and the maximum pressure measured when a hearing protector is placed on an <b>acoustic</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> (ATF). Two models of an ATF manufactured by the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) were evaluated with high-level acoustic impulses created by an acoustic shock tube at levels of 134 decibels (dB), 150 dB, and 168 dB. The fixtures were identical except that the E-A-RCAL ISL fixture had ear canals that were 3 mm longer than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) ISL fixture. Four hearing protection conditions were tested: Combat Arms earplug with the valve open, ETYPlugs ® earplug, TacticalPro headset, and a dual-protector ETYPlugs earplug with TacticalPro earmuff. The IPILs measured for the E-A-RCAL fixture were 1. 4 dB greater than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) ISL ATF. For the E-A-RCAL ISL ATF, the left ear IPIL was 2. 0 dB greater than the right ear IPIL. For the NIOSH ATF, the right ear IPIL was 0. 3 dB greater than the left ear IPIL...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to answer the {{question}} of whether earplugs provide sufficient protection in the exposure to impulse noise generated during metalworking processes. Material and Methods: The noise generated by die forging hammer and punching machine was characterized. Using an <b>acoustic</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture,</b> noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax) under 24 earplugs, foam, winged and no-roll, were measured. Octave band method was used to calculate values of LAeq under earplugs. Results: It was found that in the case of punching machine the exposure limit value of A-weighted noise exposure level, normalized to an 8 -h working day (LEX, 8 h = 94. 8 dB) of noise present at the workstation, was exceeded, while in the case of die forging hammer both the exposure limit value of this parameter (LEX, 8 h = 108. 3 dB) and the exposure limit value of peak sound pressure level (LCpeak = 148. 9 dB) were exceeded. The assessment of noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax, LAeq) under earplugs revealed that the noise attenuation can be insufficient, sufficient, or too high. Conclusions: Earplugs can be suitable hearing protection devices in metalworking processes. Of the 24 earplugs included in this study, 9 provided appropriate noise attenuation in the case of tested die forging hammer and 10 in the case of tested punching machine.

40|$|ObjectiveIn 2009, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{proposed}} an impulse noise reduction rating (NRR) for hearing protection devices {{based upon the}} impulse peak insertion loss (IPIL) methods in the ANSI S 12. 42 - 2010 standard. This study tests the ANSI S 12. 42 methods {{with a range of}} hearing protection devices measured in field conditions. DesignThe method utilizes an <b>acoustic</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> and three ranges for impulse levels: 13022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 134, 14822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 152, and 16622 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 170 dB peak SPL. For this study, four different models of hearing protectors were tested: Bilsom 707 Impact II electronic earmuff, E 27 A 27 R Pod Express, E 27 A 27 R Combat Arms version 4, and the Etymotic Research, Inc. Electronic BlastPLG 22 ̆ 01 e 2 EB 1. Study sampleFive samples of each protector were fitted on the fixture or inserted in the fixture's ear canal five times for each impulse level. Impulses were generated by a 0. 223 caliber rifle. ResultsThe average IPILs increased with peak pressure and ranged between 20 and 38 dB. For some protectors, significant differences were observed across protector examples of the same model, and across insertions. ConclusionsThe EPA's proposed methods provide consistent and reproducible results. The proposed impulse NRR rating should utilize the minimum and maximum protection percentiles as determined by the ANSI S 12. 42 - 2010 methods.

40|$|There are two {{objective}} test methods {{for measuring the}} sound attenuation characteristics of hearing protectors. One of them makes use of artificial heads (e. g. the <b>acoustic</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> (ATF) of ISO TR 4869 - 3 or a commercially available head and torso simulator (HATS)), the other one uses miniature microphones in the ear canals of real ears (MIRE technique). Both methods work quite well with ear-muffs, but their application to ear-plugs gives rise to severe problems. The standardised ATF has no ear canal simulation and therefore {{it is not at}} all suitable for ear-plugs. The ear canal simulations of commercially available HATSs were not yet good enough to produce correct data for ear-plugs. The MIRE technique can be easily applied to only very few types of ear-plugs (e. g. those with an existing (closed) bore that be used to measure the second at the eardrum side of the plug as for example with some otoplastic type ear-plugs or with the EAR-Link type). With all other types of ear-plugs difficulties arise because either the behaviour of the device is changed by attaching the miniature microphone, or the tightness of the fit is decreased by microphone cables along the side of the plug. However, there is an urgent need for an {{objective test}} method for ear-plugs, e. g. for measuring the sound attenuation in impulsive noise, for production control, for pattern evaluation or for designing new types of ear-plugs. Recently, new ear canal simulations of two commercially available HATSs have become available: Brueel and Kjaer 4128 with pinna simulators DZ 9751 / 9752 and HEAD-acoustics HMS II. 4 n. In the following these new versions of HATSs are evaluated as to their suitability for measuring the insertion loss of different types of ear-plugs. (orig.)

50|$|Test {{fixtures}} {{can be set}} up {{in three}} ways: in-line setup, delegate setup, and implicit setup. In-line setup is where the developer creates the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in the same method {{as the rest of the}} test and is the simplest <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> to create but can lead to duplication if multiple tests need to use the same initial data. Delegate setup is where the developer places the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in a separate standalone helper method that can be accessed by multiple test methods. Implicit setup is where the developer places the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in a setup method which is used to set up multiple test methods. This is different from delegate setup in that the overall setup of multiple tests is in a single setup method where the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> gets created instead of each test method having its own setup procedures and linking to an external <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b>|$|R

At {{frequencies}} exceeding 1 - 2 GHz, {{the substrate}} network models used in substrate coupling simulation must {{account for the}} reactive nature of the substrate. Unlike at low frequencies, where the purely resistive substrate models can be validated through DC resistance measurements, these high-frequency models, comprising reactive components, must be validated through high-frequency network analyzer measurements.
