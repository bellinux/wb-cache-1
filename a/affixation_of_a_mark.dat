40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that the}} {{formation}} of female personal nouns in Dutch provides no argument for so-called ‘paradigmatic’ means of word-formation. In the literature (Van Marle 1985, 1986) {{it has been argued}} that these nouns in particular provide an argument for paradigmatic word-formation. More in particular, Van Marle observes that female nouns in -ster only exist if there is a neutral personal noun in -er. He therefore concludes that in order to form female personal nouns in -ster, the grammar needs to check whether there is an existing word in -er. However, it can be demonstrated that such means are superfluous once we acknowledge that -er is the realization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more abstract morpheme, which potentiates the <b>affixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> morpheme deriving female nouns, realized as -ster. Second, that Dutch hosts a haplology rule that deletes -er immediately before -ster. Since haplology is independently motivated (see e. g. Yip 1998, Nevins 2012), the present contribution provides an argument against paradigmatic means for word-formation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{standard}} way {{of describing}} the vocal behaviour of nonhuman primates is to classify the vocal repertoire as either graded or discrete. We analysed <b>a</b> large database <b>of</b> calls given by adult males <b>of</b> <b>a</b> primate considered a typical example for discrete vocal behaviour, the forest-dwelling Campbell's monkeys, Cercopithecus campbelli. We recorded vocal responses from several dozen individuals to their main predators, crowned eagles and leopards. Using cluster analysis techniques, we found two main call types, which were modified further by optional <b>affixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inflexible vocal structure. It {{was possible to}} force the four call types into eight subtypes, with various degrees of gradedness. When taking context into account, we found that acoustically discrete and nonaffixed calls tended to be given right after discovering a predator, while acoustically graded and affixed calls were given during later parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predator encounter and to nonpredatory disturbances. In sum, our results suggest that classifications of primate vocal repertoires as either discrete or graded {{are likely to be}} meaningless, as communicatively relevant acoustic variation can be present within seemingly discrete call types...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{internal}} reconstruction and new {{analysis of the}} data from Novelli (1985), it is shown that ATR harmony processes have a reciprocal relationship with diachronic change in Karimojong, and that three morphophonological levels are necessary to account for surface forms. On the one hand, vowel mergers and reinterpretations by the speech community have generated greater variety in the affix types and harmony processes in the language. On the other hand, affix behavior under harmony processes brings to light transitional phases of affix incorporation. Comparative reconstruction by Dimmendaal (2002) indicates that the original [+ATR] variant of the low vowel [a] merged with [], [o] and []. One result is the [/o] alternating affix, which under root controlled harmony, appears with [] in the [-ATR] case, and with [o] in the [+ATR] case, as seen in Level 1 of examples (1 -a,b). Subsequent <b>affixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [+ATR] TAM marker and a suffix –controlled [+ATR] spreading on Level 2 generates different behaviors of Level 1 [/o] suffixes. The []-head of the suffix for the [-ATR] verb appears as [], rather than [o], while the [o] head of the [+ATR] suffix remains unchanged. Pronominal prefix [-] in both examples, unaffected by ATR harmony processes, is affixed on Level 3. The findings of recent ultrasound research (Archangeli, 2003; Gick et al 2006) allow us to interpret [] in [+ATR] environments as [], providing a new explanation for what had been regarded as low vowel transparency. Three types of affixes in Karimojong demonstrate attested diachronic processes of incorporation. Pronomina...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of prior use in common and {{statutory}} trade mark law. In the United States a pertinent requirement is priority of use. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a reputation must be present. In the United Kingdom a plaintiff is required to have goodwill in the country, but in the United States and South Africa it is not required. The conception <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> does not qualify for protection. It is not required that a business must have actually entered the market. In the United States the general approach is that a plaintiff will not receive protection in a remote area, but regard must be had to zones of natural expansion. British and South African law is the same, and protection may be obtained in areas {{where there is no}} trading. Where a dual reputation exists, neither party will be able to act against the other. The mere fact that the user <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> was aware <b>of</b> the use thereof by another person, does not exclude protection. <b>A</b> trade <b>mark</b> application can be opposed on the basis of another application, combined with use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark,</b> or on the ground of prior use. In some instances the fact that <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> has been filed will influence the burden of proof. In general, a registration can be expunged on the same grounds as would constitute grounds of opposition. The concurrent use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> can form the basis for the registration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark.</b> In the United States, the use must have taken place prior to the filing date of the other party, but in the United Kingdom and South Africa, prior to the own filing date. In the latter two countries, knowledge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> is not necessarily exclusionary. Prior use is generally accepted as a defence to an infringement action. It is, however, noted that in various countries, it is only use prior to the relevant date that will be protected, and there is not necessarily a right to extend the scope of use concerned.

40|$|The title {{question}} is the central theme which runs throughout this thesis. However, in order to answer this question, one must answer two preliminary questions. Firstly, what constitutes the essential function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trade <b>mark</b> and therefore at are the aspects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mark</b> that the law ought to protect? Secondly, what actions constitute use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trade <b>mark</b> {{for the purposes of}} the infringement provisions? Therefore, Chapter One discusses the specific subject matter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trade <b>mark</b> and provides <b>a</b> conclusion as to what elements the law should protect. Chapter Two uses Section 10 (4) as a starting point to discuss the concept of use and in finding no fixed definition, provides its own. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
