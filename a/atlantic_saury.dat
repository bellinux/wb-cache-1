50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>saury</b> (Scomberesox saurus) is a fish of {{the family}} Scomberesocidae found in the Atlantic Ocean, in the seas near Australia, {{and also in the}} Mediterranean. The fish grow to about 35 cm in length, with a maximum of 50 cm, and have beaklike jaws and a row of finlets behind their dorsal and anal fins. Atlantic sauries live near the surface, and will often jump above the surface.|$|E

As traditional species decrease in abundance and become less profitable, {{the industry is}} increasingly turning to alternate species. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>saury</b> (Scomberesox saurus saurus (Walbaum)) {{has been identified as}} a potential species for exploitation. Very little information is available on its biology or population dynamics, especially for Irish waters. This thesis aims to obtain sound scientific data, which will help to ensure that a future <b>Atlantic</b> <b>saury</b> fishery can be sustainably managed. The research has produced valuable data, some of which contradicts previous studies. Growth of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>saury</b> measured using otolith microstructure is found to be more than twice that previously calculated from annual structures on scales and otoliths. This results in a significant reduction of the expected life span from five to about two years. Investigation of maturity stage at age indicates that <b>Atlantic</b> <b>saury</b> will reproduce {{for the first time at}} age one and will survive for one or at most two reproduction seasons. It is concluded that a future Irish fishery will target mostly fish prior to their first reproduction. Finally the thesis gives some insights into the population structure of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>saury,</b> by analysis of otolith morphometric. Significant differences are detected between Northeastern Atlantic and western Mediterranean Sea specimens of the 0 + age class (less than one year old). The implications of these results for the management of an emerging fishery are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The stomach {{content of}} 113 {{individuals}} of shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus was analyzed. Individuals were sampled at landing in Vigo (Spain) and captured by sea-surface long-liners {{in the vicinity}} of the Azores Archipelago and between Azores and the Iberian Peninsula, in March and October 2012, and March 2013. Teleosts constituted the dominant item, mainly <b>Atlantic</b> <b>saury</b> Scomberesox saurus (87 % of teleost prey). Among them, 94 % were deprived of both head and the caudal fin, while the flesh and bones of the body were preserved. The presence of eye’s lenses, the number of which was consistent with the number of fish remains, likely rules out the elimination of the heads before ingestion. There is no obvious explanation for this unexpected and unrecorded pattern of digestion...|$|E
