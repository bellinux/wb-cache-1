40|$|The {{permanent}} magnet AC motor requires absolute position {{information to be}} supplied to the controller so that the applied winding currents can be modulated in synchronism with the rotor. The design of controllers which can operate without position feedback {{have been the subject}} of intense development. The most commonly cited justifications for the elimination of the <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> <b>encoder</b> are those of cost, and also reduction of the physical dimensions of the motor. The position estimation technique to be developed must be robust to external torque disturbances and preferably robust to electrical parameter variations over time. Certain military specifications apply stringent restraints to the use of sensors and estimation techniques. Absolute position encoders in this case are prohibited due to the relatively fragile nature of the glass index disk found in the encoder. The same restriction applies to manufacturers' specifications concerning electric vehicle traction drives. Fully sensorless operation has been the focus of development for all classes of electric motors, particularly the PMAC. Unfortunately, the use of state observers is viewed by industry with suspicion in terms of the computational effort required and also the question of robustness. A solution is presented which satisfies the constraints of physical and computational robustness, and is experimentally verified...|$|E

Soldier amputees desiring to return to active duty can only return to limited military occupational specialties under the capabilities of current passive prosthetics. The work presented here {{is part of an}} ongoing project in developing an active foot-ankle prosthetic that addresses the unwieldiness of conventional, passive below-the-knee prosthetics by providing an active, powered motor force exertion similar to what the amputated limb would have exerted had it not been amputated. For testing and development purposes, a software and hardware package that controls the prosthetic and allows real-time and logged inspection of physical signals and sensor data is currently being designed and implemented. A closed loop tibia based control algorithm will be integrated with a PIC 32 microcontroller. The desired ankle position is determined and actuated based on tibia position and angular acceleration acquired from a two-plane micromachined gyroscope and an <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> <b>encoder.</b> Data analysis will be performed in tethered or un-tethered modes to allow flexibility in testing environments. Sensor data is recorded to an on board micro SD card for un-tethered operation. Tethered operation will stream data in real time via USB 2. 0 interface with a computer. A software interface was developed to process and display operational data for visual analysis either in real time (tethered) or play back from logged data (un-tethered). This work has provided the ability to diagnose the operation of the active prosthesis, visualize the results in real-time, and drive design improvements based on real world testing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Permanent magnet {{synchronous}} motor (PMSM) drives {{are suitable for}} high-performance servo applications, as in robotics. This, however, requires an accurate position feedback, which is not possible with the existing <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> encoders, unless one is prepared to compromise {{on the size of}} the encoder. This paper proposes a new encoding scheme based on the simple Vernier principle. The proposed scheme improves the resolution of the encoder within limited disk diameter. An improved encoder based on the same principle is also presented with minor mod-ifications to improve the resolution. Computer simulations and experimental work have shown that a suitable modification of the Vernier concept can result in an encoder that is superior to the existing ones.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{framework}} called rigid body localization for joint position and orientation estimation of a rigid body. We consider a setup {{in which a}} few sensors are mounted on a rigid body. The <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> of the sensors on the rigid body, or the <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> of the rigid body itself is not known. However, we know how the sensors are mounted on the rigid body, i. e., the sensor topology is known. Using range-only measurements between the sensors and a few anchors (nodes with known <b>absolute</b> <b>positions),</b> and without using any inertial measurements (e. g., accelerometers), we estimate the position and orientation of the rigid body. For this purpose, the <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> of the sensors is expressed as an affine function of the Stiefel manifold. In other words, we represent the orientation as a rotation matrix, and <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> as a translation vector. We propose a least-squares (LS), simplified unitarily constrained LS (SUC-LS), and optimal unitarily constrained least-squares (OUC-LS) estimator, where the latter is based on Newton's method. As a benchmark, we derive a unitarily constrained Cramér-Rao bound (UC-CRB). The known topology of the sensors can sometimes be perturbed during fabrication. To take these perturbations into account, a simplified unitarily constrained total-least-squares (SUC-TLS), and an optimal unitarily constrained total-least-squares (OUC-TLS) estimator are also proposed.
