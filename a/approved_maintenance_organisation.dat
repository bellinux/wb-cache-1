50|$|The {{company was}} formed in 2005 {{with the purpose of}} {{operating}} turboprop commuter aircraft. The initial fleet consisted of 1 Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft and 3 Beechcraft 1900C aircraft. CemAir has since evolved into a specialised aircraft leasing company offering turboprop and jet aircraft to a variety of operators throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Indian Ocean islands as well as a significant operator of scheduled regional services within South Africa. The company is a South African Part 121 (large aircraft operator) and Part 135 (small aircraft operator) company, holding South African Civil Aviation Authority issued AOCs (Air Operator Certificates) in both of these categories. The Air Service Licensing Council has issued the company with domestic and international licenses, for both scheduled and non-scheduled services. In addition, CemAir holds approval from the SACAA for a Part 145 AMO (<b>Approved</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organisation),</b> which allows it to operate its own maintenance department. The management structure conforms to the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) model and has six full-time post holders for complete oversight of flight operations and maintenance. The duties and responsibilities of each position are documented with frequent internal and external audits to ensure compliance.The organisation runs an ICAO based Safety Management System (SMS) conforming to the requirements of ICAO Safety Management Standards & Recommended Practises (SARPs) and ICAO Doc 9859.The company was previously a member of the Flight Safety Foundation and completed three successive BARS audits. BARS (Basic Aviation Risk Standard) is a move towards audit standardization using a risk-based model based on best practice aviation safety principles and tailored {{to the needs of the}} resource sector, mainly the mining industry. Two additional resource based audits have been successfully concluded by Hart Aviation to ensure that CemAir's operating and maintenance standards are acceptable to companies in the oil, gas and petroleum industry. The company has recently concluded its first IOSA audit (IATA Operational Safety Audit)and expects full accreditation to be achieved by mid-2016.|$|E

40|$|Risk is an {{unavoidable}} {{part of the}} aviation industry, and describes both an inherent uncertainty, and {{an appreciation of the}} degree to which this uncertainty matters [9]. It is a well - known aphorism that ‘one cannot manage what one cannot measure’, and so the identification of hazards is the first step towards the management of safety risk [11]. A hazard may be defined as something with “the potential to cause harm”, yet different attitudes and perceptions mean that their recognition may be highly subjective because of “[exposure] to sources of explicit and implicit bias”. This means that what appears hostile to some may appear benign to others [9]. In an effort to promote safety and sustain airworthiness, <b>Approved</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organisations</b> (AMO) are one of the most regulated aspects of the aviation industry. As an imperfect, human - built and human - led system, basic fallibility means that the performance of any aviation organisation will unavoidably deviate that which is planned. This research has shown that a balance of compliance and flexibility is essential to the continued operation of such systems in an “uncertain and dynamic world”, and so aviation is reliant upon the management of risk attitude to provide an enveloping response to uncertainty and safety risk [16]. Through analysis of the safety performance of an EASA registered Part 145 AMO, this project has shown that risk attitudes and perception play an integral role in the identification of safety risk. Whilst the scope and nature of the various risk attitude biases could not be fully quantified, further analysis has shown that Safety Performance Monitoring and Measurement is the first step toward this goal, whilst helping to reduce uncertainty and manage subjectivity across the operational environment. Recommendations address the mitigation of conscious, subconscious and affective biases, and aim to enhance situational awareness and improve hazard identification. These include the standardisation of the risk assessment process, improved levels of quantitative performance monitoring, and improved awareness amongst operational personnel of the potential impact of specific situational risk attitude influences. Ultimately, this research has shown that the greatest asset to any AMO is its constituent staff members, and the promotion of risk attitude and error wisdom has been shown to enhance operational safety by allowing personnel to develop their understanding and management of their own limitations, whilst adapting their risk attitude to that required by the situation, the context and their skills...|$|R
40|$|Unavailability of {{technical}} systems, such as aircraft, is expensive. Technical systems require maintenance {{to prevent and}} to remedy defects that cause unavailability. Users {{of technical}} systems usually bear {{the consequences of the}} risk of unavailability, in particular the loss of productivity. This is based on the presumption that users are best able to insure the risks, although <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> may be more capable to mitigate the risks. The risks are seldom allocated to <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> because users and <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> tend to have conflicting objectives. This raises the questions if a <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> can be motivated to pursue the objective of the user. This would be possible if the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> is rewarded for the “commercial success of the user of the technical system”. If the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> indeed pursues the objective of the user of the technical system, the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> can make autonomous decisions about the maintenance activities. And if the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> can make decisions, it can make investments in measures to mitigate risks, knowing that it can decide if these measures will be employed. This research shows that it is efficient and effective to transfer the risks of the unavailability of a technical system from the user to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> on the condition that the <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> (a) will be compensated for the risks of unavailability, (b) will be rewarded for the contribution of the technical system to the commercial success of the user, and (c) is assigned the required decision rights. This will in practice require new “collaborative” contracts {{that can be used for}} the supply of long-term maintenance services of technical systems where unavailability causes a significant economic risk, for example in aircraft maintenance.

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{has affected the}} airline industry {{as much as it}} has affected all other industries in the world. The small airlines and maintenance organisations must find new opportunities and options in order to survive the harsh crisis. Priority Aero Maintenance is now an <b>approved</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> performing maintenance on aircrafts, engines and components. The company sees economic gains in the future by becoming an approved organisation that follows the European Aviation Safety Agency guidelines (EASA) and meets the requirements outlined in the rules of Part-M. In order for the company to become an approved organization, responsible for continuing airworthiness of aircraft, a handbook should be presented to the local authority. This handbook describes the company’s responsibility for the continuing airworthiness in order for the authorities to get an insight into the company and its work. This thesis resulted in a draft of CAME (Continuing Airworthiness Management Exposition) and this draft has been approved by Priority Aero Maintenance. The CAME will in the future be used by the company as a basis for developing a more detailed manual to be presented to and approved by the Swedish Aviation Authority (Transportstyrelsen) ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research on future manufacturing and the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution (implying extensive digitalisation), {{there is a}} lack of understanding regarding the specific changes that can be expected for <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations.</b> Therefore, developing scenarios for future maintenance is needed to define long-term strategies for the realisation of digitalised manufacturing. This empirical Delphi-based scenario planning study is the first within the maintenance realm, examining a total of 34 projections about potential changes to the internal and external environment of <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations,</b> considering both hard (technological) and soft (social) dimensions. The paper describes a probable future of <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> in digitalised manufacturing in the year 2030, based on an extensive three-round Delphi survey with 25 maintenance experts at strategic level from the largest companies within the Swedish manufacturing industry. In particular, the study contributes with development of probable as well as wildcard scenarios for future maintenance. This includes e. g. advancement of data analytics, increased emphasis on education and training, novel principles for maintenance planning with a systems perspective, and stronger environmental legislation and standards. The scenarios may serve as direct input to strategic development in industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> and are expected to substantially improve preparedness to the changes brought by digitalised manufacturing...|$|R
