40|$|Purpose. To {{survey the}} species {{diversity}} of home dust mites (HDM) in Xishuangbanna, a tropical rainforest region in Southwest China. Methods. From August 2010 to January 2011, mite-allergic patients and healthy controls {{were invited to}} participate. Dust samples from the patients’ homes were collected, and mites in the samples were isolated. Permanent slides were prepared for morphologically based species determination. Results. In total, 6316 mite specimens of morphologically identifiable species were found in 233 dust samples taken from 41 homes. The result shows that the mite family of Pyroglyphidae occupied {{the highest percentage of}} the total amount of mites collected, followed by Cheyletidae family. The most common adult Pyroglyphidae mites were Dermatophagoides (D.) farinae, D. pteronyssinus, and D. siboney. The most common mites found from other families were Blomia tropicalis, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, and Aleuroglyphus ovatus. Four main <b>allergenic</b> <b>dust</b> mite species D. farinae, D. pteronyssinus, D. siboney, and Blomia tropicalis were found to be coinhabiting in 6 / 41 homes. Conclusion. The HDM population in homes in Xishuangbanna, a tropical rainforest region in Southwest China, has its own characteristics. It has rich dust mite species and the dust mite densities do not show significant variation across seasons...|$|E

40|$|Historically, horse {{dandruff}} was {{a favorite}} allergen source material. Today, however, allergic symptoms due to airborne mammalian allergens are mostly a result of indoor exposure, be it at home, at work or even at school. The relevance of mammalian allergens {{in relation to the}} allergenic activity of house dust extract is briefly discussed in the historical context of two other proposed sources of house <b>dust</b> <b>allergenic</b> activity: mites and Maillard-type lysine-sugar conjugates. Mammalian proteins involved in allergic reactions to airborne dust are largely found in only 2 protein families: lipocalins and secretoglobins (Fel d 1 -like proteins), with a relatively minor contribution of serum albumins, cystatins and latherins. Both the lipocalin and the secretoglobin family are very complex. In some instances this results in a blurred separation between important and less important allergenic family members. The past 50 years have provided us with much detailed information on the genomic organization and protein structure of many of these allergens. However, the complex family relations, combined with the wide range of post-translational enzymatic and non-enzymatic modifications, make a proper qualitative and quantitative description of the important mammalian indoor airborne allergens still a significant proteomic challeng...|$|R
40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} {{the incidence of}} occupational diseases in Poland (2013). Material and Methods: Occupational disease reporting forms, supplied to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases, were used as the study material. The incidence was specified in terms of rates per 100 000 employed people. Results: The number of new cases was 2214 with the incidence rate of 15. 6. The downward trend recorded over several years continues; compared to 2012, {{the number of new}} cases decreased by 7. 8 %. Exposure to dusts (35 % cases), mostly inorganic (carbon, asbestos, and industrial dusts containing free crystalline silica) was {{the most common cause of}} occupational diseases. Among the organic <b>dusts</b> <b>allergenic</b> effects of flour and vegetable dusts predominated. Every 3 rd case of occupational disease was attributable to physical agents, mainly the way the work is done, excessive vocal effort and noise. The sections of national economy with the highest incidence comprised mining and quarrying (271. 1), manufacturing (24. 3), education (22. 4), agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing (21. 0), human health and social assistance (20. 5). Conclusions: The decreased incidence of ‘traditional’ diseases observed over the recent 15 years and the analysis of the 2013 incidence indicate a need to revise the Polish list of occupational diseases by exposures found in the modern work environment. Particular attention should be paid to conditions prevailing in workplaces with high exposures to industrial dusts containing free crystalline silica. A considerable variation in the incidence of voice disorders in teachers between individual voivodeships (provinces) points to the need for harmonization of the standards of preventive, diagnostic and certification procedures.

40|$|Background: In {{beginning}} of April 2014 England again experienced “red rain”, which {{is due to}} long distant transport of Saharan dust. In 2014 this coincided with the worst air pollution episode in Southern England for more than a decade. We argue here, that when the Saharan dust episodes like this happens during spring in Northern Europe, then there is also a very large risk that this will cause a health damaging cocktail consisting of Saharan dust, aeroallergens and increased air pollution. It mainly depends on the path of the air masses. Method: We explore observations of pollen from Worcester and coastal monitoring sites in England during the episode of Saharan dust. This is combined atmospheric modelling using the weather forecast model WRF and the particle dispersion model HYSPLIT. Results: During the episode, southern air masses arrived at Worcester and the coastal sites, thus from the sea. All sites showed large amounts of birch pollen and detailed analysis at Worcester pollen grains from plants native to Southern Europe or North Africa. Foot print modelling with WRF-HYSPLIT shows that air masses pass France during their way from the area around the Mediterranean. Conclusion: During episodes of Saharan dust, then the atmosphere is in a state that favours long distance transport to an extreme degree. When the air masses pass large continental areas like Central-Northern Europe during spring, there is a good possibility that a fraction of the passed areas will have flowering birch trees. The pollen will therefore enrich the already polluted air masses and also undergo long distance transport. This will cause a cocktail effect of Saharan <b>dust,</b> <b>allergenic</b> pollen and increased air pollution in areas like England...|$|R
