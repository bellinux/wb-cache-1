40|$|Abstract: A {{method for}} {{determining}} consensus of hierarchical incomplete ordered partitions <b>and</b> <b>coverings</b> of sets {{is presented in}} this chapter. Incomplete ordered partitions <b>and</b> <b>coverings</b> are often used in expert information analysis. These structures should be useful when an expert has to classify elements of a set into given classes, but referring to several elements {{he does not know}} to which classes they should belong. The hierarchical ordered partition is a more general structure than incomplete ordered partition. In this chapter we present definitions of the notion of hierarchical incomplete ordered partitions <b>and</b> <b>coverings</b> of sets. The distance functions between hierarchical incomplete ordered partitions <b>and</b> <b>coverings</b> are defined. We present also algorithms of consensus determining for a finite set of hierarchical incomplete ordered partitions <b>and</b> <b>coverings...</b>|$|R
