5|$|The four {{credit rating}} {{agencies}} which monitor Iceland's sovereign debt all lowered their ratings during the crisis, and their outlook for future ratings changes became negative.

30|$|The principal’s {{expected}} utilities with a top-down and <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> {{process are}} increasing in the earnings potential x_H. The relative attractiveness of a top-down and <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process is {{captured by the}} cut-off level β ^c. For an importance of coordination below this threshold, the top-down <b>budgeting</b> process yields <b>a</b> higher expected utility for the principal than <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process. For <b>an</b> importance of coordination above the threshold β ^c, the opposite is true. When the earnings potential x_H increases, the principal’s expected utilities with a top-down and <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process also increase. The increase is higher with <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process than with <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process because of imperfect coordination with <b>a</b> top-down <b>budget.</b> Therefore, the cut-off level β ^c is smaller for a higher earnings potential x_H. The range for which <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process is implemented, i.e., [0,β ^c), becomes smaller when the earnings potential increases. As a consequence, {{an increase in the}} earnings potential reduces the potential use of <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process. This is stated in Corollary 3 and displayed in Fig. 3.|$|R

5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass <b>a</b> <b>budget</b> before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass <b>a</b> <b>budget.</b> In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass <b>a</b> <b>budget</b> in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E
30|$|The model shows that, in {{the case}} of a low {{importance}} of coordination, the loss from imperfect coordination in <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process is outweighed by the additional costs for inducing truth-telling in <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process. That is, the company prefers to implement <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process and to keep the managers uninformed. For a high importance of coordination, the use of <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process is optimal. The results illustrate that the company might prefer to use <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process instead of <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process. However, this is not true for the managers of the divisions. The managers receive higher positive expected rents with participation than they receive with top-down budgets. Thus, the managers always prefer to have <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process in place.|$|R

30|$|When <b>a</b> {{top-down}} <b>budgeting</b> {{process is}} in place, the agents are not induced to provide truthful reports. Therefore, the agents only receive incentives for providing high productive effort. The resulting rent is positive, i.e., each agent’s expected utility exceeds his reservation utility of zero (Proposition 1). In {{the case of}} <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process, the agents obtain additional rents, because the principal provides adapted compensation payments that induce the agents to truthfully report their private decision-relevant information. Consequently, if the agents designed the budgeting process in date 0, they would implement <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process and obtain higher positive rents. This insight conforms with empirical findings. Practitioners would like to use more participation in the budgeting system (Libby and Lindsay 2010). Heinle et al. (2014) also illustrate that agents prefer <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process to <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process. The intuition is similar. With <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process, the agent controls the reporting and the productive effort supply. In <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process, the agent only controls the productive effort supply and the principal controls the reporting. Thus, in Heinle et al. (2014), the agent receives less rents with top-down <b>budgets</b> than under <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process. In the present paper, the agents also control the effort supply and the reporting when <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process is implemented. However, for <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process, the control over reporting is completely set mute. This means, neither the agents nor the principal controls the reporting. The findings of Corollary  4 correspond {{to the results of}} Heinle et al. (2014), i.e., the agents obtain more rents with <b>a</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process compared to <b>a</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process.|$|R
