5|$|The 23rd Division (South Vietnam) {{under the}} command of Brigadier General Tran Van Cam was the main unit {{defending}} Ban Me Thuot and the surrounding areas. Major General Pham Van Phu had at his disposal five artillery battalions equipped with 146 artillery guns, and one armoured brigade of about 117 tanks and <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The South Vietnamese military also stationed air force and naval units in Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
5|$|A police {{van with}} two {{officers}} arrived {{a short time}} after the shootings began, at around 11:00. They entered the yard of the college where they were shot at by Saari, and forced to retreat. From around 11:45 to 12:00 further police units, bolstered {{by a number of}} <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles,</b> began to arrive on the scene. They attempted to enter the building through the main corridor, but this assault was aborted due to the black smoke that was emanating from within the building.|$|E
5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} {{undoubtedly}} substantial, the exact numbers are unclear {{because of a}} lack of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia, with the loss of 600 <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> and heavy weapons and over 20 aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>armoured</b> {{recovery}} <b>vehicle</b> (ARV) is an <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{used during}} combat for recovery or repair of battle-damaged and inoperable <b>armoured</b> fighting <b>vehicles.</b> The term [...] "Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle" [...] (ARRV) is also used.|$|R
50|$|Armour The Royal Marines {{maintain}} no heavy armoured units, instead, {{they operate}} {{a fleet of}} lightly armoured and highly mobile vehicles intended for amphibious landings or rapid deployment. The primary <b>armoured</b> fighting <b>vehicle</b> operated by the Armoured Support Group is the BvS 10 Viking All Terrain <b>Armoured</b> <b>Vehicle.</b> Other, lighter vehicles include the Land Rover Wolf <b>Armoured</b> Patrol <b>Vehicle,</b> the Jackal (MWMIK) <b>Armoured</b> <b>Vehicle</b> and the Pinzgauer High Mobility All Terrain Vehicle.|$|R

5|$|Attempting to {{list the}} {{equipment}} available to the DRC's land forces is difficult; most figures are unreliable estimates based on known items delivered in the past. The IISS's Military Balance 2007 and Orbat.com's Concise World Armies 2005 give only slightly differing figures however (the figures below are from the IISS Military Balance 2007). Much of the Army's equipment is non-operational due to insufficient maintenance—in 2002 only 20 percent of the Army's <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> were estimated as being serviceable.|$|E
5|$|Tactical {{training}} {{emphasized that}} it was best utilized from a slit trench with surprise and concealment {{on the side of}} the PIAT team, and where possible enemy <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> should be engaged from the flank or rear. The PIAT was often also used in combat to knock out enemy positions located in houses and bunkers. It was possible to use the PIAT as a crude mortar by placing the shoulder pad of the weapon on the ground and supporting it.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army is {{primarily}} a light infantry force with equipment which may be carried by individual soldiers. It is also equipped with <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> and artillery; the Army is introducing more <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> into service {{as part of the}} 'hardened and networked army' initiative. The Army's armoured, mechanised and motorised units are currently equipped with 59 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 774 M113 armoured personnel carriers (including vehicles in store), and 257 ASLAV armoured reconnaissance vehicles. 838 Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles are currently in service with 214 on order as of July 2012. The Army's artillery holdings consist of 112 L119 Hamel 105mm calibre towed guns, 36 155mm towed M198 howitzers, an unspecified number of 81mm mortars and 30 RBS-70 surface-to-air missiles. As of July 2015, Australian Army Aviation is equipped with 115 helicopters, including 19 Kiowa reconnaissance helicopters, 22 Eurocopter Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopters, 34 S-70A-9 Blackhawk, six CH-47D Chinooks, one CH-47F Chinook (with six on order), 27 of a planned 46 MRH 90 transport helicopters, and 12 Bell 206 training aircraft.

50|$|The Sulu PNP <b>Armoured</b> <b>Vehicle</b> was an <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{produced}} indigenously in the Philippines. There are {{a number}} of photos of examples of it some being used by state military forces, and others by irregular forces; however, its exact history, design, and development are not known.|$|R
5|$|The Condor Legion {{also took}} part in the Battle of Brunete. The Legion was sent from the north to {{reinforce}} the broken line. There were repeated raids on Spanish Republican Army <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> and later defensive positions by both bombers and fighters based at Salamanca. Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft were ineffective, despite Nationalist fears, compared with German aircraft. The Legion lost eight aircraft, but claimed 18 victories. German tactics were also improved with the experience of Brunete, particularly the en masse use of tanks by the Nationalists.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's main role {{throughout}} its existence {{was to provide}} a pool of armoured units and sub-units that could be deployed to augment infantry forces. It was also responsible for developing specialised variants of <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Elements of the 4th Armoured Brigade were detached to support most of the Australian Army's major operations from 1943 {{until the end of the}} war, and from September 1944 it was the Army's only armoured brigade. The formation was disbanded, after the war, in February 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jordan mounted two counter-attacks. The {{first was}} over Beit Susin. The Legionnaires took several Israeli guard posts {{but could not}} keep them {{more than a few}} hours. The fighting took lives and some 20 injuries on the Israeli side. The second was at Kibbutz Gezer from where the diversion attacks had been launched. A force the strength of a battalion, made up of Legionnaires and irregulars and supported by a dozen <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles,</b> attacked the kibbutz in the morning. It was defended by 68 soldiers of the Haganah (including 13 women).|$|E

5|$|Across the Central Highlands of Vietnam, the South Vietnamese {{military}} {{enjoyed a}} numerical superiority of about 78,300 soldiers against North Vietnam’s 65,141 soldiers. However, within {{the vicinity of}} Ban Me Thuot, the South Vietnamese were actually outnumbered by a ratio of 5:1. The North Vietnamese had more tanks, <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and heavy artillery, with a ratio of about 2:1. North Vietnamese General Van Tien Dung believed his tank and artillery units in the Central Highlands were the key factors that guaranteed a quick victory, because South Vietnam simply lacked the capability to withstand such large numbers of heavy weaponry.|$|E
5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> of many kinds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North Vietnamese had secured all major points {{surrounding}} Huế, and South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North Vietnamese claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, who reported to the North Vietnamese military authorities. The South Vietnamese military in Huế also surrendered vast quantities of weaponry, which included 140 tanks and <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|E

5|$|In October, {{the unit}} moved from Tidworth to Colchester {{and around the}} same time it was redesignated as the 2/33rd Battalion, to bring it into line with the other battalions of the Second Australian Imperial Force. At Colchester, the Australians {{undertook}} a period of intensive training which was followed by defensive duties amidst the backdrop of the ongoing Battle of Britain, which took place in the skies overhead. During this time, the battalion was allocated the role of mobile reserve, assigned the task of counter-attacking around Harwich {{in the event of a}} German invasion; in this role they undertook further training operating with and against tanks, with British <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> and crews being assigned to the battalion during training exercises.|$|E
5|$|Security {{measures}} included Turkish war {{ships and}} Turkish commandos in rubber boats patrolling the Bosporus, AWACS surveillance planes and F-16 warplanes circling {{above the city}} in order to monitor a no-fly zone over the city, and the assignment of 23,000 to 24,000 police officers, supported by police helicopters and <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The Bosphorus Strait was also closed to oil tankers, the underground rail system was suspended and whole city districts were sealed off. Nevertheless, a small bomb or explosive devise blew up on an empty Turkish Airlines plane on June 29 as workers were cleaning it at the main Istanbul airport. Three of the workers were slightly injured.|$|E
