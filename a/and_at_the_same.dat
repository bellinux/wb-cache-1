5|$|After {{the landing}} at Normandy, {{a revival of}} Anvil became {{increasingly}} attractive to the Allied planners. The Normandy ports had insufficient capacity to handle Allied supply needs <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time French generals under Charles de Gaulle pressed for a direct attack on Southern France with participation of French troops. These factors led to a reconsideration of the plan. Despite Churchill's objections, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14July and then renamed Dragoon on 1August. The landing was scheduled for 15August.|$|E
5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E

5|$|Autolink has {{traditionally}} owned a large pool of autoracks. These have been {{operated by the}} Norwegian State Railways, and subsequently their subsidiary CargoNet. On 31 January 2007, Autolink bought 40% of the private railway company Ofotbanen, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time signed a haulage contract with them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer, and second largest owner. In March, Autolink ordered additional 70new autoracks for NOK175 million.|$|E
5|$|Autolink, {{the largest}} {{distributor}} of automobiles in Norway, has traditionally bought train services from CargoNet. In 2007, they {{signed a contract}} with Ofotbanen, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time bought 40% of the company. However, Ofotbanen was in financial difficulties, causing a dispute between the two owners. The result was that Autolink formally established Cargolink in March 2008, without the knowledge of Ofotbanen, and terminated the contract with Ofotbanen in July. Cargolink received an operating licence in September and service started in November.|$|E

5|$|Bosi had {{previously}} been head chef and won a Michelin star at the Overton Grange restaurant, just outside the town. He had intended to open a restaurant in Warwickshire, but found the premises too expensive and purchased a 25-year lease on the former Oaks property in Ludlow for £40,000. Within a year Hibiscus won its first Michelin star, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time Overton Grange was downgraded before going into receivership.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as to allow it to have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base nunatak for the research station <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E

5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants. Service {{was a natural}} part of the cycle of life, and it was common for young people to spend some years away from home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.|$|E
5|$|In 326, Constantine {{reversed}} this pro-equestrian trend, raising many {{administrative positions}} to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices {{to the old}} aristocracy, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time elevating the rank of already existing equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank —in the process, {{so that by the}} end of the 4th century the title of perfectissimus was granted only to mid-low officials.|$|E
