5|$|Although {{the speaker}} uses bought-in drivers, {{they have been}} rebuilt using {{stronger}} materials. Drivers' metal baskets are treated to reduce the effects of vibration, and the enclosure designed and constructed to control energy. The drive units (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from KEF in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet. However, Linn found the T27 tweeter too fragile {{and replaced it with}} the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> short run; the Scan-Speak tweeter was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark. The midrange KEF B110, known for its use in the LS3/5A BBC monitor, is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping. The woofer is a KEF B139.|$|E

5|$|In the 1969–70 FA Cup quarter final, Liverpool {{played against}} {{struggling}} Second Division side Watford at Vicarage Road and lost 1–0 <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor performance. The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled {{the end for}} St John, Hunt, Byrne, Yeats and Lawrence; the incomers included Ray Clemence, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd, John Toshack, Brian Hall and Steve Heighway. Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves, they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even, {{in the case of}} Heighway, from non-league football. Adding the new players to Tommy Smith, Ian Callaghan, Chris Lawler and Emlyn Hughes, Shankly formed the nucleus of a second great team which went on to dominate English and European football in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Paralleling the coastline, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a light storm surge that peaked at 2.6feet (0.8m) above normal on Sanibel Island. In some locations, the surge rose rapidly, and, despite the unusual {{geography of the}} area, the levels varied only {{by as much as}} 9.8inches (250mm) than the predicted levels from the SLOSH model. The surge and waves caused minor beach erosion. Moderate to heavy rainfall fell across western Florida, peaking at 6.14 inches (156 mm) near Bradenton; the rainfall was beneficial <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> dry summer, though, because it fell quickly, even this amount of precipitation failed to relieve water restrictions across the area. The storm resulted in some flooding in its path, including some several homes in Manatee County, roadways, and two U.S. highways. Statewide damage totalled $3 million (1990 USD, $  USD), of which $1 million (1990 USD, $  USD) occurred in Manatee County.|$|E
5|$|The draft-Constitution {{was to be}} {{subjected}} to a referendum on 8 August 1797, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> lively campaign in which the French ambassador Noël weighed in with a supportive appeal. This probably contributed to the resounding defeat of the proposal (108,761 votes to 27,995). The Assembly was back at square one. At this moment in time foreign events {{in the form of the}} 18 Fructidor coup of general Pierre Augereau intervened. This brought the more radical faction to power in France, which proved to be ultimately less patient with the vagaries of the Dutch political process, and more prone to intervene. Elections for a second National Assembly returned one in which the balance of power had shifted to the unitarists in the Fall of 1797. Nevertheless, the federalists managed to retain control of the new constitutional commission by a bare majority. This led to more dawdling and the unitarists in the Assembly now came with their own proposal in the form of the Declaration of 43 on 12 December 1797, containing a nine-point manifesto concerning the minimum conditions to which the new constitution should conform.|$|E
