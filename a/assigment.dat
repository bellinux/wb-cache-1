This {{research}} is {{that aims to}} know comparation of giving structured <b>assigment</b> with emendation feedback and feedback without emendation towards result of physics learning of the students class X SMAN I Sungguminasa Gowa Regency. The research design is Solomon Four-Group design adaptation. The independentt variable of this research are structured <b>assigment</b> with emendation feedback methods and structured <b>assigment</b> with feedback without emendation methods, whereas the dependent variable a results of physics learning of the students. The popukation in this {{research is}} all of students at 9 clasess of X SMAN I Sungguminasa in academic year 2013 / 2014, meanwhile the sample is class X 2 SMAN I Sungguminasa as a experiment class with 32 students and class X 3 SMAN I Sungguminasa as control class with 32 students. Analysis of inferential statistics, t-count for result of physics learning = 11, 684 with t-table = 1, 99 were obtained at significance level α = 0, 05. The result indicate t-count > t-table {{and it can be}} concluded that there significant difference result of physics learning between students who taugh by structured <b>assigment</b> with emendation feedback methods and who taugh by structured <b>assigment</b> with feedbeck without emendation methods.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{short term storage}} systems. We analyze presorting strategies to improve the effiency of these storage systems. The presorting task is called Batch PreSorting Problem (BPSP). The BPSP is a variation of an <b>assigment</b> problem, i. e., it has an <b>assigment</b> problem kernel and some additional constraints. We present different types of these presorting problems, introduce mathematical programming formulations and prove the NP-completeness for one type of the BPSP. Experiments are carried out in order to compare the different model formulations and to investigate the behavior of these models...|$|E
40|$|The {{intention}} solution {{determination of}} maximum matching at this graph bipartit {{is to determine}} maximum result at <b>assigment</b> problem which formed in graph bipartit tagg is later searched by maximum matching of him, and also finish the of <b>assigment</b> problem without the altering of {{in the form of}} graph beforehand and compare result of him. In solution of this problem, calculation at graph bipartit to determine maximum matching of him use method of augmenting path and <b>assigment</b> problem using method of hungarian, and also comparison both of method. Maximum Matching can be found by using method of augmenting path with step look for free dots at graph bipartit, then from free dots with lable most is maximum formed by augmenting path, seeking of maximum matching desisting is otherwise found again aughmenting path which is respech to matching. As for example of applying of maximum matching at graph bipartit tagg that is to finish the <b>assigment</b> problem. Method of Hungarian can be used to solve assignation problem through step initially that is formed in the form of matrix, and to test the him of by using technique mark with lines cover zero that is made plump line or level off to close all zero but with many possible minimum lineses. If many lines of close zero equal to n (matrix measure are n x n) hence tables have optimal. Result of solving of assignation problem with method of augmenting path and method of hungarian have is same maximum result...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} supervisory actions (leadership and mentoring, working conditons and work <b>assigments)</b> on job satisfaction and turnover intentions of junior accountants. Following study by Sweneey and Boyle on Irish in 2005, junior accountants working in public accounting firms in Central Java and Yogyakarta was chosen as object of this research. Data was collected using questionnaires in 2007. Data was analyzed using Structural Equation Model (SEM) with the program VisualPLS (Partial Least Square) software. Findings of this research indicated that from seven hypothesis proposed, {{there is no one}} was accepted. Hypothesis 1 (there ware positive influence of leadership and mentoring on job satisfaction) hypothesis 2 (there ware negative influence of leadership and mentoring on turnover intentions), hypothesis 3 (there ware positive influence of working conditons on job satisfaction), hypothesis 4 (there ware negative influence of working conditons on turnover intentions), hypothesis 5 (there ware positive influence of work <b>assigments</b> on job satisfaction), hypothesis 6 (there ware negative influence of work <b>assigments</b> on turnover intentions) and hypothesis 7 (there ware negative influence of job satisfaction on turnover intentions) ware rejected. This research also indicated that supervisory actions had no direct effect on turnover intentions and had direct effect on job satisfaction.

40|$|A {{language}} model based on word-category n-grams and ambiguous category membership with n increased selectively to trade compactness for performance is presented. The use of categories leads intrinsically to a compact model {{with the ability}} to generalise to unseen word sequences, and diminishes the spareseness of the training data, thereby making larger n feasible. The {{language model}} implicitly involves a statistical tagging operation, which may be used explicitly to assign category <b>assigments</b> to untagged text. Experiments on the LOB corpus show the optimal model-building strategy to yield improved results with respect to conventional n-gram methods, and when used as a tagger, the model is seen to perform well in relation to a standard benchmark...|$|R

This technique is a very effective tool for introducing students to a variety of reading skills, for creating an awareness of language complexity, {{while at the same time}} getting them personally involved in the reading passage at hand. For the teacher, this technique is a readily available guide to exploita-tion of ad hoc reading <b>assigments,</b> such as an article from one day's newspaper or a passage a student has just written. It also allows teachers to objectively evaluate "reading skills " textbooks, many of which are, in fact, "reading task " textbooks. However, this particular technique is not a panacea for every level of reading nor is it an exhaustive list of all skills, tasks, or question types. Some theoretical considerations For the purposes of this article, we will consider the three reading skills of "scanning, " "skimming, " and "reading for deeper comprehension"...|$|R

A survey examined professors' hours spent in job-related work each week, tasks they committed their time to, tasks they felt they should commit more time to, and insights they reported about their experience of being professors. An analysis of their responses indicated that new professors spend {{only a portion of}} their time on research, scholarship, the potentially supportive work of personal professional developmerc, and that they would choose to spend considerably more time at those activities. The data suggest that those who are already working more hours per week than the average are not committing more time to research and scholarship. Despite their desire to apply themselves to scholarly pursuits and research, new professors find that they canot control the time they spend at work and that their choices are limited by administrative expectations and <b>assigments.</b> The conclusions suggest that exercising choice in an academic career is an important dimension of that work, but choices are not unlimited.
