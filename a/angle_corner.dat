A slot is cut into {{each end of the}} weight so as to enable the weight to straddle, and be laterally secured by, the arbor rods. In order to facilitate removal of weights with angle cuts, it is customary to stack the weights in alternating orientations so that the square corners of any weight will be aligned with the <b>angled</b> <b>corners</b> of adjacent weights. This simplifies removal because the square corners of each weight protrude beyond the <b>angled</b> <b>corners</b> of the weight below, serving as handles that can be easily gripped, even with gloved hands.|$|R

40|$|We {{exploit the}} common {{constraint}} {{of having a}} right <b>angle</b> <b>corner</b> of two rectangular planes in the scene in order to calibrate a perspective projection camera and compute its pose relative to the coordinate system defined by the corner.

We then reproject {{the image of the}} corner to an arbitrary viewpoint. We can also compute the metric properties of the scene up to scale. We report experimental results with subjectively acceptable quality. The approach shows the power of exploiting constraints that are abundant in typical architectural scenes. 1 Introduction The generation of synthetic images in such areas as computer graphics has traditionally been based on the explicit construction of artificial 3 D models and texture rendering.

The current study extends on this line of research, investigating whether systematic deviations are also observed {{in the formation of}} haptic spatial representations of object-to-object relations.

Three magnets were positioned to form corners of an isosceles triangle and the task of the participant was to reproduce the right <b>angle</b> <b>corner.</b> Weobserved systematic deviations in the reproduction of the right angle triangle. The systematic deviations were not observed when the task was conducted on the mid-sagittal plane. Furthermore, the magnitude of the deviation was decreased when non-informative vision was introduced. These results suggest that there is a deformation in spatial representation of object-to-object relations formed using haptics. However, as no systematic deviation was observed when the task was conducted on the mid-saggital plane, we suggest that the {{perception of}} object-to-object relations use a different egocentric reference frame to the perception of orientation...|$|E

40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{studies of}} complete, first-order and critical wedge filling transitions, at a right <b>angle</b> <b>corner,</b> using a microscopic fundamental measure density functional theory. We consider systems with short-ranged, cut-off Lennard-Jones, fluid-fluid forces and {{two types of}} wall-fluid potential: a purely repulsive hard wall and also a long-ranged potential with three different strengths. For each of these systems we first determine the wetting properties occurring at a planar wall including any wetting transition and the dependence of the contact angle on temperature. The hard wall corner is completely filled by vapour on approaching bulk coexistence and the numerical results {{for the growth of}} the meniscus thickness are in excellent agreement with effective Hamiltonian predictions for the critical exponents and amplitudes, at leading and next-to-leading order. In the presence of the attractive wall-fluid interaction, the corresponding planar wall-fluid interface exhibits a first-order wetting transition for each of the interaction strengths considered. In the right angle wedge geometry the two strongest interactions produce first-order filling transitions while for the weakest interaction strength, for which wetting and filling occur closest to the bulk critical point, the filling transition is second-order. For this continuous transition the critical exponent describing the divergence of the meniscus thickness is found to be in good agreement with effective Hamiltonian predictions...|$|E
40|$|High {{aspect ratio}} {{three-dimensional}} nanostructures are of tremendous interest {{to a wide}} range of fields such as photonics, plasmonics, fluid mechanics, and biology. Recent developments in capillary force lithography (CFL) have focused on taking advantage of the formation of menisci to enhance the functionality of small size-scale structures. In this study, simulations of the three-dimensional shapes of equilibrium menisci formed in capillaries with various cross-section geometries are studied. The capillary cross sections include regular polygons and equilateral star-shapes with sharp and rounded corners. The characteristic dimension of the physical lithography systems which are simulated is on the order of 100 nm. At such size-scale, surface-tension-effects are predominant, and as a consequence, our simulations demonstrate that nanometer-sized structures with great application potentials can be fabricated. Specifically, this study demonstrates that surfaces with three-dimensional nanoscale structures can be fabricated from templates with micron or sub-micron features through the development of cusps in the corners of the polygonal capillaries. Quantitatively, the effects of contact <b>angle,</b> <b>corner</b> angle, meniscus confinement, and corner rounding radius are examined and scaling analyses are presented to describe the dependencies of the height variation across the meniscus on these parameters. These simulations serve as useful guides for extending the development and implementation of capillary force lithography. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{flat head}} and a tape {{transport}} arrangement impart a wrap angle to the tape at the upstream corner of the head. The wrap <b>angle,</b> <b>corner</b> sharpness and tape stiffness are sufficient to cause a moving tape to form a hollow bump at the upstream corner, thereby creating a hollow into which entrained air can expand, causing a subambient pressure within and downstream of the bump. This pressure keeps the tape {{in contact with the}} head. It is created without the need for a groove or complex pressure relief slot(s). No contact pressure arises at the signal exchange site due to media wrap. The highest contact pressures are developed at a wrapped upstream corner. For a tape drive, traveling in both forward and reverse, the wrap can be at both the upstream and downstream (which is the reverse upstream) corners. Heads that are not flat can also be used, if the wrap angle relative to a main surface is sufficient and not too large. The wrapped head can also be used with rotating media, such as disks (floppy and hard) and rotating heads, such as helical wound heads for video recording. Multiple flat tape bearing surfaces can be separated by grooves and/or angles. Each flat can carry heads along one or more gap lines. Multiple adjacent narrow tracks can thus be written for extreme high track density recording...|$|E
