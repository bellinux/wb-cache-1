25|$|The {{success of}} a play, {{especially}} one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side. One may fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened that was always securely shut until then. For myself, the experience was invigorating. It {{made it possible to}} dream of daring more and risking more. The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons <b>and</b> <b>gasped</b> when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invented a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.|$|E
500|$|... and Keyes Metcalf, Director of University Libraries from 1937 to 1955, {{wrote that}} {{early in his}} tenure a Classics {{professor}} [...] "rushed into my office, looking {{as if he were}} about to have an apoplectic stroke, <b>and</b> <b>gasped,</b> 'I've just been in the reading room, and there is a Radcliffe girl in there! By then female graduate students were permitted to enter the stacks, but only until 5p.m., [...] "after which time it was thought they would not be safe there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On one account, {{moments before}} his death, Beethoven was laying upon bed, pale and suffering, {{when a man}} entered. It was fellow {{composer}} Johann Nepomuk Hummel, who was Beethoven's old and only friend, {{and one of his}} contemporaries. Hummel, who had heard of Beethoven's illness, came to him with succor and money. But it was too late; Beethoven was speechless, and a grateful smile was all that he had to bestow upon his friend. Hummel bent toward him, and, by the aid of an acoustic instrument, enabled Beethoven to hear a few words of his compassion and regret. Beethoven seemed reanimated, his eyes shone, he struggled for utterance, <b>and</b> <b>gasped,</b> [...] "Is it not true, Hummel, that I have some talent after all?". After these words, his eyes grew fixed, his mouth fell open, and he passed away.|$|E

40|$|The {{transporting}} {{function of}} many branched tubular networks like our lungs and circulatory system {{depend on the}} sizes and shapes of their branches. Understanding the mechanisms of tube size control during organ development may offer new insights {{into a variety of}} human pathologies associated with stenoses or cystic dilations in tubular organs. Here, we present the first secreted luminal proteins involved in tube diametric expansion in the Drosophila airways. obst-A <b>and</b> <b>gasp</b> are conserved among insect species and encode secreted proteins with chitin binding domains. We show that the widely used tracheal marker 2 A 12, recognizes the Gasp protein. Analysis of obst-A <b>and</b> <b>gasp</b> single mutants <b>and</b> obst-A; <b>gasp</b> double mutant shows that both genes are primarily required for airway tube dilation. Similarly, Obst-A <b>and</b> <b>Gasp</b> control epidermal cuticle integrity and larval growth. The assembly of the apical chitinous matrix of the airway tubes is defective in <b>gasp</b> <b>and</b> obst-A mutants. The defects become exaggerated in double mutants indicating that the genes have partially redundant functions in chitin structure modification. The phenotypes in luminal chitin assembly in the airway tubes are accompanied by a corresponding reduction in tube diameter in the mutants. Conversely, overexpression of Obst-A <b>and</b> <b>Gasp</b> causes irregular tube expansion and interferes with tube maturation. Our results suggest that the luminal levels of matrix binding proteins determine the extent of diametric growth. We propose that Obst-A <b>and</b> <b>Gasp</b> organize luminal matrix assembly, which in turn controls the apical shapes of adjacent cells during tube diameter expansion...|$|R

60|$|After some minutes had thus passed, {{her father}} appeared, {{and would have}} gone on without seeing her, but she {{detained}} him by an imploring cry <b>and</b> <b>gasp,</b> <b>and</b> entreated to hear what had happened.|$|R
60|$|The {{two girls}} read and were awestruck; Jane opening her mouth <b>and</b> <b>gasping,</b> Gertrude closing hers and looking very serious.|$|R
