25|$|The {{approximately}} 50 {{miles of}} coast <b>assaulted</b> <b>by</b> the Eastern Task force {{was divided into}} 3 sectors – A, B, and C (Apple, Beer, and Charlie). In the last hour of 7 November, the landing craft were launched from their parent ships, in a moderate swell, a new moon and a westward current of about 4 knots. Running west to east beginning just east of Castiglione were Apple Green and Apple White, <b>assaulted</b> <b>by</b> 11 Brigade, British 78th Infantry Division. Just east of Cape Sidi Ferruch was Beer Green, <b>assaulted</b> <b>by</b> No. 1 Commando, and Beer White <b>assaulted</b> <b>by</b> 168 Regt., US 34th Infantry Division. US Navy transports were in the majority at Charlie Beach {{to the east of}} Algiers, and it is likely that no LCAs were employed there during the initial landings.|$|R

5|$|Near {{the town}} of Bazeilles, the Engineers and assault {{infantry}} had gathered to prepare the boats for the crossing of the Meuse at Wadelincourt when an artillery barrage from the French positions destroyed 81 out of 96 rubber boats. The plan of attack had included an <b>assault</b> <b>by</b> both the 69th and 89th Infantry Regiments, but the loss of so many boats meant that only the 86th Infantry Regiment was able to conduct the crossing. The 69th Infantry Regiment was kept in reserve to follow the 86th as reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate {{high command}} {{were unable to}} {{anticipate}} Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed {{him to make a}} prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an <b>assault</b> <b>by</b> 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.|$|E
