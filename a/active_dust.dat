40|$|To date, the {{radiative}} {{impact of}} dust and the Sahar an air layer (SAL) on North Atlantic hurricane activity is not yet known. According to previous studies, dust stabilizes the atmosphere due to absorption of solar radiation but thus shifts convection to regions more conducive for hurricane genesis. Here we analyze differences in hurricane genesis and frequency from ensemble sensitivity simulations with radiatively active and inactive dust in the aerosol-climate model ECHAM 6 -HAM. We investigate dust burden and other hurricane-related variables and determine their influence on disturbances which develop into hurricanes (developing disturbances, DDs) and those which do not (nondeveloping disturbances, NDDs). Dust and the SAL are found to potentially have both inhibiting and supporting influences on background conditions for hurricane genesis. A slight southward shift of DDs is determined when dust is active {{as well as a}} significant warming of the SAL, which leads to a strengthening of the vertical circulation associated with the SAL. The dust burden of DDs is smaller in <b>active</b> <b>dust</b> simulations compared to DDs in simulations with inactive dust, while NDDs contain more dust in <b>active</b> <b>dust</b> simulations. However, no significant influence of radiatively <b>active</b> <b>dust</b> on other variables in DDs and NDDs is found.

Most studies have analyzed floor or mattress dust endotoxin, but its validity {{as a proxy for}} airborne exposure is unknown, while <b>active</b> airborne <b>dust</b> sampling is not feasible in large-scale population studies because of logistic and financial limitations. We therefore developed and evaluated a simple passive airborne dust collection method for airborne endotoxin exposure assessment. We explored an electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC), consisting of a 42 - by 29. 6 -cm-sized folder with four electrostatic cloths exposed to the air. The EDC was tested during two 14 -day periods in seven nonfarm and nine farm homes and in farm stables. In parallel, <b>active</b> airborne <b>dust</b> sampling was performed with Harvard impactors and floor dust collected by vacuuming, using nylon sampling socks. The endotoxin levels could be measured in all EDC cloth extracts. The levels (in EU/m 2) between EDCs used simultaneously or in different sampling periods in the same home correlated strongly (r > 0. 8). EDC endotoxin also correlated moderately to strongly (r = 0. 6 to 0. 8) with the endotoxin measured by <b>active</b> airborne <b>dust</b> sampling and living room floor dust sampling and—in farm homes—with the endotoxin captured by the EDC in stables. In contrast, endotoxin levels measured by floor dust sampling showed only a poor correlation with the levels measured by <b>active</b> airborne <b>dust</b> sampling. We therefore conclude that measuring endotoxin levels with the EDC is a valid measure of average airborne endotoxin exposure, while reproducibility over time is at least equivalent to that of reservoir dust analyses...|$|R

The dust has a volcanogenic origin of basaltic composition with about 10 % Fe content. We used two independent methods to quantify dust emission from Iceland and dust deposition at sea. Firstly, the aerial extent (map) of deposition on land was extended to ocean areas around Iceland. Secondly, surveys {{of the number of}} dust events over the past decades and calculations of emissions and sea deposition for the dust storms were made. The results show that total emissions range from 30. 5 (dust-event-based calculation) to 40. 1 million t yr − 1 (map calculation), which places Iceland among the most <b>active</b> <b>dust</b> sources on Earth. Ocean deposition ranges between 5. 5 (dust event calculations) and 13. 8 million tons (map calculation).

40|$|A dust {{transport}} scheme {{has been}} developed for a general circulation model of the Martian atmosphere. This enables radiatively <b>active</b> <b>dust</b> transport, with the atmospheric state responding {{to changes in the}} dust distribution via atmospheric heating, as well as dust transport being determined by atmospheric conditions. The scheme includes dust lifting, advection by model winds, atmospheric mixing, and gravitational sedimentation. Parameterizations of lifting initiated by (1) near-surface wind stress and (2) convective vortices known as dust devils are considered. Two parameterizations are defined for each mechanism and are first investigated offline using data previously output from the non-dust-transporting model. The threshold-insensitive parameterizations predict some lifting over most regions, varying smoothly in space and time. The threshold-sensitive parameterizations predict lifting only during extreme atmospheric conditions (such as exceptionally strong winds), so lifting is rarer and more confined to specific regions and times. Wind stress lifting is predicted to peak during southern summer, largely between latitudes 15 ° and 35 °S, with maxima also in regions of strong slope winds or thermal contrast flows. These areas are consistent with observed storm onset regions and dark streak surface features. Dust devil lifting is also predicted to peak during southern summer, with a moderate peak during northern summer. The greatest dust devil lifting occurs in early afternoon, particularly in the Noachis, Arcadia/Amazonis, Sirenum, and Thaumasia regions.

40|$|A general {{circulation}} model {{is used to}} evaluate changes to the circulation and dust transport in the martian atmosphere {{for a range of}} past orbital conditions. A dust transport scheme, including parameterized dust lifting, is incorporated within the model to enable passive or radiatively <b>active</b> <b>dust</b> transport. The focus is on changes which relate to surface features, as these may potentially be verified by observations. Obliquity variations have the largest impact, as they affect the latitudinal distribution of solar heating. At low obliquities permanent CO 2 ice caps form at both poles, lowering mean surface pressures. At higher obliquities, solar insolation peaks at higher summer latitudes near solstice, producing a stronger, broader meridional circulation and a larger seasonal CO 2 ice cap in winter. Near-surface winds associated with the main meridional circulation intensify and extend polewards, with changes in cap edge position also affecting the flow. Hence the model predicts significant changes in surface wind directions as well as magnitudes. Dust lifting by wind stress increases with obliquity as the meridional circulation and associated near-surface winds strengthen. If <b>active</b> <b>dust</b> transport is used, then lifting rates increase further in response to the larger atmospheric dust opacities (hence circulation) produced. Dust lifting by dust devils increases more gradually with obliquity, having a weaker link to the meridional circulation. The primary effect of varying eccentricity is to change the impact of varying the areocentric longitude of perihelion, l, which determines when the solar forcing is strongest. The atmospheric circulation is stronger when l aligns with solstice rather than equinox, and there is also a bias from the martian topography, resulting in the strongest circulations when perihelion is at northern winter solstice. Net dust accumulation depends on both lifting and deposition. Dust which has been well mixed within the atmosphere is deposited preferentially over high topography. For wind stress lifting, the combination produces peak net removal within western boundary currents and southern midlatitude bands, and net accumulation concentrated in Arabia and Tharsis. In <b>active</b> <b>dust</b> transport experiments, dust is also scoured from northern midlatitudes during winter, further confining peak accumulation to equatorial regions. As obliquity increases, polar accumulation rates increase for wind stress lifting and are largest for high eccentricities when perihelion occurs during northern winter. For dust devil lifting, polar accumulation rates increase (though less rapidly) with obliquity above o = 25 °, but increase with decreasing obliquity below this, thus polar dust accumulation at low obliquities may be increasingly due to dust lifted by dust devils. For all cases discussed, the pole receiving most dust shifts from north to south as obliquity is increased. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

Therefore, we present a detailed energy budget analysis for the surface of a model comet in the orbit of P/Wirtanen, target comet of the European spacecraft mission Rosetta, for a variety of parameters and assumptions. We will show that for a fast spinning Jupiter-family comet like P/Wirtanen with a rotation period of about 6 hours a fast rotator approximation unterestimates the effective energy input. This yields to lower gas fluxes from the surface. For an <b>active,</b> not <b>dust</b> covered surface we obtain a water gas flux on the order of about 2 + 10 _ 28 molecules s_- 1.

The DTS described here was subject to performance tests at the Heidelberg dust accelerator {{at the same time as}} the recording of impact signals from potential collector materials. The tests with dust particles in the speed range from 3 to 40 km/s demonstrate that trajectories can be measured with accuracies of ∼ 1 ° in direction and ∼ 1...|$|R
40|$|Comets often display narrow dust jets {{but more}} diffuse gas comae when their {{eccentric}} orbits {{bring them into}} {{the inner solar system}} and sunlight sublimates the ice on the nucleus. Comets are also understood to have one or more active areas covering {{only a fraction of the}} total surface active with sublimating volatile ices. Calculations of the gas and dust distribution from a small active area on a comet’s nucleus show that as the gas moves out radially into the vacuum of space it expands tangentially, filling much of the hemisphere centered on the <b>active</b> region. The <b>dust</b> dragged by the gas remains more concentrated over the active area. This explains some puzzling appearances of comets having collimated dust jets but more diffuse gaseous atmospheres. Our test case is 67 P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, the Rosetta mission target comet, whose activity is dominated by a single area covering only 4...|$|R
