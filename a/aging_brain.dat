25|$|Age is a {{major risk}} factor for most common {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease. While much {{research has focused on}} diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the <b>aging</b> <b>brain</b> (usually spelled ageing brain in British English) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults. However, research does suggest that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the brain as well as a host of neurocognitive changes. Recent reports in model organisms suggest that as organisms age, there are distinct changes in the expression of genes at the single neuron level. This page is devoted to reviewing the changes associated with healthy aging.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 Denise Cai in Alcino Silva's laboratory, led {{a team of}} {{scientists}} at UCLA and UCSD that discovered that mechanisms of memory allocation can be used to link memories across time. They showed that one memory triggers the activation of CREB and subsequent enhancements in excitability in a subset of neurons of a neuronetwork, so that a subsequent memory, even many hours later, can be directed or allocated to some of the same neurons that encoded the first memory. Later on, recall of the first memory triggers the activation of those neurons and therefore the reactivation and retrieval of the second memory. These results represent the first molecular, cellular and circuit mechanism underlying the linking of memories across time. These authors also showed that memory linking mechanisms are affected in the <b>aging</b> <b>brain,</b> and that manipulating excitability in a subset of neurons reverses these deficits. Impairments in CREB and neuronal excitability in aging likely underlie these abnormalities in memory linking. It is possible that problems with memory linking may underlie well-known source memory problems (source amnesia) associated with aging.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam, {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes {{impairments}} in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Nitrazepam {{has been found to}} be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day. Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthric, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only nitrazepam and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. CNS depression occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5mg of nitrazepam. Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights' use of nitrazepam, but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of nitrazepam. The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to nitrazepam due to increased sensitivity of the <b>aging</b> <b>brain</b> to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic nitrazepam administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of nitrazepam may last up to 60 hours after administration.|$|E

40|$|The brain {{changes as}} we age and these changes are {{associated}} with functional deterioration and neurodegenerative disease. It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the <b>brain</b> <b>ageing</b> process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of <b>brain</b> <b>ageing</b> have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ as a biomarker of an individual's brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts <b>brain</b> <b>age.</b> Importantly, recent evidence shows that having an ‘older’-appearing brain relates to advanced physiological and cognitive ageing {{and the risk of}} mortality. We discuss controversies surrounding <b>brain</b> <b>age</b> and highlight emerging trends {{such as the use of}} multimodality neuroimaging and the employment of ‘deep learning’ methods. <b>Brain</b> <b>age</b> can be predicted in individuals based on neuroimaging data using machine learning approaches to model trajectories of healthy <b>brain</b> <b>ageing.</b> The predicted <b>brain</b> <b>age</b> for a new individual can differ from his or her chronological age; this difference appears to reflect advanced or delayed <b>brain</b> <b>ageing.</b> <b>Brain</b> <b>age</b> has been shown to relate to cognitive ageing and multiple aspects of physiological ageing and to predict the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and mortality in older adults.

Expression of nNOS mRNA was lower while iNOS was absent at any age. However, total NO synthesis increased in aged cerebral cortex and cerebellum {{as a consequence of}} changes of nNOS phosphorylation state. The question arise how aging influences activity and expression of eNOS in different parts of adult and <b>aged</b> <b>brain.</b> The levels of eNOS mRNA, protein and activity were measured using RT-PCR, immuno- and radiochemical methods, respectively. Our studies indicated that after inhibition of nNOS with 7 -nitroindazole (7 -NI) NO synthesis is lower in all parts of <b>aged</b> <b>brain</b> comparing to adults. However, eNOS activity significantly decreases only in cerebellum. The expression of eNOS determined on mRNA level was enhanced in all investigated <b>aged</b> <b>brain</b> parts to 140 - 190 % of adult value and the data were statistically significant for cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The higher level of mRNA is probably the adaptive response to lower NOS activity. However, the Western-blot signal of eNOS protein was unchanged in <b>aged</b> <b>brain</b> parts comparing to adults suggesting age-related disturbances of protein synthesis and its function.

50|$|It {{has become}} clear that aging {{negatively}} affects brain function and this can encompass a decrease in locomotor activities and coordination as well as affect {{in a negative way}} learning and memory. Certain responses to stress within the hippocampus can have negative effects on learning. In a study done by Mark A. Smith, it is demonstrated that exposure to continuous stress can cause age-related issues to the hippocampus. What then becomes more noticeable is that the <b>aging</b> <b>brain</b> is not as able to recognize growth, this is a symptom of hippocampal damage. If the information is not being encoded properly in the brain then of course there would not be good memory retention without the consideration of outside implications. However, the consideration of anxiety, memory and overall function must be compromised. An emotional memory is capable of being embedded and then reused in a similar scenario at a later time if need be. Also noted within a study relating to age and anxiety and memory it was noted that lesions on the brain can affect spatial learning as well as sex presenting at a disadvantage. Dysfunction within the hippocampus can be a reason behind <b>aging</b> <b>brain</b> changes among the elderly. To sum up anxiety and memory and aging, it is useful to recognize a correlation between what anxiety can cause the body to do and how memories are then formed or not formed, and how the <b>aging</b> <b>brain</b> has enough difficulty on its own trying to perform recall tasks.|$|E

30|$|While age-dependent {{genes for}} each cell subtype {{did not share}} similar age-dependency {{in the other two}} cell types or brain tissues or cultured NSC/NPCs, GO {{analysis}} strongly indicated that all aged cell subtypes showed reduced “cell cycle” gene expression.

5000|$|The {{likelihood}} that proteopathy will develop is increased by certain risk factors that promote the self-assembly of a protein.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} the mechanisms underlying <b>brain</b> <b>aging</b> is fundamental to understand its functional decline and the baseline upon which brain pathologies superimpose. Endogenous protective mechanisms must contribute to the adaptability and plasticity still present in the healthy <b>aged</b> <b>brain.</b> Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) {{is one of the}} few genes with a consistent and evolutionarily conserved up-regulation in the <b>aged</b> <b>brain.</b> ApoD protecting roles upon stress or injury are well known, but a study of the effects of ApoD expression in the normal aging process is still missing. Using an ApoD-knockout mouse we analyze the effects of ApoD on factors contributing to the functional maintenance of the <b>aged</b> <b>brain.</b> We focused our cellular and molecular analyses in the cortex and hippocampus at an age representing the onset of senescence where mortality risks are below 25 %, avoiding bias towards long-lived animals. Lack of ApoD causes a prematurely <b>aged</b> <b>brain</b> without altering lifespan. Age-dependent hyperkinesia and memory deficits are accompanied by differential molecular effects in the cortex and hippocampus. Transcriptome analyses reveal distinct effects of ApoD loss on the molecular age-dependent patterns of the cortex and hippocampus, with different cell-type contributions to age-regulated gene expression. Markers of glial reactivity, proteostasis, and oxidative and inflammatory damage reveal early signs of <b>aging</b> and enhanced <b>brain</b> deterioration in the ApoD-knockout brain. The lack of ApoD results in an age-enhanced significant reduction in neuronal calcium-dependent functionality markers and signs of early reduction of neuronal numbers in the cortex, thus impinging upon parameters clearly differentiating neurodegenerative conditions from healthy <b>brain</b> <b>aging.</b> Our data support the hypothesis that the physiological increased brain expression of ApoD represents a homeostatic anti-aging mechanism.

40|$|Impaired {{function}} of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) in aged animals is associated with increased susceptibility to the development of many neurodegenerative diseases. Age-related functional deterioration in brain is consistent with the free radical theory of aging that predicts, among other things, that free radical reactions with and damage to biomolecules, such as proteins and membrane lipid bilayers, leads to loss of neurons and subsequently diminished cognition. These oxidatively modified biomolecules are believed to contribute to the decreased antioxidant content, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired plasticity in <b>aged</b> <b>brains.</b> Treatment of rodents with L-acetylcarnitine (LAC; �-trimethyl-�-acetylbutyrobetaine) can improve these functional losses.
