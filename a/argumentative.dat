5|$|Niklausse and Van Tricasse {{climb up}} the clock tower to survey the troops. They are at first <b>argumentative,</b> then calm down and help {{each other in the}} clean air at the top. They agree they must stop the war but, once they reach the {{polluted}} air, they argue again in their urgency to get to war.|$|E
5|$|The {{first house}} on the site was built as a hunting lodge in 1717 for the Duke of Schomberg, a British army {{commander}} of German origin. He {{is said to have}} been very <b>argumentative,</b> to the point where he would argue with all those around him bar the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Back at the office, {{the staff}} have drunk {{multiple}} cups of espresso and experience a caffeine rush {{along with a}} powerful surge in office productivity. As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly irritable and <b>argumentative,</b> frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath, and try to relocate the copy machine. At five o'clock everybody leaves the office in total disarray. When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia, they are bewildered by the sight they encounter.|$|E
5|$|Robert Morse (Danny Webb) is loud, <b>argumentative,</b> {{cynical and}} Golic's only friend. Golic, {{who has been}} {{restrained}} in the infirmary since the deaths of Boggs and Rains, convinces Morse to free him; he subdues Morse, and releases the creature. After Dillon's death, Morse helps Ripley reach {{the top of the}} furnace so she can kill the Alien Queen and then herself by deliberately falling into the vat of molten lead. At {{the end of the film}} he is led away by Weyland-Yutani personnel, the only surviving resident of Fury 161.|$|E
5|$|Louise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her {{household}} {{to move from}} Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid {{in the wake of}} the Prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull. Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged mourning. For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and <b>argumentative.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} hereditary privilege, {{but also the}} rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric {{as well as his}} argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its <b>argumentative</b> force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had never}} {{finished}} high school, {{with the help of}} the GI Bill, Rothenberg completed a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1954. He attended graduate school at the University of Chicago, where he was recognized as an <b>argumentative,</b> sometimes abrasive, graduate student with a keen mind. As a graduate student, Rothenberg reviewed W.E.D. Allens Caucasian Battlefields: A History of the Wars on the Turco-Caucasian Border, 1828–1921 (Cambridge University Press, 1953) for Journal of Modern History, He wrote his 1956 masters' thesis entitled General Crook and the Apaches, 1871–1874: the campaign in the Tonto Basin. Rothenberg received his doctorate from the University of Illinois: his 1959 dissertation, Antemurales Christianitatis: then military border in Croatia, 1522–1749, was published in 1960 by the University of Chicago Press, as The Military Border in Croatia, 1522–1749; he followed this with a second study, The Military Border in Croatia, 1750–1888: a study of an imperial institution in 1966, also published by University of Chicago Press. Both volumes were translated into German in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{will choose}} their {{strategy}} for expressing dissent {{based on the}} strength of their arguments. Kassing and Avtgis (1999) found an individual who is more <b>argumentative</b> and less verbally aggressive is prone to use articulated dissent. On the other hand, an individual who lacks <b>argumentative</b> skills will resort to using a less direct and more aggressive strategy, latent dissent.|$|E

25|$|Christgau {{has been}} long, albeit <b>argumentative,</b> friends with critics such as Dave Marsh, Greil Marcus, and Ellen Willis, whom he dated from 1966 to 1969. He has also mentored younger critics such as Ann Powers and Chuck Eddy.|$|E
25|$|Flexibility: A {{measure of}} {{behaviors}} related to compromise and cooperation.

25|$|In March 1967, Orton and Halliwell had {{intended}} another extended holiday in Libya, but they returned home after one day {{because the only}} hotel accommodation they could find was a boat that had {{been converted into a}} hotel/nightclub. Orton was working hard, energised and happy; Halliwell was increasingly depressed, <b>argumentative,</b> and plagued with mystery ailments.|$|E
25|$|Macarthur was an <b>argumentative</b> man who quarrelled {{with many}} of his {{neighbours}} and successive Governors. He {{was involved in a}} campaign alleging that Governor Hunter was ineffective and trafficked in rum. The allegations led to Hunter being forced to answer the charges and contributed to Hunter being recalled to England where he fought to restore his reputation.|$|E
25|$|Rhemes, dicisigns, and arguments. Every sign is {{interpreted}} either as (rheme) term-like, standing for its object {{in respect of}} quality, or as (dicisign) proposition-like, standing for its object in respect of fact, or as (argument) <b>argumentative,</b> standing for its object in respect of habit or law. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks of inference.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly, Haarmann's {{father had}} married his mother (who {{was seven years}} his senior) on account of her wealth. Haarmann Sr. {{was known to be}} an <b>argumentative,</b> short-tempered {{individual}} who conducted several affairs throughout the duration of his marriage. From his early childhood, Fritz developed a bitter hatred and rivalry towards his father, which would continue until his father's death in 1921.|$|E
25|$|By 1923, Oskar Horney's firm went broke, and Oskar {{developed}} meningitis soon after. Oskar rapidly became embittered, morose and <b>argumentative.</b> It {{was also}} in 1923 that Karen's brother died of a pulmonary infection. Both these events contributed to a worsening of Karen's mental health. She entered into a second period of deep depression; she swam out to sea during a vacation and considered committing suicide.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Professor Athar Maqsood of School of Business of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), {{set forward}} his <b>argumentative</b> thesis {{that there are}} two reasons behind why the {{privatization}} has not been successful as was originally perceived are economic reasons and socio-psychological and political reasons. In the 1990s, the privatized enterprises have laid off employees by introducing schemes like golden hand shake.|$|E
25|$|In March 1930 Wingate {{was given}} command {{of a company}} of 300 {{soldiers}} with the local rank of bimbashi (major). He was never happier than when in the bush with his unit, but when at HQ in Khartoum he antagonised the other officers with his aggressive and <b>argumentative</b> personality. He was granted the local rank of captain in the regular army on 16 April 1930.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} in an uproar over {{political}} and religious controversies, and the competitive system where professors were dependent on attracting student fees for income meant that the university was riven with <b>argumentative</b> feuds and conflicts. The monopoly held by established medical professors was challenged by private independent schools, with new ideas of teaching by dissecting corpses giving clandestine trade to bodysnatchers (just shortly before the Burke and Hare scandal).|$|E
25|$|In current {{secondary}} education, the Battle of the Somme {{is barely}} mentioned in German school curricula, while it features {{prominently in the}} United Kingdom. In many British schools, variations of the question Does Haig deserve to be called 'The Butcher Of The Somme'? (Year 9) or To what extent can Sir Douglas Haig be considered either a butcher or a hero of the First World War? (GCSE) are used to teach pupils historical empathy, evaluation and <b>argumentative</b> writing skills.|$|E
25|$|Eleanor's {{marriage}} to Henry was {{reputed to be}} tumultuous and <b>argumentative,</b> although sufficiently cooperative to produce at least eight pregnancies. Henry {{was by no means}} faithful to his wife and had a reputation for philandering. Henry fathered other, illegitimate children throughout the marriage. Eleanor appears to have taken an ambivalent attitude towards these affairs. Geoffrey of York, for example, was an illegitimate son of Henry, but acknowledged by Henry as his child and raised at Westminster in the care of the queen.|$|E
25|$|After the Second World War, the Polish Communist state (established in 1948) forcefully {{promoted}} women's emancipation at {{home and}} at work. However, during Communist rule (until 1989), feminism in general and second-wave feminism in particular were practically absent. Although feminist texts were produced in the 1950s and afterwards, they were usually controlled and generated by the Communist state. After the fall of Communism, the Polish government, dominated by Catholic political parties, introduced a de facto legal ban on abortions. Since then, some feminists have adopted <b>argumentative</b> strategies from the 1980s American pro-choice movement.|$|E
25|$|His {{father wanted}} him to study rhetoric toward the {{practice}} of law. According to Seneca the Elder, Ovid tended to the emotional, not the <b>argumentative</b> pole of rhetoric. After {{the death of his}} brother at 20 years of age, Ovid renounced law and began travelling to Athens, Asia Minor, and Sicily. He held minor public posts, as one of the tresviri capitales, {{as a member of the}} Centumviral court and as one of the decemviri litibus iudicandis, but resigned to pursue poetry probably around 29–25 BC, a decision his father apparently disapproved of.|$|E
25|$|Observing that {{philosophers}} often seek {{to deduce}} their total {{view from a}} few basic principles, showing how everything follows from their intuitively based axioms, Nozick compares such an approach to building a tower by piling one brick on top of another: if the brick at the bottom crumbles or is removed, everything collapses, and even the insights that were independent of the starting point are lost. He suggests instead that the Parthenon should be the model for philosophy, and advocates an explanatory model of philosophical activity rather than an <b>argumentative</b> or coercive one.|$|E
25|$|Manser created {{notebooks}} {{that were}} richly illustrated with drawings, notes, and 10,000 photographs during his six-year stay from 1984 to 1990 with the Penan people. Some of his sketches include cicada wing patterns, how {{to carry a}} gibbon with a stick, and how drill holes on a blowpipe. These notebooks were later published by Christoph Merian Verlag press in Basel. Manser also created audio recordings of oral histories told by Penan elders and translated them. He claimed that the Penan people were never <b>argumentative</b> or violent during his time with the Penan tribe.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{his life}} Jim Thompson drank heavily; the effects of {{alcoholism}} often featured in his works, most prominently in The Alcoholics (1953) which is set in a detoxification clinic. Donald E. Westlake, who adapted The Grifters for the screen, observed that alcoholism had a great role in Thompson's literature though it tended to be tacit and subtle. Westlake described typical personal relationships in Thompson novels as pleasant in the morning, <b>argumentative</b> in the afternoon, and abusive at night—behavior common to the alcoholic Thompson's style of life but which he elided from the stories.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is written}} in a style that {{differed}} from the prevailing writing technique {{and structure of the}} scholar gentry of the time. The scholar gentry under the Confucian education system fostered by the classical imperial examinations were molded by their study and memorization of classical Chinese poetry and literature. As such, the literary style tended to be poetic, indirect and metaphorical, relying on allusions and imagery to depict an idea. Phan eschewed this traditional style to write in a direct, ordinary prose style, especially in his analytical and <b>argumentative</b> sections. The book precipitated a new style of writing among scholar gentry revolutionaries, who later tended to use a more direct style.|$|E
25|$|Scholarly {{handling}} of the Celtic languages has been rather <b>argumentative</b> owing to scarceness of primary source data. Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic, arguing that {{the differences between the}} Goidelic and Brittonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between P-Celtic and Q-Celtic, putting most of the Gaulish and Brittonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called Gallo-Brittonic) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages.|$|E
25|$|Charles was {{initially}} {{treated as a}} hero on his return to Paris but {{after several years of}} war, the French were short of money and eager to bring it to a conclusion; following the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the Stuarts were once more banished from France. Charles secretly visited London in 1750 and continued attempts to reignite his cause but the heavy drinking that was now a feature of his life made him <b>argumentative</b> and hard to work with. In 1759, the French Chief Minister, de Choiseul met with Charles to discuss Jacobite participation in another ambitious invasion attempt but dismissed him as incapable through drink. Charles never visited Britain again and in January 1788, died in Rome, a disappointed and embittered man.|$|E
25|$|Although Dahmer was doted upon as {{an infant}} and toddler by both parents, his mother {{was known to be}} tense, greedy for attention, and <b>argumentative</b> with her husband and their neighbors. As her son entered first grade, Joyce Dahmer began to spend an {{increasing}} amount of her time in bed recovering from weakness. Lionel's university studies kept him away from home much of the time; when he was home, his wife demanded constant attention. She reportedly would work herself into a state of anxiety over trivial matters simply to achieve appeasement from her husband. On one occasion, Joyce Dahmer attempted suicide from an overdose of the Equanil pills to which she had become addicted. Consequently, neither parent devoted much time to their son.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, aged nineteen, Rajneesh {{began his}} studies at Hitkarini College in Jabalpur. Asked to leave after {{conflicts}} with an instructor, {{he transferred to}} D. N. Jain College, also in Jabalpur. Having proved himself to be disruptively <b>argumentative,</b> he was not required to attend college classes in D. N. Jain College except for examinations and used his free time {{to work for a}} few months as an assistant editor at a local newspaper. He began speaking in public at the annual Sarva Dharma Sammelan (Meeting of all faiths) held at Jabalpur, organised by the Taranpanthi Jain community into which he was born, and participated there from 1951 to 1968. He resisted his parents' pressure to get married. Rajneesh later said he became spiritually enlightened on 21 March 1953, when he was 21 years old, in a mystical experience while sitting under a tree in the Bhanvartal garden in Jabalpur.|$|E
25|$|Eustace Clarence Scrubb is {{a cousin}} of the Pevensies, and a classmate of Jill Pole at their school Experiment House. He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve his nasty {{behaviour}} when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while. His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible he has been, and he soon becomes a better person so Aslan changes him back into a boy. In the later books, Eustace {{comes across as a}} much nicer person, although he is still rather grumpy and <b>argumentative.</b> Nonetheless, he becomes a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.|$|E
25|$|Multimodality {{also can}} be used to {{associate}} a text with a specific <b>argumentative</b> purpose, e.g., to state facts, make a definition, cause a value judgment, or make a policy decision. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, professors at the University of Maryland and the Pennsylvania State University, labeled the fulfillment of these purposes stases. A text’s stasis can be altered by multimodality, especially when several mediums are juxtaposed to create an individualized experience or meaning. For example, an argument that mainly defines a concept is understood as arguing in the stasis of definition; however, it can also be assigned a stasis of value if the way the definition is delivered equips writers to evaluate a concept, or judge whether something is good or bad. If the text is interactive, the audience is facilitated to create their own meaning from the perspective the multimodal text provides. By emphasizing different stases through the use of different modes, writers are able to further engage their audience in creating comprehension.|$|E
25|$|When Dove {{returned}} to America in 1909 he met Alfred Stieglitz, probably {{by way of}} Maurer's written introduction. Stieglitz was a well known photographer and gallery owner who was very active in promoting modern art in America, including works by European artists {{that had never been}} seen before in the U.S. Dove decided to quit working as an illustrator but was in need of artistic identity along with emotional bolstering and Stieglitz filled both these roles. The photographer was 16 years older than Dove and his urban, Jewish and European cultural roots were in contrast to Dove's rural Anglo-Saxon Protestant heritage. Dove was said to be gentle, quiet, and a good friend while Stieglitz was known as being <b>argumentative</b> and shrewd. They found their common ground in the idea that art forms should embody modern spiritual values, not materialism and tradition. With Stieglitz's support, Dove produced what are known as the first purely abstract paintings to come out of America. Dove’s works were based on natural forms and he referred to his type of abstraction as “extraction” where, in essence, he extracted the essential forms of a scene from nature.|$|E
25|$|Korolev {{grew up in}} Nezhin, {{under the}} care of his {{maternal}} grandparents Mykola Yakovych Moskalenko who was a trader of the Second Guild and Maria Matviivna Moskalenko (Fursa), a daughter of a local cossack. Korolev's mother also had a sister Anna and two brothers Yuri and Vasily. Maria Koroleva was frequently away attending Women's higher education courses in Kiev. As a child, Korolev was stubborn, persistent, and <b>argumentative.</b> Sergei grew up a lonely child with few friends. Korolev began reading at an early age, and his abilities in mathematics and other subjects made him a favorite student of his teachers, but caused jealousy from his peers. He later stated in an interview, the torment of classmates bullying and teasing him as a small child encouraged his focus on academic work. His mother divorced Pavel in 1915 and in 1916 married Grigory Mikhailovich Balanin, an electrical engineer educated in Germany but attending the Kiev Polytechnic University because German engineering diplomas were unrecognized in Russia. After getting a job with the regional railway, Grigory moved the family to Odessa in 1917, where they endured hardships with many other families through the tumultuous years following the Russian Revolution and continuing internecine struggles until the Bolsheviks assumed unchallenged power in 1920. Local schools were closed and young Korolev had to continue his studies at home. Grigory proved a good influence on his step-son, who suffered from a bout of typhus during the severe food shortages of 1919.|$|E
25|$|Zach {{comes into}} the {{knowledge}} that Kendall agreed to act as the surrogate for Ryan and Greenlee's baby when Greenlee's chances of giving birth became non-existent. He utterly hates the idea, and is determined to ensure Kendall will not go through with it. Once Ryan reveals himself to be alive a little after this, Kendall comes to the shocking realization that her husband helped Ryan fake his death. She is enraged at Zach, and states that she never would have taken {{on the task of}} being Greenlee's surrogate if she had known that Ryan is alive. Zach and Kendall fight on and off, but no matter their <b>argumentative</b> nature, Zach has developed true romantic feelings for Kendall. At this point, Greenlee has discovered that Kendall is pregnant not with Greenlee and Ryan's baby, but rather with Kendall and Ryan's baby. She spills this knowledge to the whole town, stating that Kendall has betrayed her in order to produce a child between Ryan and herself. Kendall is embarrassed and heartbroken at Greenlee's accusation, and tries to explain that Greenlee's eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and if she had not used her own eggs, Greenlee would have been without Ryan's child for certain. Greenlee does not care to listen and soon leaves town. Zach sticks by Kendall's side and tells her of his love for her. Kendall is afraid of his declaration, and starts to distance herself from him. She asks for a divorce, not admitting that she feels the same way. Zach agrees to grant her a divorce, but Bianca Montgomery, Kendall's sister, counsels Zach to not give up on Kendall. Zach does as suggested, and informs Kendall of his love for her again. This time Kendall does not hold back and the two share a passionate kiss.|$|E
