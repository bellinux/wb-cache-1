25|$|Shortly before World War II, Stalin {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact agreeing to non-aggression with Nazi Germany, {{after which the}} two {{countries}} invaded Poland in September 1939. In June 1941, the pact collapsed as Germany turned to attack to the Soviet Union, opening the largest and bloodiest theatre of war in history. Soviet war casualties <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> proportion of {{the conflict in the}} effort of acquiring the upper hand over Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad and Kursk. The territories overtaken by the Red Army became satellite states of the USSR; the postwar division of Europe into capitalist and communist halves would lead to increased tensions with the West, led by the United States.|$|E

5000|$|To {{decrease}} developmental costs, the Mustang used chassis, suspension, and drivetrain components {{derived from}} the Ford Falcon and Fairlane. It used a unitized platform-type frame from the 1964 Falcon, and welded box-section side rails, including welded crossmembers. Although hardtop Mustangs <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> sales, durability problems with the new frame led to the engineering of a convertible first, which ensured adequate stiffness. Overall length of the Mustang and Falcon was identical, although the Mustang's wheelbase was slightly shorter. With an overall width of 68.2 in, it was 2.4 in narrower, yet the wheel track was nearly identical. Shipping weight, approximately 2570 lb with the straight six-cylinder engine, was also similar to the Falcon. A fully equipped V8 model weighed approximately 3000 lb. Although most of the mechanical parts were from the Falcon, the Mustang's body was completely different; sporting a shorter wheelbase, wider track, lower seating position and lower overall height. An industry first, the [...] "torque box" [...] was an innovative structural system that greatly stiffened the Mustang's construction and helped contribute to better handling.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{validity}} and usefulness of incident reporting and other methods for identifying adverse events remains unclear. This study aimed to compare five methods in general practice. METHODS: In a prospective observational study, with five general practitioners, five methods were applied and compared. The five methods were physician reported adverse events, pharmacist reported adverse events, patients' experiences of adverse events, {{assessment of a}} random sample of medical records, and assessment of all deceased patients. RESULTS: A total of 68 events were identified using these methods. The patient survey <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> number of events and the pharmacist reports for the lowest number. No overlap between the methods was detected. The patient survey <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> number of events and the pharmacist reports for the lowest number. CONCLUSION: A mix of methods is needed to identify adverse events in general practice...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} cancer hospital {{morbidity and}} mortality in the Brazilian elderly population according to the primary site of neoplasms per Brazilian region and their importance on Public Health System expenses. Methods: The data {{were obtained from the}} Ministry of Health records from 2000 to 2005. Rresults: From 2000 to 2005, there were 507, 174 deaths due to neoplasms of the population older than 60 years old. The largest mortality rates were found in South and South-East regions. Among women, breast cancer was the most fatal neoplasm; among men, prostate cancer and trachea, bronchi and lung cancer. In situ neoplasms <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> average hospitalizations and the highest average expenses of the total amount paid for hospitalizations, while brain neoplasms <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> average amount spent per hospitalization.
