25|$|Immediately {{east from}} the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords {{in the south and}} by deep lakes in the north, and with varying {{temperatures}} according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to 2,000 m on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuquén in Argentina, where sunnier <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> conditions allow trees to grow up to close to 3,000 m), and diminishes southward to only 600–800 m in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other, and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Frías, in Argentina, receives 4,400mm yearly. The city of Bariloche, about 40km further east, receives about 1,000mm, and the airport, another 15km east, receives less than 600mm. The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Martín de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bolsón, Esquel, El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between 20°C and 24°C, with cold nights between 4°C and 9°C; in the south, summers are between 16°C and 20°C, at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from 3°C to 9°C in the north, and from 0°C to 7°C in the south, whereas nights range from −5°C to 2°C everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values: -21°C have been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often see temperatures between −12°C and −15°C and highs staying around 0°C for a few days.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Burns asks Homer to [...] "find the jade monkey" [...] in a {{reference}} to the film The Maltese Falcon. He also offers the nuclear inspectors a washer <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> or the contents of a mysterious box, which parodies the gameshow Let's Make a Deal. Mr. Burns' escape pod resembles the one used by R2-D2 and C-3PO in the first Star Wars film.

500|$|... "Give It Away" [...] is {{performed}} in the time signature of 4/4 time. The track begins with a distinctively [...] "dry" [...] guitar tone that is similar in style {{to the rest of}} the record. Producer Rick Rubin had a considerable influence on the sound of Blood Sugar Sex Magik by removing much of the reverb and guitar layering that epitomized the band's previous album Mother's Milk. This caused the record to contain simpler <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> guitar and bass chords that were not filtered through guitar effects—those that did, however, were made with vintage electronics from the 1960s and 70s. For [...] "Give It Away", along with the rest of the album, Rubin sought to achieve a sense of atmosphere that was similar to 60s records that were made without commercialism or viability in mind and to downplay on [...] "big" [...] sounds: [...] "What you hear is what you get—there's not a lot of trickery. A lot of people want the biggest sound, with walls of guitar and huge drums. But I don't think those things matter." [...] The song follows a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure; when Kiedis begins singing, Frusciante jumps into a funk-oriented riff that is repeated throughout the verse while Flea plays a complex bass-line that makes use of virtually the entire fretboard.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1950s, the 'white goods,' or {{laundry and}} kitchen {{appliance}} industry, grew rapidly. Maytag first entered the commercial laundry field at this time, manufacturing washers <b>and</b> <b>dryers</b> for commercial self-service laundries and commercial operators. In response, other full-line appliance producers began {{to compete with}} Maytag in the white-goods consumer market. These included 'full-line' manufacturers such as Whirlpool, General Electric, and Frigidaire, who built not only washing machines <b>and</b> <b>dryers,</b> but also refrigerators, stoves, and other appliances. Since Maytag was {{much smaller than the}} full-line producers, the company decided to limit itself to the manufacture of washers <b>and</b> <b>dryers,</b> alongside marketing ovens and refrigerators built by other companies, as a small, premium-brand manufacturer. The company capitalized on its reputation by renaming its corporate address in Newton, Iowa, [...] "One Dependability Square." ...|$|R

2500|$|The house {{used for}} Big Brother 10 had a [...] "classics" [...] theme, with {{areas such as}} the kitchen being {{decorated}} in the style of an old diner. The outside of the house is decorated to look like a standard two-story home. One bedroom features a black and red color theme, while another was decorated with items promoting peace and love. A third bedroom featured props such as a stuffed poodle for a HouseGuest to keep. The living room features several green colored couches. The living room is connected to the kitchen, which is connected to the HoH stairway and a hallway. There is one door in the hallway, which features a spa available to the HouseGuests. The hallway then leads to the bathroom. Workout equipment can also be found outside in the backyard, and is available for use at any time. There are also multiple lawn chairs that the HouseGuests may use to lay out in the sun, along with a swimming pool and a hot tub.

There is also a large couch under a roof by the sliding glass door that the HouseGuests may use in case of rain.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout their film appearances, Predators have {{undergone}} numerous design variations. In Predator 2, the main Predator {{was designed to}} look more urban and hip than its predecessor. Design changes included tribal ornamentation on the forehead, which was made steeper and shallower, brighter skin coloration and {{a greater number of}} fangs. This Predator was made less reliant on his plasma caster, and more cunning with the use of nets, spears and bladed weaponry. In Alien vs. Predator, the appearance of the Predators was redesigned to make them seem more heroic. Redesigns included a reduction in head and waist size, broader shoulders, a more muscular physique, piranha-like teeth on the upper jaw, <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> and less clammy skin to further differentiate them from the Aliens. In Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, the Predator was returned to the sleeker design concept prior to Alien vs. Predator. For the so-called [...] "Black Super Predators" [...] in Predators, the designers used the differences between a cassette tape and an iPod as an analogy in differentiating the new Predators from the classic. The Super Predators were designed as leaner and taller than the [...] "classic" [...] Predator design, and they have longer faces, tighter armor, and more swept back dreadlocks.|$|E

2500|$|Juniors and Seniors {{living on}} campus are {{generally}} assigned to either East Campus or Rappahannock River Hall. James River Hall also accommodates Juniors and Seniors in apartment style dorms. CNU is currently planning construction {{on a dedicated}} upperclassmen residence, to be called [...] "Shenandoah Hall." [...] It is expected to house more than 200 seniors and to open in summer 2020. Starting in 2009, five sororities and four fraternities live in Barclay Apartments, CNU's temporary Greek Village, and any additional fraternities and sororities live in the adjacent townhouses of CNU Landing as of 2012. Completed in 2002, CNU Apartments is a complex of five buildings {{of three or four}} stories, housing up to 355 students. These buildings, named after Virginia-born presidents, include Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Harrison, and Monroe. The CNU Village rose to accompany CNU Apartments in 2005, adding room for an additional 398 students in apartment living. Both the apartments and the Village feature 2 to 4 single bedroom apartments with a common living area (full kitchen, living room/dinette, washer <b>and</b> <b>dryer).</b> Below CNU Village, along Warwick Blvd., are a variety of eating establishments including Panera Bread, Moe's Southwest Grill, Subway, 7-11, Sushi & Spice, and Schooners, opened by three local restaurateurs who wanted to fill a void left by the lack of a social outlet on campus.|$|E
60|$|Now there arose {{a second}} reason for {{squeezing}} into an already overcrowded church.

In other parts of the world, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial laundromat.|$|R
60|$|Oh, {{the splendor}} of the sun, the fresh green grass, the {{rippling}} water of the river, the beautiful lake! And what joy it was to see our horses feed and sleep. They looked distressingly thin and poor without their saddles. Ladrone was still weak in the ankle joints and the arch {{had gone out of}} his neck, while faithful Bill, who never murmured or complained, had a glassy stare in his eyes, the lingering effects of poisoning. The wind rose in the afternoon, bringing to us a sound of moaning tree-tops, and somehow it seemed to be an augury of better things--seemed to prophesy a fairer <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> country to the north of us. The singing of the leaves went to my heart with a hint of home, and I remembered with a start how absolutely windless the sullen forest of the Skeena had been.|$|E
6000|$|The devil a saint, at all events, was Vernon, who {{denied that}} he had passed his word, and who, {{as soon as he}} had surmounted his first disablement, passionately and quite admirably re-enlisted. At once {{restored}} to the front and to what now gave life for him its indispensable relish, he was in the thick, again, of the great carnage roundabout Richmond, where, again gravely wounded, he (as I figure still incorrigibly smiling) succumbed. His mother had by this time indignantly returned to Europe, accompanied by her daughter and her younger son--the former of whom accepted, for our great pity, a little later on, the office of closing the story. Anne King, young and frail, but not less firm, under stress, than the others of her blood, came back, on her brother's death, and, quietest, most colourless Electra of a lucidest Orestes, making her difficult way amid massed armies and battle-drenched fields, got possession of his buried body and bore it for reinterment to Newport, the old habitation, as I have mentioned, of their father's people, both Vernons and Kings. It must have been to see my mother, as well as to sail again for Europe, that she afterwards came to Boston, where I remember going down with her, at the last, to the dock of the English steamer, some black and tub-like Cunarder, an archaic [...] "Africa" [...] or [...] "Asia" [...] sufficing to the Boston service of those days. I saw her off drearily and helplessly enough, I well remember, and even at that moment found for her another image: what was she most like, though in a still sparer <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> form, but some low-toned, some employed little Brontë heroine?--though more indeed a Lucy Snowe than a Jane Eyre, and with no shade of a Brontë hero within sight. To this all the fine privilege and fine culture of all the fine countries (collective matter, from far back, of our intimated envy) had [...] "amounted"; just as it had amounted for Vernon to the bare headstone on the Newport hillside where, by his mother's decree, as I have already noted, there figured no hint of the manner of his death. So grand, so finely personal a manner it appeared to me at the time, and has indeed appeared ever since, that this brief record irrepressibly springs from that. His mother, as I have equally noted, was however, with her views, to find no grace in it so long as she lived; and his sister went back to her, and to Marseille, as they always called it, but prematurely to die.|$|E
50|$|Stackable machines, on {{the other}} hand, are defined by two {{separate}} machines, a washer and a dryer, stacked {{on top of one}} another. These stackable machines are often a good choice for large families that still need the full capacity and functionality of a washer <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> without having to compromise too much regarding space. Most stackable washer <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> configurations come in the front-loading design as opposed to the top-loading design, which makes it easier to access both the washer <b>and</b> <b>dryer</b> while they are stacked.|$|E
