50|$|The <b>accurate</b> {{calculation}} of <b>a</b> location's longitude was long a critical element of maritime navigation. The United States established the United States Coast Survey in the 1830s {{to produce a}} consistent set of nautical charts for the nation's coastline. The Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts was chosen in 1847 {{as the site of}} the prime reference point for the longitude determinations, and survey work extended from there. The advent of telegraphy made possible the simultaneous exchange of time signals between distant locations to determine the difference in time between observed passage of an object in the sky (often Polaris) at different locations. With sufficiently <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> <b>pieces,</b> longitude could be determined with significant precision.|$|R

50|$|One common {{style of}} {{radio-controlled}} clock uses time signals transmitted by dedicated terrestrial longwave radio transmitters, which emit a time code {{that can be}} demodulated and displayed by the radio controlled clock. The radio controlled clock will contain <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> base oscillator to maintain timekeeping if the radio signal is momentarily unavailable.

50|$|The Timation {{satellites}} were conceived, developed, {{and launched}} by the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. beginning in 1964. The concept of Timation was to broadcast <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> reference {{for use as a}} ranging signal to receivers on the ground. On 31 May 1967 the Timation-1 satellite was launched. This was followed by the Timation-2 satellite launch in 1969. The results of this program and Air Force Project 621B formed the basis for the Global Positioning System (GPS). The Navy's contribution to the GPS program continued to be focused on ever more accurate clocks.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to being}} a {{prominent}} colonizer C. stygia has {{an important role in}} Australian forensics. When a body has been dead for more than 72 hours, prolong enough that temperature cannot give <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> of death, insects can be used instead. Larval secession can aid in determining the time of death through aging the insects that are removed from the body; however insect age can be altered by temperature, humidity, larval density in and on the corpse, and the location on the body after death. Also the presence of drugs can affect the succession rate and relative age on any insects feeding on the flesh of the corpse.|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} capability {{provided by}} GPS-based guidance {{is the ability}} to completely tailor a flight trajectory to meet criteria other than simply hitting a target. Weapon trajectories can be controlled so that a target can be impacted at precise headings and vertical angles. This provides the ability to impact perpendicular to a target surface and minimize the angle of attack (maximizing penetration), detonate the warhead at the optimum angle to maximize the warhead effectiveness, or have the weapon fly into the target area from a different heading than the launch aircraft (decreasing the risk of detection of the aircraft). GPS also provides <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> source common to all systems; this allows multiple weapons to loiter and impact targets at preplanned times and intervals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{theoretical}} approach for {{the classification of}} multiple reflections in time-domain e. m. inverse scattering of multi-layered media is presented. The existence of multiples limits the capabilities of inversion algorithms, thus suitable identification and suppression techniques should be applied to reduce this undesired effect. Assuming a scenario composed of loss-less and non-dispersive media, and providing <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>time</b> delay estimation (TDE) of backscattered signals, the proposed method allows not only to evaluate the presence of multiples and discriminate them from primary reflections, but also to determine their propagation paths. Preliminary tests performed on FDTD simulated data have shown its potentialities to effectively handle multiple reflections and therefore to enhance the e. m. signals backscattered by primary reflectors. 1...|$|R

Such protocols establish a set of primary time reference sources which are directly synchronized with external sources.
