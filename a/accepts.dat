40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the time and the}} crossing sequence complexities of onetape off-line Turing machines.

We also prove that the maximal length of the crossing sequences used in <b>accepting</b> computations must grow at least as log n. On the other hand, it is known that if the time is measured considering, for each <b>accepted</b> string, only the faster <b>accepting</b> computation (weak measure), then there exist nonregular languages <b>accepted</b> in linear time.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{definition}} of <b>accepting</b> networks – called target based <b>accepting</b> networks – is given. In a target based <b>accepting</b> network of evolutionary processors, each node {{is equipped with}} a regular language – the target set. As soon as a node contains a word of its target set, the input word is <b>accepted</b> by the network. In this way, no further output nodes are necessary. It is shown that conventional <b>accepting</b> networks with regular filters and target based <b>accepting</b> networks with regular filters have the same computational power. However, the number of processors needed for <b>accepting</b> a language can be reduced when using target based networks. 1...|$|R
