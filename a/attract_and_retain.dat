After the year 2000, Portland experienced significant growth, with a population rise of over 90,000 between the years 2000 and 2014. The city's increased presence within the cultural lexicon has established it as a popular city for young people, and it was second only to Louisville, Kentucky as one of the cities to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> the highest number of college-educated people in the United States.

25|$|With {{the growth}} of the size of {{development}} teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios {{need to be able to}} pay their staff a competitive wage in order to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450. The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.|$|E

Arguments have been polarized, however, between those suggesting that quality of place {{plays a key role}} in urban growth, and those arguing that jobs and production networks are more important. In this paper we reconcile the debates by emphasizing the productive function of quality of place. Drawing on a case study of fashion designers in Toronto, we examine the roles of diversity, tolerance, social services, and cultural dynamism in <b>attracting</b> <b>and</b> <b>retaining</b> talent, in fostering aesthetic experimentation, and in mediating some of the risks associated with cultural work. ...|$|R

25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the Firm {{continued}} to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> significant legal talent. Its senior partners Antony Purdon Godwin and Wu Chang-Sheng became prominent figures at the Singapore Litigation Bar. Wu Chang-Sheng, son of renowned plague-fighter Dr. Wu Lien-teh (himself credited with modernising China's medical services and medical education), was particularly renowned for his expertise in construction arbitration. Godwin and Wu were also founding {{members of the}} Council of the Singapore Advocates and Solicitors Society (which subsequently became the Law Society of Singapore) in 1967. The late Henry Mosley Dyne, a former senior partner, {{was regarded as a}} giant in the Chancery Bar until his retirement in 2000.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Chesapeake Bay settlements, colonial {{officials}} found it difficult to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> laborers under the harsh frontier conditions, and there was a high mortality rate. Most laborers came from Britain as indentured servants, having signed contracts of indenture to pay with work for their passage, their upkeep and training, usually on a farm. The colonies had agricultural economies. These indentured servants were young people who intended to become permanent residents. In some cases, convicted criminals were transported to the colonies as indentured servants, rather than being imprisoned. The indentured servants were not slaves, but were required to work for four to seven years in Virginia to pay the cost of their passage and maintenance. Many Germans, Scots-Irish, and Irish came to the colonies in the 18th century, settling in the backcountry of Pennsylvania and further south.|$|E
25|$|Model {{validation}} (MV) {{takes the}} models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group {{might well be}} seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.|$|E

500|$|Other {{issues facing}} the RAN during Dowling's term as CNS were its relegation—since the {{beginning}} of the 1950s—to third place behind the other armed forces in terms of Federal budget allocations, its replacement by the RAAF as the country's first line of defence, and a shortage of manpower. Dowling himself considered [...] "separation from families, lack of houses, over employment, high wages and overtime payment in civvie street" [...] as the causes for the Navy's inability to <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> personnel; the Allison Report in 1958 resulted in various improvements to service conditions, which helped reduce wastage. The RANC had moved to Flinders Naval Depot in 1930, and Dowling was pleased to be able to oversee its return to Jervis Bay in 1958, the year before he relocated the office of the CNS to Canberra.|$|E
500|$|Several {{businesses}} {{and the state}} of Virginia added a 29-hour-a-week cap for their part-time employees, to reflect the 30-hour-or-more definition for full-time worker. As of yet, however, only a small percent of companies have shifted their workforce towards more part-time hours (4% in a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis). [...] Trends in working hours and the effects of the Great Recession correlate with part-time working hour patterns. The impact of this provision may have been offset by other factors, including that health insurance helps <b>attract</b> <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> employees, increases productivity and reduces absenteeism; and the lower training and administration costs of a smaller full-time workforce over a larger part-time work force. Relatively few firms employ over 50 employees and more than 90% of them offered insurance. Workers without employer insurance could purchase insurance on the exchanges.|$|E
