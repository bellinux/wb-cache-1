Samantha is killed, although it is revealed that she was simply {{one of a number}} of clones, produced using alien tissue to create an alien-human hybrid.|$|E
5|$|The Infectious Disease Society of America {{recommends}} against {{empirical treatment}} and considers antibiotics only appropriate when given after a positive test. Testing {{is not needed}} in children under three as both group A strep and rheumatic fever are rare, unless <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> a sibling with the disease.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E

25|$|SLI is {{diagnosed}} when <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> difficulties with understanding or producing spoken language for no obvious cause. The problems cannot {{be explained in}} terms of peripheral hearing loss. The child is typically late in starting to talk, and may have problems in producing speech sounds clearly, and in producing or understanding complex sentences. Some theoretical accounts of SLI regard it as the result of auditory processing problems. However, this view of SLI is not universally accepted, and others regard the main difficulties in SLI as stemming from problems with higher-level aspects of language processing. Where <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> both auditory and language problems, {{it can be hard to}} sort out cause-and-effect.|$|E
25|$|Using both {{paracetamol}} and ibuprofen at {{the same}} time or alternating between the two is more effective at decreasing fever than using only paracetamol or ibuprofen.

25|$|In the UK, {{children}} {{are entitled to}} an assessment by local NHS Speech and Language Therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly. If treatment is appropriate, a care plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often {{play a role in}} multi-disciplinary teams where <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition.|$|E
25|$|Most {{bedwetting}} is {{a developmental}} delay—not an emotional problem or physical illness. Only {{a small percentage}} (5% to 10%) of bedwetting cases are caused by specific medical situations. Bedwetting is frequently associated with {{a family history of}} the condition. Nocturnal enuresis is considered primary (PNE) when <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> not yet had a prolonged period of being dry. Secondary nocturnal enuresis (SNE) is when a child or adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry.|$|E
25|$|Beloved and Sethe {{are both}} very much emotionally {{impaired}} {{as a result of}} Sethe’s previous enslavement. Slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child, which has devastating consequences for both parties. Furthermore, the earliest need <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> is related to the mother: the baby needs milk from the mother. Sethe is traumatized by the experience of having her milk stolen because it means she cannot form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter.|$|E

Along {{the way they}} gather flowers to transplant into the gardens of Heaven. The angel takes the child to a poverty-stricken area where a dead field lily lies in a trash heap. The angel salvages the flower explaining that it had cheered a crippled boy before he died. The angel then reveals he was the boy, and the boy continued his journey.|$|E
25|$|Sickle-cell {{conditions}} have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance from parents. The types of haemoglobin a person makes {{in the red}} blood cells depend on what haemoglobin genes are inherited from her or his parents. If one parent has sickle-cell anaemia and the other has sickle-cell trait, then the child has a 50% chance of having sickle-cell disease and a 50% chance of having sickle-cell trait. When both parents have sickle-cell trait, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> a 25% chance of sickle-cell disease, 25% do not carry any sickle-cell alleles, and 50% have the heterozygous condition.|$|E
25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} ultimately {{explains the}} disease's variability, including the late-onset forms. The disease can potentially {{result from the}} inheritance of two unrelated mutations in the HEXA gene, one from each parent. Classic infantile Tay–Sachs disease results when <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> inherited mutations from both parents that completely stop the biodegradation of gangliosides. Late onset forms occur due to the diverse mutation basenbsp&– people with Tay–Sachs disease may technically be heterozygotes, with two differing HEXA mutations that both inactivate, alter, or inhibit enzyme activity. When a patient {{has at least one}} HEXA copy that still enables some level of hexosaminidasenbsp&A activity, a later onset disease form occurs. When disease occurs because of two unrelated mutations, the patient {{is said to be a}} compound heterozygote.|$|E

25|$|Twenty-five of the 34 cases {{listed in}} the {{previous}} Compliance Report have been closed, with approximately one-third resulting in {{the return of the}} children to the United States. There have been ten Hague court hearings since Fall 1999, with all children except one returned to the U.S. In one case, children were returned to the United States only six months after the abduction. In addition, there have been voluntary returns in more than 30 cases, with the existence of a pending Hague case a factor in the voluntary return decision. Once <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> been located, the taking parent must be notified of the hearing date. Mexico’s new procedure of taking children into custody at that time has been very effective in ensuring that the taking parent does not go into hiding with the children.|$|E
500|$|Children with Tourette's {{may suffer}} {{socially}} if their tics {{are viewed as}} [...] "bizarre". If <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> disabling tics, or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning, supportive psychotherapy or school accommodations can be helpful. Because comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) can cause greater impact on overall functioning than tics, a thorough evaluation for comorbidity is called for when symptoms and impairment warrant.|$|E

Like many old buildings, Little Moreton Hall has stories of ghosts; a grey lady is said to haunt the Long Gallery, and <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> reportedly been heard sobbing in and around the Chapel.|$|E

500|$|Family trees {{may be seen}} as {{directed}} acyclic graphs, with a vertex for each family member and an edge for each parent-child relationship. Despite the name, these graphs are not necessarily trees because of the possibility of marriages between relatives (so <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>has</b> a common ancestor on both the mother's and father's side) causing pedigree collapse. The graphs of matrilineal descent ("mother" [...] relationships between women) and patrilineal descent ("father" [...] relationships between men) are trees within this graph. [...] Because ...|$|E

He asserted the importance of discipline and punctuality to the children. She studied at the Convent of Jesus and Mary boarding school in Shimla. Although she confesses to loneliness in the boarding school, she noted that it was compensated by her finding a [...] "...perfect set of friends" [...] there. As a student, she developed a love for literature, particularly the works of William Shakespeare and poetry. According to Zinta, she enjoyed schoolwork and received good grades; in her free time she played sports, especially basketball.|$|E

The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. In an interview with The Washington Post, Michele commented on her casting, saying, [...] "I was kind of just thrown into this—this {{is one of the}} first television jobs I've ever had.
