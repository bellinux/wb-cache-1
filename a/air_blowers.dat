500|$|After a tank is cleaned, {{provided}} {{that it is}} going to be prepared for entry, it will be purged. Purging is accomplished by pumping inert gas into the tank until hydrocarbons have been sufficiently expelled. Next the tank is gas freed which is usually accomplished by blowing fresh air into the space with portable air powered or water powered <b>air</b> <b>blowers.</b> [...] "Gas freeing" [...] brings the oxygen content of the tank up to 20.8% O2. The inert gas buffer between fuel and oxygen atmospheres ensures they are never capable of ignition. Specially trained personnel monitor the tank's atmosphere, often using hand-held gas indicators which measure the percentage of hydrocarbons present. After a tank is gas-free, it may be further hand-cleaned in a manual process known as mucking. Mucking requires protocols for entry into confined spaces, protective clothing, designated safety observers, and possibly the use of airline respirators.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} modeling and controller {{design of a}} hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system (HABS). The purpose {{of this research is}} to obtain model estimation best fit over 90 %. Furthermore, the purpose of this research is to design controllers which the overshoot percentage close to zero percent and obtain a shorter rise time compare to current hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system. The research divided into 3 area of focus, first focus on the development of Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences (PRBS) controller prototype to use as a System Identification Tool. The development of the controller was designed using PIC controllers. Testing was being conducted to ensure the controller is fully operational. Next, the output data from the hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system (HABS) was captured for analysis. Second, the research focused on the modeling of a hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system using System Identification and Estimation approach. By obtaining the mathematical model of a hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system, tuning can be made possible. The output data was being run on MATLAB to compare between several of model structures. Model structures selected for this research are Auto-Regressive with eXogeneous inputs (ARX), Auto-Regressive Moving-Average with eXogeneous inputs (ARMAX), Output Error (OE) and Box–Jenkins (BJ). Result shows the eXogeneous inputs (ARX) obtained the highest best fit which best resemble the dynamic system of a hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system (HABS) and was selected to be implemented in the controllers. Third area of focus is the simulation design of controllers; controllers which were selected for this research were PID controllers, Self-tuning controllers and Fuzzy controllers. The result obtained are shown in the Result and Analysis chapter, all controllers obtained zero overshoot percentage and have a shorter rise time then the current hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> system. Results showed the different in rise time, peak time, delay time and percentage overshoot varies depending on the controller.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> actuated by PZT for air blowing for air-breathing micro PEM fuel cell. The several factors {{to affect the}} performance of air-breathing PEM fuel cell such as air flow rate, opening ratio and cathode open type in the cathode side were studied. Especially, an air flow rate is critical condition to improve its performance. In this paper, we developed a synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> to supply a high stoichiometric air flow. The synthetic jet mechanism is a zero mass flux device that converts electrical energy into the momentum. The synthetic jet actuation is usually generated by a traditional PZT actuator, which consists of a small cylindrical cavity, in/outlet channel and PZT diaphragms. The flow rate of the fabricated synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> was 400 cc/min at 550 Hz and its power consumption was very low under 0. 3 W. The proposed air-breathing PEM fuel cell which installed synthetic jet <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> was higher performance and stability during continuous operation than the air-breathing fuel cell without auxiliary device to supply the air. The {{results showed that the}} maximum power density was 188 mW/cm 2 at 400 mA/cm 2. This maximum power density and durability were improved more than 40 % and 20 %, respectively.

40|$|The sewage {{treatment}} efficiency of hybrid constructed wetlands (CWs) was evaluated under different ventilation methods. The removal efficiencies of {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in the vertical flow- (VF-) horizontal flow (HF) CWs using an electric fan <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> by the renewable energy of solar and wind power were higher than those by natural ventilation, excluding only suspended solids (SS). The TN treatment efficiency in the CW using the <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> especially increased rapidly by 16. 6 % {{in comparison with the}} CW employing natural ventilation, since the VF bed provided suitable conditions (aerobic) for nitrification to occur. The average removal efficiencies of BOD, SS, TN, and TP in the effluent were 98. 8, 97. 4, 58. 0, and 48. 3 % in the CW using an electric fan <b>air</b> <b>blower,</b> respectively. The treatment performance of the CWs under different ventilation methods was assessed, showing TN in the CW using an electric fan <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> to be reduced by 57. 5 ~ 58. 6 % for inlet TN loading, whereas reduction by 19. 0 ~ 53. 3 % was observed in the CW with natural ventilation.
