40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{study examines}} {{the relationship between}} degree of financial autonomy and spending patterns of public higher education institutions on research-related activities versus instruction-related activities. As state appropriations have been decreasing and student enrollment has been increasing, higher education institutions have become more financially autonomous from states. Using 8 -year panel of university- and state-level data, this study finds an association between financial autonomy and institutional spending patterns. The main finding(s) are the positive relationship between lesser reliance on state funding, more-diversified revenue sources and full authority over tuition-setting, and higher spending on research-related activities versus instruction-related activities, in particular for research universities. In turn, comprehensive institutions with the most flexible budgeting approach tend to spend more on instruction than research. Thus, the institutional type {{and the source of}} revenue (e. g., tuition and fees, state and local <b>appropriations,</b> <b>grants,</b> endowment interest, donations, etc.) matter...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the Hebrew Bible’s theory of sovereignty with special reference to the book of Joshua. The author conceives of sovereignty as the exclusive and absolute control over territory. The sovereign is “all Israel” – the biblical analogue to “we the people. ” The territory is the land promised to the Patriarchs and partially conquered by Joshua {{in the war of}} conquest. Israel’s title to this territory is established vis-à-vis foreign nations by boundary agreement (Aram), partition (Ammon and Moab), abandonment (Edom), and renunciation (Egypt); its right to dispossess the prior inhabitants is based on theories of conquest, capacity, <b>appropriation,</b> <b>grant,</b> promise, purchase and contract. Israel’s control over territory is explored in narratives describing the allocation of the Promised Land. The author’s approach is pragmatic rather than programmatic, stressing the value of fair procedures and recognizing arguments for distributive justice based on merit, equality, productivity, expectations and need. The author argues that a property distribution, even if fair ex ante, must also be accepted as reasonable ex post. ...|$|R

40|$|The Smithsonian Institution is the United States' {{national}} museum, {{which has}} grown immensely since its adoption {{by the federal}} government during the mid- 19 th century. Although considered a "small" institution, {{a significant portion of the}} Smithsonian’s total budget comes from federal government <b>appropriations,</b> <b>grants,</b> and contracts. Along with those appropriations, it is the job of the legislative branch to ensure that those funds are spent properly through different techniques of congressional oversight. In recent decades, political scientists have measured and scrutinized oversight and its relationship to divided government. This study addresses the question of whether a small, low profile institution like the Smithsonian is subject to increased oversight during times of divided government. After providing an overview of what the Smithsonian is and its relationship to the federal government, I provide a literature review on how political scientists have measured oversight. The study aggregates data on three forms of government oversight on the institution: committee hearings, appropriations, and the inspectors general. Although the data does not support the hypothesis, it supports David Mayhew’s notion that divided government has little to no effect on government oversight. While there are indications of an overall increase in oversight on the Smithsonian, political incentives are the driving force in conducting oversight on this particular institution.

50|$|The Division was {{the first}} heavier-than-air {{military}} aviation organization {{in the world and}} the precursor to the United States Air Force. Led by Captain Charles deForest Chandler, a Signal Corps officer with interest in military aeronautics, the Division was established with three officers and ten enlisted men, all from the Signal Corps. It soon became clear that the newly formed Aeronautical Division was limited by both a lack of funding and inadequate staffing. In the Division's first year, the War Department submitted a request to Congress for a $200,000 appropriation for aeronautical equipment and instruction, but the item was struck from the final bill. The Board of Ordnance and Fortifications stepped in, appropriating enough funding for the War Department to purchase an airplane from A.M. Herring of New York, and another from the Wright Brothers. The first regular appropriation for aeronautics in the military services was not made until 1911, and while annual reports of the Chief Signal Officer repeatedly stated that funding was insufficient to keep pace with aeronautical development in other countries, <b>appropriations</b> <b>granted</b> by Congress remained small. Another major problem facing the Aeronautical Division was a lack of personnel within the Signal Corps devoted to aeronautics. Between 1908 and 1910, repeated attempts were made to secure legislation that would authorize a personnel increase, but none were successful.|$|R
