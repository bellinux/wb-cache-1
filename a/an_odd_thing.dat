It charted at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 16 and No. 11 in Canada and Australia, respectively. Mills said years later, [...] "Without 'Losing My Religion', Out of Time would have sold two or three million , instead of the ten [...] or so it did. But the {{phenomenon}} that is a worldwide hit is <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> to behold. Basically that record was a hit in almost every civilised country in the world." [...] The success of [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] and Out of Time broadened R.E.M.'s audience beyond its original college radio-based fanbase. When asked at the time if he was worried that the song's success might alienate older fans, Buck told Rolling Stone, [...] "The people that changed their minds because of 'Losing My Religion' can just kiss my ass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kaidan (怪談), which {{literally}} means “supernatural tale” or [...] "weird tale", {{is a form}} of Japanese ghost story. Kaidan {{entered the}} vernacular when a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular in the Edo period. The popularity of the game, as well as the acquisition of a printing press, {{led to the creation of}} a literary genre called Kaidanshu. Kaidan are not always horror stories, they can [...] "be funny, or strange, or just telling about <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> that happened one time".|$|E
2500|$|Davidson had {{the actors}} {{who played in}} Eddie's band rehearse {{as if they were}} getting ready for a real concert. Pare remembers, [...] "The first time we played {{together}} - as a band - was a college concert. <b>An</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> happened. At first, the extras simply did what they were told. Then, as the music heated up, so did the audience. They weren't play-acting anymore. The screaming, stomping and applause became spontaneous." [...] Davidson recalls, [...] "One by one, kids began standing up in their seats, screaming and raising their hands in rhythmic applause. A few girls made a dash for the stage, tearing at Michael's shirt. We certainly hadn't told them to do that. But we kept the cameras rolling." [...] Additionally, New Jersey musician Southside Johnny was hired as a technical advisor for the film.|$|E

2500|$|Commenting to Digital Spy {{about her}} return, Lawrence said: [...] "I've {{not been in}} the show for 11 years and it's not like I've ever thought [...] "I'll never go back", you just think that your chance to go back has gone. It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{gave him}} a couple of tolerably juicy buffets before he legged it. I say, Wooster, that kid said <b>a</b> dashed <b>odd</b> <b>thing.</b> He yelled out {{something}} about Jeeves promising him a dollar if he called me--er--what he said." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucie {{scrambled}} up the stile with the bundle in her hand; {{and then she}} turned to say [...] "Good-night," [...] and to thank the washer-woman.--But what <b>a</b> VERY <b>odd</b> <b>thing!</b> Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill! ...|$|R
6000|$|Henrietta gave {{a little}} sigh, but did not answer: and Beatrice said, [...] "It is <b>a</b> very <b>odd</b> <b>thing,</b> {{whenever}} any work of art--or, what shall I call it?--is well done, it is apt {{to have so much}} more in it than the author intended. It is so in poetry, painting, and everything else." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will look}} after it for you," [...] I said. [...] "You can {{leave it in}} my hands. It is rather <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing,</b> but I believe that I have met this man in Paris." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lucie {{scrambled}} up the stile with the bundle in her hand; {{and then she}} turned to say, [...] "Good-Night," [...] and to thank the washer-woman-- But what <b>a</b> very <b>odd</b> <b>thing!</b> Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill! She was running running running up the hill--and Where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He died," [...] {{the young}} man explained. [...] "It was {{just about the time}} that the Earl was ill himself. His Lordship gave orders that the body was to be buried and the room locked up, in case the old chap's heirs should come along. Seems he'd brought <b>a</b> few <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> of his own over--nothing {{whatever}} of any value.

6000|$|... 'This {{is such an}} {{extremely}} singular lad!' replied Mr. Pickwick, looking uneasily at the boy. 'It seems <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> to say, but upon my word I am afraid that, at times, he is a little deranged.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you stick}} to it? By all means. Tell--the truth--and stick to it. It's always safest. Now, don't {{you think it}} was rather <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> for an officer's {{daughter}} to do--to run about Germany as maid to a lady of title?' ...|$|E
60|$|Next day, however, <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> occurred. We strolled out together, {{all four}} of us, {{along the banks of}} the lake, among woods just carpeted with strange, {{triangular}} flowers--trilliums, Mrs. Quackenboss called them--and lined with delicate ferns in the first green of springtide.|$|E
60|$|But Asad did not respond. He {{sat there}} in a gloomy abstraction, staring {{straight}} before him. At last he sighed wearily. He was just, and he had <b>a</b> conscience, as <b>odd</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as it was awkward in a corsair Basha.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Creem, Jagger said, [...] ", I thought it was <b>a</b> really <b>odd</b> <b>thing,</b> because it was only one song, after all.

6000|$|... "Just {{these poor}} shavelings, madame," [...] he answered, and {{he raised his}} hand again and made a sign.

60|$|Presently {{he noticed}} as <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> {{that it was}} {{undoubtedly}} out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; {{it was such a}} gallant piece of paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] he went on, after a pause, [...] "I {{have been}} negligent. The fact is-- it isn't {{a case of}} ghosts or apparitions--but--it's <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> to tell of, Redmond--I am haunted. I am haunted by something--that rather takes the light out of things, that fills me with longings..." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Creem, Jagger said, [...] "people started taking us as devil worshippers, I thought it was <b>a</b> really <b>odd</b> <b>thing,</b> because it was only one song, after all.

6000|$|... "It's <b>a</b> very <b>odd</b> <b>thing,</b> sir," [...] he continued. [...] "A person {{arrived here}} with a small bag a little time ago and {{presented}} your card,--said that you had given him permission to sleep in your room.

I thought that as you were here this evening, you would have told us if you had proposed lending it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cricket {{correspondent}} Colin Bateman remarked, [...] "Hendrick was {{a lively}} fast-medium seam bowler who could produce plenty of bounce to trouble county batsmen. His 770 first-class wickets came at an impressive cost of just 20 apiece". Bateman added, [...] "he loved to pin batsmen {{down with his}} accuracy and force errors, {{and to do so}} he bowled negatively and slightly short - too short to take wickets consistently at the top level". Which is <b>a</b> rather <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> to say of a player who took 87 test wickets at 25 runs apiece.|$|R
6000|$|And then <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> happened. As {{they were}} {{preparing}} to leave the school, the door opened a little and there appeared in the aperture the face of Tommy, tear-stained but excited.

6000|$|He {{was strangely}} supported, it struck him, in his fixed smile; {{which was the}} more fixed as he felt in these last words an exact {{description}} of his course.

5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} in 1991 that Brown said that force could {{be necessary to}} restore stability in the Middle East and keep nuclear weapons {{from the hands of}} Saddam Hussein. [...] "It's <b>a</b> real <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> for <b>an</b> old anti-war person to be thinking, but there are wars and there are wars," [...] said Brown. [...] "Every time I hear a parallel to Vietnam, I blanch. I see the movement people gearing up, the same familiar faces, and I want to say, 'Hold on, hold on.' It's a wholly different situation that needs to be analyzed on its own merits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Fagin, {{when they}} had left the room, 'I'll go and get you that cash, Nancy.

Listen!' ...|$|R

I could not turn {{any of the other}} handles; I think that they are all shams," [...] said Duchess, [...] "but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!" ...|$|R
