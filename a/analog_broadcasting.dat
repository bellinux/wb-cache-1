25|$|At 1:00a.m. on September 10, 1995, WCIX and WTVJ swapped channel positions. The entire WCIX {{intellectual}} unit (CBS affiliation, {{programming and}} staff) moved from channel 6 to channel 4, effectively returning CBS programming to channel 4 after a six-year hiatus. WTVJ had been Miami's CBS affiliate from its sign-on in March 1949 until the 1989 switch to NBC. Along with the frequency change came {{a new set}} of call letters, WFOR-TV, changing the reference to the station's channel number from its original allocation to its new one. Due to the way the asset exchange deal was structured, the two stations were required to swap licenses in addition to the transmitting facilities. As a result, WFOR-TV legally operated under WTVJ's old license on channel 4 {{through the end of the}} <b>analog</b> <b>broadcasting</b> era; however, the studios of both WFOR-TV and WTVJ remained the same at the time of the swap (WTVJ has since moved to a new facility).|$|E
2500|$|At 1am on Sunday, September 10, 1995, WTVJ and WCIX swapped channel positions. WTVJ's entire {{intellectual}} unit (calls, shows, NBC network, and staff) {{moved from}} channel 4 to channel 6, while the intellectual unit of WCIX, which changed its calls accordingly to WFOR-TV, moved to channel 4. However, both stations' retained their respective existing studio facilities. Due to {{the manner in}} which the transfer was structured, the two stations were required to swap licenses in addition to their transmitting facilities. As a result, WTVJ legally operated under the old WCIX license until the end of the <b>analog</b> <b>broadcasting</b> era. This move led to WPTV picking up market share of NBC programming in Broward County from WTVJ, as WTVJ moved its transmitter from its longtime home on the Broward–Dade county line to WCIX's former transmitter in Homestead (about [...] south of Miami). WPTV's signal in Fort Lauderdale is actually closer to city-grade than WTVJ's (though it still transmits a Grade B signal in the area).|$|E
