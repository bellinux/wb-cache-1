The material {{on either side of the}} interface may have large differences in mechanical properties which could leave the interface vulnerable to microcrack initiation during loading. Since this may lead to catastrophic failure of the composite, it is essential to understand the mechanical behavior of the fiber-matix interfaces at a microscopic level. It has been observed that in many cases the interface is not discontinuous, but rather forms a continuum of three dimensional interphases wherein the material properties vary gradually over a distance of a few microns.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{invention}} of the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM), a key objective has been the enhancement of the resolution in the acoustic images. This challenge has generally been pursued with two directions for approaches: one approach was to raise the acoustic frequency. B. Hadimiooglu and C. F. Quate achieved a resolution of 0. 2 micron by operating at about 4. 4 GHz with the sample in boiling water in order to minimize the attenuation of the coupling medium [1]. A second approach has been to use low velocity coupling media such as super-fluid liquid helium. J. S. Foster and D. Ruger were able to obtain a resolution of 20 nano-meters using super-fluid liquid helium as coupling medium at a temperature of 0. 2 ° K [2]. These techniques are excellent for increasing resolution on the surface of a specimen but not necessarily in its interior. In the first approach described above, the ultrasonic wave is attenuated in proportion to the square of its frequency. Therefore, when the high frequency ultrasonic wave is used as a probe, the wave may not penetrate the inside of the specimen, so that internal information may not be obtained. In the second technique, also referred to as cryogenic <b>microscopy,</b> the <b>acoustic</b> impedance between the coupler and the specimen are very different, so that most of the ultrasonic waves are reflected at the interface between the coupler and the specimen, and it is unlikely that an image from any significant depth may be obtained. Hence, <b>acoustic</b> <b>microscopy’s</b> most important and unique feature, namely obtaining subsurface information may not be realized by these two approaches...|$|R
