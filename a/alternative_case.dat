50|$|In {{their call}} for {{research}} {{to move its}} focus toward bona fide groups, Putnam and Stohl argued that this model is more ecologically valid than <b>alternative</b> <b>case</b> studies, and as such, it gives a more accurate reading of how small groups behave on a day-to-day basis. Furthermore, since it had already helped develop current research settings, methods, and variables, it most certainly will continue to shape small group communication studies. In the time since this initial argument was proposed, social scientists have generally agreed with Putnam and Stohl, and have redirected much of their research to emphasize bona fide groups {{as a model of}} small group communication.|$|E

50|$|Returning to {{the issue}} of {{information}} asymmetry between incumbent and entrant, Milgrom and Roberts (1982b) consider the <b>alternative</b> <b>case</b> when the entrant is uncertain about the incumbent’s costs. In this case, they show that the incumbent’s low prices signal that its costs are low too, and so are the target’s long term prospects from entry. Like Milgrom and Roberts (1982a), this paper brought formal understanding to an old idea in industrial organization, this time the concept of limit pricing. In the process of doing so, the paper also uncovered new results of interest. In particular, Milgrom and Roberts (1982b) show that the equilibrium entry rate may actually increase when asymmetric information is introduced.|$|E

40|$|The block {{type and}} {{structural}} systems in buildings affect {{the amount of}} building materials required {{as well as the}} CO 2 emissions that occur throughout the building life cycle (LCCO 2).

The quantity of building materials used and building energy simulations were analyzed for each block type using building information modeling techniques, and improvements in LCCO 2 emission were calculated by considering high-strength concrete alternatives.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Waste Management Facility Accident Analysis (WASTE{underscore}ACC) software, which was developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{to support the}} US Department of Energy`s (DOE`s) Waste Management (WM) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). WASTE{underscore}ACC is a decision support and database system that is compatible with Microsoft{reg_sign} Windows{trademark}. It assesses potential atmospheric releases from accidents at waste management facilities. The software provides the user with an easy-to-use tool to determine the risk-dominant accident sequences for the many possible combinations of process technologies, waste and facility types, and <b>alternative</b> <b>cases</b> described in the WM PEIS. In addition, its structure will allow additional <b>alternative</b> <b>cases</b> and assumptions to be tested {{as part of the}} future DOE programmatic decision-making process. The WASTE{underscore}ACC system demonstrates one approach to performing a generic, systemwide evaluation of accident risks at waste management facilities. The advantages of WASTE{underscore}ACC are threefold. First, the software gets waste volume and radiological profile data that were used to perform other WM PEIS-related analyses directly from the WASTE{underscore}MGMT system. Second, the system allows for a consistent analysis across all sites and waste streams, which enables decision makers to understand more fully the trade-offs among various policy options and scenarios. Third, the system is easy to operate; even complex scenario runs are completed within minutes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to: Develop a baseline design and two alternative designs for indirect liquefaction using advanced F-T technology.

There is an <b>alternative</b> refining <b>case</b> using ZSM- 5 treatment of the vapor steam from the flurry F-T reactor and an <b>alternative</b> coal <b>case</b> using Western coal from the Powder River Basin. Prepare the capital and operating costs for the baseline design and the alternatives.

40|$|A Global Energy Market model (GEM) is used {{to analyze}} the market shares (i. e. the primary energy mix) of gases, liquids and solids in the Asia Pacific. The model is {{successful}} in matching the historical energy mix from 1850 to 2009. The model also provides a good match of the hydrogen to carbon ratio, which is a proxy for environmental quality. Given these validations, the GEM is then used to present scenarios of the Asia Pacific energy mix and hydrogen to carbon ratio until the year 2030. Three energy mix scenarios are presented - reference case; <b>alternative</b> <b>case</b> 1; <b>alternative</b> <b>case</b> 2. The reference case assumes limited divergence from current policies and technologies. It indicates that Asia Pacific energy needs will be met by approximately 46 % solids, 34 % liquids, and 20 % gases by 2030. Alternative cases 1 and 2 represent policies and technologies that either encourage or discourage the use of gases. The good matches observed for historical data suggest the GEM can be used cautiously for evaluating outcomes and opportunities in the region. Although the model can be used for projecting far into the future, it is currently calibrated to what we consider a reasonable time horizon – until the year 2030. Given appropriate energy policies and sufficient technological advancement, the importance of natural gas in the region could increase significantly...|$|E
