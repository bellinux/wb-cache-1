40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{effects of}} {{polished}} and dehulled Bacillus-fermented <b>adlay</b> on lipid metabolism, antioxidant status and intestinal microflora {{were examined in}} hyperlipidaemic hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet. RESULTS: Hamsters administered Bacillus-fermented <b>adlay</b> experienced significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) serum and hepatic total cholesterol (by 37 - 43 % and 42 - 49 % respectively) and triglyceride (by 22 - 27 % and 30 - 35 % respectively) levels compared with the high-cholesterol group. Lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios in serum and increased cholesterol (by 47 - 52 %) and triglyceride (by 40 - 47 %) contents in faeces were also observed. Bacillus-fermented <b>adlay</b> lowered the levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, thus increasing total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase activities. In particular, polished Bacillus-fermented <b>adlay</b> had satisfactory antioxidant activity, {{similar to that of}} commercially available natto.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the protective effects of gamma irradiation against postharvest insect damage and microbial contamination {{and its effect}} on the nutritive value of <b>adlay</b> (Coix lacryma-jobi L.). <b>Adlay</b> was treated with doses of 0 - 20 kGy gamma irradiation and subsequently stored at ambient temperature. The number of insects, microbial quality and chemical properties of irradiated and non-irradiated <b>adlay</b> were evaluated immediately after treatment and after 6 months of storage. Before irradiation, total aerobic microbial counts ranged from 5. 6 x 10 (2) to 1. 4 x 10 (5) CFUg(- 1) and the mean total number of insects was 3. 2 +/- 2. 1 per 100 g of polished kernel. Two kilograys was the lowest dose that provided 100 % insect control. A radiation-resistant bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans RC 1, was found in 2 of 10 <b>adlay</b> samples. Four kilograys was a sufficient dose for Enterobacteriaceae inactivation, and 6 kGy was a sufficient dose for yeast and fungi inactivation. Twenty and 8 kGy sufficed for the inactivation of all mesophilic microbes in samples with and without D. radiodurans, separately. Moreover the moisture, ash, crude fiber, crude fat, crude protein and riboflavin content all remained constant. However, 8 kGy irradiation reduced vitamin B 1 concentration by 24. 2 %, but did not measurably reduce the amount of amino acids, except methionine and cysteine. Fatty acid contents did not alter after 8 kGy irradiation, but changes were observed after the 6 months of storage. These changes caused by irradiation were no greater than those caused by the 6 -month storage. Irradiation up to 8 kGy did not markedly increase the acid value, but did increase the peroxide value to 13 % of the initial value right after irradiation. However, significant changes in acid value and peroxide value were noted after 6 months of storage both in non-irradiated and post-irradiated storage samples. Additionally, 8 kGy irradiation did not significantly change the <b>adlay</b> appearance. The improvement in the hygiene of this vital food source compensates for the small loss of some nutritional constituents. Hence 8 kGy of gamma irradiation can be used in cold decontamination of <b>adlay</b> to prolong shelf-life, to improve postharvest quality, and {{to reduce the risk of}} food-borne disease.

40|$|ABSTRACTAdlay (薏苡 yì yĭ; “soft-shelled job’s tears”, {{the seeds}} of Coix lachryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen Stapf) is a grass crop {{that has long been}} used in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine (TCM) and as a nourishing food in China for the treatment of warts, chapped skin, rheumatism, neuralgia, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases. In addition, <b>adlay</b> also has been said to have stomachic, diuretic, antipholgistic, anodynic, and antispasmodic effects. Carcinogenesis is a multistage process that begins with exposure of viruses or chemicals that are found in the environment. Chemoprevention refers to the use of natural or synthetic, non-toxic chemical substances to reverse, repress, or prevent carcinogenesis. In this review, we summarize recent research attempting to study the chemopreventive blocking and suppressing potential of <b>adlay</b> and its active components in scavenging electrophiles and reactive oxygen species, antimutagenicity, enhancing Nrf 2 -mediated detoxification and antioxidant effect, altering carcinogen metabolism, suppressing proliferation, decreasing inflammation, and enhancing antitumor immunity.

40|$|<b>Adlay</b> seed {{samples were}} {{collected}} from three <b>adlay</b> growing regions (Yeoncheon, Hwasun, and Eumseong region) in Korea during 2012. Among all the samples collected, 400 seeds were tested for fungal occurrence by standard blotter and test tube agar methods and different taxonomic groups of fungal genera were detected. The most predominant fungal genera encountered were Fusarium, Phoma, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Cochliobolus and Leptosphaerulina. Fusarium species accounted for 45. 6 % of all species found; and, with phylogenetic analysis based on the combined sequences of two protein coding genes (EF- 1 α and β-tubulin), 10 Fusarium species were characterized namely, F. incarnatum (11. 67 %), F. kyushuense (10. 33 %), F. fujikuroi (8. 67 %), F. concentricum (6. 00 %), F. asiaticum (5. 67 %), F. graminearum (1. 67 %), F. miscanthi (0. 67 %), F. polyphialidicum (0. 33 %), F. armeniacum (0. 33 %), and F. thapsinum (0. 33 %). The Fusarium species were then examined for their morphological characteristics to confirm their identity. Morphological observations of the species correlated well with and confirmed their molecular identification. The ability of these isolates to produce the mycotoxins fumonisin (FUM) and zearalenone (ZEN) was tested by the ELISA quantitative analysis method. The result revealed that FUM was produced only by F. fujikuroi and that ZEN was produced by F. asiaticum and F. graminearum...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Monascus <b>Adlay</b> (MA) {{prepared}} from fungal fermentation of Monascus purpureus inoculating with cooked <b>adlay</b> contains high {{content of}} monakolin K (MK) and phenolic compounds. We explored whether MA and MK improve FeCl 3 -induced arterial thrombosis in rats. Methods: The rats {{were divided into}} control, FeCl 3 -treated rat carotid artery occlusion (TTO), TTO determined with one-week MA, and TTO determined with one-week MK. We compared MA or MK effects on oxidative stress by chemiluminescence amplification and immunohistochemistry, TTO by a transonic system, NF&#x 03 BA;B, ICAM- 1, endoplasmic reticulum stress CHOP and Nrf 2 signaling by western blotting. Results: MA or MK efficiently depressed O 2 -, H 2 O 2 and HOCl levels, platelet activation and aggregation and H 2 O 2 -enhanced ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 expression in the endothelial cells. FeCl 3 significantly increased NF&#x 03 BA;B p 65, 3 -nitrotyrosine, CHOP and ICAM- 1 expression, and decreased nuclear Nrf 2 translocation and induces arterial thrombus formation. MA or MK pretreatment significantly elongated the level of FeCl 3 -induced TTO compared to TTO group, significantly decreased proinflammatory NF-&#x 03 BA;B/ICAM- 1 signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress CHOP expression and decreased thrombotic area. MA or MK significantly preserved nuclear Nrf 2 translocation. MA and MK exerted a similar protective effect in attenuating thrombus formation.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} whether four grains including <b>adlay</b> (AD), buckwheat (BW), glutinous barley (GB), and white rice (WR) affect {{the duration of}} food residence in the gastrointestinal tract and hepatic enzyme activities in rats fed different combinations of the grains. The rats were raised for 4 weeks on a high fat diet based on the American Institute of Nutrition- 93 (AIN- 93 G) diets containing 1 % cholesterol and 20 % dietary lipids. Forty male rats were divided into four groups and raised for 4 weeks with a diet containing one of the grains. Corresponding to the dietary fiber contents of the experimental grains, gut transit time was shortest in the rats fed GB and increased {{in the order of}} BW, AD, and WR. In addition, the accumulated shortest transit time occurred in the GB group. Gut transit time affected weight gain and major organ weight, as it was closely related to the absorption of nutrients. The level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) in liver was higher in rats fed WR, AD, BW, and GB, indicating that the other grains decreased oxidative stress in vivo more than WR. Glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase levels in the AD, BW, and GB groups were significantly higher than those in the WR group. In conclusion, reduced colonic transit time has been implicated in reducing the incidence of colon cancer, as evidenced by populations consuming diets rich in fiber. Whole grains such as AD, BW, and GB may contribute to a significant supply of antioxidants to prevent oxidative stress if they are consumed in large amounts.
