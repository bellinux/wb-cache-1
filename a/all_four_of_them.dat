5|$|Shoshone National Forest {{forms the}} eastern {{boundary}} of Yellowstone National Park and the northeastern and eastern entrances {{to the park}} are both accessed by way of designated scenic roadways. A federally designated National Scenic Byways All-American Road, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212), weaves through the forest and serves as the northeastern entranceway to Yellowstone National Park. Chief Joseph Scenic Byway (Wyoming Highway 296) connects Cody, Wyoming with the Beartooth Highway and follows the old trail in which Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe attempted to flee the U.S. Cavalry in 1877. South of there, Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway (US 14/16/20) heads west from Cody, Wyoming, passes through the forest and crosses Sylvan Pass as it enters Yellowstone. Lastly, the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway (US 26/287) heads northwest from Dubois, Wyoming, over Togwotee Pass and enters Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Though the Beartooth Highway {{is the only one}} of these four roads that is a National Scenic Byway, <b>all</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have been designated Wyoming State Scenic Byways by the state of Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Brett's replacement, Major General George Kenney, {{arrived in}} the theater in August, and Walker was {{appointed}} Commanding General, V Bomber Command, Fifth Air Force on 3 September, with his headquarters in Townsville. At this time, Port Moresby was subject to frequent Japanese air raids, so the bombers were generally based in the Townsville area and staged through Port Moresby to minimize their chance of loss or damage on the ground. In mid-September 1942, {{at the height of}} the Kokoda Track campaign, Kenney sent Walker to Port Moresby for a few weeks to direct the advanced echelon, to give Whitehead a rest and Walker more experience. Walker attempted to lift morale by improving the men's living conditions. He made a point of small gestures of fellowship, such as standing in line with the men at meal times. But what endeared him most to his men was his willingness to share the dangers as well as their hardships, by flying a mission a week on average. In October, General Douglas MacArthur gave Kenney a dressing down for flying over the Owen Stanley Range. In turn, Kenney ordered Walker, Wilson and Whitehead not to fly any more missions. For a variety of reasons, <b>all</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> eventually disobeyed their orders.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The heterobranch {{gastropod}} family Glacidorbidae (?Pulmonata) {{is known}} only from temperate Australia and Chile. The Australian taxa are reviewed and three new genera, Benthodorbis, Striadorbis and Tasmodorbis are described based on {{differences in their}} shells, especially the protoconchs, and in their opercula and radulae.

25|$|By the 1966-67 season, the {{interest}} in cricket in India had risen to unprecedented levels. Despite being beaten by the West Indies at home, the Indian team's spirits were not dampened. The captain Nawab of Pataudi {{thought that it would}} be a good idea to introduce more quality spinners into the team in order to compensate for the absence of good new-ball bowlers in the country. Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, the leg spinner, had already established his place in the team with solid performances against Australia and the West Indies. Erapalli Prasanna was making him comeback having been out of the team for five years, while both Venkatarghavan and Bedi played in the series against West Indies. <b>All</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> played their first (and only game together) against England at Birmingham in the summer of 1967. Prasanna and Chandrasekhar impressed in that game, claiming 7 and 6 wickets respectively, and all four bowlers bowled a tight line. Even though these four bowlers continued to play for 11 more years, this remained the only Test where all of them featured in the Indian test XI.|$|E
25|$|As of {{the colonial}} period, Texas was largely divided between 6 culture groups. The Caddoan peoples {{occupied}} the area surrounding {{the entire length of}} the Red River. Although they are considered the progenitors of the Mississippian culture, their influence within it was much weaker and had largely passed to the Muskogean tribes of the American southeast. Upon contact with Europeans, they formed four collective confederacies known as the Natchitoches (Natchez), the Hasinai, the Wichita & the Kadohadocho (Caddo). <b>All</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> held some land in what is now Texas. Along the Gulf Coast region were the Atakapa tribes, with at least one Coahuiltecan tribe (a culture group primarily from Northeast Mexico) a little further west on the Rio Grande. Largely between the Rio Grande & Peco River were the Puebloan peoples, part of an extensive civilization of tribes that lived in what are now the states of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado & Utah. While the northern-most groups faced a cultural collapse due to a drought, many of the southern tribes survive to the present. North of the Pueblos were the Apachean tribes. Although commonly referred to as one, single nation, they are actually a culture group. North of the Apacheans, in the Northern Panhandle region, were the Comanches.|$|E
25|$|In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Captain Britain is {{a member}} of the European Defense Initiative (the EU {{equivalent}} of the Ultimates), along with Captain Italy, Captain France, Captain Spain and several unnamed members most likely from other European countries, all of whom have the same powers: flight, super strength and a force field. <b>All</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> developed their powers from the super powered exo-suits developed by Professor Sir James Braddock, who oversees the EDI super soldier program. Captain Britain and the other members of European Defense Initiative helped the Ultimates track down and contain Thor and they released the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man and the X-Men during the Liberators' attack on America. They are also seen helping to pull up the Statue of Liberty after the battle is over. During Ultimatum, Captain Britain (along with other Captains) is discussing how to take action against Magneto in the Houses of Parliament. However, Multiple Man bursts in and sets off a bomb, destroying the Houses of Parliament and everyone inside. His status is unknown on panel, although he was listed in the in memoriam section at the end of Ultimatum #5. He survived the attack at the Houses of Parliament, although he succumbed to the cancer caused by using one of the first versions of the Captain Britain suit, and his brother James took the mantle of Captain Britain.|$|E

[...] A labor-affiliated group praised the episode [...] "Boys and Girls" [...] for what it considered an unusually frank depiction of union busting on American television.

Mạnh was accused of nepotism and of establishing a patronage system for himself within the party and state; his son Nông Quốc Tuấn was elected as Head of Youth Organizations in March 2005, and was thus entitled to attend the 10th Congress.
