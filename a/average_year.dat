A decrease in <b>average</b> <b>years</b> of life lost due to cervical cancer (37. 4 %) and an increase in <b>average</b> <b>years</b> of life lost due breast cancer (8. 9 %) was observed during the period studied. <b>Average</b> <b>years</b> of life lost due to cervical cancer was greater among women living in areas with a high marginalization index, while <b>average</b> <b>years</b> of life lost due to breast cancer was greater in women from areas with a low marginalization index...|$|R

The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of 235 lunar months in 19 years since 499 BC (with only three exceptions before 380 BC), {{but it did not}} use a specified number of days.

This paper aims at {{examining}} {{the relationship between}} <b>average</b> <b>years</b> of total schooling and GDP per capita for six middle-income countries over the period 1950 - 2010.

According to the output from estimations, GDP per capita is positively related to <b>average</b> <b>years</b> of total schooling {{and there is a}} bidirectional causality between variables.

25|$|Historically, Israel {{had about}} 1,780 million {{cubic meters of}} {{conventional}} freshwater and brackish water resources at its disposal in an <b>average</b> <b>year.</b> More than half of these resources consisted of inflows from the Golan Heights (275 million), Lebanon (310 million) and the West Bank (345 million). 92 percent of the conventional water resources were considered economically exploitable, the rest being excess floodwaters. The usable amount consisted of about 1.1 billion cubic meters of groundwater and springs and 0.6 billion from surface water. About 80% of the water resources {{are located in the}} North of the country and only 20% in the South. However, average rainfall has declined, possibly as a result of climate change, so that conventional water resources are now estimated at less than 1,336 million cubic meters in an <b>average</b> <b>year</b> (arithmetic mean) over the period 1975–2011. The median was even lower at 1,202 million cubic meters per year.|$|E

25|$|Rabbinic {{tradition}} ascribes to him an enactment {{which proved}} of incalculable benefit to his coreligionists {{of his own}} and of subsequent generations. The Jewish calendar is lunisolar.

The purpose of the latter is to ensure that the festivals, all of which occur on fixed dates of the lunar months, are also observed each year in the seasons designated for them in the Bible. To ensure the former, occasional intercalations of a day in a month were required; to ensure the latter, occasional intercalations of an extra month in a year were required.|$|E
25|$|Successive {{years of}} drought from 1998–2002 had {{dramatically}} lowered water levels {{in all of}} the main reservoirs. 1998–1999 was the worst drought year in Israel for the past 100 years. The following years were also characterized by less than average rainfall which led to a shortfall of some half a billion cubic meters in Israel's water balance each year, in comparison to an <b>average</b> <b>year.</b> The winters of 2002–03 and 2003–04 were characterized by average and higher than average rainfall which led to a significant rise in the water level of the Sea of Galilee and in the collection of floodwater in catchment reservoirs. However, the country's aquifers have remained depleted. It was estimated in 2003 that increased water demand and decreased water availability has led to a cumulative deficit of nearly 2 billion cubic metres. In 2008 another drought occurred.|$|E

25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Israel are intricately {{linked to the}} historical development of Israel. Because rain falls only in the winter, and largely {{in the northern part of}} the country, irrigation and water engineering are considered vital to the country's economic survival and growth. Large scale projects to desalinate seawater, direct water from rivers and reservoirs in the north, make optimal use of groundwater, and reclaim flood overflow and sewage have been undertaken. Among them is the National Water Carrier, carrying water from the country's biggest freshwater lake, the Sea of Galilee, to the northern Negev desert through channels, pipes and tunnels. Israel's water demand today outstrips available conventional water resources. Thus, in an <b>average</b> <b>year,</b> Israel relies for about half of its water supply on unconventional water resources, including reclaimed water and desalination. A particularly long drought in 1998–2002 had prompted the government to promote large-scale seawater desalination.|$|E
25|$|Water use {{is about}} 83.5 km3, or 20% of water {{availability}} in an <b>average</b> <b>year.</b> However, {{there are large}} variations in the utilization rate between years and regions. For example, in the coastal part of the Kantō region that includes Tokyo the utilization rate is over 90% in a dry year. In the relatively dry north of Kyushu {{it is more than}} 50%. Of the total use 55.2 km3 was for agriculture, 16.2 km3 for domestic use and 12.1 km3 for industrial use. Despite the introduction of water-saving devices domestic per capita use declined only slightly from 322 liter per capita per day in 2000 to 314 in 2004. Per capita water use thus is slightly lower than in the United States (371 liter in 2005) and more than twice as high as in Germany (122 liter in 2007) or in England (145 liter in 2009).|$|E
25|$|National {{overview}} of water resources. Water resources are scarce in Burkina Faso. Water availability varies greatly between regions and seasons, {{as well as}} from year to year. In the South, average rainfall is as high as 1,200mm during a six-month wet season, while in the North the wet season lasts only three months and rainfall is only 300mm. The only rivers in the country that carry water all year around are the Mouhoun River (Black Volta) and the Nakambe River (White Volta), the other rivers carrying water only during the wet season. Building dams has been the most common way of storing water for the dry season, even though evaporation can reach 2,000mm/year thus causing substantial water losses from open reservoirs. A substantial portion of surface water resources is shared with neighboring countries. For example, the Nakambe River - the main source of supply for the capital, Ouagadougou - and the Mouhoun River are shared with Ghana. Surface water resources vary between 8 billion cubic meters (BCM)/year in an <b>average</b> <b>year</b> and 4 BCM in a dry year. The lower figure corresponds to less than 300 cubic meters per capita and year, which is well below the level of 1,000 cubic meters per capita and year that is considered the threshold for “water stress”.|$|E
