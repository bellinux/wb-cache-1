5000|$|In Neoclassical terms, a {{commodity}} {{is a good}} or service that can be traded or exchanged in the marketplace for another commodity or money,. Commodification is routed in Marxist political theory and entails {{the creation of an}} ‘economic good’ that previously was not prescribed an economic value. This takes place through the application of market mechanisms with the intended result being a standardized class of goods or services. Once commodified an economic good can be bought or sold at a price determined by market exchange, and as such market values replace social values previously attached to the good. It is this transformation from a public good to an economic good that neoliberals claim leads to better management and allocation of a resource, such as water. In accordance with welfare economics, this view infers the more efficiently managed a resource is the higher a society’s welfare. This neoliberal sentiment of water as an economic good not unlike any other is visible in a quote from The Economist: “Only by <b>accepting</b> <b>water</b> as a tradable commodity will sensible decisions be possible” (The Economist, 1992) ...|$|E
40|$|Molecular level {{insight into}} water {{structure}} and structural dynamics near proteins, lipids and nucleic acids {{is critical to}} the quantitative understanding of many biophysical processes. Un- fortunately, understanding hydration and hydration dynamics around such large molecules is challenging because of the necessity of deconvoluting the effects of topography and chemical heterogeneity. Here we study, via classical all atom simulation, water structure and structural dynamics around two biologically relevant solutes large enough to have significant chemical and topological heterogeneity but small enough to be computationally tractable: the disaccharides Kojibiose and Trehalose. We find both molecules to be strongly amphiphilic (as quantified from normalized local density fluctuations) and to induce nonuniform local slowdown in water translational and rotational motion. Detailed analysis of the rotational slowdown shows that while the rotational mechanism is similar to that previously identified in other aqueous systems by Laage, Hynes and coworkers, two novel characteristics are observed: broadening of the transition state during hydrogen bond exchange (water rotation) and a subpopulation of water for which rotation is slowed because of hindered access of the new <b>accepting</b> <b>water</b> molecule to the transition state. Both of these characteristics are expected to be generic features of water rotation around larger biomolecules and, taken together, emphasize the difficulty in transferring insight into water rotation around small molecules to much larger amphiphilic solutes.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to design a test to {{ascertain}} the behaviour and reliability of a membrane used in drug release and simulated absorption tests in order to arrive at useful indications for simulating topical as well as gastro-intestinal absorption. The membrane can be used in two different conditions: a) as a simple porous membrane placed between the ointment and an accepting liquid phase, generally water phase; b) as a membrane soaked in a lipophilic liquid phase to simulate the horny layer between the ointment and <b>accepting</b> <b>water</b> phase. In this study the "bubble point test” was used to test the integrity of the soaking film as well as the membrane, during and after drug release and simulated absorption tests with different types of ointment. In the case of a drug release test from an ointment, the bubble point test may determine the test conditions, that is the ointment applied to either a dry or hydrated membrane. Only use of a previously hydrated membrane can guarantee constant conditions in the in vitro model. Use of a dry membrane may lead to infiltration of liquid components of the ointment base, thus altering the contact conditions between the two phases of the cutaneous compartment model (lipogel and A/O creams). The use of a hydrated membrane may also lead to interactions between the two phases of the compartment, with osmotic exchanges between the acceptor phase and ointment sample (hydrogel, PEG gel, O/A creams). The hydrated membrane is therefore reliable only for comparison between lipophilic base ointments. In a simulated absorption test, determination of the bubble point makes it possible to ascertain the physical integrity of the lipoid liquid film immobilized by capillary action in the inner microporous structure of the membrane during the test. This condition is essential to maintain a balance between the parameters regulating the diffusion process between the different compartments of the system. The use of a lipoid-soaked membrane makes it possible to avoid interactions between the ointment sample and aqueous acceptor phase, such as hydrosoluble bases. Since the diffusion across a lipoid film immobilised within a porous membrane depends on the drug release rate from the ointment base, the test allows a contextual evaluation of the release kinetics as well as an indication of the drug absorption possibilities through an in vitro model of the cutaneous compartment...|$|E

50|$|A {{dry well}} is a passive structure. Water flows through {{it under the}} {{influence}} of gravity. A dry well receives water from one or more entry pipes or channels at its top and discharges the same water through a number of small exit openings distributed over a larger surface area in the side(s) and bottom of the dry well. When a dry well is above the water table, most of its internal volume will contain air. Such a dry well can accept an initial inrush of water very quickly, until the air is displaced. After that, the dry well can only <b>accept</b> <b>water</b> as fast as it can dissipate water. Some dry wells deliberately incorporate a large storage capacity, so that they can accept a large amount of water very quickly and then dissipate it gradually over time, a method that is compatible with the intermittent nature of rainfall. A dry well maintains the connection between its inflow and outflow openings by resisting collapse and resisting clogging.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{water balance}} is {{important}} for planning the agriculture crop production because it can assess the water shortage and the water excess or the water demand of each river basin area. This helps improve efficiency of the current and future watershed management. Soil and Water Assessment or SWAT is a mathematical model which is the method of the water balance assessment. It is reliable and internationally <b>accepted</b> <b>water</b> model. This article introduced the SWAT model to evaluate the water balance of the 25 watersheds in Thailand within one month ago and seven days and six hours in advance. It uses the real rainfall data from the rainfall gauging stations for the backward period and the forecast rainfall data from WRF weather model maps for the forward period. This system is the automatic process as scheduled. The outcomes of this system are the water balance data displayed as the text files and the water balance maps in order that this information are simple to apply for planning the water management.

40|$|Executive Summary: Groundwater cooling is an {{appropriate}} and sustainable heat rejection technology for the Pawsey Supercomputer Centre. It makes use of the local Mullaloo aquifer system which is able to provide cool groundwater at high and reliable flow rates, and is readily able to <b>accept</b> <b>water</b> warmed by excess heat. This report has considered a range of engineered pumping system designs and has identified a pumping layout that provides maximum longevity and flexibility of thermal performance with minimal capital requirements for borefield construction. The basic design involves production-injection well doublets. Flow net analysis has shown that shielding wells placed between production and injection wells provide a useful buffer against thermal breakthrough which promotes longevity of heat rejection. Hydrothermal simulations indicate that shielded configurations reduce or delay thermal breakthroughs and hence provide greater energy efficiencies for groundwater cooling systems as compared to unshielded configurations, but at the capital expense of extra injection wells and pipe runs. Based on the findings above {{it is recommended that}} the Pawsey groundwater cooling system be designed using a twin-doublet layout with two extra shielding wells (6 wells in total) ...|$|R

40|$|Intensification of {{agriculture}} and extension of aquaculture is increasing {{the pressure on the}} natural resources by introducing fertilizers and pesticides into the system. This study focuses on quantification of the relationship between agriculture in the drainage basin, aquaculture in the lagoon and the water quality of the coastal ecosystem. Based on extensive literature research the use of fertilizers and some popular pesticides is estimated. Through mapping of historic and present spatial extension and analysis of future planning, the load of substances from agriculture and aquaculture to the lagoon system, are quantified. Implementation of a 2 D hydrodynamic and water quality model (Delft 3 D model) allows the estimation of present and future concentrations of substances in the water of the lagoon. Based on this, this study concludes that planned extension and intensification {{of agriculture}} and aquaculture will lead to serious exceedance of internationally <b>accepted</b> <b>water</b> quality standards, indicating overexploitation of resources and increasing risk of serious problems with ecosystem functioning. This study also produces relevant information for policymakers to estimate maximum use of the system in relation to spatial differences, seasons and interventions that lead to changed patterns of flushing of the lagoon.

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} 10 years, the B. C. Forest Service has {{measured}} sediment concentration and turbidity {{on a number}} of creeks in the Kootenay region of British Columbia, which are used for community or domestic water supply. This paper summarizes the results of measurements on 11 forested watersheds. Some of them have streamflow stations, so that suspended sediment data collected for water quality purposes can be converted to sediment yield. Reasonable estimates of discharge and yield can be made for the remaining creeks. Both undeveloped and developed watersheds are included. For most watersheds, annual background suspended sediment yields are comparable to or slightly higher than the range of published Water Survey of Canada results for small forested watersheds (about 3 to 10 t/km 2 /y). These yields are lower than for most watersheds in British Columbia. Streams with low sediment yield have been chosen by communities as water sources because they provide good quality water. In some watersheds with forestry development, sediment yield is significantly greater than background levels, due mainly to erosion from logging roads. However, in most cases, the amount of sediment is still within generally <b>accepted</b> <b>water</b> quality guidelines. In rare cases, landslides caused by forest roads have resulted in very large increases in sediment yield...|$|R
