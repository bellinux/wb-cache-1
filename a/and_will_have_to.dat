5|$|They {{discover}} that an unknown source of Eichner radiation {{is causing the}} growth. Separately, Ian (R.J. Williams), now appearing as an eight-year-old, confides to Troi {{that he is the}} source of the crew's problems <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave. Troi realizes Ian is dying and calls for medical assistance. As Pulaski tries to keep Ian alive, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) scans him and discovers that he is the source of radiation. Ian dies in Troi's arms, and turns into a ball of energy, which settles into Troi's hands, communicating telepathically with her for a moment, then leaves the ship. The lifeform told her that he wished to learn about humans through experiencing standard human development and living among the crew. With Ian gone, the plague sample returns to normal and the crew continues on their mission.|$|E

This helps with appending elements at the array's end, but inserting into (or removing from) middle positions still carries prohibitive costs due to data moving to maintain contiguity. An array from which many elements are removed may also have to be resized in order to avoid wasting too much space.|$|E

Tony immediately orders Silvio to inform everyone in the family to break their routines and to go into hiding themselves until Phil can be located. However, Bobby has gone to a hobby store in Lynbrook, New York, to buy a rare model Blue Comet train and leaves his ringing phone behind in his car. While Bobby is at the counter, two gunmen enter and shoot him dead.|$|E
25|$|After the {{annexation}} of the Punjab by the British, the young {{heir to the}} Sikh throne Duleep Singh was sent away to England, and was to stay there until British rule became established in the Punjab. After {{the events of the}} Indian Mutiny of 1857 the young prince decided to return, which was much anticipated by his supporters. At this time Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is said to have predicted the failure of his return. He claimed to have received knowledge from God that the prince will not return, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> encounter some trouble, and had informed many people about this. This prediction {{is believed to have been}} fulfilled while the prince was on his journey back to India, the British government decided that the prince's return may be dangerous for the government and feared trouble.

25|$|Courtship and {{relationships}} in the Philippines are conservative in nature. The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years; this however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in theirhome, so {{they can have a}} chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression on the woman and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose the best from among her suitors. Courtship {{and relationships}} remain the same for rural and urban areas despite the modern western influence.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives made a {{detailed}} and revised plan on April 25, 2007, after leaks {{of a speech}} {{which was supposed to}} be made by John Baird on April 26 were discovered after some Liberal MPs received a fax of the speech. The new plan seeks to stop the increase of greenhouse gas emissions before 2012 and reduce the amount as much as 20% by 2020. Targets would be imposed to industries before 2015, while home appliances would need to be more energy efficient. There were also rewards for companies that reduced the amount of emissions since 2006. On the next day, Baird announced additional measures including one that would force industries to reduce greenhouse emissions by 18 percent by 2010 while auto industries would have a mandatory fuel-efficient standard by 2011. Later in 2007, Baird revealed other plans and deadlines that industries must meet. The plan mentioned that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, will have to reduce green-house emissions by six percent from 2008 to 2010 <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> report data on their emissions on every May 31.|$|E

Dawkins left Michigan with a 43.9% three point shooting percentage <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sit out a full season due to NCAA eligibility rules.

500|$|Guitar Hero: Metallica, {{like other}} {{games in the}} Guitar Hero series, allows players to {{simulate}} the playing of rock music using special instrument controllers. [...] The game {{is based on the}} band approach presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, and features parts of lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. To successfully complete songs and score, players must use the instruments to play notes that scroll on-screen in time with the music. For lead and bass guitar players, this is done by holding down colored fret buttons on the guitar neck while striking a strum bar; for the drum players, this requires the player to strike the appropriate drum pad or kick with the bass drum pedal; for vocals, the player must attempt to match the pitch of the notes through a microphone. Players earn scoring multipliers for playing several consecutive notes or phrases correctly, and by correctly completing marked phrases, players can earn Star Power which can be released for a higher scoring multiplier. If players miss too many notes, they will eventually fail the song <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> retry it.|$|E

Evans: “When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'." [...] Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: [...] "The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me [...] "No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country", I cooled it." [...] Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: [...] "It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," [...] and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.|$|E
