2500|$|The {{central drive}} shaft, called the [...] "eccentric shaft" [...] or [...] "E-shaft", {{passes through the}} center of the rotor and is {{supported}} by fixed bearings. The rotors ride on eccentrics (analogous to crankpins) integral to the eccentric shaft (analogous to a crankshaft). The rotors both rotate around the eccentrics and make orbital revolutions around the eccentric shaft. Seals at the corners of the rotor seal against the periphery of the housing, dividing it into three moving combustion chambers. The rotation of each rotor on its own axis is caused and controlled by a pair of synchronizing gears A fixed gear mounted on one side of the rotor housing engages <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> attached to the rotor and ensures the rotor moves exactly 1/3 turn for each turn of the eccentric shaft.

5000|$|Some designs use [...] "stepped-planet" [...] {{which have}} two differently-sized gears on {{either end of}} a common casting. The large end engages the sun, while the small end engages the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> This may be {{necessary}} to achieve smaller step changes in gear ratio when the overall package size is limited. Compound planets have [...] "timing marks" [...] (or [...] "relative gear mesh phase" [...] in technical term). The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume. For example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with <b>a</b> 50T <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> would give the same effect as <b>a</b> 100T <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> but with half the actual diameter.|$|R

An exception to this is the Hondamatic line from Honda, which uses sliding gears on parallel axes like a manual transmission without any planetary gearsets.

50|$|A {{water wheel}} is a machine for {{converting}} {{the energy of}} flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a wheel (usually constructed from wood or metal), {{with a number of}} blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but can also be mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft, for example the tub or Norse. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load.|$|E

50|$|Bell housing or {{bellhousing}} is a colloquial/slang {{term for}} {{the portion of the}} transmission that covers the flywheel and the clutch or torque converter of the transmission on vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. This housing is bolted to the engine block and derives its name from the bell-like shape that its internal components necessitate. The starter motor is usually mounted here, and engages with <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> on the flywheel. On the opposite end to the engine is usually bolted to the gearbox. The use of different bellhousings on a transmission allows the same transmission to be used on multiple engines in multiple applications. However, on some transmissions, the bellhousing is a nonremovable part of the transmission case. This is particularly true with front wheel drive transmissions, which are much shorter than conventional rear wheel drive transmissions.|$|E
