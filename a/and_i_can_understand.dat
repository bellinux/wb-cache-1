500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E

They blame, with some justification, the {{problems}} in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and they’re dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too many people out of work. We have a very uneven distribution of income. We have a very frustrated people, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> their frustration." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no; {{the great}} world you have {{inhabited}} at Paris <b>and</b> elsewhere. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that at Lavedan you should find little of interest, and--and that your inactivity should render you impatient to be gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He does. I myself {{think that}} Gurth's counsel was good, {{and that it}} were best for England that he {{remained}} at Westminster; <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> well that he himself would feel it a shame did he remain behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, how dreadful!" [...] Beatrice impulsively {{crossed the}} floor and, {{kneeling}} {{down beside her}} mother, put her arm round her. [...] "I know how you must feel it. <b>And</b> now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> Father's troubled look. He has been very quiet and stern since Gerald came home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt that}} will make her quite {{independent}} of you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that her presence here in such circumstances must be very uncomfortable to you all. No doubt she feels her power." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "Poor Sue! She simply {{lives to}} do people good, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> exactly {{how she feels}} toward them. I'll be round bright and early to-morrow to thank her. Why do you go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} seems," [...] the Colonel admitted, [...] "to {{have covered}} up his traces with admirable skill. I have read {{every word of}} the evidence at the inquest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> {{that the police are}} completely confused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not Lady Adela. Poor lady, {{she had her}} own {{relations}} with her. She had not by any means recovered the loss of her little boy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> that it must have been too trying for her to see me in his place. I understand from Hailes--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was just}} like my father," [...] Cuthbert said, admiringly, [...] "he always thought {{a great deal of}} his county, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> his acting as he did. Well, they were ten pound shares, I think, so it is only five hundred gone at the worst." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} extraordinary," [...] the lady said; [...] "but {{it does not}} seem to me by any means impossible, for I have heard that in these terrible cyclones houses have been taken up and carried long distances, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> the same thing happening to a boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum!" [...] said Holmes. [...] "I think I see {{how things}} worked, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how this message would, as you say, bring them to a head. But while you wait, you might {{tell me what you}} can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{we could}} not," [...] the major said, heartily. [...] "Another three months' work {{and these two}} regiments would be equal to our best; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> now how they stood up against the charge of Franceschi's cavalry regiments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{that which}} the family wants, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>{{understand}}</b> {{that it should be}} wanted. As for myself,--for mamma and me,--you can hardly understand how it has been with us when we were young. You despise Mr. Thwaite,--because he is a tailor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least. The {{young lady}} {{seems to have}} been left by her father and step-mother without any engagement, and, indeed, without any provision. She was brought here, in the first place, from sheer charity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{certainly}} <b>understand</b> that when she was here Mr Whittlestaff should have admired her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, sir," [...] he said, {{with great}} severity, [...] "this is {{the manner in}} which you abuse my politeness. You join {{yourself}} to persons of condition, I perceive, for no other purpose than to escape the consequences of your crimes; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> readily <b>understand</b> your embarrassment when I addressed myself to you yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lad, don't {{make such}} wishes," [...] said Colonel Zane, earnestly. [...] "You were indeed {{fortunate}} to escape, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>understand</b> your feelings. There is nothing I should like {{better than to}} see Girty over the sights of my rifle; but I never hunt after danger, and to look for Girty is to court death." ...|$|R
60|$|RAINA (with dignity). My mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that notion, as {{you call}} it. And if instead of {{threatening}} me with your pistol as you did, you had simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our hospitality, {{you would have been}} as safe as in your father's house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Philip, don't be silly. I'm quick-tempered too <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that I hurt you, but it's {{so stupid}} to sulk over it. What's {{the good of}} making us both unhappy? It's been so jolly, our friendship." [...] She passed her fingers slowly over his hand. [...] "I love you, Philip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{be sure of}} that. I {{know how}} he acted to father; but at this minute I pity him so that I could take his part against father. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how Ellen--Anyway, I must make a clean breast of it. What day is this Thursday? And they sail Saturday! I must write--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And father, too," [...] {{said the}} wife. [...] "He {{has been a}} very good father to you all; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why one who works so hard should earn so little; but I believe it is the fault of those machines. The police ought to put them down, and then every body would be comfortable." ...|$|R
60|$|Damascus is {{beautiful}} from the mountain. It {{is beautiful}} even to foreigners accustomed to luxuriant vegetation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>understand</b> how unspeakably beautiful {{it must be}} to eyes that are only used to the God-forsaken barrenness and desolation of Syria. I should think a Syrian would go wild with ecstacy when such a picture bursts upon {{him for the first}} time.|$|R
6000|$|Science is the {{organised}} {{conquest of}} Nature, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> that ancient libertine refusing to co-operate {{in her own}} undoing. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand,</b> too, my father's preference {{for what he called}} an illustrative experiment, which was simply an arrangement of the apparatus {{in front of the class}} with nothing whatever by way of material, and the Bunsen burner clean and cool, and then a slow luminous description of just what you did put in it when you were so ill-advised as to carry the affair beyond illustration, and just exactly what ought anyhow to happen when you did. He had considerable powers of vivid expression, so that in this way he could make us see all he described. The class, freed from any unpleasant nervous tension, could draw this still life without flinching, and if any part was too difficult to draw, then my father would produce a simplified version on the blackboard to be copied instead. And he would also write on the blackboard any exceptionally difficult but grant-earning words, such as [...] "empyreumatic" [...] or [...] "botryoidal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I know it, poor boy, I know it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> {{how much}} it has cost you to remain under that unjust stigma to this time. But it is all right now, and no harm is done. You have {{restored}} my comfort of mind, and with it your own; and both of us had suffered enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] March went on, {{trying to}} be proof against her flatteries, {{or at least to}} look as if he did not deserve praise; [...] "I know that what Lindau said was {{offensive}} to him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how he felt that he had a right to punish it. All I say is that he had no right to punish it through me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to {{the nature}} of the {{language}} in which you have found yourself compelled to write to me, I must remind you that it is unusual as coming from a clergyman to a bishop. I am, however, ready to admit that the circumstances of the case were unusual, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that you should have felt the matter severely. Under these circumstances, I trust that the affair may now be allowed to rest without any breach of those kind feelings which have hitherto existed between us.--Yours very faithfully, ...|$|E

But, by George, to make an offer of marriage to such a girl as that in September, to live for a month in her family as her affianced husband, and then coolly go away to another house in October, and make an offer to another girl of higher rank--" ...|$|E

[...] "Sister Rhoda," [...] {{she said in a}} timid tone, [...] "it may be very wicked--I feel sure it is--but do you know, I've read somewhere in old stories of the unenlightened days that a mother always loved the most afflicted of her {{children}} the best. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> it now, sister Rhoda; I can feel it here," [...] and she put her hand upon her poor still heart. [...] "If only I could keep this one dear crippled baby, I could give up all the world beside--except you, Clarence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{mind being}} caught in a dirty trick," [...] Griffiths was saying defiantly. [...] "I've been in the tropics too long. I'm a sick man, a damn sick man. And the whiskey, and the sun, and the fever have made me sick in morals, too. Nothing's too mean and low for me now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why the niggers eat each other, and take heads, and such things. I could do it myself.

5000|$|Michael Brenson of the New York Times, {{followed}} {{the arc of}} Silver's career over his lifetime and spoke at his funeral.

[...] "I {{should not have}} believed it possible that men would devote so many years to such a purpose, nor {{that they could have}} succeeded in tracing the diamonds in spite of the precaution taken by your uncle, and afterwards by yourself. It would seem that from the time he landed in England he, and after him your father and yourself, must have been watched almost night <b>and</b> day. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> now why they did not take your watch and money.
