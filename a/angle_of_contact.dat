40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of soil particle shape, confining {{pressure and the}} amount of relative displacement on the value of the interface friction angle are studied in the laboratory using a ring shear apparatus. Two quartz sands, one angular and the other rounded,with twogeomembranes, one soft and the other hard,were used as the interfac-ing constituents. The geomembrane surface texture before and after shearing is quanti-fied using a profilometer. Test data indicate that the value of the interface friction angle can vary significantly for each of the surfaces investigated. The smooth HDPE geo-membrane exhibits distinct peak and residual interface friction angle values that range from 65 to 90 % <b>of</b> the friction <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contacting</b> sand.

40|$|Low thermal {{conductivity}} 7 wt. % yttria stabilized zirconia (7 YSZ) coatings have been grown using a low vacuum (0. 20 Torr) {{electron beam evaporation}} process. In this approach, a transsonic helium jet was used to entrain and transport an evaporated 7 YSZ flux to a substrate. The interac-tion of the helium jet with the coating surface resulted {{in many of the}} evaporated species making oblique <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with the substrate. This resulted in the formation of a highly porous, columnar microstructure without substrate rotation. When the substrate was positioned perpendic-ular to the axis of the jet, coatings with intercolumnar pores normal to the substrate surface were formed. The ambient temperature {{thermal conductivity}} of a coating grown in this arrangement was 1. 9 Wm/K, comparable to that of conventional, high vacuum electron beam coatings. When the column and pore orientation was inclined (by tilting the substrate) the thermal conductivity was observed to fall. By alternating the inclination angle as growth progressed, coatings contain-ing zig-zag columns and pores could be synthesized. Using this technique, 7 YSZ coatings with thermal conductivities as low as 0. 8 W/mK were obtained. The observed thermal conductivity reduction arises from the longer thermal diffusion path of the zig-zag pore microstructures. 1...|$|R

5000|$|An {{angular contact}} ball bearing uses axially {{asymmetric}} races. An axial load passes {{in a straight}} line through the bearing, whereas a radial load takes an oblique path that tends to want to separate the races axially. So the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> on the inner race is the same as that on the outer race. Angular contact bearings better support [...] "combined loads" [...] (loading in both the radial and axial directions) and the contact angle of the bearing should be matched to the relative proportions of each. The larger the contact angle (typically in the range 10 to 45 degrees), the higher the axial load supported, but the lower the radial load. In high speed applications, such as turbines, jet engines, and dentistry equipment, the centrifugal forces generated by the balls changes the contact angle at the inner and outer race. Ceramics such as silicon nitride are now regularly used in such applications due to their low density (40% of steel). These materials significantly reduce centrifugal force and function well in high temperature environments. They also tend to wear in a similar way to bearing steel—rather than cracking or shattering like glass or porcelain.|$|E

40|$|The soft-tissue {{contact between}} the thigh and calf during deep knee flexion results in tibiofemoral joint contact force {{reductions}} at angles beyond 134 º of flexion (Caruntu et al., 2003; Zelle et al., 2009; Hirokawa et al., 2013). Many knee models that predict tibiofemoral joint contact forces in high flexion neglect to account for this force. Very few investigations have attempted to characterize thigh-calf contact force, and even fewer have directly measured thigh-calf contact or attempted to model thigh-calf contact force and contact force location on the tibia (Zelle et al. 2007; Zelle et al. 2009). This study focused on the following four thigh-calf contact parameters: (1) maximum total thigh-calf contact force, (2) the corresponding flexion angle, (3) the corresponding centre of pressure, and (4) the starting <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> thigh-calf <b>contact</b> (the flexion angle at the initiation <b>of</b> thigh-calf <b>contact</b> when transitioning into a kneeling or squatting posture). This study addresses limitations of previous work by investigating how the thigh-calf contact parameters are correlated to anthropometric measures after accounting for correlations between body mass and contact force (by normalizing thigh-calf contact force to body mass), comparing parameters between sexes and activities, and presenting an equation for the average thigh-calf contact force and location from 30 participants as a function <b>of</b> percent thigh-calf <b>contact</b> flexion range (this has only been done previously for a single participant as a function <b>of</b> flexion <b>angle).</b> Anthropometric measurements from 30 healthy participants (16 male and 14 female) were recorded. Instrumentation included opto-electronic markers to track dominant leg motion and an interface pressure mapping system to determine the thigh-calf contact force during three deep flexion movements: dorsi-flexed kneeling, plantar-flexed kneeling, and plantar-flexed squatting. Four two-way (3 activities x 2 sexes) ANOVAs were {{used to compare the}} mean values for maximum total thigh-calf contact force (in N/kg), centre of pressure at maximum total force (in cm), flexion angle at maximum total force (in degrees) and the starting <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> thigh-calf <b>contact</b> (in degrees) between sexes and between the three activities. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (R) were calculated in order to investigate the relationship between the anthropometric measures and the four outcome parameters. In cases where the R value exceeded 0. 5 for {{one or more of the}} anthropometric measures for a given outcome parameter, predictive modeling of the outcome parameter based on anthropometric measures was pursued using multivariate linear regression with forward stepwise selection. A mean curve for thigh-calf contact force and a mean curve for centre of pressure were created for all participants for each activity. Equations were fit to the mean curves to express each of the measures as a function of percent range <b>of</b> flexion after <b>contact.</b> Based on the average thigh-calf contact force curve for 30 participants, the maximum thigh-calf contact force occurred at maximum flexion and was 1. 1 N/kg (S. D. 0. 6 N/kg) during squatting, 2. 0 N/kg (S. D. 0. 7 N/kg) during dorsi-flexed kneeling and 2. 2 N/kg (S. D. 0. 9 N/kg) during plantar-flexed kneeling. The average centre of pressure, corresponding to those maximum total thigh-calf contact force values, was found to be closer to the epicondylar axis during squatting (13. 7 cm, S. D. 1. 6 cm) than for dorsi-flexed kneeling (14. 9 cm, S. D. 1. 7 cm) and plantar-flexed kneeling (14. 6 cm, S. D. 1. 9 cm). There was a significant difference in the maximum total thigh-calf <b>contact</b> force, centre <b>of</b> pressure at maximum total force, and starting <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> thigh-calf <b>contact</b> between squatting and each of the two kneeling activities, however, for all outcome parameters, dorsi-flexed and plantar-flexed kneeling were not significantly different. There was a significant main effect of sex on the starting <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> thigh-calf <b>contact</b> (p = 0. 004), whereas, with all other outcome parameters, there was no sex main effect. Unlike the previous investigation that measured thigh-calf contact (Zelle et al., 2007), there was little correlation between anthropometric measures and maximum total thigh-calf contact force or location of centre of pressure at maximum total thigh-calf contact force. This discrepancy likely occurred because thigh-calf contact force was normalized to body mass in this study, whereas non-normalized contact force was used in the previous study. The joint reaction forces, net joint moment, and joint contact forces at the knee joint in the sagittal plane during static full flexion squatting were calculated for a single participant both with and without the addition <b>of</b> thigh-calf <b>contact</b> force. The addition <b>of</b> thigh-calf <b>contact</b> force into the model reduced the knee joint reaction forces by 101. 09 N in the anterior-posterior direction and the net sagittal plane knee joint moment by 13. 14 Nm at maximal flexion. Based on a single muscle equivalent estimate, the compressive tibiofemoral joint contact force decreased by 221. 78 N in the longitudinal direction and 84. 96 N in the anterior-posterior direction...|$|R
