50|$|<b>Artemotil</b> (INN; {{also known}} as β-arteether), is a fast acting blood schizonticide {{specifically}} indicated {{for the treatment of}} chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria and cerebral malaria cases. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, a natural product of the Chinese plant Artemisia annua. It is currently only used as a second line drug in severe cases of malaria.|$|E
40|$|Three new {{antimalarial}} {{drugs have}} recently been registered in the Netherlands: atovaquone-proguanil, artemether-lumefantrine and <b>artemotil.</b> These drugs are effective against parasites with multiple resistance. Atovaquone-proguanil and artemether-lumefantrine seem in practice to be equivalent {{for the treatment of}} non-severe Plasmodium falciparum infections for respectively persons of more than 11 kg and persons aged 12 years and older (35 kg). <b>Artemotil</b> (intramuscular injection) is registered for the treatment of severe malaria in children up to 17 years of age. Atovaquone-proguanil is also registered for prophylactic use in adults. The intravenous administration of quinine is preferable in the case of seriously ill patients. In patients with non-severe malaria for whom parenteral treatment is indicated, <b>artemotil</b> is a good alternative for quinin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} intramuscular <b>artemotil</b> (ARTECEF) was compared to intravenous quinine in African children with cerebral malaria. This prospective block randomized open-label study was conducted at two centers in Zambia. Subjects were children aged 0 to 10 years of age with cerebral malaria and a Blantyre Coma Score of 2 or less. Ninety two children were studied; 48 received <b>artemotil</b> and 44 quinine. No significant differences in survival, coma resolution time, neurologic sequelae, parasite clearance time, and fever resolution time were seen between the two regimens. Rates for negative malaria smears one month after therapy were similar in both groups. <b>Artemotil</b> was a well-tolerated drug in the 48 patients in this study. It appears {{to be at least}} therapeutically equivalent to quinine for the treatment of pediatric cerebral malaria. It has the advantage of being able to be given intramuscularly once daily for only five days...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pharmacokinetic {{data were}} {{obtained}} to evaluate the therapeutic potential of <b>Artemotil</b> (-arteether) in 56 Thai patients with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Intramuscular administration was given at 1) a low dose of 3. 2 mg/kg on day 0 and 1. 6 mg/kg/day on days 1 – 4 and 2) a high dose of 4. 8 mg/kg on day 0 at 0 hours, 1. 6 mg/kg at 6 hours, and 1. 6 mg/kg/day on days 1 – 4. Cmax values of 63. 7 ng/mL at 6. 1 hours and 140. 8 ng/mL at 5. 7 hours were reached in low-dose and high-dose patients, respectively. Drug concentrations decreased slowly with half-lives of 12. 5 – 22. 4 hours on day 0 and 31. 6 – 40. 7 hours on day 4 for both dosage regimens. Although the maintaining dosage {{on the last day}} was much lower than the loading dose on day 0, the area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax on day 4 were significantly increased (2. 85 – 4. 55 fold), suggesting drug accumulation in the blood. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), an active metabolite of <b>Artemotil,</b> was detected in most patients. The mean ratios of DHA and <b>Artemotil</b> were 0. 16 – 0. 19 in both dosage regimens for the entire study period. Similar to previous reports, all patients showed a slow response to treatment with mean values of 77. 2 hours for the fever clearance time (FCT) and 75. 8 hours for the parasite clearance time (PCT) (low dose) and 70. 1 hours for the FCT and 64. 4 hours for the PCT (high dose). Interestingly, a very rapid response to the treatment was exhibited in patient 151, with an FCT of 4 hours and a PCT of 36 hours, with different pharmacokinetic data from others on day 0. The patient had a very high Cmax (2, 407 ng/mL) and AUC (12, 259 ng·hr/mL) values without an intramuscular absorption phase on the first day. These values were approximately 21. 9 (Cmax) and 2. 6 (AUC) time...|$|E
40|$|In animals, {{high doses}} of {{intramuscular}} artemether and <b>artemotil</b> {{have been shown to}} cause an unusual pattern of selective damage to certain brainstem nuclei, especially those implicated in hearing and balance. We aimed to investigate whether a similar pattern arises in human adults. We examined the brainstems of adults who died after treatment with high dose artemether or quinine for severe falciparum malaria for evidence of a pattern of selective neuronal damage. Neuropathological findings were similar in recipients of quinine (n= 15) and artemether (n= 6; total artemether doses received 4 - 44 mg/kg). No evidence was recorded for artemether-induced neurotoxic effects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Several antimalarials {{can cause}} {{significant}} prolongation of the electrocardiograph QT interval, {{which can be}} associated with an increased risk of potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. High doses of artemether and <b>artemotil</b> have been associated with QT prolongation in dogs, raising the possibility of a class effect with the artemisinin derivatives. Serial electrocardiograms were recorded, and QTc interval was calculated before and after administration of artesunate by intravenous injection in patients with severe falciparum malaria in Bangladesh. Of 21 adult patients with severe malaria enrolled, 8 (38 %) died. The mean QTc interval was unaffected by bolus intravenous artesunate (2. 4 mg/kg). In two patients, the QTc interval exceeded 0. 5 seconds, but in both cases, an alternative explanation was plausible. No effect was observed on the JTc or PR interval, QRS width, blood pressure, or heart rate. Intravenous artesunate does not have significant cardiovascular effects in patients with severe falciparum malaria...|$|E
