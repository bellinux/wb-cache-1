5|$|As of June 2014, the Dragon Quest {{series has}} sold over 64 million units {{worldwide}} {{and is one}} of the most popular video game series in Japan. All games in the main series, and its many spin-offs, have sold over a million copies in Japan and some games have sold over four million copies. The remake of Dragon QuestVI sold 0.91 million copies in Japan in the first four days after its release, an exceptional sales figure for a remake. In 2006 readers of the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu voted on the hundred best video games of all time. Dragon QuestIII was third, Dragon QuestVIII fourth, Dragon QuestVII ninth, Dragon QuestV eleventh, Dragon QuestIV fourteenth, Dragon QuestII seventeenth, Dragon Quest thirtieth, and Dragon QuestVI thirty-fourth. In 2009 Horii received a special award <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Computer</b> Entertainment Supplier's Association Developers Conference for his work on the Dragon Quest franchise.|$|E

25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E

2500|$|Strong Bad Emails (also {{known as}} [...] "sbemails") are {{arguably the most}} popular and {{prolific}} series, featuring Strong Bad answering emails from fans. Since starting in August 2001, the initially brief episodes have grown in length and scope, introducing numerous spin-offs, characters, and inside jokes, such as Homsar, Trogdor, Senor Cardgage, 20X6, the Teen Girl Squad shorts, and Homestar Runner Emails (also known as [...] "hremails"). The format, however, has remained largely unchanged. Each episode typically begins with Strong Bad singing a short song to himself while booting up his computer to check fan emails. Starting a reply, he typically mocks the sender's name, spelling, and grammar, and rarely answers questions directly. While early episodes focused mostly on Strong Bad sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> with occasional cutaways, over time, the cutaways would become more elaborate, allowing for more complex story lines to develop, growing tangentially from the initial email. Each episode closes with Strong Bad finishing his reply, closing the episode with a link to email Strong Bad appearing via [...] "The Paper", a dot matrix printer {{at the top of the}} screen. In later episodes, it is replaced with the [...] "New Paper", an inkjet printer, then with the [...] "Compé-per", a pop-up balloon, and finally with a CGI version of the original Paper, which instead promotes Strong Bad's Twitter account. Episodes will often feature extra jokes and sequences as Easter eggs, accessible only by clicking certain objects on the screen during the cartoon.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Nomura {{was hired by}} Square and at first worked as a {{debugger}} for Final Fantasy IV. Some time later, the company's staff was divided and he {{was placed in the}} team in charge of Final Fantasy. After he had received some training by artist Tetsuya Takahashi, Nomura designed the monsters for Final Fantasy V. At that time, each Final Fantasy developer had their own plan book as a compilation of ideas to present to the director of a game. While the others typed their plan books <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> and then printed them out, Nomura wrote his by hand and attached many drawings which impressed director Hironobu Sakaguchi and event planner Yoshinori Kitase. Nomura then became the graphic director of Final Fantasy VI. For this game, he conceived the characters Shadow and Setzer as well as their background stories. Their designs were reused from some of Nomura's abandoned concepts for Final Fantasy V. Following several smaller projects, Nomura was asked to be the principal character designer of Final Fantasy VII in replacement for Amano. Nomura drew the game's characters in a stylized and super deformed way and {{came up with the idea}} for the [...] "Limit Break" [...] attacks. He also took part in the making of the story and had a hand in plot elements such as Aerith's death. In 1998, Nomura worked on both Parasite Eve and Brave Fencer Musashi. He then designed characters and monsters for Final Fantasy VIII in what he described as his [...] "actual style of drawing", working alongside art director Yusuke Naora to realize the more realistic approach to the game's graphics. Additionally, he wrote the character's background stories and was the battle visual director in charge of designing fight sequences. Afterwards, Nomura worked on several different projects for Square, for example as a character designer of the 1998 fighting game Ehrgeiz which also used characters from Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
