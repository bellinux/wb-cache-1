Its limb control system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> walk {{with the lower}} limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|E
5|$|By Paul's estimate, about 50 or 60 {{doctors were}} {{certified}} by the NBO. The NBO was incorporated in 1999, but Paul <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be dissolved in 2000 {{when he did not}} file the required paperwork with the Kentucky Secretary of State's office. He later recreated the board in 2005, but it was again dissolved in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The queen's pyramid complex {{had its own}} {{separate}} mortuary temple, {{which was}} located on {{the east of the}} pyramid in contrast to Userkaf's complex.

5|$|A 800–1,000-strong Swedish Brigade, led by Hjalmar Frisell, {{took part}} in the battles of Tampere and those fought in the area south of the town. In February 1918, the Swedish Navy escorted the German naval squadron, {{transporting}} Finnish Jägers and German weapons, and <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> pass through Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish socialists did not aid the Finnish Reds but tried to open peace negotiations between the Whites and Reds. The weakness of Finland gave Sweden a chance to take-over geopolitically vital Finnish Åland islands, east of Stockholm, but the German army's Finland-operation stalled the plan.|$|E
5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E

Robattle's modularity <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be fitted with robotic arms, radars and weapons, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> engage in combat. As such, sensitive systems in the Robattle are redundant <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> operate after taking damage.|$|R

In its green form, it controls the element of air, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> produce ropes from its hands to swing around the environment and it can also pull different objects with its rope. In its blue form, it controls the element of water, allowing the ability to dive underwater and shooting bubbles that damage hostiles.|$|R

5|$|By 1964 over 20,000 {{new homes}} had been built, {{transforming}} the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. Most {{of the city}} centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid-twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece. The Plymouth City Council <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> fall into disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2010 by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.|$|E

5|$|During the Panic of 1893, Lilly {{created a}} {{commission}} to help provide food and shelter to the poor people who were adversely affected. His work with the commission led {{him to make a}} personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis named in honor of his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had no money to pay for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.|$|E
5|$|During the war Zinn <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be {{run around}} the clock, and its design {{made it easy to}} conduct experiments. This {{included}} tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.|$|E
5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> create new shows.|$|E

On the final day 221,554 visitors added to the more than 50 million (50,306,648) that attended Expo 67 at a time when Canada's population was only 20 million, setting a per-capita record for World Exhibition attendance that still stands.|$|E
5|$|In 1562 the château came briefly {{into the}} {{possession}} of the Huguenots and {{was turned into a}} state prison by Henry IV of France. Cardinal Richelieu was given the castle to prevent it from coming under the control of unfriendly forces, though he <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> fall into ruin. Château de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the Reign of Terror, the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist Vendeans. Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set up {{the first of several}} iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and smelt ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest iron content) was exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E

The film with an ensemble cast, was a two-part crime saga centred on the coal mafia of Dhanbad with the story spanning from the early 1940s to 2009. The first part was released on 22 June, and the second on 8 August 2012, both receiving appreciation from Indian and international critics alike. The combined budget of the two films <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a box-office success.|$|E

Afterward, Katrina made landfall as a Category3 storm near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, and once more near the Mississippi/Louisiana border. Katrina progressed northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the Great Lakes on August 31, when it was absorbed by a cold front.|$|E
