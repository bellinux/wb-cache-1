50|$|Interband cascade lasers (ICLs) are a type {{of laser}} diode that can produce {{coherent}} radiation over {{a large part of}} the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. They are fabricated from epitaxially-grown semiconductor heterostructures composed of layers of indium arsenide (InAs), gallium antimonide (GaSb), <b>aluminum</b> <b>antimonide</b> (AlSb), and related alloys. These lasers are similar to quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) in several ways. Like QCLs, ICLs employ the concept of bandstructure engineering to achieve an optimized laser design and reuse injected electrons to emit multiple photons. However, in ICLs, photons are generated with interband transitions, rather than the intersubband transitions used in QCLs. Consequently, the rate at which the carriers injected into the upper laser subband thermally relax to the lower subband is determined by interband Auger, radiative, and Shockley-Read carrier recombination. These processes typically occur on a much slower time scale than the longitudinal optical phonon interactions that mediates the intersubband relaxation of injected electrons in mid-IR QCLs. The use of interband transitions allows laser action in ICLs to be achieved at lower electrical input powers than is possible with QCLs.|$|E
40|$|The {{flight test}} furnace {{run of the}} monotectic and syntectic alloys {{experiment}} was successfully performed during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission in July 1975. Examination of the returned sample cartridges and the formal comparative characterization of the low-g and one-g processed samples of lead-zinc and <b>aluminum</b> <b>antimonide</b> were completed. The results for <b>aluminum</b> <b>antimonide</b> show that polycrystalline and multiphased material can be homogenize in space under low-g conditions. Microstructural study on the lead-zinc flight samples shows that complete interdiffusion of lead and zinc had not been achieved, even though the flight data indicated a soak temperature in the miscible region that was 40 K above the published consolute temperature...|$|E

40|$|Calculations within density {{functional}} {{theory on}} the basis of the local density approximation are carried out to study the properties of intrinsic point defects in <b>aluminum</b> <b>antimonide.</b> Special care is taken to address finite-size effects, band gap error, and symmetry reduction in the defect structures. The correction of the band gap is based on a set of GW calculations. The most important defects are identified to be the aluminum interstitial $Al_{i,Al}^{ 1 +}$, the antimony antisites $Sb_{Al}^ 0 $ and $Sb_{Al}^{ 1 +}$, and the aluminum vacancy $V_{Al}^{ 3 -}$. The intrinsic defect and charge carrier concentrations in the impurity-free material are calculated by self-consistently solving the charge neutrality equation. The impurity-free material is found to be n-type conducting at finite temperatures. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this study}} <b>Aluminum</b> <b>Antimonide</b> (AlSb) thin films were {{synthesized}} by electro-deposition technique using tri-sodium citrate as complexing agent. X-Ray studies {{were performed on}} both as-grown {{as well as on}} annealed films. The depositon potential was kept at- 0. 7 V and- 0. 8 V for a period of 15 minutes. The analysis of X-Ray diffraction spectra of the as-grown and annealed samples shows that the films are of AlSb material and are polycrystalline in the as-grown form. The hot probe analysis indicates that the grown film is of P-type in nature. In order to confirm the results we also used UV-VIS spectroscopy to determine the indirect and direct band gaps and the calculated values are in close agreement with the reported values in the literature. Calculated lattice constant values further clarifies that AlSb films were successfully grown on brass substrate using tri-sodium citrate as a complexing agent which was not reported earlier in the literature {{to the best of our}} knowledge...|$|E
40|$|The {{flight test}} furnace {{run of the}} monotectic and syntectic alloys {{experiment}} was successfully performed during the Apollo Soyuz Test Project mission. All three experiment cartridges were returned intact. A second ground based test was conducted after the mission to provide one g samples with an equivalent thermal history. The examinations of all flight and ground based cartridges and ampoules have been completed. Encouraging results have been obtained in the preliminary analysis of one flight <b>aluminum</b> <b>antimonide</b> sample as compared to ground based and prototype test counterparts. In terms of reduction of the unwanted second phase, the low g sample shows a homogeneity improvement {{by a factor of}} 5 to 20. Preliminary examination of one lead zinc flight sample shows a dispersion of lead in the zinc matrix. However, complete homogenization of the material did not occur. A thermal analysis of flight data shows that the average soak temperature for the head zinc ampoules was 20 C lower than planned but 35 C above the published consolute temperature. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} thermodynamic {{and electronic}} properties of group IV (C, Si, Ge, Sn) and group VI (O, S, Se, Te) impurities {{as well as}} P and H in <b>aluminum</b> <b>antimonide</b> (AlSb) using first-principles calculations. To this end, we compute {{the formation energies of}} a broad range of possible defect configurations including defect complexes with the most important intrinsic defects. We also obtain relative scattering cross strengths for these defects to determine their impact on charge carrier mobility. Furthermore, we employ a self-consistent charge equilibration scheme to determine the net charge carrier concentrations for different temperatures and impurity concentrations. Thereby, we are able to study the effect of impurities incorporated during growth and identify optimal processing conditions for achieving compensated material. The key findings are summarized as follows. Among the group IV elements, C, Si, and Ge substitute for Sb and act as shallow acceptors, while Sn can substitute for either Sb or Al and displays amphoteric character. Among the group VI elements, S, Se, and Te substitute for Sb and act as deep donors. In contrast, O is most likely to be incorporated as an interstitial and predominantly acts as an acceptor. As a group V element, P substitutes for Sb and is electrically inactive. C and O are the most detrimental impurities to carrier transport, while Sn, Se, and Te have a modest to low impact. Therefore, Te can be used to compensate C and O impurities, which are unintentionally incorporated during the growth process, with minimal effect on the carrier mobilities.
