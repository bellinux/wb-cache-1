40|$|The {{starting}} proposition for the Authorising Environment strand is that {{reform of}} public management system {{to date has}} been a one way street. By and large reform has focused on how public organisations set, manage and report their performance, paying insufficient attention {{to the role of}} the authorising environment, such as ministers, parliament and the media. Recent international analyses of public management reform identify <b>authorising</b> <b>agents</b> as the ‘missing piece’ in system design and performance, emphasising, for example, the formal role of politicians and legislators in setting performance criteria and their absence of understanding and inconsistent levels of utilisation. It is taken for granted that public sector reform revolves around both normative and descriptive suppositions that the signals sent by <b>authorising</b> <b>agents</b> matter within the design and operation of public management systems, and yet we know precious little about how this part of the system actually works. The authorising environment is an ongoing project, which explores the missing link in systemic public management reform: the role expectations for ministers and the question of what should (or can) be done to modify the way ministers and legislators engage with the public management systems that they have installed. This is about both better alignment (by clarifying the expectations of <b>authorising</b> <b>agents</b> and the fit with what public organisations do) and stronger engagement (by examining what can be done to increase conformance by <b>authorising</b> <b>agents</b> with the systemic expectations that they themselves have set). This paper is part of the initial phase of the project: a literature review on what is already known about the role expectations of the key <b>authorising</b> <b>agents</b> – ministers – in the New Zealand public management system. The focus has been on the ‘performance’ framework governing minister-chief executive relations, and has confirmed that this area is under-researched. In the second stage of the project this New Zealand research literature will be placed in the context of the international literature on ministerial role expectations and public management design, as a first step in scoping a research question for empirical study...|$|R

50|$|The parties most {{opposed to}} the grey market are usually the <b>authorised</b> <b>agents</b> or importers, or the {{retailers}} of the item in the target market. Often this is the national subsidiary of the manufacturer, or a related company. In response to the resultant damage to their profits and reputation, manufacturers and their official distribution chain will often seek to restrict the grey market. Such responses can breach competition law, particularly in the European Union. Manufacturers or their licensees often seek to enforce trademark or other intellectual-property laws against the grey market. Such rights may be exercised against the import, sale and/or advertisement of grey imports. In 2002, Levi Strauss, after a 4-year legal case, prevented the UK supermarket Tesco from selling grey market jeans. However, such rights can be limited. Examples of such limitations include the first-sale doctrine in the United States and {{the doctrine of the}} exhaustion of rights in the European Union.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{deployment}} of Share Data Spaces in open, possible hostile, environments arises {{the need of}} protecting the confidentiality of the data space content. The approaches that have been proposed focus on access control mechanisms that protect the data space from untrusted agents. The basic assumption is that the hosts (and their administrator) where the data space is deployed have to be trusted. Basic encryption schemes {{can be used to}} protect the data space content from malicious hosts. However, these schemes do not allow searching on encrypted data. In this paper we present a novel encryption scheme that allows tuple matching on completely encrypted tuples. Since the data space does not need to decrypt tuples to perform the search, tuple confidentiality can be guaranteed even when the data space is deployed on malicious hosts (or an adversary gains access to the host). Secondly, our scheme does not require authorised agents to share keys for inserting and retrieving tuples. Each <b>authorised</b> <b>agent</b> can encrypt, decrypt, and search encrypted tuples without having to know other agents ’ keys. This is a great benefit inasmuch as relieves the system of the difficult task of key management. An implementation of an encrypted data space based on this scheme is described and some preliminary performance results are given. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} government (eGovernment) is mainly concerned with providing quality services and value added information to citizens, {{and it has}} potentials to build better relationships between government and the public by making interactions between citizens and government agencies smoother, easier, and more efficient. The use of Internet medium has helped government organisations and nongovernment organisations to increase their productivity, reduce costs and also improve services. The most security implications in egovernment is {{the protection of the}} data security, whereby the privacy of the citizens are not guaranteed, because the access to the data are not controlled by <b>authorised</b> <b>agents,</b> and due to human interaction it is vulnerable to so many attacks. Hackers developed sneaky ways attacking the digital communicating system by phishing into the information systems. There are problems about security vulnerability in government websites, which has made the public to be extremely concerned, and third party routinely invade government websites for fraudulent purposes. Attitudes of people interrogating this system {{will go a long way}} by having a strong principle of sincerity and honesty so as to help rectifying the security issues and strict legislative rule cannot be undermined in dealing with offenders.
