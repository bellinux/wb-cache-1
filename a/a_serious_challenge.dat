5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell Froude, was attacking the Church's move towards {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead {{a greater emphasis on}} Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>challenge</b> to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to Roman Catholicism. Although Froude was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on Newman and the Oxford Movement), he ultimately repudiated his beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. The {{result was a}} victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The Southern Sudan Federal Party competed in the election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The Federal party platform represented <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>challenge</b> to the authorities. However, {{when it became clear}} that the party's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E

Cunningham {{played in the}} match which was won easily by the New Zealanders 55–4. Devon were expected to pose <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>challenge,</b> but were overwhelmed and only managed to score a drop-kick. A series of large victories followed against domestic opposition throughout England, {{and by the time}} the All Blacks played their first Test match against Scotland, the team had played and won nineteen matches, and scored 612 points while conceding only 15.|$|E
5|$|Due to poor intelligence, the British {{were told}} to expect only limited {{resistance}} from German reserve forces. <b>A</b> <b>serious</b> <b>challenge</b> to their operation was not expected and many men believed that their work {{would lead to the}} ending of the war. Some—anticipating a period of occupation in Germany—packed leisure equipment in their kit or in the sea tail. The optimistic mood prior to the operation would have tragic consequences however. Frederick Browning's intelligence officer—Major Brian Urquhart—obtained information from the 21st Army Group in Belgium and Dutch resistance that German armour was present around Arnhem. This was backed up with aerial reconnaissance that he ordered to be flown. Browning however was dismissive and ordered his chief medical officer to have Urquhart sent on sick leave. In fact, SHAEF was aware that there were almost certainly two Panzer divisions at Arnhem but with the operation looming chose to ignore them. Such information would have been gleaned from Ultra intercepts that the First Allied Airborne Army was not privy to and therefore could not act upon themselves.|$|E
5|$|Howe's {{impatience with}} the {{necessity}} for parliamentary debate of his proposals won him few friends, and he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe {{came to be seen}} as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>challenge</b> in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships. The former minister died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} December 1960.|$|E

5|$|The {{previous}} {{season was}} a transitional period for Arsenal. The club transferred {{a number of}} first-team players such as defenders Sol Campbell and Lauren to Portsmouth and winger Robert Pirès to Spanish club Villarreal. After lengthy negotiations, Ashley Cole moved to Chelsea {{on the final day}} of the summer transfer window, in exchange for £5million and defender William Gallas. Arsenal played their home games at the newly constructed Emirates Stadium and drew their first game against Aston Villa. After a defeat by Bolton Wanderers, manager Arsène Wenger admitted that his team were unlikely to make <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>challenge</b> for the Premier League. Despite being a young and inexperienced team, however, Arsenal reached the final of the League Cup, where they were beaten 2–1 by Chelsea. Elimination in the UEFA Champions League in the knockout stage (two-legged matches played home and away) and FA Cup in the space of four days followed – the club lost three games in succession for the first time since October 2002. Arsenal eventually finished fourth in the league, level on points with third-placed Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} Army Group South faced the Southwestern Front, {{which had the}} largest concentration of Soviet forces, and the southern section faced the Southern Front. In addition, the Pripyat Marshes and the Carpathian Mountains posed <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>challenge</b> to the army group's northern and southern sections respectively. On 22 June, only the northern section of Army Group South attacked, but the terrain impeded their assault, giving the Soviet defenders ample time to react. The German 1st Panzer Group and 6th Army attacked and broke through the Soviet 5th Army. Starting {{on the night of}} 23 June, the Soviet 22nd and 15th Mechanized Corps attacked the flanks of the 1st Panzer Group from north and south respectively. Although intended to be concerted, Soviet tank units were sent in piecemeal due to poor coordination. The 22nd Mechanized Corp ran into the 1st Panzer Army's III Motorized Corps and was decimated, and its commander killed. The 1st Panzer Group bypassed much of the 15th Mechanized Corps, which engaged the German 6th Army's 297th Infantry Division, where it was defeated by antitank fire and Luftwaffe attacks. On 26 June, the Soviets launched another counterattack on the 1st Panzer Group from north and south simultaneously with the 9th, 19th and 8th Mechanized Corps, which altogether fielded 1649 tanks, and supported by the remnants of the 15th Mechanized Corps. The battle lasted for four days, ending in the defeat of the Soviet tank units. On 30 June Stavka ordered the remaining forces of the Southwestern Front to withdraw to the Stalin Line, where it would defend the approaches to Kiev.|$|E
