5|$|The stomach {{produces}} gastric acid, {{a strongly}} acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. Constriction {{of the upper}} and lower esophageal sphincters help to prevent reflux (backflow) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa. In addition, the <b>acute</b> <b>angle</b> of His and the lower crura of the diaphragm helps this sphincteric action.|$|E

5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's <b>acute</b> <b>angle</b> and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and unproductive.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark can be most {{reliably}} {{distinguished from}} the bull shark {{by the number of}} precaudal (before the caudal fin) vertebrae (89–95 in C. amboinensis versus 101–123 in C. leucas). Externally, it has a greater size difference between its dorsal fins (first-to-second height ratio >3.1:1 versus ≤3.1:1 in C. leucas) and the notch in its anal fin margin forms an <b>acute</b> <b>angle</b> (versus a right angle in C. leucas). This species also usually has fewer tooth rows in the lower jaw (10–12 on each side versus 12–13 in C. leucas).|$|E
5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an <b>acute</b> <b>angle</b> with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E

Team captain Roy Keane, however, who was shown a yellow card preventing him from playing the final, headed in a Beckham cross. Dwight Yorke added a second to level the match just before the break. In the second half, Cole put United ahead {{for the first time}} in the match and the tie. Yorke was brought down by the Juve keeper in the area as he went round him, but the referee played the advantage and Cole tapped in from an <b>acute</b> <b>angle.</b> United held on for their first victory in Italy and booked their place in the Camp Nou for the final, against group opponents Bayern Munich.|$|E
5|$|UA 8699 is a {{worn and}} broken left lower molar. Part of the trigonid (the front group of cusps), at the mesiolingual (inner front) {{corner of the}} tooth is missing. Krause {{estimated}} that the complete tooth would have been 3.5mm (0.14in) long and 2.2mm (0.09in) wide. The tooth is tribosphenic, like that of modern mammals, as indicated {{by a number of}} features, including the broad basin of the talonid (the back group of cusps), and the <b>acute</b> <b>angle</b> (48°) between the cusps of the trigonid. UA 8699 lacks a cingulid (ridge) resembling a shelf on the lingual (inner) side, indicating that is not a member of Australosphenida (the proposed clade uniting monotremes and some ancient Gondwanan mammals, including the Jurassic Madagascan Ambondro); thus, it can be identified as representing Boreosphenida, which includes marsupials, placentals, and their extinct relatives.|$|E
5|$|During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten {{changed the}} side's {{formation}} to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle {{for a position}} with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. He dragged {{the ball out of}} reach of a defender near the half-way line and paced his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder and he ran at the France goal and was forced into an <b>acute</b> <b>angle,</b> but despite the angle, he shot the ball into the net past Coupet.|$|E

5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper incisors (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors {{because they have a}} less <b>acute</b> <b>angle</b> at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.|$|E
5|$|Isolated lower premolars {{are known}} from I.kamlialensis. A p3, YGSP 33157, {{resembles that of}} YGSP 32727 in {{possessing}} a single large cusp connected to crests at the front and back. A heel is present at the back, part of a small talonid. The tooth has two roots. The p4, represented by YGSP 24338, is an elongate, two-rooted tooth with a distinct trigonid at the front and talonid at the back. The protoconid is the highest cusp of the trigonid. Two crests descend from it at right angles in a lingual direction (towards the inner side of the tooth): the protolophid towards the front, ending at the low paraconid, and the metalophid towards the back, reaching the elongate metaconid. The talonid basin is open lingually; on the labial side, the hypoconid cusp is present. A crest, the cristid obliqua, reaches from the hypoconid forward towards the trigonid. No other cusps are visible in the talonid, but the specimen is worn and poorly preserved; the posterolophid, a crest descending from the hypoconid, may end in a small hypoconulid. A weak cingulum is present on the labial side of the tooth between the protoconid and hypoconid. Another tooth, YGSP 32151, is interpreted as a dp4. It has a more closed trigonid (with the protolophid and metalophid making a more <b>acute</b> <b>angle),</b> the protolophid is shorter, and the paraconid is indistinct. In the talonid, the hypoconulid and entoconid are distinct. The labial cingulum is strong.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} are triangular {{in overall}} shape and much broader than long, with the narrow {{end of the}} triangle pointing lingually. The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in D.chimaera is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species, but otherwise very similar. The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the buccal side of the tooth, the paracone and metacone, are well-developed, together forming a long W-shaped ridge. D.chimaera resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone {{and in front of}} the metacone form an <b>acute</b> <b>angle</b> with each other, so that together they form a V; their shape rather resembles an U in the Sunda colugo. A cingulum (shelf) is present on the buccal margin of the tooth, but this cingulum is rather weak in the Pakistani fossil. On the M2, smaller cusps, the paraconule and metaconule, are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone, but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and ridgelike. The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2. A third major cusp, the protocone, is present on the lingual side of both upper molars. This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos, but less so in D.chimaera. Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a buccal direction. These crests end in small cusps (protoconules) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone. The living colugos lack these protoconules. The enamel is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and, in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens, on the lingual side of the protocone. Enamel wrinkling is also seen in some Philippine colugos.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut for Millwall {{in the opening}} game of the 2009–10 season, {{starting}} in the club's 1–1 draw with Southampton; providing the assist for Millwall's equaliser. A month later, he scored his first goal for Millwall in a 3–1 victory over Huddersfield Town. Playing in a deeper role than when at Stevenage, Morison struggled for goals, but made the majority of Millwall's goals throughout October, whilst also netting in a 5–0 win over Tranmere Rovers. In December 2009, he scored a 91st-minute winner in a 3–2 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, and also scored a similar goal in a 4–0 win over Staines Town in the FA Cup. Three days later, Morison scored twice in Millwall's 2–1 victory over Walsall. His fine form through December continued, scoring twice in a 4–4 draw against Charlton Athletic at The Valley. He scored his seventh goal in as many games in a 2–0 win over Bristol Rovers, whilst also assisting the second goal. Morison scored his second goal of Millwall's FA Cup campaign against Derby County at Pride Park in early January 2010; scoring in the 108th minute as Millwall were knocked out 5–3 on a penalty shootout. He provided the assists for both of Millwall's goals in games against Southampton and Oldham Athletic respectively, before scoring the winner in a 1–0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion; his 11th goal of the season. This was followed up with a brace in a 3–1 win away to Carlisle United, whilst also setting up Millwall's third goal. Morison scored another brace four days later, as Millwall beat Charlton Athletic 4–0. His 17th of the season came {{in front of the}} Sky cameras against Leeds United at Elland Road. Shortly after, Morison scored his 18th goal of the campaign, scoring a header from an <b>acute</b> <b>angle</b> in Millwall's 5–0 win over Stockport County. As a result of his fine goalscoring form throughout March, Morison was named Football League One Player of the Month. Another goal followed for Morison in a 2–1 win away at Colchester United. Morison's 20th goal of the season came in a 2–1 victory over Leyton Orient, scoring Millwall's second goal from the penalty spot. The goal subsequently means that Morison has now scored 20 goals or more in his last six seasons for three different clubs. On {{the last day of the}} season, Morison scored a brace against Swindon Town in a 3–2 victory. Morison's first was a coolly dispatched penalty, whilst he supplied the cross that led to an own goal. Morison's second goal of the game was a half-volley from outside the area; looping into the top right-hand corner of the net. He scored his 23rd goal of the season in Millwall's 2–0 win against Huddersfield Town as Millwall progressed to the League One play-off final, where they beat Swindon Town 1–0 at Wembley Stadium; Morison's third successive victory at the stadium.|$|E
