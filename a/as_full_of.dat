25|$|Deciding that France was too dangerous, Hamilton Rowan moved next to Philadelphia, {{then the}} capital of the United States. He reached Philadelphia on 4 July 1795, reuniting with fellow United Irishmen in exile. To his dismay, he {{discovered}} Philadelphia to be <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> backstabbing and partisanship as France (albeit of a less bloody nature). His more radical Irish friends were already inserting themselves into the dispute between Thomas Jefferson's Republican faction against John Adams' Federalists. He chose to leave Philadelphia for the more peaceful and less expensive shores of the Brandywine River in Delaware.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, R.A. Zimbardo {{viewed the}} play <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded {{to in the}} play, in his view, stand for {{permanence}} in mutability. The play uses the principle of discordia concors in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has {{to give up her}} motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of film, New York City was {{characterized}} as urbane and sophisticated. By the city's crisis period in the 1970s and early 1980s, however, films like Midnight Cowboy, The French Connection, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver, Marathon Man, Cruising, Dressed to Kill, and Death Wish showed New York <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> chaos and violence. With the city's renaissance in the 1980s and 1990s came new portrayals on television; Friends, Seinfeld, and Sex and the City showed life in the city to be glamorous and interesting. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of crime dramas, such as Law & Order, continue to make criminality in the city as their subject even as New York has become the safest large city in the United States in the last two decades.|$|E

The friend was, however, unwilling {{to appear in the}} film. In writing the script Hoolboom tried to keep {{elements}} of humour; he later said that the humour was necessary as the source had insisted [...] "most of our relationship was incredibly joyous and happy and a good time".|$|E
500|$|As with Instant Vintage, Ray Ray {{features}} Saadiq's characteristic {{fusion of}} programmed beats, strings, neo soul melodies, and live guitars. The songs are mostly mid-tempo and groove-based, and also feature rubbery bass lines and horns. AllMusic's Andy Kellman views that the album's music is [...] "a little funkier {{and a lot}} more energetic than 2002's Instant Vintage, yet just <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> Saadiq's stylish flourishes." [...] He writes of the album's subject matter, [...] "for every song that's charmingly simple and full of lighthearted romantic sentiments, there's something message-oriented". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe characterizes the album's mood as [...] "playful" [...] and writes that it is composed as [...] "a bouncy song cycle that's a throwback to '70s funk." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review {{in which he}} described the script <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> plot holes, the car chases as silly, and criticized the mixture of futuristic environments with [...] "defiantly retro costuming". The complexity of the storyline was also a source of criticism for Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who considered the plot [...] "too intricate and difficult to follow". Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail criticized Tom Cruise's performance, and though Hoberman liked the movie, he described the film as [...] "miscast, misguided, and often nonsensical". Both Rosenbaum and Hoberman belittled the titular minority report as a [...] "red herring". More positive reviews have seen it similarly, but {{referred to it as}} a [...] "MacGuffin".|$|E

500|$|Embracing a {{reasoned}} sensibility, Wollstonecraft contrasts her {{theory of}} civil society with Burke's, which she describes <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> pomp and circumstance and riddled with prejudice. She attacks what she perceives as Burke's false feeling, countering with her own genuine emotion. She argues that to be sympathetic to the French revolution (i.e., the people) is humane while to sympathize with the French clergy, as Burke does, is a mark of inhumanity. She accuses Burke not only of insincerity, but also of manipulation, claiming that his Reflections is propaganda. In {{one of the most}} dramatic moments of the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft claims to be moved beyond Burke's tears for Marie Antoinette and the monarchy of France to silence for the injustice suffered by slaves, a silence she represents with dashes meant to express feelings more authentic than Burke's: ...|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} for the Fifth and final Test, where he recorded his highest Test innings of 170 {{on his home}} ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground. Among the spectators was a 12-year-old Don Bradman, who had been taken to watch Macartney by his father. Eight decades later, Bradman recalled the innings, [...] "as if it were yesterday", describing it <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> [...] "delicate leg-glances, powerful pulls, cuts and glorious drives" [...] and concluding {{that it was one}} of the best innings he had seen in his lifetime. Bradman cited the innings as an inspiration for his career. Macartney headed the Australian Test averages with 260 runs at 86.66 as Australia won the Ashes 5–0. It was the only such Ashes whitewash until 2006–07. Macartney has amassed 821 runs at 68.42 for the season. He took only three wickets at 56.33.|$|E
500|$|Canadian {{historians have}} treated Benedict Arnold as a {{relatively}} minor figure. His difficult time in New Brunswick led historians to summarize it <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> [...] "controversy, resentment, and legal entanglements" [...] and to conclude that he was disliked by both Americans and Loyalists. Historian Barry Wilson points out that Arnold's descendants ended up establishing deep roots in the country, becoming leading settlers in Upper Canada and later in lands further west, where they established settlements in Saskatchewan. His descendants who adopted the Arnold surname are spread across Canada, most of all those of John Sage. His long woollen British scarlet military jacket with a buff lining continues to be owned by descendants; as of 2001, it was held in Saskatchewan. It has reportedly been passed in each generation to the eldest male of the family.|$|E

[...] "Shakespear was in one sense the least moral of all writers; for morality (commonly so called) {{is made up of}} antipathies [...] ". Yet [...] "in another [...] he was the greatest of all moralists. He was a moralist in the same sense in which nature is one. He taught what he had learnt from her.

500|$|In March 1643, Temple had {{returned}} to Sussex, and along with his stepbrother, John Busbridge, he was appointed by Parliament to the Sussex committee set for the sequestration (i.e. seizure and administration) of the assets of prominent Royalists. In December 1643, Temple was prominent in the defence of the crossing of the River Adur at Bramber Castle against a Royalist attack during Lord Hopton's attempt to obtain control of Sussex for the King. His actions were described by Dr Cheynell: [...] "Upon the 12th of December I visited a brave soldier of my acquaintance, Captn Jas Temple, who did that day defend the fort of Bramber against a bold and daring enemy to the wonder of all the country and I did not marvel at it, for {{he is a man}} that hath his head full of stratagems, his heart full of piety and valour, and his hand <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> success as it is of dexterity." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray's {{work has}} been {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> humanism and universality, and of a deceptive simplicity with deep underlying complexity. The Japanese director Akira Kurosawa said, [...] "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon." [...] But his detractors find his films glacially slow, moving like a [...] "majestic snail." [...] Some find his humanism simple-minded, and his work anti-modern; they criticize him for lacking the new modes of expression or experimentation found in works of Ray's contemporaries, such as Jean-Luc Godard. As Stanley Kauffman wrote, some critics believe that Ray assumes that viewers [...] "can {{be interested in a}} film that simply dwells in its characters, rather than one that imposes dramatic patterns on their lives." [...] Ray said he could do nothing about the slow pace. Kurosawa defended him by saying that Ray's films were not slow, [...] "His work can be described as flowing composedly, like a big river".|$|E
