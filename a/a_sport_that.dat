Teklemariam explained in interviews prior to the Games that he hoped his appearance would inspire other Ethiopians living in colder climates to take up sports. He suggested that cross-country skiing could be <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> <b>that</b> Ethiopians could naturally be proficient at, since it was an endurance sport.|$|E

5|$|Ice {{hockey is}} <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> <b>that</b> is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. A men's ice hockey tournament {{has been held}} every Winter Olympics (starting in 1924); an ice hockey tournament was also held at the 1920 Summer Olympics. From 1920 to 1968, the Olympics also acted as the Ice Hockey World Championships, and the two events {{occurred}} concurrently. From 1920 until 1984, only amateur athletes were allowed {{to compete in the}} tournament, and players from the National Hockey League (NHL) were not allowed to compete. However, Soviets and Czechoslovakia had state-sponsored teams that was almost always on par with the talent coming out of Canada. In 1970, after a disagreement over the definition of amateur players, Canada withdrew from the tournament and did not send a team to the 1972 or 1976 Winter Olympics. In 1987, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to allow professional athletes to compete in the Olympics, and starting in 1998, the NHL allowed its players to participate. Women's ice hockey was added in 1992 and the first tournament was held at the 1998 Winter Olympics. Both events have been held at every Olympic Games since.|$|E
5|$|Short track {{speed skating}} is <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> <b>that</b> is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} speed skating, {{but the first}} official short track speed skating events were not held until the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Before 1992, short track speed skating events were held at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport. At those games, events {{for both men and}} women were held in five disciplines: 500 metre, 1000 metre, 1500 metre, 3000 metre and the relay (3000 metres for women, 5000 metres for men). The Netherlands, United Kingdom and South Korea won two gold medals each, with Canada, Italy, Japan and China picking up a gold medal each. The results of those demonstration events are not considered official and are not included in this list. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, there were four medal events: men's 1000 metres, men's 5000 metre relay, women's 500 metres and women's 3000 metre relay. Men's 500 metres and women's 1000 metres was added in 1994. The men's and women's 1500 metres were added in 2002 and all eight events have been held at every Olympic Games since.|$|E
5|$|Snowboarding is <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> <b>that</b> {{has been}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding {{was one of}} five new sports or {{disciplines}} added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and {{was the only one}} not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.|$|E

5|$|Speed skating is <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> <b>that</b> {{has been}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games in 1924. Events {{held at the}} first Winter Olympics {{included}} the men's 500-metre, 1500-metre, 5000-metre, and 10,000-metre races. Points from the four races were combined and counted towards the all-round event, which was dropped following the 1924 Olympics. Speed skating events for women were first held at the 1932 Winter Olympics, as a demonstration sport. The first official women's events were held in 1960 in the 500-metre, 1000-metre, 1500-metre, and 3000-metre distances. The men's 1000-metre event was added in 1976 and the women's 5000-metre event was added in 1988. All 10 events have been held at every Olympic Games since, and a team pursuit event for both genders was added in 2006, {{for a total of}} 12 medal events.|$|E
