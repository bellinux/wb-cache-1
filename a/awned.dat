25|$|In 1981, Alex George {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia {{in his classic}} monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). He reinstated B.ser. Quercinae, placing it within B.sect. Banksia, and redefining it as containing those species with <b>awned</b> perianths, and beaked follicles. Initially, the series contained three species, but in 1988 George moved B.baueri (Woolly Orange Banksia) into its own series, B.ser. Bauerinae, leaving just B.quercifolia (Oak-leaved Banksia) and B.oreophila (Western Mountain Banksia) in B.ser. Quercinae.|$|E
2500|$|Emmer wheat, {{also known}} as farro {{especially}} in Italy, or hulled wheat, {{is a type of}} <b>awned</b> wheat. [...] Emmer is a tetraploid (2n=4x=28 chromosomes). [...] The domesticated species are Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccum and Triticum turgidum conv. durum. The wild species is called Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides. [...] The principal difference between the wild and the domestic species is that the ripened seed head of the wild species shatters and spreads the seed onto the ground, while in the domesticated emmer, the seed head remains intact, thus making it easier for humans to harvest the grain.|$|E

Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in that light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot. Makes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn. Travel round {{in front of the}} sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.

Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly's new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.|$|E
30|$|Both an 1 and an 2 {{genes in}} all 15 accessions tested are loss-of-function. Yet, <b>awn</b> length in these accessions varies {{from zero to}} about 5  cm. This {{indicates}} that more genes are controlling the presence/absence of an <b>awn</b> {{as well as its}} length. Wild rice, including Oryza rufipogon, usually has an extra-long <b>awn,</b> much longer than 10  cm; the <b>awn</b> moreover is barbed in wild rice. In contrast, the <b>awns</b> of all aboriginal landraces are barbless. It was noted earlier that loss-of-function an 2 gene leads to a short and barbless <b>awn</b> or to no <b>awn</b> at all (Gu et al. 2015; Hua et al., 2015). Cai and Morishima (2002) showed that <b>awn</b> length in rice is a QTL-controlled trait with more than 10 loci. In addition to An 1 and An 2 used in the current study, Regulator of <b>Awn</b> Elongation 1 (RAE 1), RAE 2, and RAE 3 were shown to contribute to <b>awn</b> length control (Furuta et al. 2015; Bessho-Uehara et al. 2016). Thus, other awn-controlling genes should be responsible for the differences in <b>awn</b> length among Formosan landraces.|$|R

40|$|The {{mendelian}} inheritance of <b>awns,</b> and, {{the effect that}} {{presence or absence of}} <b>awns</b> may have on yield have been the subjects of much investigation and discussion.

The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to add something to the genetics of <b>awn</b> inheritance and if possible to determine the possible relation between length of <b>awns</b> and yield. Four crosses, Kanred-Minhardi, Minhardi-Minturki, Turkey-Minhardi and Buffum-Minturki have been used in correlation studies to determine the effect of presence or absence of <b>awns,</b> or length of <b>awn</b> may have on characters indicative of yield.

5000|$|According to the study, Stipa avenacea, {{along with}} other Stipa species, {{appeared}} to reveal a kind of kinking and coiling of their <b>awns,</b> causing different variations {{of the length of}} the <b>awns.</b> This would eventually yield linear strains of up to 20%. Due to this, it was observed that strain variations were possibly rectified {{in the direction of the}} grass tips.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{interfacial}} area (<b>awn)</b> between air and subsurface liquids during air-sparging can limit {{the rate of}} site remediation. Lateral movement within porous media could be encountered during air-sparging operations when air moves {{along the bottom of}} a low-permeability lens. This study was conducted to directly measure the amount of <b>awn</b> between air and water flowing within a bench-scale porous flow cell during the lateral movement of air along the upper edge of the cell during air injections into an initially water-saturated flow cell. Four different cell orientations were used to evaluate the effect of air injection rates and porous media geometries on the amount of <b>awn</b> between fluids. Air was injected at flow rates that varied by three orders of magnitude, and for each flow cellover this range of injection rates little change in <b>awn</b> was noted. A wider variation in <b>awn</b> was observed when air moved through different regions for the different flow cell orientations. These results are in good agreement with the experimental findings of Waduge et al. (2007), who performed experiments in a larger sand-pack flow cell, and determined that air-sparging efficiency is nearly independent of flow rate but highly dependent on the porous structure. By directly measuring the <b>awn,</b> and showing that <b>awn</b> does not vary greatly with changes in injection rate, we show that the lack of improvement to remediation rates is because there is a weak dependence of the <b>awn</b> on the air injection rate...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis We {{present the}} results of a {{combined}} experimental and theoretical investigation of the mechanics of self-burial of some plant seeds whose morphologies respond to environmental changes in humidity. The seeds of Erodium and Pelargonium have hygroscopically responsive <b>awns</b> that {{play a critical role in}} their self-burial into soil. The <b>awn,</b> coiled in a dry state, uncoils to stretch linearly under highly humid condition because of a tilted arrangement of cellulose microfibrils in one of the layers of the awn’s bilayered structure. By measuring the mechanical characteristics of the <b>awns</b> of Pelargonium carnosum, we find that the extensional force of the <b>awn</b> can be aptly modeled by the theory of elasticity for a coiled spring. We further show that although the resistance to the seed-head penetrating relatively coarse soils without spinning is large enough to block the digging seed, the rotation of the seed greatly reduces the soil’s resistance down to a level the <b>awn</b> can easily overcome. Our mechanical analysis reveals that the self-burial of the seed is a sophisticated outcome of the helically coiled configuration of the <b>awn...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Wild {{emmer wheat}} spikelets {{effectively}} self-cultivate by propelling themselves mechanically into soils with their <b>awns.</b> [...] During {{a period of}} increased humidity during the night, the <b>awns</b> of the spikelet become erect and draw together, {{and in the process}} push the grain into the soil. [...] During the daytime, the humidity drops and the <b>awns</b> slacken back again; however, fine silica hairs on the <b>awns</b> act as hooks in the soil and prevent the spikelets from backing out. [...] During the course of alternating stages of daytime and nighttime humidity, the awns' pumping movements, which resemble a swimming frog kick, will drill the spikelet an inch or more into the soil.|$|R
