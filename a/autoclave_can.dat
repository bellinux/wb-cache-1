For example, it is feasible to manufacture flat and single-curvature light aircraft landing gear springs on inexpensive aluminum molds with electric heating pads bonded directly {{to the bottom of}} the mold. This eliminates the cost of the motor and fan as well as the air heaters and uses much less electricity than a comparable electric autoclave would require. In this way, the autoclave provides consolidation pressure alone. There are limitations to this approach, such as mold complexity. Sometimes, the parts are heated from one side only; sometimes, the mold has top and bottom parts, each fitted with heaters.

The effects {{of the amount of}} water in the bottom of autoclave, the crystallization time, the crystallization temperature and the gel drying temperature on the formation of the Sn-Beta zeolite frameworks, which have not been addressed before, were investigated in detail. An improved SAC autoclave was used for investigating the role of water in the formation of Sn-Beta zeolites. The characterization results of XRD, SEM, FT-IR, and UV-Vis for the as-synthesized samples show that the SAC method can rapidly produce pure and highly crystalline Sn-Beta zeolites.

30|$|UV–vis {{absorption}} spectra of the as-synthesized MBH nanowhiskers formed {{with the assistance}} of surfactants are shown in Fig. 8 b. When compared with the MBH-NON nanowhiskers, the nanostructures synthesized with surfactants show optical absorption peaks with maximum intensity at around 350 nm (photon energy of 3.55 eV), which can be related to the absorption in the band gap region. The optical band gap values estimated from the optical band edge plots ((αhγ) 2 vs. hγ, not shown) for MBH-CTAB, MBH-SDS, MBH-Triton-In Autoclave and MBH-Triton-In open beaker are 2.64, 2.7, 2.5 and 2.62 eV, respectively. The large difference in the optical band gap for MBH-NON nanowhiskers and MBH nanowhiskers synthesized with various surfactants arises {{due to the fact that}} the surfactants can induce the formation of intermediate surface defect states in the band gap region [36]. The reduced optical band gap values can also be assigned to the increased aspect ratio of the nanowhiskers with the addition of surfactants (MBH-CTAB and MBH-Triton). The increase in the absorption peak intensity and band gap for MBH-SDS nanowhiskers in comparison with the MBH-CTAB and MBH-Triton-In <b>Autoclave</b> <b>can</b> be assigned to the reduced particle size [37].

The thermal stability of the compounds is also evaluated. Our {{results show that the}} pore diameter depends strongly on the heating time and temperature.

A reorganization of the micellar solution during the hydrothermal treatment in <b>autoclave</b> <b>can</b> also simultaneously occur to give materials with smaller pore diameter.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mathematical modelling {{of the following}} autoclave processes: heating, cooling and pressure changes. An autoclave is a pressure vessel of a cylindrical form where the composite semi-products are placed on a metal plate above electrical heaters and heated at selected temperatures and under a higher pressure. The purpose of the modelling {{is to build a}} mathematical model with which the behaviour of the processes can be simulated and the temperature and pressure control in the <b>autoclave</b> <b>can</b> be improved. Furthermore, using this mathematical model we intend to test advanced uni- and multi-variable control algorithms.

While the pressure-changing process is not very complex, the heating and cooling processes involve complex phenomena of heat conduction and convection. In the mathematical model some simplifications were considered and so the heat-transfer correlations past flat plates were used. Most of the data are real and obtained from the autoclave manufacturer, but where not possible, the method of the model’s response fitting to the measured data with the criterion function of the sum of squared errors was used. In this way, to a great extent simulated similarly to the real process responses were obtained. It can be concluded that the obtained mathematical model is usable for the design of a variety of process-control applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In general, {{surgical}} instruments and medications that enter an already aspetic {{part of the}} body (such as the blood stream, or penetrating the skin) must be stertilized to a high sterility assurance level. An autoclave is a device used to sterilize medical equipment. While there are many sterilization techniques available, the preferred method for this project is steam sterilization. In this process, water is raised to its boiling point (Steam) is generated at a temperature higher than 100 °C. In fact, In order to fully eliminate all prions and bacteria associated with disease, saturated steam needs to be at least 121 °C when in contact with the equipment being sterilized. Currently, many electrical autoclaves are being used. These autoclaves are usually electrically powered and use computers to monitor the internal temperatures and pressures. Unfortunately, many developing/under developed countries around the globe do not have the technology available to operate these types of autoclaves. As a result, nurses and doctors at remote health clinics in these rural areas are continually challenged with the decision to operate with unsanitary equipment, risking the spread of infection. A solar autoclave provides an alternative solution to this problem. Using only solar radiation, a solar <b>autoclave</b> <b>can</b> be an aid in remote health clinics as its inexpensive and efficient way to sterilize medical equipment.
