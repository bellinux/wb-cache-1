40|$|Saltation threshold, {{the minimum}} wind speed for {{sediment}} transport, {{is a fundamental}} parameter in aeolian processes. The presence of liquid, such as water on Earth or methane on Titan, may affect the threshold values to a great extent. Sediment density is also crucial for determining threshold values. Here we provide quantitative data on density and water content of common wind tunnel materials {{that have been used}} to study conditions on Earth, Titan, Mars, and Venus. The measured density values for low density materials are higher compared to literature values, whereas for the high density materials, there is no such discrepancy. We also find that low density materials have much higher water content and longer <b>atmospheric</b> <b>equilibration</b> timescales compared to high density sediments. In the Titan Wind Tunnel, we performed threshold experiments with the standard walnut shells (125 - 150 μ m, 7. 2...|$|R

In addition, {{the existence of}} deglacial � 13 C minima in tropical surface water records (2, 3) {{has been difficult to}} explain because the nutrient increase implied by the � 13 C shift is not supported by evidence of increased upwelling in these presently nutrient-poor regions (2). Because the � 13 C of atmospheric CO 2 was lower {{at the onset of the}} deglaciation, tropical surface water � 13 C DIC would have decreased via air-sea equilibration without an accompanying nutrient change. Such a mechanism is analogous to the invasion of low � 13 C anthropogenic CO 2 into the modern surface ocean (7). Taken as a whole, the timing and distribution of the deglacial carbon isotope minimum in tropical marine sediments is consistent with a Southern Ocean origin, with advection through intermediate waters and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>equilibration</b> providing the high-latitude–tropical connection...|$|R
