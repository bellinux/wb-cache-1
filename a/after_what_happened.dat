25|$|Beatty orders Montag {{to destroy}} his own house, {{telling him that}} his wife and her friends {{reported}} him <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> the other night. Montag watches as Mildred {{walks out of the}} house, too traumatized about losing her parlor wall family to even acknowledge her husband's existence or the situation going on around her, and catches a taxi, never once looking back. Montag obeys the chief, destroying the home piece by piece with a flamethrower. As soon as he has incinerated the house, Beatty discovers Montag's ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and (after Beatty taunts him) burns his boss alive, and knocks his coworkers unconscious. As Montag escapes the scene, the firehouse's mechanical dog attacks him, managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer. He destroys The Hound with the flamethrower and limps away.|$|E
25|$|Five years later, In-ha and Dal-po {{are high}} school seniors and classmates at their small-town high school. Dal-po, who is {{actually}} a genius, pretends to be dumb (like the real Dal-po) and gets all zeroes in his test scores {{in order to keep}} up the deception in front of Choi Gong-pil. With his last-place class standing and scruffy, country bumpkin hair, Dal-po is friendless at school while In-ha is the most popular girl. Dal-po secretly likes In-ha, and he is forced to join a televised quiz show at first to prevent Ahn Chan Soo, who has a crush on In Ha, from confessing to her on national TV. At the TV studio, he runs into the show producer Hwang Gyo-dong, who had been a YGN reporter and one of Cha-ok's rivals, but changed careers <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to the Ki family. After seeing Dal-po on TV, and despite knowing that her Pinocchio syndrome limits her career choices, In-ha decides to become a journalist.|$|E
25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E

500|$|The European vice-consuls in Rhodes {{were united}} in believing the ritual murder charge. They played the {{key role in}} the {{interrogation}}, with J. G. Wilkinson, the British consul, and E. Masse from Sweden being involved. During the interrogation of the chief rabbi, Wilkinson asked, referring to the qadi's decision to dismiss the case: [...] "What signifies the Mollah's judgment to us <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in Damascus and it is proved that, according to the Talmud, Christian blood must be used in making your Passover bread?" [...] The consuls were also present during much of the torture. When the chief rabbi, an Austrian subject, was tortured, he appealed to Austrian vice-consul Anton Giuliani, who replied: [...] "What rabbi? What do you complain about?

2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his {{liberation of}} Paris speech, de Gaulle argued [...] "It {{will not be}} enough that, with the help of our dear and admirable Allies, we have got rid of him [...] from our home for us to be {{satisfied}} <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> We want to enter his territory as it should be, as victors", clearly showing his ambition that France be considered one of the World War II victors just like the Big Three. This perspective was not shared by the western Allies, as was demonstrated in the German Instrument of Surrender's First Act. The French occupation zones in Germany and in West Berlin cemented this ambition, leading to some frustration on the part of other European nations, which became part of the deeper Western betrayal sentiment. This sentiment was felt by other European Allies, especially Poland, whose proposition that they be part of the occupation of Germany was rejected by the Soviets; the latter taking the view that they had liberated the Poles from the Nazis which thus put them {{under the influence of the}} USSR.|$|E
