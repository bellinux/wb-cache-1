Statistical analysis of compiled bathymetry andgravity data from the flanks of the Southwest Indian Ridge from 54 °E to 67 °E provides estimates of abyssalhill morphologic character and inferred crustal thickness. The extent of the compiled data encompasses aspreading rate change from slow to ultraslow at 24 Ma, a significant inferred variation in sub-axis mantletemperature, and a patchwork of volcanic and non-volcanic seafloor, making the Southwest Indian Ridge anideal and unique location to characterize abyssal hills generated by ultraslow spreading and to examine theeffect of dramatic spreading rate change on seafloor morphology. Root mean square <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> height inultraslow spreading seafloor ranges from 280 m to 320 m and is on average 80 m greater than foundfor slow-spreading seafloor. Ultraslow spreading <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> width ranges from 4 km to 12 km, averaging 8 km. <b>Abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> height and width increases west-to-east in both slow and ultraslow spreadingseafloor, corresponding to decreasing inferred mantle temperature. Abyssal hills persist in non-volcanic seafloorand extend continuously from volcanic to non-volcanic terrains. We attribute the increase of abyssalhill height and width to strengthening of the mantle portion of the lithosphere {{as the result of}} cooler subaxialmantle temperature and conclude that <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> height is primarily controlled by the strength ofthe mantle component of the lithosphere rather than spreading rate...|$|E
30|$|Normal faults, {{found on}} the outer rise of many Pacific {{trenches}} (e.g., Masson 1991), are one type of small-scale feature with potential impacts on the upper plate morphology. As the plate enters a subduction zone, flexural bending of the plate produces the outer rise (e.g., Bodine et al. 1981). Brittle failure manifested by normal faults permanently deforms {{the surface of the}} downgoing plate. Faults can form parallel to the trench axis in subduction zones. However, in regions where the <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> fabric, formed at oceanic spreading centers, strikes at a low angle (< 25 ° to 30 °) to the trench, the <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> faults are reactivated instead of forming new faults (Masson 1991). Reactivated <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> faults are identified by their strike, which is parallel to the <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> fabric or magnetic lineations seaward of the trench (Billen et al. 2007). Flexural bending structures and seafloor spreading fabrics along the outer rise are the major contributors to strikes of incoming topographic features on the Northwestern Pacific Plate (Nakanishi 2011). Furthermore, normal faults produced by plate flexure seaward of the trench penetrate into the mantle are thought to allow hydration of the upper mantle and crust (Ranero et al. 2003; Grevemeyer et al. 2007) leading to a potential role in overpressuring and hydrofracturing of the upper plate at depth (von Huene et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|On-axis deep tow {{side scan}} sonar data are used {{together}} with off-axis bathymetric data to investigate the temporal variations of the accretion processes at the ultra-slow spreading Southwest Indian Ridge. Differences in the length and height of the axial volcanic ridges and various degrees of deformation of these volcanic constructions are observed in {{side scan sonar}} images of the ridge segments. We interpret these differences as stages in an evolutionary life cycle of axial volcanic ridge development, including periods of volcanic construction and periods of tectonic dismemberment. Using off-axis bathymetric data, we identify numerous <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> with a homogeneous size for each segment. These <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> all display an asymmetric shape, with a steep faulted scarp facing toward the axis and a gentle dipping volcanic slope facing away. We suggest that these hills are remnants of old split axial volcanic ridges that have been transported onto the flanks and that they result from successive periods of magmatic construction and tectonic dismemberment, i. e., a magmato-tectonic cycle. We observe that large <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> are in ridge sections of thicker crust, whereas smaller <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> are in ridge sections of thinner crust. This suggests that the magma supply controls the size of <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills.</b> The <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> in ridge sections of thinner crust are regularly spaced, indicating that the magmato-tectonic cycle is a pseudoperiodic process that lasts ~ 0. 4 m. y., about 4 to 6 times shorter than in ridge sections of thicker crust. We suggest that the regularity of the <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> pattern {{is related to the}} persistence of a nearly constant magma supply beneath long-lived segments. By contrast, when magma supply strongly decreases and becomes highly discontinuous, regular <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> patterns are no longer observed...|$|R

40|$|Nearly {{complete}} coverage of shipboard multibeam bathymetry data at the right-stepping Menard and Pitman Fracture Zones {{allowed us to}} map <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> deviations along their traces. In this study we distinguish between (1) J-shaped curvatures at their origin, where modeling is addressing primary volcanism and faulting following a curved zone, and (2) straight abyssal hills getting bent in anti-J-shaped curvatures, in response to increased coupling across the transform fault, after they were formed. We compared the mapped <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> deflections to a detailed plate motion model for the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge to test how <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> curvature correlates to changes in plate motion direction, which lead to periods of transtension or transpression. This test {{was based on the}} number and size of the <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> deflections. The observations show a high abundance of J-shaped abyssal hills during periods of significant clockwise change in plate motion direction, which leads to transtension. The tip of the ridge axis can deflect up to 60 ° into the transform fault in response to changes in the stress field at ridge-transform intersections. This is observed, in particular, at the Pitman Fracture Zone, where there has been a ∼ 15 ° clockwise rotation of the spreading direction azimuth during the last 9 Myr. In addition, we observed anti-J-shaped curvatures at Menard, Pitman, and Heirtzler Fracture Zones during periods of transpression when increased coupling across an oceanic transform fault is partially accommodated by distributed strike-slip deformation rather than solely by discontinuous displacement at the transform fault. Anti-J-shaped deflections typically develop in seafloor less than 2 Myr old when the oceanic lithosphere is thin. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInternal tide driven mixing plays a {{key role}} in {{sustaining}} the deep ocean stratification and meridional overturning circulation. Internal tides can be generated by topographic horizontal scales ranging from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers. State of the art topographic products barely resolve scales smaller than approximate to 10 km in the deep ocean. On these scales abyssal hills dominate ocean floor roughness. The impact of <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> roughness on internal-tide generation is evaluated in this study. The conversion of M- 2 barotropic to baroclinic tidal energy is calculated based on linear wave theory both in real and spectral space using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM 30 _PLUS bathymetric product at 1 / 120 degrees resolution with and without the addition of synthetic <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> roughness. Internal tide generation by abyssal hills integrates to 0. 1 TW globally or 0. 03 TW when the energy flux is empirically corrected for supercritical slope (i. e., approximate to 10 % of the energy flux due to larger topographic scales resolved in standard products in both cases). The <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> driven energy conversion is dominated by mid-ocean ridges, where <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> roughness is large. Focusing on two regions located over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise, it is shown that regionally linear theory predicts an increase of the energy flux due to abyssal hills of up to 100 % or 60 % when an empirical correction for supercritical slopes is attempted. Therefore, abyssal hills, unresolved in state of the art topographic products, can have a strong impact on internal tide generation, especially over mid-ocean ridges...|$|E
40|$|Abyssal hills are the {{dominant}} small-scale roughness fabric {{over much of}} the ocean floor. Created at midocean ridges by combined volcanic and tectonic processes, they are rafted away by plate spreading and modified through time by mass wasting and sedimentation. Abyssal hills are morphological indicators of spreading rate and direction: they are lineated parallel to the ridge at the time of formation, and their heights and widths are inversely correlated to spreading rate. Knowledge of <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> roughness statistics is important for high-resolution models, including models of internal wave generation and mixing driven by tidal and low-frequency flows over the rough bottom. In this paper we present a prediction of <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> roughness statistical parameters world-wide via relationships for the average statistical properties of abyssal hills as a function of spreading rate and direction, and for the modification to these roughness parameters as a function of sediment thickness. These relationships are constrained by new publicly-available digital maps of paleo-spreading rate and direction, and sediment thickness.

During Alvin dives in 2002, organic material attached to basalt was collected at low, near-ambient tempera-tures from an <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> fault scarp in 0. 5 Ma litho-sphere on the western ridge flank of the East Pacific Rise. Mineral analysis by X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy revealed high-temperature (> 110 °C) phases chalcopyrite (Cu 5 FeS 4) and 1 C pyrrhotite (Fe 1 -xS) within the fault scarp materials. A molecular survey of archaeal genes encoding 16 S rRNA identified a diverse hyperthermo-philic community, including groups within Crenarcha-eota, Euryarchaeota, and Korarchaeota.

However, little is known about their spatial distributions, making it difficult to quantify their ecological significance.

40|$|Although our {{knowledge}} {{on the vast}} deep-sea biome has increased in recent decades, {{we still have a}} poor understanding of the processes regulating deep-sea diversity and assemblage composition, as well as their underlying natural variability in space and time. In the face of unprecedented anthropogenic impact on this environment, addressing this knowledge gap remains of paramount importance. In this thesis I focus on the effect of mesoscale (10 s of kilometres) spatial heterogeneity, in the form of <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> and surrounding <b>abyssal</b> plains, on benthic communities and specifically on foraminiferal faunas living at abyssal depths in the northeast Atlantic. ‘Live’ (Rose-Bengal-stained) and dead benthic foraminiferal assemblages, including rarely-studied soft-walled monothalamous species, were analysed based on a total of 16 Megacorer samples (0. 25 cm 2 surface area, 0 - 1 sediment horizon, > 150 ?m sieve fraction) from five sites within the area of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory (PAP-SO, NE Atlantic, ~ 4850 m water depth). Three sites were located on the tops of small <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> (~ 200 - 500 m elevation) and two on the adjacent abyssal plain. The main results of this analysis include the following. (1) Description of new morphotypes of poorly known primitive benthic foraminifera associated with (i. e. sessile on) planktonic foraminiferal shells and mineral grains. Some of these forms were more common on the hills, while others were more common on the plain. (2) Agglutinated foraminifera selected particles of different sizes on the hills compared to the plain, which affected their test morphometry and visual appearance. Distinct hydrodynamic conditions, and consequently distinct sediment granulometric characteristics between the two settings (hills, plain) resulted in foraminifera on the hills having more coarsely agglutinating tests. This information could be useful in palaeoecological interpretations of the fossil record. (3) Live benthic foraminiferal assemblages were significantly influenced by seafloor topography. <b>Abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> had a higher species density compared to the plain, supported a distinct fauna, and therefore tended to increase regional diversity. Enhanced bottom-water flow on hills, which affects organic matter supply and local sedimentology, were proposed to be responsible for these differences. (4) During the transition from live to dead benthic foraminiferal faunas there was a significant loss of delicate agglutinated and organic-walled forms. Unlike ‘live’ assemblages, the composition of the dead assemblages was very similar in hill and plain settings, suggesting {{that it would not be}} possible for paleoceanographers to differentiate between fossil foraminiferal faunas originating from these topographically contrasting settings. In conclusion, this study highlighted the significant effect of hills on agglutination patterns, assemblage composition and regional diversity of living benthic foraminifera.

40|$|A University of Hawaii oceanographic cruise, Abyssal Hills 69, {{with the}} R/V Mahi, {{was carried out}} to study the {{association}} of manganese nodules with an <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill.</b> Manganese nodules from three dredge hauls on an <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> located at 36 °W and 157 °W exhibited differences in morphology and composition between stations only three miles apart. The morphology of the nodules suggests that nodules from a single site have similar morphologies because they began growth at the same time, probably because of a volcanic event. Differences in morphology between stations indicate a local supply of elements. Atomic absorption analysis for manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper revealed that nodules nearest to a probable fault line and source of volcanism have a, lower manganese to iron ratio than nodules farther removed. This finding supports the theory that volcanism contributes {{to the formation of}} some nodules. Additional evidence showing association with volcanism consists of volcanic nuclei in nodules, crusts formed on layers of volcanic ash, and basalt encrusted to various degrees. The variation in cobalt, nickel, and copper contents Gt the nodules from a single dredge is two-to threefold, but iron content is more uniiorm. Four of the six cores from the area increased in manganese concentration with depth, suggesting that diffusion is concentrating manganese in the upper zone of the sediments or in nodules.

40|$|The rate of {{generation}} of internal gravity {{waves in the}} lee of small length scale topography by geostrophic flow in the World Ocean was estimated using linear theory with corrections for finite amplitude topography. Several global data sets were combined for the calculation including an ocean circulation model for the near-bottom geostrophic flow statistics, over 500 abyssal current meter records, historical climatological data for the buoyancy frequency, and two independent estimates of the small scale topographic statistical properties. The first topography estimate was based on an empirically-derived relationship between paleo-spreading rates and <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> roughness, with corrections for sedimentation. The second estimate was based on small-scale (< 100 km) roughness of satellite altimetry-derived gravity field, using upward continuation relationships to derive estimates of <b>abyssal</b> <b>hill</b> roughness at the seafloor at scales less than approximately 20 km. The lee wave generation rate was found to be between 0. 34 to 0. 49 TW. The Southern Hemisphere produced 92 % of the lee wave energy, with the Southern Ocean dominating.

P. oceanic crust. The 58 heat flow measurements made at five stations in the area have revealed (1) constant heat flow over the abyssal plain (56 mW m− 2), (2) a cyclic heat flow over the <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> (mean of 77 mW m− 2), and (3) a large anomaly of 710 m W m− 2 over one of several small domes which protrude from the abyssal plain. The domes are 0. 5 – 1. 0 km in diameter near the top and rise 50 m above the level of the abyssal plain. They are recognized from surface echo sounders by an abrupt disappearance in the abyssal plain subbottom reflectors, but on near-bottom pinger records they appear as steep-walled structures which are covered by ∼ 10 m of sediment (compared to ∼ 75 m on the surrounding <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills).</b> From analogy with active ridge crests, these features are probably small volcanoes. The heat flow anomaly over one of the domes is matched well by a finite element convection model with the following characteristics: (1) recharge at one basement outcrop and discharge at another, (2) 300 m of sediment fill between outcrops, and (3) permeabilities of 10 − 10 cm 2 for basalt and 10 − 13 cm 2 for sediment. In other words, we believe that there is very effective convective heat transfer within the crust and out of the relatively permeable, thinly sedimented basement dome, resulting in the local high heat flow. Overall, the results from the Nares survey vividly show the age independent muting effect of sediment on the surface manifestation of crustal convection. In our survey area the mode of heat transfer varies from purely conductive in the more thickly sedimented abyssal plain areas (∼ 300 m sediment cover) to moderate amplitude convection pattern beneath the <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> (∼ 75 m sediment cover) to a very large thermal anomaly over the small dome or ‘chimneylike’ structure (∼ 10 m sediment cover). The domes are possibly active analogues to the presently inactive basement chimney drilled at DSDP site 417 A...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> are {{the most}} {{abundant}} landform on Earth, yet the ecological impact of the resulting habitat heterogeneity on the wider abyss is largely unexplored. Topographic features are known to influence food availability and the sedimentary environment in other deep-sea habitats, in turn affecting the species assemblage and biomass. To assess this spatial variation, benthic assemblages and environmental conditions were compared at four hill and four plain sites at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. Here we show that differences in megabenthic communities on <b>abyssal</b> <b>hills</b> and the adjacent plain are related to environmental conditions, which {{may be caused by}} local topography and hydrodynamics. Although these hills may receive similar particulate organic carbon flux (food supply from the surface ocean) to the adjacent plain, they differ significantly in depth, slope, and sediment particle size distribution. We found that megafaunal biomass was significantly greater on the hills (mean 13. 45 g m− 2, 95 % confidence interval 9. 25 – 19. 36 g m− 2) than the plain (4. 34 g m− 2, 95 % CI 2. 08 – 8. 27 g m− 2; ANOVA F(1, 6) = 23. 8, p < 0. 01). Assemblage and trophic compositions by both density and biomass measures were significantly different between the hill and plain, and correlated with sediment particle size distributions. Hydrodynamic conditions responsible for the local sedimentary environment may be the mechanism driving these assemblage differences. Since the ecological heterogeneity provided by hills in the abyss has been underappreciated, regional assessments of abyssal biological heterogeneity and diversity may be considerably higher than previously thought...|$|R
