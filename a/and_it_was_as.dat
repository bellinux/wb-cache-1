5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{initially}} {{thought of}} calling the case 'Dreams and Hysteria', <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> {{a contribution to}} dream analysis, a pendant to his Interpretation of Dreams, that Freud saw the rationale for publishing the fragmentary analysis.|$|E
25|$|Callaghan's {{tenure as}} Home Secretary {{was marked by}} the {{emerging}} conflict in Northern Ireland <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> Home Secretary that he took the decision to deploy British Army troops in the province after a request from the Ulster Unionist Government of Northern Ireland.|$|E

This was a highly controversial ruling disputed by prominent peers of Feinstein.|$|R
50|$|In 1872 Woodgate {{was called}} to the bar. He practised for forty years but took neither the law nor {{anything}} else save rowing too seriously <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> a first-class oarsman and journalistic critic of rowing that he is remembered.|$|R
25|$|In 1963, Finlay {{published}} Rapel, {{his first}} collection of concrete poetry (poetry {{in which the}} layout and typography of the words contributes to its overall effect), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a concrete poet that he first gained wide renown. Much of this work was issued through his own Wild Hawthorn Press, in his magazine 'Poor.Old.Tired.Horse'.|$|E

25|$|I {{watched his}} face, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> grave and serene {{as that of}} a man writing in his own library. He was the very {{embodiment}} of tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid the animal-like babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling snarl of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of nervousness or haste.|$|E

50|$|Conventional {{airships}} {{often make}} use of aerodynamic lift by using their elevators to set a nose-up attitude so that {{the main body of}} the airship provides some lift as it flies along; however, this is typically done to counteract minor out-of-trim conditions, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>as</b> likely that the nose may need to be pointed down to reduce lift.|$|R
25|$|The Jacobite {{struggles in}} Scotland and Ireland {{were part of}} a wider European {{conflict}} that became known as the Nine Years' War. In 1692, Hastings' Regiment sailed to Flanders and, in 1694, took part in the disastrous amphibious assault at Camaret on the French coast. In 1695, Colonel Fernando Hastings was found guilty of extortion, and dismissed. Sir John Jacob became the colonel, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> Jacob's Regiment of Foot that they returned to England {{at the end of the}} war in 1697.|$|E
25|$|To get an {{audience}} with the casino's CEO Jay Sarno, Knievel created a fictitious corporation called Evel Knievel Enterprises and three fictitious lawyers to make phone calls to Sarno. Knievel also placed phone calls to Sarno claiming to be from American Broadcasting Company and Sports Illustrated inquiring about the jump. Sarno finally agreed to meet Knievel and arranged for Knievel to jump the fountains on December 31, 1967. After the deal was set, Knievel tried to get ABC to air the event live on Wide World of Sports. ABC declined, but said that if Knievel had the jump filmed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> spectacular {{as he said it}} would be, they would consider using it later.|$|E
25|$|At {{some time}} in 1589 Crane married her second husband, George Carleton, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> Elizabeth Carleton that she was {{examined}} on 1 October 1589 by the ecclesiastical commissioners. She refused to answer any of the questions put {{to her on the}} ground that she would neither be 'her own hangman' nor could she 'in her conscience be an accuser of others'. Together with Sir Richard Knightley, John Hales, and Roger Wigston and his wife, she was imprisoned in the Fleet. The interrogations of Knightley, Hales and the Wigstons likewise failed to elicit the identity of Martin Marprelate, which appears to have been unknown to those who harboured the secret press.|$|E

25|$|Some 200 {{yards in}} advance of our position, which we were holding at a terrible cost, was a fence built high and strong. The troops in advance had tried to scale the fence and reform under that hell of fire. They were {{actually}} torn in shreds and wedged into the fence. The cry came to us for volunteers to pull down the fence. Instantly there sprang from the long line, fast being shortened as the ranks closed up over the dead, seventy-six volunteers. We ran straight for the fence amid a hail of iron and lead, the dead falling all about us, but to reach the fence was our only thought. A part of the force reached it, and, as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying {{out of his hands}} by rifle-shots. The fence leveled, we made the attempt to return, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> hot for us on the retreat, as it had been on the advance. Few escaped death or wounds. I had almost regained my regiment, when I was hit. The line then successfully pressed on, and the 'Sunken Road,' or ' Bloody Lane,' as it is now known, was within our lines.|$|E
25|$|Hurst {{was called}} to the Bar in 1910 but then entered the UK civil service, serving in the Public Trustee Office from 1911, before {{transferring}} to the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War. At {{the end of the}} war, he moved to the Ministry of Labour <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a labour relations expert that he was drawn into the controversies of the UK coal-mining industry, serving as the secretary of the Royal Commission that attempted to bring warring owners and unions together in the period leading up to the General Strike of 1926, and then to the Coal Mines Reorganization Commission which was charged by the UK government with creating larger units within a highly fragmented industry but proved ineffective. Finally, from 1938, he was secretary to the Coal Commission which, with the imminence and then the reality of the Second World War, had the necessary power to reshape the industry and pave the way for state ownership as the National Coal Board in 1947. Hurst was offered a post within the nationalised industry, but chose instead to retire. He was awarded the Companion of the Order of the Bath and the Officer of the Order of the British Empire honours for his public service.|$|E
500|$|Ian Hendry {{stars as}} Dr John Kane, British {{astrophysicist}} {{and head of}} the Phoenix project. Hendry, who had appeared in the television series The Avengers (1961â€“69) and, according to Anderson, [...] "was always drinking", performed the stunt sequence depicting the aftermath of the Dove crash while drunk: [...] "...he was pissed as a newt, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> much as he could do to stagger away. Despite all that, it looked exactly as it was supposed to on-screen!" [...] In the draft script, Kane's first name is Philip, and he has a wife called Susan. In scenes deleted from the completed film, a romance between Kane and Lise Hartman, a EUROSEC official portrayed by Austrian actress Loni von Friedl, is played out at Kane's villa and on a beach in Portugal.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has {{also said that he}} has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, Iâ€™m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I donâ€™t hate him at all.

500|$|Illinois {{served with}} the European Squadron from 1902 to 1903, and with the North Atlantic Fleet until 1907, by which time it had been renamed the Atlantic Fleet. During this time, she accidentally {{collided}} with two other battleships. From December 1907 to February 1909, she circumnavigated the globe with the Great White Fleet. From November 1912, the ship {{was used as a}} training ship. She was lent to the state of New York in 1919 for use as a training vessel for the New York Naval Militia. The ship was converted into a floating armory in 1924 {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a floating armory, barracks and school that she served for the next thirty years. In January 1941 she was reclassified as IX-15 and renamed Prairie State so that her former name could be given to , a new [...] Prairie State was ultimately sold for scrap in 1956.|$|E
500|$|A piano version also {{appeared}} on the DVD single, which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. During an interview he stated, [...] "When BjÃ¶rk asked me to play piano on Oceania, she sent me the music, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> complicated and layered as any piece of classical music I've played. I spent a few days {{figuring out how to}} make her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios". BjÃ¶rk decided to stick with the album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices. Before some last-minute polishing by Mark Bell, this version of [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last track to be worked for MedÃºlla.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the accusations}} of {{nepotism}} that greeted his appointment on January 3, 1903, Sifton fast became a well-respected judge. [...] He served as {{chief justice of}} the Northwest Territories until September 16, 1907, when the Supreme Court of Alberta was established, whereupon he headed this new court, sitting in Calgary as the first Chief Justice of Alberta. [...] He was notoriously difficult for barristers to read: he generally heard arguments expressionlessly smoking a cigar, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> a judge that he first acquired his long-time nickname of the Sphinx for his inscrutability. [...] In one trial, he sat apparently vigorously taking notes during both sides' lengthy closing arguments and, once they concluded, immediately delivered his judgment. [...] The bewildered lawyers wondered what he had been writing down, since he had obviously made up his mind before closing arguments; once Sifton had left the courtroom, they found their answer in the form of page after page covered with the judge's signature. [...] He rarely recorded his ratio decidendi but, despite this, few of his decisions were overturned on appeal. It has also been argued that his fellow judges had difficulty ruling on appeals from his decisions specifically because he rarely provided reasons. Much of his work was in criminal law, dealing especially with theft of livestock (in which cases he generally delivered a sentence of three years hard labour, severe {{by the standards of the}} day). By the end of his judicial career, he had convicted as many Americans as Canadians. His rulings were generally concerned with practicalities rather than legal theory, based more on social morality than legal precedent, and he did not establish any important precedents.|$|E
