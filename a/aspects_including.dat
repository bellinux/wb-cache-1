25|$|Krupa {{praised the}} use of the Wii U gamepad as the Camera Obsura and enjoyed combat for most of the game, but found the latter third of the game tedious due to {{repetitive}} battles.

Wilson likewise enjoyed the gamepad's role in the game, while faulting most other <b>aspects</b> <b>including</b> the high amount of health items and character controls. Orry said that the new controls made combat more claustrophobic than in previous games, while Brown enjoyed the immersion the gamepad brought.

These sentiments were echoed by Dengeki, but stated that some combat situations made aiming difficult.
