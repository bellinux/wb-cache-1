40|$|The Papanicolaou test (or Pap test) {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{screening}} tool to detect cervical precancerous/ cancerous lesions. However, studies on the use of this test to predict both the presence and change in size of genital warts are limited. We examined whether cervical Papanicolaou test results are associated with the size of the largest <b>anal</b> <b>wart</b> over time in HIV-infected women in an on-going cohort study in the US. A sample of 976 HIV-infected women included in a public dataset obtained from the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) was selected for analysis. A linear mixed model was performed to determine the relationship between the size of anal warts and cervical Pap test results. About 32 % of participants had abnormal cervical Pap test results at baseline. In the adjusted model, a woman with a result of Atypia Squamous Cell Undetermined Significance/Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (ASCUS/LSIL) had an <b>anal</b> <b>wart,</b> on average, 12. 81 mm 2 larger than a woman with normal cervical cytology. The growth rate of the largest <b>anal</b> <b>wart</b> after each visit in a woman with ASCUS/LSIL was 1. 56 mm 2 slower than that of a woman with normal cervical results. However, they were not significant (P = 0. 54 and P = 0. 82, respectively). This is the first study {{to examine the relationship between}} cervical Pap test results and <b>anal</b> <b>wart</b> development in HIV-infected women.

40|$|Objectives: Trichloroethylene (TCE) is {{suspected}} of association with elevated risk of cervical cancer. A case–control study was performed in a geographical area in which occupational TCE exposure is high. The study objective was to analyze the correlation between occupational TCE exposure and cervical cancer (including precancerous conditions). Methods: Case and control subjects were recruited by gynecologists. General and occu-pational data were collected by telephonic interviews. An industrial hygienist assessed occu-pational TCE exposure on a task-exposure matrix. Analysis focused on occupational TCE exposure at various levels and on cumulative dose. Multivariate analysis was performed {{to take account of}} the various risk factors. Results: In total, 67 case and 67 age-matched control subjects were included. Mean age was 36 years in both groups. Five of the possible general risk factors correlated significantly with cervical dysplasia or cancer: number of partners, history of genital or <b>anal</b> <b>wart,</b> interval between first period and first sexual relation, parity, and body mass index, the last three show-ing inverse correlation.

40|$|Background: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) -related {{anal cancer}} lesions are often found {{adjacent to the}} squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). We have assessed the histopathology and associated HPV genotypes in anal SCJ lesions in surgically excised anal warts in HIV-negative and âpositive patients. Methods: Histopathology identified 47 squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) adjacent to the SCJ amongst a total of 145 cases of clinically diagnosed anal condylomata. The anal SCJ lesions were further analyzed with p 16, CK 7 and p 63 immunohistochemistry and HPV genotyping. Results: Sixteen (16 / 47) of the excised <b>anal</b> <b>wart</b> lesions contained HSIL; Three were HSIL and exclusively associated with oncogenic HPVs. A further thirteen (13 / 47) were mixed lesions. Of these eight were HSILs with LSIL and six were HSILs with papillary immature metaplasia (PIM); Ten of the mixed lesions were associated {{with one or more}} oncogenic HPVs, while three cases were exclusively associated with HPV 6. Conclusions: Clinically diagnosed anal warts cannot be assumed to be limited to low-grade lesions as anal warts of the SCJ often show heterogeneous lesions, with coexistence of LSIL, PIM, and HSIL. Lesions showing PIM, however, may mimic HSIL, because they are hypercellular, but lack the nuclear atypia and conspicuous mitotic activity of HSIL; and are p 16 negative.

40|$|Background. Little {{is known}} about the {{associations}} between CD 41 cell counts, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load, and human papillomavirus ‘‘low-risk’ ’ types in noncancerous clinical outcomes. This study examined whether CD 41 count and HIV load predict the size of the largest anal warts in 976 HIV-infected women in an ongoing cohort. Methods. A linear mixed model was used to determine the association between size of <b>anal</b> <b>wart</b> and CD 41 count and HIV load. Results. The incidence of anal warts was 4. 15 cases per 100 person-years (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 83 – 4. 77) and 1. 30 cases per 100 person-years (95 % CI, 1. 00 – 1. 58) in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, respectively. There appeared to be an inverse association between size of the largest anal warts and CD 41 count at baseline; however, this was not statistically significant. There was no association between size of the largest anal warts and CD 41 count or HIV load over time. Conclusions. There was no evidence for an association between size of the largest anal warts and CD 41 count or HIV load over time. Further exploration on the role of immune response on the development of anal warts is warranted in a larger study. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause o...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] (I) to {{determine}} the relative sensitivities of clinical examination, cytology and HPV DNA hybridisation {{for the detection of}} anal human papillomavirus infection; and (ii) to examine various factors which may influence presentation of anal human papillomavirus infection in homosexual men. METHODS AND RESULTS [...] 112 unselected homosexual men attending a Sydney STD clinic for routine screening underwent a complete anogenital and physical examination, during which blood samples (for haematological, serological and immunological investigations), rectal swabs (for culture of anal pathogens) and anal scrapes of the dentate line (for cytology and HPV DNA hybridisation) were collected. Papanicolaou-stained anal smears were examined for cytological abnormalities, including those indicative of HPV infection or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). HPV DNA was detected by high stringency dot hybridisations using radiolabelled HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 DNA probes. Visible anal condylomata, situated either externally or in the anal canal, were present in 26 % of these men; 46 % had cytological evidence of HPV infection, and 19 % of the smears showed evidence of mild to moderate dysplastic changes (AIN I-II). Detectable HPV DNA was present in 40 % of the anal scrapes. By combining these results, a total of 73 men (65 %) were found to have {{at least one of the}} indicators of HPV infection. These data, together with that relating to HIV antibody, immune status and past or present infection with other STDs, was correlated with information obtained from a questionnaire administered to the patients at the time of their clinical examination. CONCLUSIONS [...] In this study cytology was found to be slightly more sensitive than HPV DNA dot hybridisation for the detection of HPV infection in the anal canal, providing the full range of HPV-associated cytological changes were accepted as a basis for diagnosis. Clinical anal lesions were more likely to be detected in young men, men who had symptomatic HIV infection and those with a history of past <b>anal</b> <b>wart</b> infection. The latter group also had a higher incidence of cytologically apparent HPV infection in their anal smears. There was a significant association between the detection of HPV 16 / 18 and the presence of anal dysplasia, but there were no significant correlations between HPV infection or anal dysplasia and HIV antibody, immune function status, sexual practices or history of other STDs...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 128 biopsy {{specimens}} from anal condylomas in 73 homosexual or bisexual and 38 heterosexual men (mean (SD) age 31. 8 (9. 6) years) {{were subjected to}} histological assessment and human papillomavirus (HPV) typing by in situ DNA hybridisation with 35 S-labelled HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, and 33 probes. Most patients were also tested serologically for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As evaluated on light microscopy, most (74 %, 95 / 128) of the lesions were exophytic (papillary) acuminate warts, 15 % (19) were flat, and 11 % (14) were pigmented papulous lesions. No signs of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) were seen in 70 % (90) of the 128 biopsy specimens (NAIN), 27 % (35) were classified as showing AIN I, and another 2 % (three) as AIN II. AIN was significantly (p less than 0. 05) more often associated with papulous lesions, only 43 % (6 / 14) of which showed NAIN compared with 72 % (68 / 98) of acuminate condylomas. The duration of disease was {{directly related to the}} presence and severity of AIN in the lesions; thus in 47 lesions that had been present for more than 12 months, NAIN was found in 31 (66 %), AIN I in 14 (30 %), and AIN II in two (4 %). HPV DNA of {{at least one of the}} six types tested for was detected in 109 / 125 (87 %) lesions. HPV 6 and HPV 11 were the two most common types, comprising 57 % (62) and 37 % (40), respectively, of the 109 HPV DNA positive cases. Only seven (6 %) biopsy specimens were associated with any of HPV types 16, 18, 31, or 33, which carry a high risk of potential malignant transformation. No association was found between sexual preferences of patients and the incidence of any of the various HPV types. Neither did the distribution of the various HPV types differ between men with antibody to HIV and those without antibody. All the men with antibody to HIV were homosexual or bisexual. On microscopy, 93 % (38) of 41 lesions containing HPV 11 and 75 % (48 / 64) of HPV 6 lesions were of the acuminate wart type; in comparison, the remaining 16 HPV 6 lesions were equally either flat or papulous (eight, 13 % each). Of the 64 HPV 6 and 41 HPV 11 associated lesions, 73 % (47) and 63 % (26), respectively, were classified as NAIN. Only two lesions were associated with HPV 16, and both showed mild dysplasia. On the other hand, two HPV 6 induced lesions were associated with AIN II. No differences were found between HPV 6 and HPV 11 in duration of disease; (39 %, and 27 % respectively, had been present for more than 12 months). The results showed that overt <b>anal</b> <b>wart</b> disease was associated with HPV types 6 and 11 in most cases. Although HPV types considered as being of higher oncogenic potential were detected relatively rarely, the associated AIN in a relatively high proportion (31 % 32 / 105) of HPV 6 or 11 induced lesions indicated that a malignant potential, even for HPV 11 associated anal warts, cannot be excluded...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To compare anal cytology, {{colposcopy}} and DNA hybridisation as {{methods of}} detecting anal HPV infection. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN [...] Patients attending: (1) a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic with ano-genital warts; (2) a surgical out-patient department with anal fissure or haemorrhoids were examined {{for evidence of}} anal HPV infection. RESULTS [...] Considering GUM clinic attenders, 17 % (38 / 225) and 40 % (90 / 225) had perianal or <b>anal</b> canal <b>warts</b> respectively. Colposcopic examination revealed anal acetowhite lesions without warts in 28 % (63 / 225). Cytological evidence of HPV infection was found in 98 %, 83 %, and 90 % of patients with <b>anal</b> canal <b>warts,</b> perianal warts and acetowhite lesions respectively. Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) was documented in 22 % of patients with <b>anal</b> canal <b>warts</b> compared with 6 % with perianal warts (p less than 0. 01). HPV DNA was detected from the anal brushings of 71 %, 50 %, 32 %, and 29 % of patients with <b>anal</b> canal <b>warts,</b> perianal warts, acetowhite lesions and a normal anal examination respectively. HPV type 6 / 11 was detected {{in the majority of}} HPV positive samples. Considering surgical out-patient attenders with no history or signs of <b>anal</b> <b>warts,</b> 25 % showed cytological evidence of anal HPV infection and HPV DNA was detected from anal brushings in 3 % (2 / 71).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of anal cancer {{has increased in}} the past decade, especially among {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) and HIV-infected individ-uals. There is controversy about whether to routinely screen for anal cancer in MSM. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether current anal cancer screening behaviors, intention, and concern differ by HIV serostatus and to identify characteristics of men who intend to seek anal cancer screening. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of data collected from 901 HIV-infected and 1, 016 HIV-uninfected MSM from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) in 2005 – 2006. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported anal cancer screening history, attitudes, and intentions. RESULTS: A history of <b>anal</b> <b>warts</b> was relatively common in these men (39 %), whereas having a recent anal Pap test (5 %), intention to seek anal cancer screening in the next 6 months (12 %), and concern about anal cancer (8. 5 %) were less common. Intention to seek anal cancer screening was associated with enabling factors (screening availability, health insur-ance), need factors (HIV-infection, history of <b>anal</b> <b>warts),</b> concern about <b>anal</b> cancer, and recent sexual risk taking. Among four large US cities, there was significant regional variability in anal cancer screening behaviors, intention, and concern (all p< 0. 001).

There are few data on the sero-epidemiology of HPV 6 and HPV 11 among homosexual men. METHODS: Behavioural data and sera for antibodies to HPV 6 and HPV 11 capsid protein L 1 were collected annually for 1427 HIV negative and 245 HIV positive homosexual men. For HIV negative men, a combined variable, HPV 6 / 11, was created (HPV 6 and/or 11) to analyse predictors of seroprevalence and seroincidence. RESULTS: High rates of HPV 6 and HPV 11 seroprevalence were found (39. 2 - 53. 2 % of men). For HPV 6 / 11 (HIV negative men only), seroprevalence was associated with higher numbers of sexual partners, longer history of sexual activity and seropositivity for several sexually transmissible infections. Each year, 12. 6 % of men younger than 25 years seroconverted. Seroincidence (5. 9 / 100 PY) was associated with younger age, more recent male sexual partners, receptive anal fingering and anal chlamydia. Seropositivity and seroconversion were strongly associated with past and incident <b>anal</b> <b>warts.</b> CONCLUSIONS: HPV 6 and HPV 11 seropositivity were common among homosexual men. Among HIV negative men, HPV 6 / 11 seroprevalence and seroincidence correlated closely with markers of sexual activity.

Cholera toxin was able to enhance systemic and mucosal anti-VLPs responses after rectal immunization, but not after vaginal immunization. Rectal immunization with Resiquimod {{and to a lesser extent}} Imiquimod, but not monophosphoryl lipid A, induced anti-HPV 16 VLP antibodies in serum and secretions. Vaginal immunization was immunogenic only if administered in mice treated with nonoxynol- 9, a disrupter of the cervico-vaginal epithelium. Our findings show that rectal and vaginal administration of VLPs can induce significant HPV 16 -neutralizing antibody levels in secretions, despite the fact that low titers are induced in serum. Imidazoquinolines, largely used to treat genital and <b>anal</b> <b>warts,</b> and nonoxonol- 9, used as genital microbicide/spermicide were identified as adjuvants that could be safely used by the rectal or vaginal route, respectively...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Imiquimod is {{a topical}} chemotherapic and {{immunostimulant}} agent with antitumoral and antiviral activities, used for anal condylomata acuminata treatment, mainly in recurrences. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the imiquimod efficiency in chronic and recurrent anal condylomata acuminata in HIV-infected persons. METHOD: A prospective study that analyzed 61 patients with recurrent anal condylomata treated with topic 5 % imiquimod, {{for at least}} 8 weeks. These patients had already been submitted to other topical and surgical treatments for <b>anal</b> <b>warts.</b> We evaluated the efficiency of this agent, through wart remission, with clinical examination and high-resolution anoscopy, CD 4 + T lymphocyte count and side effects. The patients were 55 males and 6 females, from 22 to 63 years old. RESULTS: Remission was seen in 90 %, being 46 % complete remission and 44 % partial remission. Other 10 % {{did not respond to}} the treatment with imiquimod within the 16 th week. Recurrences were observed in 11 % of patients in 24 -week follow-up. Statistics showed no differences in CD 4 + T cell scores when groups with and without complete remission were compared. Adverse effects were reported by 45 % of patients. They were mild to moderate burning (25 %), intense burning (7 %), ulcerative dermatitis (8 %) and systemic symptoms (5 %). CONCLUSION: Imiquimod was effective in controlling recurrent anal condylomata acuminata in HIV-positive patients, regardless of CD 4 + T cell count...|$|R
50|$|Human {{papilloma}} virus, {{which causes}} <b>anal</b> and genital <b>warts,</b> {{plays a role}} in the increased rates of anal cancers in gay men, and some health professionals now recommend routine screening with anal pap smears to detect early cancers. Men have higher prevalence of oral HPV than women. Oral HPV infection is associated with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Anal</b> or genital <b>warts</b> may be {{transmitted}} during birth. The presence of wart-like lesions on the genitals {{of young children}} has been suggested {{as an indicator of}} sexual abuse. However, genital warts can sometimes result from autoinoculated by warts elsewhere on the body, such as from the hands. [...] It has also been reported from sharing of swimsuits, underwear, or bath towels, and from non-sexual touching during routine care such as diapering. Genital warts in children {{are less likely to be}} caused by HPV subtypes 6 and 11 than adults, and more likely to be caused by HPV types that cause warts elsewhere on the body ("cutaneous types"). Surveys of pediatricians who are child abuse specialists suggest that in children younger than 4 years old, there is no consensus on whether the appearance of new <b>anal</b> or genital <b>warts,</b> by itself, can be considered an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|R
