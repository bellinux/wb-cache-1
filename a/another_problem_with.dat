5|$|Women's {{football}} in Africa {{as a whole}} faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental gender inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the development for the national team, one faced throughout the continent, is if quality female football players are found, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the NIF lasers is {{that the}} flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|A life of Augustine {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a {{different}} light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> emerged <b>with</b> Censor Board of China for {{depicting}} {{the country as}} India's main enemy. As a result, the word China was muted out in the film.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> small <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> differing {{frequencies}} is the {{doppler shift}} and a Pip passing by at 3.4 m/s (8 MPH) will show a doppler shift of about 1 kHz.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> major <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Bradley was how Democratic Governor Jim Florio {{implemented}} a $2.8 billion tax increase, hurting the state's economy. In addition, Bradley {{refused to answer}} questions pertaining to Florio's tax policies.|$|R
5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> shellac {{was that}} the size of the disks tended to be larger because it was limited to 80–100 groove walls per inch before the risk of groove {{collapse}} became too high, whereas vinyl could have up to 260 groove walls per inch.|$|E
50|$|The ‘Harlequin Sign’ is {{unilateral}} flushing {{and sweating}} {{of the face}} and neck usually after exposure to heat or strenuous exertion.Horner syndrome, <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> associated <b>with</b> the sympathetic nervous system, is often seen in conjunction with harlequin syndrome.|$|R
5000|$|The {{state had}} over 70 water districts {{handling}} filings. The same stream had several water districts appropriating priorities without {{knowledge of what}} the others were doing. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> occurred <b>with</b> the growing awareness {{of the relationship between}} ground water and surface water.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> was <b>with</b> {{the rear}} suspension, which {{although}} slightly modified to allow clearer airflow {{from the rear}} of the sidepods, it was still directly in the path of the exiting air, which affected the stability of the back of the car, causing oversteer.|$|R
25|$|Stainless {{steel and}} {{aluminum}} handles are durable and sanitary, {{but can be}} slippery. To counter this, premium knife makers make handles with ridges, bumps, or indentations to provide extra grip. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> knives that have metal handles is that, since metal is an excellent heat-conductor, these knives can be very uncomfortable, and even painful or dangerous, when handled without gloves or other protective handwear in (very) cold climates.|$|E
25|$|Correct {{diagnosis}} {{is important for}} mental health disorders, otherwise the condition could worsen, resulting in {{a negative impact on}} both the patient and the healthcare system. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> mis{{diagnosis is}} that a treatment for one condition might exacerbate other conditions. In other cases apparent mental health disorders could be a side effect of a serious biological problem such as concussion, brain tumor, or hormonal abnormality, which could require medical or surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|Williams's {{objection}} {{has turned}} out to be valid: Modern studies of demography in natural environments demonstrate that senescence does indeed make a substantial contribution to the death rate in nature. These observations cast doubt on Medawar's theory. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Medawar's theory became apparent in the late 1990s, when genomic analysis became widely available. It turns out that the genes that cause ageing are not random mutations; rather, these genes form tight-knit families that have been around as long as eukaryotic life. Baker's yeast, worms, fruit flies, and mice all share some of the same ageing genes.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{dependence}} is <b>another</b> <b>problem</b> associated <b>with</b> ADH, which researchers {{think might}} {{be linked to}} alcoholism. One particular study suggests that drug dependence has seven ADH genes associated with it. These results may lead to treatments that target these specific genes. However, more research is necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of ring-tailed mongooses has decreased by 20% {{during the period}} 1989-1999 due to habitat loss. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> is competition <b>with</b> the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica).|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{possible}} <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> an iCVT is {{that the}} pins of the variator pulley can fall-out {{when they are not}} engaged with their chain, and wear of the pins and the grooves of the pulley halves can cause some serious performance and reliability problems.|$|R
25|$|The {{county has}} a mixed economy. An {{important}} part of the economy is based on tourism: many visitors are attracted by the many beaches and the mountains. A significant part of the county lies within the Snowdonia National Park, which extends from the north coast down to the district of Merioneth in the south; it is much larger than Snowdonia proper. But tourism provides seasonal employment and thus {{there is a shortage of}} jobs in the winter. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> tourism is the demand that it creates for second homes. This pushes house prices out of reach of local people, to the detriment of the position of the Welsh language in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Volta's {{batteries}} {{was short}} battery life (an hour's worth at best), which {{was caused by}} two phenomena. The first was that the current produced electrolysed the electrolyte solution, resulting in a film of hydrogen bubbles forming on the copper, which steadily increased the internal resistance of the battery (this effect, called polarization, is counteracted in modern cells by additional measures). The other was a phenomenon called local action, wherein minute short-circuits would form around impurities in the zinc, causing the zinc to degrade. The latter problem was solved in 1835 by William Sturgeon, who found that amalgamated zinc, whose surface had been treated with some mercury, didn't suffer from local action.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} using a {{specific}} collagen type II biomarker from {{the breakdown of}} articular cartilage is {{that the amount of}} cartilage is reduced (worn away) over time with progression of the disease so a patient can eventually have very advanced osteoarthritis with none of this biomarker detectable in their urine. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> a systemic biomarker is that a patient can have osteoarthritis in multiple joints at different stages of disease at the same time, so the biomarker source cannot be determined. Some other collagen breakdown products in the synovial fluid correlated with each other after acute injuries (a known cause of secondary osteoarthritis) but did not correlate with the severity of the injury.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> {{encountered}} <b>with</b> mechanical devices is {{the failure}} {{of one or more}} switch contacts to make firm, low resistance electrical connections, often necessitating some wiggling or adjustment of the knob to correct patchy colors on screen or unreliable peripheral response. Gold-plated contacts improve that aspect of switch performance, but add cost to the device.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} two decades a number of {{different}} approaches to “fuzzy probabilities ” have been presented. The use of the same term masks fundamental differences. This paper surveys these different theories, contrasting and relating them to one <b>another.</b> <b>Problems</b> <b>with</b> these existing approaches are noted and a theory of “linguistic probabilities ” is developed, which seeks to retain the underlying insights of existing work whilst remedying its technical defects. It is shown how the axiomatic theory of linguistic probabilities can be used to develop linguistic Bayesian networks which have a wide range of practical applications. To illustrate this a detailed and realistic example in the domain of forensic statistics is presented. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> huge <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{having a}} low scale of quantum gravity was the {{existence}} of possibly TeV-suppressed proton decay, flavor violating, and CP violating operators. These would be disastrous phenomenologically. It was quickly realized that there were novel mechanisms for getting small numbers necessary for explaining these very rare processes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> elderspeak is that {{licensed}} practical nurses, registered nurses, {{and other}} healthcare team professionals very seldom have training and expertise {{when it comes}} to communication with elders, and that elderspeak is often used incorrectly. Shorter sentences appear to have a beneficial effect on older adults’ communication, factors of elderspeak such as slow speech and exaggerated pitch tend to make older persons feel worse about their own competency, as well as the competency of the speaker; However, younger adults continue to use elderspeak with these characteristics. Not only does elderspeak fail to improve communication effectiveness for older adults, the messages inherent in elderspeak may unknowingly reinforce dependency and engender isolation and depression, contributing to the spiral of decline in physical, cognitive, and functional status common for elderly individuals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> wave heating {{has been}} the {{complete}} absence, until the late 1990s, of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the solar corona. The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the solar corona was made in 1997 with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) {{for long periods of}} time with stable photometry. Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 millihertz (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfvén waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} problem with blocking all scripts on all websites by default is substantial reduction in functionality and responsiveness (client-side scripting {{can be much}} faster than server-side scripting {{because it does not}} need to connect to a remote server and the page or frame {{does not need to be}} reloaded). <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> script blocking is that many users do not understand it, and do not know how to properly secure their browsers. Yet another drawback is that many sites do not work without client-side scripting, forcing users to disable protection for that site and opening their systems to vulnerabilities. The Firefox NoScript extension enables users to allow scripts selectively from a given page while disallowing others on the same page. For example, scripts from example.com could be allowed, while scripts from advertisingagency.com that are attempting to run on the same page could be disallowed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> {{associated}} <b>with</b> extreme cold is cavitation. Ring-porous wood is {{susceptible to}} cavitation because the large pores that are used for water transport easily freeze. Cavitation is much less of <b>problem</b> in trees <b>with</b> ring-diffuse wood. In ring-diffuse wood, there is a reduced risk of cavitation, as transport pores are smaller. The trade-off is that these species {{are not able to}} transport water as efficiently.|$|R
40|$|For flows {{the rank}} is an {{invariant}} by linear change of time. But {{what we can}} say about isomorphisms? It seems that in case of mixing flows this problem is the most difficult. However the known technique of joinings provides non-isomorphism for mixing rank-one flows under linear change of time. For automorphisms we consider <b>another</b> <b>problems</b> (<b>with</b> similar solutions). For example, the staircase cutting-and-stacking construction is set by a height h_ 1 of the first tower and a sequence {r_j} of cut numbers. Let us consider two similar constructions: one is set by (h_ 1, {r_j}), another is set by (h_ 1 + 1, {r_j}), and r_j=j. We prove a general theorem implying the non-isomorphism of these constructions.

25|$|Occlusal splints {{are divided}} into partial or full-coverage splints {{according}} to whether they fit over {{some or all of}} the teeth. They are typically made of plastic (e.g. acrylic) and can be hard or soft. A lower appliance can be worn alone, or in combination with an upper appliance. Usually lower splints are better tolerated in people with a sensitive gag reflex. <b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> wearing a splint can be stimulation of salivary flow, and for this reason some advise to start wearing the splint about 30 mins before going to bed so this does not lead to difficulty falling asleep. As an added measure for hypersensitive teeth in bruxism, desensitizing toothpastes (e.g. containing strontium chloride) can be applied initially inside the splint so the material is in contact with the teeth all night. This can be continued until there is only a normal level of sensitivity from the teeth, although it should be remembered that sensitivity to thermal stimuli is also a symptom of pulpitis, and may indicate the presence of tooth decay rather than merely hypersensitive teeth.|$|E

The section between Sears Point and Mare Island was plagued with fatal accidents, earning its {{nickname}} of [...] "Blood Alley". Between 1966 and 1970, 27 {{people lost their}} lives to it. In a preliminary effort to reduce the fatalities, officials established both a daylight test section, requiring all cars to keep their headlights on during the day, and passing lanes. However, these efforts were ineffective.|$|E
30|$|Thompson [10] {{argues that}} <b>another</b> major <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{stepwise}} regression {{is that a}} local optimization obtained by including variables one-by-one {{is not necessarily a}} global optimization. For example, selecting a fifth explanatory variable contingent on the four variables that were already chosen does not necessarily select the five variables that give the highest possible R 2.|$|R
30|$|<b>Another</b> <b>problem</b> {{associated}} <b>with</b> {{this legal}} mechanism is {{the distance between}} theatre production and its audience. Since each play begins its season with its all costs covered by the sponsors, the producers are not really worried about the empty seats in the audience. The artists can perform to chairs, then.

50|$|Common-emitter {{amplifiers}} {{give the}} amplifier an inverted output and {{can have a}} very high gain that may vary widely from one transistor to the next. The gain is a strong function of both temperature and bias current, and so the actual gain is somewhat unpredictable.
