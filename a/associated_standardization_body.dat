30|$|For a real take up of any STMA based {{ranking of}} CSP, that enjoys {{the support of}} future CSCâ€™s, {{especially}} those from the business world and government agencies, a <b>standardization</b> <b>body</b> or government led initiative could be preferable. That is not to cast aside efforts undertaken by the research and academic community. Instead, we argue that Government and <b>standardization</b> <b>bodies</b> hold more sway over {{the commitment of the}} business world to adopt such a classification scheme. This is specially the case, if a certain level of STMA was laid by a regulation as a minimum mandatory requirement that a cloud based service ought to have for being considered by a given sector of business or government agencies.|$|R

40|$|This Paper {{analyses}} the compatibility {{decisions of}} two regional monopolistic suppliers of a network-effect good who first build up installed bases {{in their respective}} home region and then compete in a third market. We show that with weak network effects, installed home bases always are higher under compatibility and suppliers always opt for compatibility. With strong network effects, home markets are covered, and given a sufficiently high home-market size advantage both the favoured supplier and a regional <b>standardization</b> <b>body</b> maintain incompatibility in order (to enable the supplier) to monopolize the third market via limit pricing. As incompatibility always results in a welfare loss, this is {{a strong case for}} a global <b>standardization</b> <b>body.</b> compatibility decisions; installed home base; international network effects; standardization bodies; third-market competition...|$|R
