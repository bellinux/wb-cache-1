At an {{altitude}} of , there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the high-altitude cold climate. Kagame {{spent the next two}} months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations. Alexis Kanyarengwe, a Hutu colonel who had previously worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation; the appointment of Kanyarengwe was motivated by a desire to appear inclusive, but most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi. Rank and file numbers grew steadily, with volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries. Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldiers' conduct. Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drugs,</b> and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several methodological {{reviews of}} alcohol {{treatment}} outcome studies and one review of drug {{studies have been}} published over the past 40 years. Although past reviews demonstrated methodological improvements in alcohol studies, they also found continued deficiencies. The current review allows for an updated evaluation of the methodological rigor of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> studies <b>and,</b> by utilizing inclusion criteria similar to previous reviews, it allows for a comparative review over time. In addition, {{this is the first}} review that compares the methodology of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> treatment outcome studies published during the same time period. METHOD: The methodology for 25 <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> 11 <b>drug</b> treatment outcome studies published from 2005 through 2010 that met the review 2 ̆ 7 s inclusion criteria was evaluated. The majority of variables evaluated were used in prior reviews. RESULTS: The current review found that more <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> treatment outcome studies are now using continuous substance use measures and assessing problem severity. Although there have been methodological improvements over time, the current reviews differed little from their most recent past counterpart. Despite this finding, some areas, particularly the continued low reporting of demographic data, needs strengthening. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in the methodological rigor of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> treatment outcome studies has occurred over time. The current review found few differences between <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> study methodologies as well as few differences between the current review and the most recent past <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> review...|$|R
