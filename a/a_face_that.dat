5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} {{the only person in the}} room when the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E
5|$|Thảo's Catholic {{background}} {{helped him}} to avoid detection as a communist. He and his brother were the only {{members of the family}} who were not anti-communist. The remainder of the relatives were followers of Diệm's brother, Archbishop Thục, who had been Bishop of Vĩnh Long during the war against France. Thảo was known to have <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> revealed nothing of his inner feelings. Thục's intervention helped Thảo rise in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Thục put Thảo in touch with Trần Kim Tuyến, {{who was in charge of}} intelligence operations under Diệm's younger brother Nhu, who was the head of the secret police and controlled the ARVN Special Forces. Thảo began as a propagandist for various units of the army and for the secret Catholic Cần lao Party, whose system of informants and secret cells helped create the atmosphere of a police state and maintained the Ngô family's grip on power.|$|E
5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the {{backgrounds}} in pencil, starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E

Social anxiety {{is one of the}} most common features associated with FXS, with up to 75% of males in one series characterized as having excessive shyness and 50% having panic attacks. Social anxiety in individuals with FXS is related to challenges with face encoding, the ability to recognize <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> one has seen before.|$|E
25|$|This {{traditional}} tail vise {{also uses}} one large screw, either wooden or metal. It {{consists of a}} movable block {{with one or more}} dog holes in it, the movable block rides in a large mortise in the workbench. The jaw has <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> contacts the bench top, and the dog holes are in line with the dog holes on the bench top. The two main varieties of this vise depend on whether the screw nut is mounted in the bench or on the dog hole block. When the screw nut is mounted on the dog hole block the installation is more complicated and expensive, but the screw does not move in and out as the vise is used.|$|E

500|$|Paris and Blois {{were the}} early centers of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as Julien Le Roy, clockmaker of Versailles, were leaders in case design and {{ornamental}} clocks. Le Roy {{belonged to the}} fifth generation {{of a family of}} clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as [...] "the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500watches. The competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately.|$|E
500|$|Half-French, half-Puerto Rican Kiele Michelle Sanchez portrayed Nikki in six {{episodes of}} the third season of Lost. She had trouble filming her burial scene due to her claustrophobia. Rodrigo Santoro, who has been called [...] "the Brazilian Tom Cruise" [...] and [...] "the Brazilian Russell Crowe", was cast in his first major American {{television}} role as Paulo on Lost. Appearing {{in a total of}} seven episodes, Santoro was reportedly paid [...] "between $2634 and $6427 a week". Lindelof called Santoro [...] "talented" [...] and [...] "perfect for Lost because he's <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> the American audience is not familiar with", despite being an award-winning actor in his home country of Brazil. Part of the reason Santoro was cast over other actors was because his physique was deemed attractive; however, the writers said that they were not interested in writing for his character with that in mind, nor did he want them to. Santoro has stated he enjoyed working with Sanchez and hoped to return to work on Lost.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{has been discussed}} {{in a variety of}} publications. Hilary Kingsley in her book Soapbox discusses Mavis's reticent and moralistic personality as seen in her drinking habits: Mavis drinks fruit juices, but on special occasions sweet sherry: [...] "two for Mavis is one too many" [...] says Kingsley. In a 1983 issue of New Statesman magazine, Mavis is described as having <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> is [...] "never quite sure of its own shape". The author describes the storyline featuring Mavis facing the prospect of a trial marriage or losing her boyfriend {{as an example of the}} [...] "either-or situations" [...] into which soap opera is [...] "forever ensnaring its characters". An article in the Evening Standard said Mavis was [...] "meek and mild" [...] and [...] "would not say boo to a budgie". In the same newspaper Mark Walton-Cook discusses Mavis's style, stating: [...] "I keep picturing Corrie's Mavis Riley twittering and clutching at the high neck of a securely fastened polyester blouse with a tasteful cameo brooch".|$|E

500|$|After a brief run as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> saw him {{defeating}} Chris Benoit at No Mercy, Triple H {{reverted to}} his heel persona and restarted his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when it emerged that Triple H had paid off Rikishi {{to run down}} Austin at Survivor Series, causing {{him to take a}} year off. While in the storyline Triple H said he had done it in order to shield Austin from the WWF Championship and end his career, in reality Austin's previous neck injuries started bothering him again, forcing him to have surgery. In November 2000, Triple H and Austin had a match at Survivor Series that ended when Triple H tried to trick Austin into coming into the parking lot to run him over again, only to have Austin lift his car up with a forklift and flip the car onto its roof 10feet high. Triple H returned a few weeks later to attack Austin, and their feud continued into 2001 and ended in a Three Stages of Hell match in which Triple H defeated Austin. In 2001, Triple H also feuded with The Undertaker, who defeated him at WrestleMania X-Seven. The night after WrestleMania, Triple H interfered in a steel cage match between Austin (who had just won the WWF Championship) and The Rock where he joined forces with Austin and double teamed on The Rock, forming a tag team called The Two-Man Power Trip. Triple H then defeated Chris Jericho for his third Intercontinental Championship on the April 5 SmackDown!, and won it for a fourth time two weeks later by defeating Jeff Hardy. Triple H then became a world tag team champion by winning the WWF Tag Team Championship {{for the first time at}} Backlash when he and Austin defeated Kane and The Undertaker in a [...] "Winner Take All" [...] tag team match. As Triple H was still Intercontinental Champion, the win made him a double champion.|$|E
500|$|On the red suit, Maslansky said, [...] "We wanted {{something}} that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy" [...] adding that it was [...] "tricky" [...] making it practical. To {{begin the process of}} creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor’s face is going to be doing something else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side {{as it is in the}} [...] "classic profile" [...] of the comics. DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the [...] "DD" [...] emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was [...] "one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was [...] "very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty".|$|E

Her marriage was arranged by the powerful Guise family. In the words of historian Jean Heritier, her background meant that [...] "at twenty-one, she knew all there was to be known about politics".

Although related to Hebrew Shekhinah, the spiritual {{state is not}} an [...] "indwelling of the Divine Presence" [...] The {{ordinary}} Arabic use of the word's root is [...] "the sense of abiding or dwelling in a place".

2500|$|The {{traditional}} tail vise uses {{one large}} screw, either wooden or metal. It {{is made in}} the form of a frame, with the back part of the frame fitting under the bench, and the movement of that frame located and restrained by a [...] complex system of sliding tongues and grooves, and runners, such that smooth left and right movements of the frame are possible, but forward and backward movements, or rotative movements of the frame are impossible. The jaw has <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> contacts the bench top, and it has one or more dog holes on the top—often 3 to 4, each spaced 5 inches apart—that are in line with the dog holes located on the front face (apron) of the bench—numerous holes, each also spaced 5 inches apart. This is the least expensive option for a tail vise, but it is by far the most complex to design, construct and maintain. Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.|$|E
