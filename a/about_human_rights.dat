Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international and national human rights and ethics institutions. Intersex organizations have also issued statements <b>about</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum.|$|E
