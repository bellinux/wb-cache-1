40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{establish}} {{the effects of}} the 1995 insurance system reform on dental utilisation. STUDY DESIGN: Four categories of patients experiencing homogeneous insurance changes - public/private insurance with and without <b>additional</b> private dental <b>insurance</b> [...] were analysed. The reform was hypothesised to increase dental expenditure for the Sickfund with (S+), and privately insured with (P+) and without (P-) <b>additional</b> dental <b>insurance.</b> Sickfund insured without <b>additional</b> dental <b>insurance</b> (S-) were not expected to change dental expenditure. Volume effects were also hypothesised per insurance group. These eight hypotheses were tested using longitudinal dental utilisation data of regularly attending adult dental patients: 91 general dental practitioners provided 803 utilisation records. RESULTS: The expected increase by S+ of dental expenditure was corroborated by the results. The three other hypotheses regarding dental expenditure were not supported by the results. The hypotheses regarding volume of dental services were partially supported. The S+ significantly increased their uptake of crowns. The S- showed constant uptake of crowns, endodontics and extractions as expected. The results for P+ and P- showed the constant uptake of restorations. The P+ group also showed the hypothesised significant increase in endodontics. CONCLUSIONS: Having <b>additional</b> dental <b>insurance</b> did not seem to influence the use of dental care in this population of regular attending adult patients. The basic health insurance (Sickfund or private) seemed to have an effect on dental utilisation. The results indicate an association of (expected) treatment need and the application for <b>additional</b> dental <b>insurance...</b>|$|R
