6000|$|I digress again, I see, but my drift I hope is clear. Differ as we may, Belloc and Chesterton {{are with}} all Socialists in {{being on the}} same side of the great {{political}} and social cleavage that opens at the present time. We and they are with the interests of the mass of common men as against that growing organisation of great owners who have common interests directly antagonistic to those of the community and State. We Socialists are only secondarily politicians. Our primary business is not to impose upon, but to ram right into the substance of that object of Chesterton's solicitude, the circle of ideas of the common man, the idea of the State as his own, as a thing he serves and is served by. We want to add to his sense of property rather than offend it. If I had my way I would do that at the street corners and on the trams, I would take down that alien-looking and detestable inscription [...] "L.C.C.," [...] and put up, [...] "This Tram, this Street, belongs to the People of London." [...] Would Chesterton or Belloc quarrel with that? Suppose that Chesterton is right, and that there are incurable things in the mind of the common man flatly hostile to our ideals; so much of our ideals will fail. But we are doing our best by our lights, and all we can. What are Chesterton and Belloc doing? If our ideal is partly right and partly wrong, <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> build up a better ideal? Will they state a Utopia and how they propose it shall be managed? If they lend their weight only to such fine old propositions as that a man wants freedom, that he has a right to do as he likes with his own, and so on, they won't help the common man much. All that fine talk, without some further exposition, goes to sustain Mr. Rockefeller's simple human love of property, and the woman and child sweating manufacturer in his fight for the inspector-free home industry. I bought on a bookstall the other day a pamphlet full of misrepresentation and bad argument against Socialism by an Australian Jew, published by the Single-Tax people apparently in a disinterested attempt to free the land from the landowner by the simple expedient of abusing anyone else who wanted to do as much but did not hold Henry George to be God and Lord; and I know Socialists who will protest with tears in their eyes against association with any human being who sings any song but the [...] "Red Flag" [...] and doubts whether Marx had much experience of affairs. Well, there is no reason why Chesterton and Belloc should at their level do the same sort of thing. When we talk on a ceiling or at a dinner-party with any touch of the celestial in its composition, Chesterton and I, Belloc and I, are antagonists with an undying feud, but in the fight against human selfishness and narrowness and for a finer, juster law, we are brothers--at the remotest, half-brothers.|$|E

[...] If he could sell the place, but then, he can't: [...] No one will ever live on it again. [...] It's too run down. This is the last of it. [...] What I think he will do, is let things smash. [...] He'll sort of swear the time away. He's awful! [...] I never saw a man let family troubles [...] Make so much difference in his man's affairs. [...] He's just dropped everything. He's like a child. [...] I blame his being brought up by his mother. [...] He's got hay down that's been rained on three times.

[...] "Where is Estelle? [...] Couldn't one talk to her? What does she say? [...] You say you don't know where she is." [...] "Nor want to! [...] She thinks if it was bad to live with him, [...] It must be right to leave him." [...] "Which is wrong!" [...] "Yes, but he should have married her." [...] "I know." [...] "The strain's been too much for her all these years: [...] I can't explain it any other way. [...] It's different with a man, at least with John: [...] He knows he's kinder than the run of men. [...] Better than married ought to be as good [...] As married--that's what he has always said. [...] I know the way he's felt--but all the same!" [...] "I wonder why he doesn't marry her [...] And end it." [...] "Too late now: she wouldn't have him. [...] He's given her time to think of something else. [...] That's his mistake. The dear knows my interest [...] Has been to keep the thing from breaking up. [...] This is a good home: I don't ask for better. [...] But when I've said, 'Why shouldn't they be married,' [...] He'd say, 'Why should they?' no more words than that." [...] "And after all why should they? John's been fair [...] I take it. What was his was always hers. [...] There was no quarrel about property." [...] "Reason enough, there was no property. [...] A friend or two as good as own the farm, [...] Such as it is. It isn't worth the mortgage." [...] "I mean Estelle has always held the purse." [...] "The rights of that are harder to get at. [...] I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse. [...] 'Twas we let him have money, not he us. [...] John's a bad farmer. I'm not blaming him. [...] Take it year in, year out, he doesn't make much.

[...] You see our pretty things are all outdoors. [...] Our hens and cows and pigs are always better [...] Than folks like us have any business with. [...] Farmers around twice as well off as we [...] Haven't as good. They don't go with the farm. [...] One thing you can't help liking about John, [...] He's fond of nice things--too fond, some would say. [...] But Estelle don't complain: she's like him there. [...] She wants our hens to be the best there are. [...] You never saw this room before a show, [...] Full of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds [...] In separate coops, having their plumage done. [...] The smell of the wet feathers in the heat! [...] You spoke of John's not being safe to stay with. [...] You don't know what a gentle lot we are: [...] We wouldn't hurt a hen! You ought to see us [...] Moving a flock of hens from place to place. [...] We're not allowed to take them upside down, [...] All we can hold together by the legs. [...] Two at a time's the rule, one on each arm, [...] No matter how far and how many times [...] We have to go." [...] "You mean that's John's idea." [...] "And we live up to it; or I don't know [...] What childishness he wouldn't give way to. [...] He manages to keep the upper hand [...] On his own farm. He's boss. But as to hens: [...] We fence our flowers in and the hens range. [...] Nothing's too good for them. We say it pays. [...] John likes to tell the offers he has had, [...] Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that. [...] He never takes the money. If they're worth [...] That much to sell, they're worth as much to keep. [...] Bless you, it's all expense, though. Reach me down [...] The little tin box on the cupboard shelf, [...] The upper shelf, the tin box. That's the one. [...] I'll show you. Here you are." [...] "What's this?" [...] "A bill-- [...] For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock-- [...] Receipted. And the cock is in the yard." [...] "Not in a glass case, then?" [...] "He'd need a tall one: [...] He can eat off a barrel from the ground. [...] He's been in a glass case, as you may say, [...] The Crystal Palace, London. He's imported. [...] John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads-- [...] Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don't complain. [...] But you see, don't you, we take care of him." [...] "And like it, too. It makes it all the worse." [...] "It seems as if. And that's not all: he's helpless [...] In ways that I can hardly tell you of. [...] Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts [...] To see where all the money goes so fast. [...] You know how men will be ridiculous. [...] But it's just fun the way he gets bedeviled-- [...] If he's untidy now, what will he be----? [...] "It makes it all the worse. You must be blind." [...] "Estelle's the one. You needn't talk to me." [...] "Can't you and I get to the root of it? [...] What's the real trouble? What will satisfy her?" [...] "It's as I say: she's turned from him, that's all." [...] "But why, when she's well off? Is it the neighbours, [...] Being cut off from friends?" [...] "We have our friends. [...] That isn't it. Folks aren't afraid of us." [...] "She's let it worry her. You stood the strain, [...] And you're her mother." [...] "But I didn't always. [...] I didn't relish it along at first. [...] But I got wonted to it. And besides-- [...] John said I was too old to have grandchildren. [...] But what's the use of talking when it's done? [...] She won't come back--it's worse than that--she can't." [...] "Why do you speak like that? What do you know? [...] What do you mean?--she's done harm to herself?" [...] "I mean she's married--married someone else." [...] "Oho, oho!" [...] "You don't believe me." [...] "Yes, I do, [...] Only too well. I knew there must be something! [...] So that was what was back. She's bad, that's all!"

[...] Say it right out--no matter for her mother. [...] The man was found. I'd better name no names. [...] John himself won't imagine who he is." [...] "Then it's all up. I think I'll get away. [...] You'll be expecting John. I pity Estelle; [...] I suppose she deserves some pity, too. [...] You ought to have the kitchen to yourself [...] To break it to him. You may have the job."

What <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> tell me?." [...] In 2005 Burke recalled: [...] "I started out as a cowboy on Atlantic Records - without a horse! I was the only singing cowboy with a corned-beef-and-pastrami sandwich on white with mayonnaise." [...] Despite his reservations, Burke, [...] "accompanied by smooth backing vocals and an arrangement equal parts Nashville and Nat King Cole, gave it his best." [...] Burke: [...] "I like country music but I don't think it was deliberate. I think it was something we just accidentally happened onto. By my being versatile. By my being able to sing different songs - being able to change my tone quality, having the different octaves. You must remember, I was capable of singing anything."Burke recalled: [...] "They weren’t happy with my rendition, because I felt I had to talk. We did it several times and I kept talking on the record. Mr. Wexler said 'I don’t think that’s gonna work'. At that time Mr. Paul Ackerman and others said 'leave it in. We don’t know what we’re doing anyway. This is something new we’re trying. No black artist has ever done country music before, so let’s see what’s gonna happen'. That was the turning point of my career - after that, international artist worldwide." [...] When recalling Burke's first recording session at Atlantic, Wexler added in 2002: [...] "There was a blizzard the morning we were to do the first recording session with Solomon and I didn't know if I {{would be able to get}} into New York. The trains weren't running, but I made it in that morning and there was Solomon, who had come up from Philadelphia. We did four songs in three hours, including 'Just Out of Reach'. After we finished recording, I went into the control room to listen to the playback. I looked around for Solomon, but he was heading out the door. He said he had to get back to Philadelphia while it was still light because he had a job shoveling snow. I think he was getting paid $3.50 an hour. He already had something like eight kids." [...] According to Tony Cummings, [...] "Despite the use of a different arranger at each session Solomon conquered all. His rich, vibrant, baritone voice brought the full majesty of the gospel tradition to a series of intense, moody ballads and laid down the solid groundwork of the soon-to-follow soul music explosion.|$|E

Varela's call hasn't gone unanswered, and recent years have seen {{the development of a}} small but growing literature intent on exploring the interface between phenomenology and cognitive science. But despite these developments, there is still some obscurity about what exactly neurophenomenology is.
