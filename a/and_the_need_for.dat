5|$|During the 1730s and 1740s, the Presbyterian Church {{was divided}} over {{the impact of}} the First Great Awakening. Drawing from the Scotch-Irish revivalist tradition, evangelical ministers such as William and Gilbert Tennent {{emphasized}} the necessity of a conscious conversion experience <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> higher moral standards among the clergy.|$|E

5|$|After {{conversion}} to M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyers, the battalion moved into Germany, helping force a bridgehead over the Neckar River at the Battle of Heilbronn. After reaching Stuttgart it was reassigned to the 103rd Infantry Division, {{and with them}} reached Innsbruck in Austria by VE Day. After two weeks of occupation duties it was ordered to prepare for service in the Pacific; however, while it was reforming in the United States, the Japanese surrender was announced, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> more combat units ended. The battalion was demobilized in September 1945.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of the civil war in 1983, a number of poets and fiction writers became active, {{focusing}} on subjects such as death, destruction, and rape. Such writings have no parallels in any previous Tamil literature. The war produced displaced Tamil writers around the globe who recorded their longing for their lost homes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> integration with mainstream communities in Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|Anti-vivisectionists {{commissioned}} a bronze {{statue of the}} dog as a memorial, unveiled on the Latchmere Recreation Ground in Battersea in 1906, but medical students were angered by its provocative plaque—"Men and women of England, how long shall these Things be?"—leading to frequent vandalism of the memorial <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a 24-hour police guard against the so-called anti-doggers. On 10 December 1907, 1,000 medical students marched through central London waving effigies of the brown dog on sticks, clashing with suffragettes, trade unionists and 400 police officers, {{one of a series}} of battles known as the Brown Dog riots.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E

5|$|During the 1768 Sejm, Repnin {{showed his}} {{disregard}} for local resistance by arranging the abduction and imprisonment of Kajetan Sołtyk, Józef A. Załuski, Wacław Rzewuski and Seweryn Rzewuski, all vocal opponents of foreign domination and the recently proclaimed policies. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had legally and practically become a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, several minor beneficial reforms were adopted, political {{rights of the}} religious minorities were restored <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> inward change.|$|E

When asked to approve this amount, Goebbels did so citing the importance of the film <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E
5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes.

The trickster is attracted to change <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules.

5|$|In April 1958, S. Gill (Ferranti) {{discussed}} {{parallel programming}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> branching and waiting. Also in 1958, IBM researchers John Cocke and Daniel Slotnick discussed {{the use of}} parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time. Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch. In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference. It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{typewriter}} received an unenthusiastic reception from the public. Lack of an established market, high cost, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> trained operators slowed its adoption. Additionally, recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical, all upper-case writing to be impersonal and even insulting. The new communication technologies and expanding businesses {{of the late}} 19th century, however, had created a need for expedient, legible correspondence, and so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures. The typewriter is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace, as many were hired to operate the new devices.|$|E

Kilroy also linked her opponent to the unpopular Republican administration and congressional majority. After Foley resigned following the page scandal, Kilroy attacked Pryce with the conservative religious voters.

5|$|The {{deployment}} to East Timor {{highlighted the}} limits of the Australian Defence Force <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> an Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers.|$|E
