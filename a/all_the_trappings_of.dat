2500|$|Kishi {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{prominent}} members of a group of [...] "reform bureaucrats" [...] within the Japanese government who favored an etatist model of economic development with the state guiding and directing the economy. From 1933 onwards, Kishi regularly attacked democracy in his speeches and praised Nazi Germany as a model for Japan. Very similar in their thinking as regards the [...] "reform bureaucrats" [...] in their plans to do away with laissez faire capitalism were the [...] "total war" [...] faction within the Japanese Army who wanted Japan to become a totalitarian [...] "national defense state" [...] whose economy would be geared entirely towards supporting the military. In the early 1930s, Kishi forged an alliance between the [...] "total war" [...] school in the military and the [...] "reform bureaucrats" [...] in the civil service. In September 1931, the Kwantung Army seized the Chinese region of Manchuria ruled by the warlord Zhang Xueliang, the [...] "Young Marshal", and turned it into the nominally independent [...] "Empire of Manchukuo" [...] supposedly ruled by the Emperor Puyi. Manchukuo was a sham, and in reality it was a Japanese colony; Manchuko had <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a state, {{but it was not a}} real country. All of the ministers in the Manchukuo government were Chinese or Manchus, but all of the deputy ministers were Japanese, and these were the men who really ruled Manchukuo. Kishi, visited Manchukuo several times starting in the fall of 1931, where he quickly become friends with the leading officers in the Kwantung Amy. As a key bureaucrat in Tokyo, Kishi played a major role in forcing out the private shareholders in the South Manchuria Railway company, which was the largest corporation in Asia at the time, so that the Kwantung Army could become a shareholder instead. One of Kishi's in-laws was the CEO of the South Manchuria Railroad, and his nephew advised him that making an alliance with the Kwantung Army was in the best interests of the corporation, and had the additional benefit of winning Kishi much goodwill from the officers of the Kwantung Army, who appreciated getting their share of the South Manchuria Railroad company's profits Besides for the railroads, the South Manchuria Railroad company also owned oil fields, hotels, ports, telephone lines, mines and the telegraph lines in Manchuria, making it the dominant corporation in Manchuria.|$|E

A third, who was but of puny dimensions, had bolstered himself out bravely with the spoils from several obscure tracts of philosophy, so that he had a very imposing front, but he was lamentably tattered in rear, and I perceived that he had patched his small-clothes with scraps of parchment from a Latin author.|$|E

This Paul has quite a {{character}} of his own--a grand old Venetian, with his head full of stateliness, and court ceremony, and gorgeous conventionality, half Oriental in his passion for gold, and gems, and incense. As a specimen of the subjects in which his soul delights, take the following, which he has wrought up into a mammoth picture: Faith, Love, and Hope, presenting to the Virgin Mary {{a member of the}} old Venetian family of Concina, who, after having listened to the doctrines of the reformation, had become reconciled to the church. Here is Paul's piety, naively displayed by giving to the Virgin all the courtly graces of a high-born signorina. He paints, too, the Adoration of the Magi, because it gives such a good opportunity to deal with camels, jewels, turbans, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> Oriental royalty. The Virgin and Child are {{a small part of the}} affair. I like Paul because he is so innocently unconscious of any thing deep to be expressed; so honestly intent on clothes, jewels, and colors.

60|$|The {{subject of}} the poem is his love for the lady Jane Beaufort, {{daughter}} of the Earl of Somerset, and a princess of the blood-royal of England, of whom he became enamoured {{in the course of}} his captivity. What gives it a peculiar value, is, that it may be considered a transcript of the royal bard's true feelings, and the story of his real loves and fortunes. It is not often that sovereigns write poetry or that poets deal in fact. It is gratifying to the pride of a common man, to find a monarch thus suing, as it were, for admission into his closet, and seeking to win his favor by administering to his pleasures. It is a proof of the honest equality of intellectual competition, which strips off <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> factitious dignity, brings the candidate down to a level with his fellow-men, and obliges him to depend on his own native powers for distinction. It is curious, too, to get at the history of a monarch's heart, and to find the simple affections of human nature throbbing under the ermine. But James had learnt to be a poet before he was a king; he was schooled in adversity, and reared in the company of his own thoughts. Monarchs have seldom time to parley with their hearts or to meditate their minds into poetry; and had James been brought up amidst the adulation and gayety of a court, we should never, in all probability, have had such a poem as the Quair.|$|E
