30|$|The <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of a wagon is {{the total}} wagon weight (empty wagon weight[*]+[*]load on the wagon) resting on the <b>axle.</b> Higher <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> means fewer {{requirements}} of wagons, which is good from the operator and customer point of view. <b>Axle</b> <b>load</b> is therefore an important design factor in the engineering of railways, designed to tolerate a maximum weight‐per‐axle (<b>axle</b> <b>load).</b> If it exceeds the maximum rated <b>axle</b> <b>load,</b> it will cause more damage to the track so, for infrastructure managers, a lower or safer <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> limit is desirable. In this regard [23] remind us that: ‘the negative impacts of increased <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> occur primarily {{in the areas of}} track and bridge maintenance and renewal, and freight car maintenance’.|$|R

40|$|A new {{identification}} {{methodology for}} dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> using the superposition principle and influence surface concept was {{proposed in the}} companion paper, in which the effects of {{various factors such as}} bridge inertia force, measurement station, vehicle speed, traveling route, number of vehicles, road surface condition, and noise level were investigated through numerical simulations. In this study the proposed methodology is applied to identify the <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> of a test truck traveling across an existing bridge. The <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> time-histories are obtained and compared to the static <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> of the test truck. The results show that the identified dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> are fluctuating around their static counterparts. The dynamic impact factor and load amplification factor for the <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> under different vehicle speeds and road surface con-ditions are also studied. Being able to identify the real dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads,</b> the methodology can be applied to improve the current bridge-weigh-in-motion techniques that usually require a smooth road surface and slow vehicle movement to mini-mize the dynamic effects. The developed methodology will also be useful in identifying real dynamic vehicle forces on bridges, which will provide more reliable live load information for site-specific bridge fatigue assessment and performance evaluation...|$|R
30|$|The {{weight of}} the vehicle {{is one of the}} {{parameters}} that can affect the response of the bridge directly. Especially when the load is dynamic, the response can be amplified with respect to static loads. Three different truck loads were employed to examine this parameter; partially (83 %) loaded HS 15 - 44 truck (SP- 17), fully loaded H 15 - 44 truck (SP- 0), and fully loaded HS 20 - 44 truck (SP- 14). SP- 0, SP- 14, and SP- 17 have properties of such weights. All the trucks represent a class-V vehicle (according to AASHTO) with one rear and one front axle. The distance between axles is 14 ft. H 20 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 32  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 8  kips. H 15 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 24  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 6  kips; whereas, the partially loaded H 15 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 20  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 5  kips.|$|R
50|$|Initially the <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> was {{expected}} to be a light 18 t and the power at ~. In practice, the German locomotives had an <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 21 t (which is normal for this type of diesel locomotive).|$|R
30|$|The SUSTRAIL study (2014) puts a high {{priority}} on {{the improvement of the}} rail system as a whole and emphasises an increase in <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> limits (to 22.5  t / 25  t), depending on different operational scenarios [34]. Some infrastructures, usually ore lines, are designed and maintained for even higher <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> than those suggested above. For example, heavy haul transport with <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> up to 30  t is well developed in Sweden, although for specific circumstances that may not be copied to other railways in general. Advances in rail vehicle bogie and general rail vehicle dynamics, through better suspension characteristics, are expected to reduce direct damage to track and allow increasingly high <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> An increase of <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> on existing lines can be costly but, if this is done systematically at renewal of the lines, the marginal cost will often be small.|$|R
40|$|In the past, damage {{resulted}} from load application to highway pavements {{focused primarily on}} the magnitude and frequency of <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> In recent years, the effect of increased truck tire pressure on flexible pavements responses has become a subject of great concern.

50|$|The <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of a {{wheeled vehicle}} {{is the total}} weight felt by the roadway for all wheels {{connected}} to a given axle. Viewed another way, it is the fraction of total vehicle weight resting on a given <b>axle.</b> <b>Axle</b> <b>load</b> is an important design consideration in the engineering of roadways and railways, as both are designed to tolerate a maximum weight-per-axle (axle load); exceeding the maximum rated <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> will cause damage to the roadway or rail tracks.|$|R
40|$|Traditional ways {{to acquire}} {{information}} on truck axle and gross weight are expensive {{and subject to}} bias, and {{this led to the}} development of weight-in-motion (WIM) techniques. Most of the existing WIM systems have been developed to measure only the static <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> However, dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> are also important. Some systems use instrumented vehicles to measure dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads,</b> but are subject to bias. All of this prompted the need to develop a system to measure the dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> using an unbiased random sample of vehicles. This paper aims to introduce four methods in determining such dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> from bridge responses, The four methods are interpretive method I, interpretive method II, time domain method, and frequency-time domain method. Examples and experiments in laboratory show that all the four methods are feasible and the time domain method and frequency-time domain method give very good results even when 5 % noise is added to the simulated input data...|$|R

30|$|Aluminothermic welding of rails {{is widely}} used within the railway {{industry}} for in-track welding during re-railing operations and defect removal [3]. The process suffers from variable quality in finished welds due to inherent limitations in the field. Under high <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> conditions, the recent failures in aluminothermic welds represent {{one of the main}} risks for a catastrophic derailment and a major limitation to further increases in <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> Improved rail welding and track maintenance practices would be required to meet the performance demands of higher <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|R

50|$|On railways, a given {{section of}} track is {{designed}} to a maximum <b>axle</b> <b>load.</b> The maximum <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> {{is related to the}} strength of the track, which is determined by weight of rails, density of sleepers and fixtures, train speeds, amount of ballast, and strength of bridges. Because track and especially the rails are expensive, it is desirable to optimise the track for a given <b>axle</b> <b>load.</b> If the track is overloaded by trains that are too heavy, it can be destroyed in a short time. However, it is also convenient for the steelworks that rails are made in a limited number of sizes, so that a perfect match of rail weight and <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> is rarely achieved. New rail is often reserved for heavy main line use, which releases good but lighter rail that can be cascaded for lighter duties on branch lines. The lightest rail cascaded from the lightest branch lines may have no railway use other that for structural items such as fenceposts, telegraph posts and for reinforcing concrete. Higher operating speeds can be achieved through reduced <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> and increased density of sleepers.|$|R
