50|$|Voter {{registration}} in Finland is {{automatic and}} based on the national population register. Each citizen is assigned <b>a</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> at birth. Permanent residents are recorded in this register even if they are not citizens, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register. People in the register are legally obliged to notify the register keeper of changes of address. Changing the address in the register automatically notifies all other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the social security authorities, the conscription authorities) and certain trusted private ones (e.g. banks and insurance companies), making the process of moving residence very simple. Close to election time, the government mails a notification to registered persons informing them of the election and where and when to cast their votes. Only citizens may vote in national elections, but all residents may vote in local elections.|$|E
40|$|The cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway plays a {{major role}} in growth, sexual differentiation, and {{virulence}} factor synthesis of pathogenic fungi. In Cryptococcus neoformans, perturbation of the cAMP pathway, such as a deletion in the gene encoding adenylyl cyclase (CAC 1), causes defects in the production of virulence factors, including capsule and melanin production, as well as mating. Previously, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis of the Ras- and cAMP- pathway mutants, which revealed 163 potential cAMP-regulated genes (38 genes at a 2 -fold cutoff). The present study characterized the role of one of the cAMP pathway-dependent genes (serotype <b>A</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> CNAG _ 06576. 2). The expression patterns were confirmed by Northern blot analysis and the gene was designated cAMP-regulated gene 1 (CAR 1). Interestingly, deletion of CAR 1 did not affect biosynthesis of any virulence factors and the mating process, unlike the cAMP-signaling deficient cac 1 ∆ mutant. Furthermore, the car 1 ∆ mutant exhibited wild-type levels of the stress-response phenotype against diverse environmental cues, indicating that Car 1, albeit regulated by the cAMP-pathway, is not essential to confer a cAMP-depen-dent phenotype in C. neoformans...|$|E
40|$|Recreational Therapy (RT) is a {{relatively}} new and growing profession with an expanding body of literature. The benefits of RT services have been demonstrated through research studies for several decades. However; {{there is a lack of}} significant studies examining the efficacy of RT services in clinical settings; specifically in pediatric rehabilitation settings. In an effort to promote efficacy based research studies in the RT field, the American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA) published a research agenda in 2003. This agenda highlighted the need for specific research areas in the field, including: (a) effects of leisure functioning on various aspects of health, (b) effect of leisure education on quality of life, (c) the effect of RT on overall independent functioning, and (d) effect of frequency and duration of contact with clients on RT outcomes. The current study aims to explore each of those impacts on the pediatric population. The purpose of the study is to determine if amount of recreational therapy services received during treatment significantly predicts changes in functional independence of pediatric patients in an in-patient rehabilitation setting.   	The study will be an examination of existing evaluation data from patients of an in-patient rehabilitation hospital who received RT services over a eight year period (2000 - 2008). The data analyzed in this study will utilize formerly collected electronic medical records data from an existing research study titled Effects of Recreational Therapy on Functional Independence Measure (FIM Scores and Patient Satisfaction (RW 06 - 01 - 05). The data includes demographic information (e. g., age, gender), amount of total rehabilitative services received (recorded in 15 minute units), information related to diagnosis and functional independence measure impairment group codes and pre- and post-treatment total pediatric Functional Independence Measure (Wee-FIM) scores. Independent variables for this study include: (a) number of treatment units of PT, (b) number of treatment units of OT, (c) number of treatment units of SLP, (d) number of treatment units of RT, (e) number of treatment units of Psychology, (f) gender, (g) age at admission, (h) frequency of utilization of each treatment service (i) diagnosis, and (j) pre-test Wee-FIM Scores. The dependent variables for this study include (a) change in total Wee-FIM, (b) change in cognition Wee-FIM, (c) change in mobility Wee-FIM, and (d) change in psychosocial Wee-FIM (from admission to discharge). In cooperation with a data manager from PCMH, the anonymity of participants of the study will be protected by assigning <b>a</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> unique to this study to each participant. No patient names or other identifiers will be included in the dataset.   Research questions include:   1. 	Does the amount of recreational therapy services received during treatment significantly predict changes in total Wee-FIM scores from admission to discharge?   2. 	Does the amount of recreational therapy services received during treatment significantly predict changes in mobility Wee-FIM scores from admission to discharge?   3. 	Does the amount of recreational therapy services received during treatment significantly predict changes in cognition Wee-FIM scores from admission to discharge?   4. 	Does the amount of recreational therapy services receive during treatment significantly predict changes in self-care Wee-FIM scores from admission to discharge?   5. 	Does the amount of recreational therapy services received during treatment significantly predict changes in psychological Wee-FIM scores from admission to discharge?  M. S...|$|E
