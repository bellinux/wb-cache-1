5000|$|The {{implications}} of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals {{have been found}} to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups (Morton, Hornsey & Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development. Paul Bloom of Yale University has stated that [...] "one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists."

[...] Fusion of PDGFRA {{has been found to}} be responsible for hematological malignances like hypereosinophilic syndrome. [...] The amplification of chromosome 4q12, the site of the PDGFRA gene, has been identified in 13-29% of adult gliomas and in 29% to 36% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), a subset of high-grade gliomas (HGG) in pediatric patients. Activation of PDGFRB, a third member of the type III RTK family, has been implicated in the development of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia due to the fusion of PDGFRB with the TEL gene. [...] Furthermore, PDGFB translocation to the COL1A1 gene locus has been identified to be responsible for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). [...] In cancer cells, PDGFR promotes tumor development and migration via proto-oncogenic downstream mediators like AKT and MEK. In stromal fibroblasts, PDGFRα activation leads to local tissue invasion, production and secretion of VEGF, and elevated intratumoral interstitial pressure. In stromal pericytes, PDGFRβ activation mediates vascular stability. [...] Thus, either FLT3 or PDGF/PDGFR pathway is the primary driver of oncogenesis in the above malignancies <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>targeted</b> by crenolanib therapy.|$|E

To assess anti-invasiveness potentials, a modified zymoanalysis method was used to measure MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 activities in the conditioned-media. The concentration necessary to produce 50 % cell death was > 80 µg/ml for ethanol extract of Cousinia shulabadensis, while a 23 µg/ml concentration of the diclofenac sodium produced the same effect.

40|$|Syndecans, {{a family}} of heparan {{sulphate}} proteoglycans that {{are present in the}} cell surface are involved in the control of cell proliferation, apoptosis and transformation. Syndecans 1 and 2 have a central role in processes such as position control, invasion, angiogenesis and metastases of several types of cancer. The expression of Syndecan 1 in epithelial cells, decreases when cells are transformed and acquire invasive properties. This decreased expression is associated to a bad prognosis. Syndecan 2, originally described in mesenchymal cells, favors cell apoptosis, increases angiogenesis and controls the death of cancer cells subjected to chemotherapy. Both syndecans are present in basal and epithelial cells of prostate cancer. Their lower expression is associated to more undifferentiated tumors. Disturbances in the expression and subcellular location of syndecans predict the relapse of localized tumors. Syndecans 1 <b>and</b> 2 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> considered tumor suppression genes <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>targets</b> for new treatments.

The structure of the NPBP/ΔNPNTD complex, solved to  3. 7  Å resolution, reveals how NPBP peptide occludes a large surface area that is important for NP-NP and NP-RNA interactions and for viral RNA synthesis.
