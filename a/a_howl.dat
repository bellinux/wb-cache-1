5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into <b>a</b> <b>howl,</b> causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E

[...] Due to Kennedy's poor start to the previous season, there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy {{was going to turn}} out to be just a [...] "wartime flash in the pan". Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. [...] "Come on, Teeder!" [...] was to become a familiar rallying cry in Maple Leaf Gardens. The cheer, <b>a</b> <b>howl</b> that could be heard throughout the building, was performed by, the otherwise quiet, season ticket-holder John Arnott whenever the Leafs needed a goal.|$|E
500|$|... 19 coyote {{subspecies}} are recognized. The average male weighs [...] and {{the average}} female [...] Their fur color is predominantly light gray and red or fulvous interspersed with black and white, though it varies somewhat with geography. It is highly flexible in social organization, living either in a family unit or in loosely knit packs of unrelated individuals. It has a varied diet consisting primarily of animal meat, including deer, rabbits, hares, rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates, though it may also eat fruits and vegetables on occasion. Its characteristic vocalization is <b>a</b> <b>howl</b> made by solitary individuals. Man is the coyote's greatest threat, followed by cougars and gray wolves. In spite of this, coyotes sometimes mate with gray, eastern, or red wolves, producing [...] "coywolf" [...] hybrids. In the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, the eastern coyote (a larger subspecies, though still smaller than wolves) {{is the result of}} various historical and recent matings with various types of wolves. Genetic studies show that most North American wolves contain some level of coyote DNA.|$|E
500|$|James Rocchi of MSN Movies {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Heartfelt and hilarious, smart and silly, action-packed but never violent, Despicable Me 2 is that rare sequel that outshines its beginnings." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "For an adult, the {{predictability}} could turn you blasé. For kids, revisiting these jokes is <b>a</b> <b>howl.</b> Pinkie promise." [...] Mary F. Pols of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As a sequel it stands level with the first film, and may have the edge on it." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, who do Minion voices expertly, never let up on the laughs. A fart joke in 3-D may not be three times as wacky, but the high spirits of Despicable Me 2 are irresistible fun." [...] A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "What's missing—and this was the crucial component of part one—is a little sour to undercut the sweet. Like its protagonist, a bad guy gone boringly good, Despicable Me 2 has no edge. It's fatally nice and insufficiently naughty." [...] Laremy Legel of Film.com gave the film a 6.3 out of 10, saying [...] "Despicable Me 2 is fun, especially near the culmination. Structural issues aside, it's impossible not to like these characters, all of them, rendered with love, always entertaining even when the story around them doesn't make much sense." ...|$|E

500|$|Gray wolves howl to {{assemble}} the pack (usually before and after hunts), to pass on an alarm (particularly at a den site), to locate each other during a storm or unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances. Wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to [...] Wolf howls are generally indistinguishable from those of large dogs. Male wolves give voice through an octave, passing to a deep bass with a stress on [...] "O", while females produce a modulated nasal baritone with stress on [...] "U". Pups almost never howl, while yearling wolves produce howls ending {{in a series of}} dog-like yelps. Howling consists of a fundamental frequency that may lie between 150 and 780Hz, and consists of up to 12 harmonically related overtones. The pitch usually remains constant or varies smoothly, and may change direction as many as four or five times. Howls used for calling pack mates to a kill are long, smooth sounds similar {{to the beginning of the}} cry of a horned owl. When pursuing prey, they emit a higher pitched howl, vibrating on two notes. When closing in on their prey, they emit a combination of a short bark and <b>a</b> <b>howl.</b> When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are. Lone wolves typically avoid howling in areas where other packs are present. Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions: the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable. The two are however mutually intelligible, as North American wolves have been recorded to respond to European-style howls made by biologists.|$|E
2500|$|The Wrestler has {{received}} much critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 98% of critics gave the film positive write-ups {{based upon a}} sample of 222, {{and gave it a}} Golden Tomato for best drama of 2008.

[...] At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film {{has received}} an average score of 81, based on 36 reviews, signifying [...] "universal acclaim".

2500|$|Much {{has been}} made over the years of Gilbert Jessop's innings of 157 {{in an hour and}} the {{reactions}} of the coloured cricketers. C.L.R. James reports that Float Woods [...] "went to his captain and asked permission to take off his boots. West Indian captain Aucher Warner asked him why: he replied that he could bowl properly only when barefooted. Woods was making the best response he knew to a truly desperate situation." [...] Sammy Woods in his autobiography reports that Jessop [...] "hit the two famous Black Bowlers (Cumberbatch and Woods) so furiously that not only they couldn't bowl for laughter, {{but the rest of the}} dark ones in the field rolled about and set up <b>a</b> <b>howl</b> of delight". Archie Cumberbatch was, of course, not on the tour at all and this and other remarks are probably embellished. Overall the reports are of doubtful accuracy and have racist undertones to them.|$|E

Accept evolution with its fossils and elementary species, its scientific doctrine of natural causes. And still you are confronted with the same mystery, primary and profound. Ex nihilo nihil, as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it: nothing can come of nothing." [...] This was brought home to him in London, where in his spare time he had organised a working boys' club. One day he invited a distinguished zoologist to deliver a lecture to the members. The speaker, adopting [...] "a frankly atheistic approach," [...] described the sequence of events leading to the emergence, [...] "though he did not say how," [...] of the first primitive life-form from lifeless matter. When he concluded, there was polite applause. Then, [...] "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet," [...] and with a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place. The naïve question took everyone by surprise. The lecturer [...] "looked annoyed, hesitated, slowly turned red. Then, before he could answer, the whole club burst into <b>a</b> <b>howl</b> of laughter.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 August, the leading {{authorities}} of Hunedoara County came to Lupeni, accompanied by 80 troops from the 4th frontier guards regiment and some 20 gendarmes. The mining company attempted to start the power station with strike-breakers {{in order to prevent}} the mines from being flooded and those underground from being asphyxiated, but the strikers maintained a cordon around the works. (A prosecutor later reported that the men inside the power station were [...] "armed with stakes, iron bars, bludgeons and revolvers and were awaiting the authorities with aggressive poses".) The public prosecutor made a final demand that the strikers withdraw from the power station; the strikers replied with <b>a</b> <b>howl</b> of defiance. Some 40 gendarmes now present advanced, trying to intimidate the strikers. According to later testimony, the workers then threw objects toward the gendarmes, wounding those in the first line. When a striker fired a revolver, the 80 troops fired warning shots into the air. As the miners' aggressiveness was undiminished, the troops fired 78 bullets into the crowd (without orders, as established by an enquiry), some lodging in the power station's chimney. When the firing ceased, dozens of men lay on the ground; the rest, panic-stricken, fled quickly. Work at the station resumed immediately; troops and gendarmes guarded the station and all mine buildings.|$|E
