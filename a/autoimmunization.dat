40|$|Introduction. Red {{blood cell}} (RBC) alloimmunization and <b>autoimmunization</b> remain {{a major problem}} in {{transfusion}} dependent thalassemic patients. There is a paucity of data on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization and <b>autoimmunization</b> in thalassemic patients from eastern part of India, as pretransfusion antibody screening is not routinely performed. Aims. To assess the incidence of RBC alloimmunization and <b>autoimmunization</b> in transfusion dependent thalassemic patients in eastern India. Materials and Methods. Total 500 thalassemia cases were evaluated. The antibody screening and identification were performed with commercially available panel cells (Diapanel, Bio-rad, Switzerland) by column agglutination method. To detect autoantibodies, autocontrol and direct antiglobulin tests were carried out using polyspecific coombs (IgG + C 3 d) gel cards in all patients. Results. A total of 28 patients developed RBC alloimmunization (5. 6 %) and 5 patients had autoantibodies (1 %). Alloantibody against c had the highest incidence (28. 57 %) followed by E (21. 42 %). Five out of 28 (17. 85 %) patients had developed antibodies against both c and E. Conclusion. Data from this study demonstrate that the RBC alloantibody and autoantibody development rates are significant in our region. Thus, pretransfusion antibody screening needs to be initiated in eastern India in order to ensure safe transfusion practice...|$|E
40|$|Autoantibodies to {{red blood}} cells (RBC) may be simple to investigate. Most cases can be solved with methods, whose {{principles}} are known for more than 60 years. However, the pathophysiology of <b>autoimmunization</b> is less known. Clinical experiences impose that autoantibodies to RBC are a heterogeneous complex that ranges from autoantibodies in autoimmune hemolytic anemia to accompanying autoantibodies as seen after different immunizations. The presented papers show that immunization against alloantigens is a principal factor for <b>autoimmunization.</b> Alloantibodies to RBC are 22 -fold more frequent in patients with autoantibodies, and alloimmunization explains autoantibodies in 81 % of these cases. Alloantibody crossreacitivity may explain this autoreactive behavior that often diminishes during antibody maturation. Autoantibodies {{may be associated with}} certain alloantibodies. This can be shown for antibodies to the RHCE-protein that occur 1. 6 -fold more frequent than other alloantibodies in patients with autoantibodies (normalized odds ratio, NOR). The association is even more pronounced for antibodies to the S/s-polymorphism on glycophorin B that is associated with RH proteins in a supramolecular complex. This type of accompanying autoantibodies may involve epitope spreading. Innate factors and constitutive costimulation like the SIRP-alfa-CD 47 -interaction are less significant for RBC <b>autoimmunization.</b> In contrast, danger signals as in medical procedures that lead to transfusion or infections that require antibiotic treatment may be important in overcoming tolerance in accompanying autoantibodies as in alloimmunization or in drug-induced immunization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Life-long {{red blood}} {{transfusion}} remains the main treatment for severe thalassemia. The development of hemolytic alloantibodies and erythrocyte autoantibodies complicated transfusion therapy in thalassemia patients. The frequency causes {{and prevention of}} this phenomenon among 80 transfused thalassemia patients were evaluated in Ali Asghar Children’s Hospital during 1998 - 2004 in a cross-sectional study. In our study the mean age at the initiation of transfusion was 1. 7 years (SD = 1. 94) and mean interval of transfusion 33. 73 day (SD = 20. 74). <b>Autoimmunization</b> in 15 patients was positive and 8 patients had hemolytic reaction in transfusion. Our data show that alloimmunization to minor erythrocyte antigens and erythrocyte <b>autoimmunization</b> of significant clinical variables, are frequent findings in transfused thalassemia patients. However data suggest that prevalence of immunization in our patients is less than other Asian countries...|$|E
40|$|Some {{published}} {{evidence has}} revealed that the dendritic cells can interact with pathogens {{that exist in the}} inner foreskin. This information provides a new vision that pathogens could play a role through the redundant prepuce; numerous studies have failed to find pathogens in prostates of patients who had chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). However, no studies have reported an association between foreskin length and CP/CPPS. Hence, we conducted a retrospective case-control study of clinical data from 322 CP/CPPS patients (case group) and 341 nonCP/CPPS patients (control group). Demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and foreskin lengths were collected and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was adopted to calculate the odds of foreskin length for CP/CPPS. According to the multivariate logistic regression results, when the foreskin length covered up {{more than half of the}} glans penis, the odds for CP/CPPS were higher with an increased foreskin (odds ratio (OR) : 1. 66, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 04 - 2. 66). In comparison, when the glans penis was completely covered by the foreskin, the OR value increased to 1. 86 (95 % CI, 1. 2 - 2. 88). The study results showed an association between foreskin length and the odds of CP/CPPS. When the foreskin length covered up more than half of the glans penis, there were greater odds for CP/CPPS. This possible mechanism might result from interaction between pathogens and DCs in the inner foreskin, consequently activating T-cells to mediate allergic inflammation in the prostate and producing the <b>autoimmunizations</b> causing CP/CPPS...|$|R

40|$|We have {{postulated}} that binding of the hydrophobic anticonvulsant drug diphenylhydantoin (DPH) to lymphoid cells might induce graft-versus-host (GVH) -like cell reactions by T lymphocytes and thus trigger <b>autoimmunization</b> and lymphoma development observed in patients treated with DPH. This hypothesis was studied in mice {{by means of}} the popliteal lymph node (PLN) assay. DPH, injected s. c. into the footpads of mice, induced a significant T cell-dependent PLN enlargement. The B cell-derived population comprised the majority of cells in the enlarged PLN. A T cell-dependent activation of Ig-secreting cells in the PLN was induced by DPH. Thymectomy of young adult mice significantly amplified the PLN reaction to DPH and facilitated the activation of Ig-secreting cells. Since injection of the hydantoin rings only completely failed to induce PLN reactions, it is assumed that the observed PLN reactions are caused by the phenyl groups and/or the highly reactive intermediates of DPH. In conclusion, DPH can induce a T cell-dependent proliferation and functional activation of B cells. Conceivably, if such a process persists, it might lead to the GVH-like lymphomagenesis and <b>autoimmunization</b> observed in patients treated with this dru...|$|E

40|$|Autoantibodies {{against the}} 70 -kD U 1 RNP {{nucleoprotein}} autoantigen and DNA were elicited in normal BALB/c mice with a purified Ig light chain. This light chain, {{derived from a}} lupus-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mouse, has two distinctive properties: it contains an idiotypic marker recognized by a monoclonal MRL-lpr/lpr anti-snRNP autoantibody, and the amino acid sequence of its third hypervariable region (CDR 3) is homologous to a sequence in an antigenic region of the 70 -kD U 1 RNP polypeptide.

40|$|Unilateral thermal {{injury to}} guinea pig testes has {{elicited}} {{the formation of}} organ- and species-specific antibodies against a testicular antigen. The antibodies were of an IgG 1 nature, and reacted with autologous as well as homologous testicular extracts. A significant number of burned animals showed pathological changes in the contralateral testis, which {{were similar to those}} observed after the induction of experimental allergic orchitis by active immunization with testicular tissue.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between expression of xenotropic virus {{and the development}} of <b>autoimmunization</b> was studied in the progeny of crosses between New Zealand Black (NZB) and SWR mice. The (F 1 X SWR) and F 2 progeny segregated into three phenotypes: high-virus, low-virus, and virus-negative; F 1 and (F 1 X NZB) progeny were always high-virus. Autoantibodies, immune deposit nephritis and lymphomas developed in the progeny of these crosses. The virological phenotype of the animal could be dissociated from the presence of either autoantibodies or nephritis. For example, mice that expressed titers of virus as high as the NZB parent failed to develop signs of <b>autoimmunization,</b> even up to 24 mo of age. By contrast, some (F 1 X SWR) and F 2 mice that expressed low titers of virus developed autoimmune disease. Furthermore, a proportion of virus-negative mice produced autoantibodies and were found to have typical immune deposit nephritis. No viral antigens could be detected in the renal lesions of such virus-negative animals. By contrast with the dissociation between expression of virus and occurrence of nephritis, the presence of antibodies to DNA correlated with the development of renal lesions. We conclude that the genes that determine the expression of infectious xenotropic virus in NZB mice segregate independently from those that are involved in the autoimmune disease of these animals...|$|E
40|$|Serum or urine {{from normal}} adult Lewis rats {{can be shown}} to contain {{detectable}} amounts of idiotypic, antigen-binding receptors with specificity for the major histocompatibility complex locus antigens of the rat, the Ag-B locus antigens. Such purified naturally occurring receptor molecules, be they of T- or B-lymphocyte origin, {{can be used in}} a polymerized form to provoke the production of auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies when injected back into normal Lewis rats. As a consequence of this autoimmunity, lymphocytes of these Lewis rats can be shown to be depleted of cells carrying the relevant idiotypic receptors signifying reactivity against a given Ag-B locus-determined antigen(s). This specific lack of idiotypic lymphocytes is manifested as a selective loss of reactivity against the relevant Ag-B-incompatible antigens as measured by graft versus host or MLC reactions. Furthermore, autoimmune Lewis rats display specific transplantation tolerance against the skin grafts from the relevant strain, as demonstrated by specific prolongation of graft survival. A further indication of the specific tolerence state of these rats comes from the highly reduced ability to produce circulating antibodies against the relevant Ag-B antigens. No side effects of these <b>autoimmunization</b> procedures have been noted so far. It would thus seem clear that a prolonged state of specific transplantation tolerance can be achieved via <b>autoimmunization</b> against the individual's naturally occurring idiotypic, antigen-binding receptors...|$|E

This review focuses on the autoantibodies and their detection, and briefly considers prospects for novel therapeutic approaches.

40|$|Background: Thalassemia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{monogenic}} disorders characterized by reduced production of globin chains. Although regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusion support is the main treatment for these patients, it may be associated with complications such as RBC alloimmunization. Aim: The study aimed to determine the incidence of alloimmunization and <b>autoimmunization</b> to RBC antigens in β-thalassemia major patients from Zanjan, Zanjan Province, Iran. Materials and Methods: A total of 49 β-thalassemia major patients comprising 24 females and 25 males (mean age: 18. 59 ΁ 8. 16 years; range: 2 - 40 years) from Northwest Iran were included in a cross-sectional study. Alloantibody screening and identification were done using 3 -cell and 10 -cell reagent red blood cells, respectively. Autoantibody detection was performed using direct Coomb′s test. Results: The incidence of alloimmunization was 16. 32 % with 10 alloantibodies identified in 8 patients. The most common clinically significant alloantibody identified in alloimmunized patients was anti-Kell (K-antigen) (60 %) followed by anti-Rhesus (Rh) (E, c-antigens). The rate of alloimmunization was significantly lower in patients transfused with leukoreduced RBCs compared with those transfused with nonleukoreduced RBCs (9. 53 % vs 57. 14 %, P = 0. 001). There was no significant correlation between alloantibody formation and the age, gender, hemoglobin levels, number of transfused units, and splenectomy. Conclusion: Transfusion of leukoreduced and phenotypically matched red blood cells for Kell (K) and Rh (E, c) antigens may help reduce the alloimmunization rate in Iranian β-thalassemia major patients. Moreover, <b>autoimmunization</b> to RBC antigens was rare in our patients...|$|E
40|$|In {{sporadic}} autoimmune disorders, dendritic {{cells are}} increasingly being incriminated as agents provocateurs. However, the mechanisms and any ‘danger signals’ that induce them to autoimmunize remain enigmatic. Here, we focus on unexpected clues from two prototypic/ highly informative autoimmune syndromes, acquired thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis and the monogenic autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type- 1 (APS 1), caused by mutations in the AutoImmune Regulator (AIRE). Both involve the thymus, and in both we find early, persistent, highly prevalent and high-titre neutralizing autoantibodies against type-I interferons, regardless of the exact AIRE genotype or the characteristically variable clinical phenotype in APS 1. Thus these key innate↔adaptive immune intermediaries are now implicated in APS 1 and paraneoplastic myasthenia {{as well as in}} systemic lupus erythematosus and other sporadic autoimmune disorders. The currently accepted notion that <b>autoimmunization</b> proceeds automatically (by ‘default’) does not explain how, when or where autoimmune responses are initiated against which targets in APS 1, or whether exogenous or internal danger signals are involved, or predict whether the primary auto-immunogenic targets are AIRE-dependent. As the parallels between these syndromes must hold novel clues to these puzzles, they demand explanations. To unify these and other findings, we propose that <b>autoimmunization</b> occurs centrally in aberrant thymic environments rendered ‘dangerous’ by AIRE-deficiency (possibly by excess undegraded nucleic acids/dead cell debris). The ensuing autoreactivity focuses early on the locally abundant type I interferons and then on other peripheral tissue autoantigens that are still expressed despite the absence of AIRE. These ideas raise numerous questions that others may already have the materials to address...|$|E
40|$|<b>Autoimmunization</b> {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} a factor in the {{etiology}} of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS, however, almost never occurs subsequent to brain injury. Thus, it was hypothesized that human serum contains a component capable of neutralizing the effect of the encephalitogenic protein (EP) when released by injury. Small amounts of human or rabbit serum added to the EP-adjuvant inoculum prevented the disease in guinea-pigs. Neither albumin, IgG, β-lipoprotein, serum lipids, including phosphatidyl-serine, pre-albumin, nor circulating antibodies, are implicated in the preventive effect of human or rabbit serum.

40|$|Immunoreaction of desialylated {{and native}} {{thyroglobulin}} was compared in sera {{of patients with}} anti-thyroglobulin antibodies by radioimmunoassay with 125 I-labelled thyroglobulin. Two human thyroglobulins were iodinated both in vivo and by lactoperoxidase. After desialylation enhancement of immunoreaction was observed in several sera ranging from marginal to more than 100 %. The effect was not due to iodination since it was reproducible with desialylated thyroglobulin labelled in vivo. In one serum (B.

40|$|The {{development}} of hemolytic alloanti-bodies and erythrocyte autoantibodies complicates transfusion therapy in thalas-semia patients. The frequency, causes, {{and prevention of}} this phenomena among 64 transfused thalassemia patients (75 % Asian) were evaluated. The effect of red blood cell (RBC) phenotypic differences between donors (mostly white) and Asian recipients on the frequency of alloimmu-nization was determined. Additional trans-fusion and patient immune factors were examined. 14 (22 %) of 64 patients (75 % Asian) became alloimmunized. A mis-matched RBC phenotype between the white population, comprising the major-ity of the donor pool, {{and that of the}} Asian recipients, was found for K, c, S, and Fyb antigens, which accounts for 38 % of the alloantibodies among Asian patients. Pa-tients who had a splenectomy had a higher rate of alloimmunization than pa-tients who did not have a splenectomy (36 % vs 12. 8 %; P 5. 06). Erythrocyte auto-antibodies, as determined by a positive Coombs test, developed in 25 % or 16 of the 64 patients, thereby causing severe hemolytic anemia in 3 of 16 patients. Of these 16, 11 antibodies were typed immu-noglobulin G [IgG], and 5 were typed IgM. <b>Autoimmunization</b> was associated with alloimmunization and with the absence of spleen (44 % and 56 %, respectively). Transfused RBCs had abnormal deform-ability profiles, more prominent in the patients without a spleen, which possibly stimulated antibody production. Transfu-sion of phenotypically matched blood for the Rh and Kell (leukodepleted in 92 %) systems compared to blood phenotypi-cally matched for the standard ABO-D system (leukodepleted in 60 %) proved to be effective in preventing alloimmuniza-tion (2. 8 % vs 33 %; P 5. 0005).

40|$|Abstract. Introduction of bemithyl into {{combined}} therapy {{of patients}} suffering chronic hepatitis allows toachieve a noticeable hepatoprotective effect. Apparently it is realized due to direct hepatotropic influence {{as well as}} through immunomodulatory action of the preparation directed at cellular immunity. At the same time, immunotropic action of bemithyl can be characterized as immunomodulatory one, which is confirmed by stimulation of T–cell immunity with some suppression of B–section and humoral immunity. An important factor of the immunotropic action of the drug is the absence of <b>autoimmunization</b> phenomena.

40|$|Delayed {{hemolytic}} {{reaction is}} a well recognized hazard of blood transfusion and occurs mainly in recipients with alloantibodies, due to sensitization to red cell antigens by previous transfusion or pregnancy.

We report the observation of a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, who presented a transitory episode of delayed hemolysis after multiple transfusions. At first, anti-Kell alloantibodies were identified and, two weeks later, warm "broad-specific" autoantibodies were detected by direct and indirect antiglobulin tests. The anemia was associated with unstable angina. The patient received multiple transfusions and prednisone.

40|$|SummaryNeuromuscular {{junction}} (NMJ) formation requires agrin, {{a factor}} released from motoneurons, and MuSK, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is activated by agrin. However, how signal is transduced from agrin to MuSK remains unclear. We report that LRP 4, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) -related protein, is expressed specifically in myotubes and binds to neuronal agrin. Its expression enables agrin binding and MuSK signaling in cells that otherwise {{do not respond}} to agrin. Suppression of LRP 4 expression in muscle cells attenuates agrin binding, agrin-induced MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, and AChR clustering. LRP 4 also forms a complex with MuSK {{in a manner that is}} stimulated by agrin. Finally, we showed that LRP 4 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in agrin-stimulated muscle cells.

This thymopoiesis-and export of mature CD 4 (+) T cells-particularly associates with MG, though there are rare/puzzling exceptions in apparently pure epithelial WHO type A thymomas. Other features potentially leading to inefficient self-tolerance induction include defective epithelial expression of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene and/or of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules in thymomas, absence of myoid cells, failure to generate FOXP 3 (+) regulatory T cells, and genetic polymorphisms affecting T-cell signaling. However, the strong focus on MG/neuromuscular targets remains unexplained and suggests some biased autoantigen expression, T-cell selection, or <b>autoimmunization</b> within thymomas.

We therefore propose that the 60 - to 90 -kDa glycoprotein autoantigen is the beta subunit of the gastric H+/K(+) -ATPase and that the alpha and beta subunits of the proton pump are major targets for <b>autoimmunization</b> in autoimmune gastritis...|$|E
40|$|Autoantibodies {{reacting}} with chromatin and its components, histones and DNA, {{are characteristic}} of the human autoimmune disease SLE and drug-induced lupus, but the mechanisms of their induction remain unknown. Serial serum samples collected over short intervals from lupus-prone MRL/MP-lpr/lpr and BXSB mice were tested by ELISA on chromatin and its substructures to characterize the initial autoimmune response to these antigens. Direct binding studies demonstrated that the early autoantibodies recognized discontinuous epitopes on native chromatin and the (H 2 A-H 2 B) -DNA subnucleosome. As the immune response progressed, native DNA and other chromatin constituents generally became antigenic. Based on adsorption studies and IgG subclass restriction, antibodies to native DNA were more related to chromatin than to denatured DNA. The kinetics of autoantibody appearance and the Ig class distribution were similar to the kinetics and distribution seen in antibodies induced by immunization with an exogenous T-dependent antigen. These results are most consistent with the view that autoantibodies reacting with chromatin are generated by <b>autoimmunization</b> with chromatin, and antibodies to native DNA are {{a subset of the}} wide spectrum of antichromatin autoantibodies...|$|E
40|$|Identification of the immunogens {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} pathogenic autoantibodies is a major problem in the field of autoimmunity. In the principal diseases that are thought to involve <b>autoimmunization,</b> rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis are examples, the instigating stimulus is unknown. Another example of the gap in our knowledge of disease-causing immunogens can be found in SLE. The characteristic autoantibody of lupus binds to double-strand (ds) DNA yet this nucleic acid antigen is barely immunogenic, even in lupus-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mice (1). Certain bacterial DNAs can elicit anti-dsDNA antibodies in normal mice, but those antibodies and the spontaneously produced anti-DNA antibodies of SLE have different serological specificities (2). By contrast with the poor immunogenicity of mammalian dsDNA, other forms of DNA, such as Z-DNA (a double-strand molecule with a leftward spiraling helix instead of the right-handed helical structure of dsDNA), elicit brisk immune responses in MLR-lpr/lpr mice as well as in normal mice and rabbits (1, 3). The lack of immunogenicity of exogenous dsDNA does not disprove the participation of endogenous DNA in the origins o...|$|E
40|$|In {{both human}} and murine lupus erythematosus, {{high-frequency}} public idiotypic markers occur on anti-DNA antibodies (1 - 4), yet Igs that do not bind to DNA can also possess the same markers (5, 6). This phenomenon, the sharing of idiotypic specificities by antibodies with different antigen binding properties, was originally described by Oudin and Cazenave (7) and is well established for antibodies to exogenous antigens (8, 9). It is probably due either to a V gene rearrangement in which a gene segment related to a particular idiotype is used for coding different Igs (10), or to a V gene mutation that affects the antigenbinding property of an antibody but not its idiotype (11). Antibodies with such recurrent idiotypes, termed parallel sets (12), are thought to underlie functional connections between B cell (or T cell) clones that respond to different antigenic determinants (13 - 15). Parallel sets of antibodies could be important in <b>autoimmunization.</b> When examined in vitro, lymphocytes from patients with active lupus erythematosus produce Igs bearing the public idiotypic marker Id- 16 / 6, a large fraction o...|$|E
40|$|The type of {{allogeneic}} {{disease that}} occurs after {{the administration of}} foreign lymphoid cells to either neonates or X-irradiated recipients is usually acute and rapidly fatal. In both laboratory animals and humans, its characteristic manifestations are wasting (runting), dermatitis, diarrhea, and atrophy of lymphoid tissue (1 - 3). Another, more chronic form of the disease can develop when mature hosts are given relatively low doses of aUogeneic lymphoid cells (4). These experimental conditions, if applied to {{a system in which}} inbred animals donate lymphoid cells to their FI hybrids, can result in prolonged confrontations between intolerant (donor) immunocompetent cells and indigenous (host) antigens. The ensuing chronic allogeneie disease represents a model of certain types of <b>autoimmunization</b> (5). In the present experiments, glomerulonephrifis was induced by transplanting sublethal doses of normal BALB/c spleen cells to mature (BALB/c X A/Jax) Fx mice. The renal lesion, which was often accompanied by a severe nephrotic syndrome, was membranous glomerulonephritis. As judged by light, immunofluorescent, and electron microscopy, its morphology was typical of an immun...|$|E
30|$|SLE {{is another}} {{autoimmune}} disease characterized by {{activation of the}} type I interferon system [47]. Multiple {{studies have demonstrated that}} SLE subjects harboring high levels of anti-interferon-α autoantibodies, but not anti-interferon-ω autoantibodies, were associated with more clinically quiescent disease activity [26 – 29]. In our cohort, two SS cases exhibited autoantibodies against interferon-α, yet only one patient had relatively high levels of anti-interferon-α autoantibodies. Consistent with this observation, in vitro testing revealed that this SS subject (# 56) had partially neutralizing serum autoantibodies to interferon-α. Although only serum was tested for anticytokine neutralizing activity, it is possible that high levels of interferon-α autoantibodies are present in the salivary gland. This subject fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of SS with SSA/SSB seropositivity and a low but positive focus score (i.e. 2 of 12), the subject displayed a normal unstimulated salivary flow rate and was negative for ocular problems as determined by the Schirmer’s test. Although two different serum samples taken 1  year apart from this SS subject were similarly positive for interferon-α autoantibodies, the exact onset of the anti-cytokine autoantibodies in this subject and other cases is not known. Potentially confounding this analysis is the recognition that SSA autoantibodies and other autoantibodies are often present over 18  years before clinical diagnosis of SS [48], and it is unclear when the anticytokine autoantibodies might arise. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that after the initial onset of SS in this patient that induction of anti-interferon-α autoantibodies may have later dampened interferon signaling resulting in improved clinical features. As previously proposed, the production of certain cytokine autoantibodies may be caused by by-stander <b>autoimmunization</b> and/or be part of a natural feedback loop to decrease cytokine signaling in chronic inflammation [49, 50]. Recently, anti-interferon-α therapy has shown promising clinical results by reducing SLE disease activity [51, 52]. By extension, our unique findings that the one SS patient harboring naturally, partially neutralizing anti-interferon-α activity exhibited milder sicca symptoms is potentially consistent with the idea that blocking the interferon-α pathway might show efficacy for the treatment of SS. Future studies exploring whether anticytokine autoantibodies exist in saliva derived from the salivary gland and the cell/tissue origin of the interferons involved in <b>autoimmunization</b> may provide additional insights into the functional significance of these autoantibodies in SS.|$|E
