It has other names, some of which more appropriately refer to subspecies, including blue pilchard, <b>Australian</b> <b>pilchard</b> (S. s. neopilchardus), blue-bait, Californian pilchard (S. s. caeruleus), Chilean sardine (S. s. sagax), Japanese pilchard (S. s. melanostictus), Pacific sardine, and Southern African pilchard (S. s. ocellatus).|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of {{the knowledge of the}} behaviour of fish in their natural environment which enables their easier location, the devising of better gear and techniques of capture has long been realized by fishery workers. Studies of that nature already conducted have proved to be of considerable interest and value in the case of various fishes such as the <b>Australian</b> <b>pilchard</b> Sardinops neopilchardus (Blackburn, 1941; Blackburn and Tubb, 1950), the California sardine, Sardinops ccerulea (Anon, 1952), the Japanese sardine, Sardinops melanosticta (Nomura, 1958), the " lemuru", Sardinella allecia (Soerjodinoto, 1958), the Atlantic salmon (Keenleyside, 1958), the tunas, Katsuwonus pelamis (Strasburg and Yuen, 1958), Neothunnus macropterus and Euthynnus yaito (Tester ef al., 1955), the lajang, Decapterus spp. (Soemarto, 1958), the cichlid, Tilapia esculenta, the cat fish, Clarias (Beauchamp, 1958),and the minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus (Jones, 1958). Kesteven (1960) in an exhaustive review has lucidly dealt with almost all aspects of behaviour of fishes. No attempts have hitherto been made towards studies on the shoaling behaviour of fishes of Indian waters. In view of the {{importance of}} the fishery of oil-sardine Sardinella longiceps on the south-west coast of India, it was thought desirable to investigate the shoaling behaviour of this species...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{abundance}} of eggs and larvae of the <b>Australian</b> <b>pilchard,</b> Sardinops sagax neopilchardus, collected by plankton tows {{in the region}} off Albany, Western Australia, was investigated. In 1989, surface tows were undertaken at five localities extending from the marine embayment of Princess Royal Harbour to the continental shelf just outside King George Sound. In 1990, oblique tows were undertaken at six localities extending from just inside King George Sound to beyond {{the edge of the}} continental shelf. Eggs and larvae of pilchards were found in many months, but peaks in egg numbers were found in July and December of both 1989 and 1990. There was, however, only one peak in larva abundance, during December. Most eggs and larvae were found in the region 2 - 8 km offshore from the entrance to King George Sound. Few were found either well inside King George Sound and Princess Royal Harbour or in outer-shelf localities. Spawning in the Albany region therefore occurred inshore of the main influence of the eastward-flowing tropical waters of the Leeuwin Current. The implications of this spawning activity in relation to the fishery for this species and the potential for stock separation along this coast are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Propagating {{epizootics}} due to Pilchard herpesvirus (PHV) {{occurred in}} the <b>Australian</b> population of <b>pilchard,</b> Sardinops sagax neopilchardus (Steindachner) (Clupeidae), in 1995 and 1998 - 99, with up to 60 % losses. No mortality events have been evident in the ensuing 7 years, one reason for which could be that PHV is now endemic. During 2004, a survey was conducted to establish if PHV was present in pilchards in Australia. The pilchard is a highly active, pelagic schooling fish which is found in subpopulations, creating difficulties {{for the conduct of}} surveys. It occurs in Australian coastal waters and embayments below about 25 °S latitude, feeds on plankton and is predated by birds, mammals and larger fish. It reaches sexual maturity at 2 years of age, spawns at sea, enters embayments when about 5 months old and returns to sea when about 1 year old. It may live for 6 - 9 years, reaching a maximum length of 200 mm. It forms schools and may travel up to 30 km per day. Pilchards aggregate in mobile shoals of fish containing large highly mobile schools, which interact randomly and exchange individuals. Four subpopulations were defined {{for the purposes of this}} survey based on differences in biological characteristics: south-eastern Queensland/northern New South Wales (NSW), Victoria/South Australia (SA), south coast Western Australia (SWA) and west coast Western Australia (WWA). Specimens were obtained from the catch of commercial fishermen using random sampling where possible. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of PHV was performed after appraising the suitability of all available tests according to their impact on sample size requirements, total survey costs and logistical constraints. In the analysis, estimates of true prevalence (TP) of infection and 95 % confidence limits were adjusted from the apparent prevalence estimates provided by PCR results. Percentage TP of PHV and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals for the four subpopulations: NSW, SA, SWA and WWA were thus estimated as 0 (0 - 1. 5), 31 (22 - 43), 42 (31 - 55) and 29 (20 - 41), respectively. PHV is now endemic in <b>Australian</b> populations of <b>pilchard.</b> Implications of the findings for fisheries management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In 1995 {{and again}} in 1998, {{millions}} of pilchards (Sardinops sagax neopilchardus) were found dead or dying {{off the coast of}} Australia and also in New Zealand. The epizootics moved progressively, at a rapid speed against the prevailing currents. A previously unrecognised herpesvirus, Pilchard herpesvirus (PHV), was identified as the causative agent. Until recently, rapid and sensitive methods to detect PHV were not available and based on a previously identified and conserved 373 bp region of the genome, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridisation and real-time PCR methods were developed for the specific detection of PHV in formaldehyde-fixed and frozen tissues of pilchards. Real-time PCR was shown to have greater sensitivity than a conventional PCR and in situ hybridisation for the detection of PHV infection. The PCR assay and sequence analysis of the amplification products was used to compare the 373 bp region of the genome from strains obtained during the 1995 and 1998 epidemics. Significant differences between the strains were not detected. Additional sequence data was obtained adjacent to the 373 bp of known PHV sequence, which did not match any sequence in any of the genetic databases, and this will be invaluable for further study of the pilchard herpesvirus and the development of improved detection methods. The molecular-based methods of virus detection developed were applied to a re- examination of virus in paraffin-embedded tissues taken from fish during an attempt to transmit the virus to wild caught pilchards in 1999. The results obtained confirmed previously equivocal results that transmission of PHV to wild caught pilchards was achieved, although this experiment failed to demonstrate thattransmission of the virus resulted in severe lesions typical of those seen in the epizootics. Using formaldehyde-fixed samples from fish collected during the 1998 PHV epizootic, virus was detected in fish collected 4 days prior to the occurrence of the epizootic even though the fish then appeared clinically normal, during the epizootic, and 8 days after mortalities had ceased. An investigation of wild pilchards collected from 4 <b>Australian</b> <b>pilchard</b> sub-populations using real-time PCR demonstrated that PHV was present in the gills of 13. 75...|$|E
40|$|The short-tailed shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris {{is one of}} the world’s most {{abundant}} seabirds, with a population of around 23 million breeding birds. Despite this abundance we have a limited understanding of their role in the marine ecosystem. This is largely due to the many uncertainties surrounding the trophic interactions, resource requirements and foraging ecology of this wide ranging pelagic seabird. I studied the movement of adults during the short trip (ST) and long trip (LT) component of their dual foraging strategy to determine how they use their marine habitat. ST were primarily confined to neritic (continental shelf) waters 30 to 100 km from their colony, and maximum depth gauges revealed that birds reached a depth of 21 ± 13 m (SD). Analysis of the time spent in area by 39 individuals performing ST revealed that 18 birds employed area restricted searches within circles of a diameter of 14 ± 3 km (SE). Prey returns from area restricted search flights were predominated by bony fish, whereas prey diversity increased for non-area restricted search flights, with more krill and cephalopods. Thus, direct flights were performed when birds were exploiting prey patches dominated by fish, in contrast to the more varied diet returned when birds covered greater distances. LT flights were highly variable ranging from 11 - 32 days duration, and reaching 912 – 6, 952 km from the colony. Foraging trips of extended duration enabled birds to exploit temperate waters further away from the colony, as well as sub Antarctic and Antarctic waters. A wider range of search patterns were performed on LT, as birds either: (1) showed no signs of area restricted search; (2) concentrated area restricted search directly at small scales of within circles of 33 ± 11 km (SE) diameter; or, (3) adopted a hierarchical mode of foraging, where large scales of area restricted search are first performed, followed by nested searches at smaller scales. This variation in foraging behaviour indicates that a range of foraging tactics are employed by the short-tailed shearwater. LT to sub Antarctic and Antarctic waters commonly involved a period of commuting travel to regions with elevated chlorophyll a associated with ocean fronts, where search effort was increased. How adults allocated time and energy during the entire chick-rearing period was investigated via the simultaneous assessment of adult attendance, adult mass change, the rate of energy delivery to chicks, and chick survival. Adults who reared chicks to good condition spent 80 % of the 90 day chick rearing period performing five - six LT of 13 ± 3 days (SE) duration. The remaining 20 % of time involved 14 ± 3 ST (SE) of one to three days duration. Comparison with chicks of moderate and poor condition revealed that, despite extensive variation in the day to day rate of provisioning, a small change in the proportion of time spent performing ST and LT over the entire chick rearing period can spell the difference between breeding success and failure. By allocating all of the food collected on ST to chicks birds depleted stored energy reserves, which were replenished on LT. Of the total energy required by chicks from hatching to adult abandonment 75 % was delivered from LT in the form of energy rich stomach oil, with the remainder being supplied in ST meals of raw prey. The advantages of the dual foraging strategy to both adult and chick was demonstrated by considering the daily food requirements of chicks and the likely energy flow from alternate feeding regimes. Under regimes of all ST or all LT, energy flow to chicks could not meet chick energy requirements. This highlights that LT of more than seven days duration are required to accumulate stomach oil. Oil boosts the energy value of meals beyond that achievable in continuous ST foraging. Under continuous ST the estimated rate of food consumption achieved by adults would not sustain both adult and chick requirements. Therefore the dual strategy enables short-tailed shearwaters to overcome many of the constraints of central-place foraging. Comparisons between years and short-tailed shearwater colonies revealed extensive variation in the dietary composition of meals returned to chicks, as well as the rate of food delivery. A year of increased ST foraging resulted in an increase in feeding frequency, but not provisioning rate, as smaller meals were returned. In this same year ST meals also contained a high % mass of low energy neritic prey (Australian krill Nyctiphanes australis and cephalopods). These factors reduced the rate of energy flow to chicks compared to other years where fewer ST meals of increased mass contained mostly higher energy fish (jack mackerel Trachurus declivis and anchovy Engraulis australis). While the rate of chick growth at different ages varied between years, a similar peak mass was gained in all three years. These findings demonstrate considerable flexibility in the dual foraging strategy of the short-tailed shearwater, providing evidence that adults are able to maintain a suitable rate of energy flow to chicks in years of varied neritic foraging conditions. This is achieved by modifying the time spent performing ST, and the volume of oil returned from LT, likely in response to changing prey availability. A review of the use of seabirds in fisheries management identified the most commonly used indicators (species and parameters) in environmental, ecological and fisheries management. For the short-tailed shearwater the most useful parameters for identifying the size of pelagic fish stocks in neritic waters include the size and dietary composition of meals returned on ST. The varied importance of pilchard Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis australis in the diet between years suggest that their occurrence in the diet meals present a potential indicator of the availability of pre-recruits into the South <b>Australian</b> <b>pilchard</b> fishery. The occurrence of Australian Krill in ST meals may also provide a means of investigating the ecological role of upwelling events in neritic waters. The usefulness of provisioning parameters as indicators of prey availability are likely to be limited in this species, due to the extent of flexibility and plasticity in the short-tailed shearwaters provisioning strategy. Documenting the extent of flexibility in the foraging strategy, and quantifying the value of the ST and LT component of the dual foraging strategy has provided an insight into the habitat utilisation and prey requirements of this species. This demonstrates that despite the various constraints incurred in sourcing and transporting prey over long distances, dual foraging presents the most optimal foraging strategy for the delivery of energy to adult and chick. The sheer abundance of this species is evidence that the separation of their foraging and breeding grounds over 3000 km is a beneficial strategy. An opportunistic diet, and flexibility in foraging suggests that the short-tailed shearwater is more resilient to changes in prey availability than other seabirds in their community. However, we have highlighted that breeding success is sensitive to small changes in the time spent foraging in near and distant waters. Sourcing prey over large spatial scales also exposes birds to feeding conditions over a broader area, increasing their exposure to the potential effects of current and future climate change. For these reasons the short-tailed shearwater presents a valuable indicator species for short and long-term monitoring programs of both neritic and oceanic ecosystems. Thesis (Ph. D.)
