50|$|Metallised {{films have}} a {{reflective}} silvery surface similar to <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> and are highly flammable. The coating also reduces the permeability {{of the film}} to light, water and oxygen. The properties of the film remain, such as higher toughness, {{the ability to be}} heat sealed, and a lower density at a lower cost than an <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil.</b> This gives metallised films some advantages over <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> and <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> laminates. It was thought that metallised films would become a replacement for <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> laminates, but current films still cannot match the barrier properties of foil. Some very high barrier metallised films are available using EVOH, but are not yet cost effective against foil laminates.|$|R
5000|$|Annual {{production}} of <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> was approximately [...] in Europe and [...] in the U.S. in 2003. Approximately 75% of <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> {{is used for}} packaging of foods, cosmetics, and chemical products, and 25% used for industrial applications (e.g. thermal insulation, cables and electronics). It can be recycled. In North America, <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> is known as aluminum foil. It was popularised by Reynolds Metals, the leading manufacturer in North America. In the United Kingdom and United States it is, informally, widely called tin foil, for historical reasons (similar to how aluminium cans are often still called [...] "tin cans"). Metallised films are sometimes mistaken for <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil,</b> but are actually polymer films coated with {{a thin layer of}} aluminium. In Australia, <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> is widely called alfoil.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> {{is widely}} used for {{radiation}} shield (barrier and reflectivity), heat exchangers (heat conduction) and cable liners (barrier and electrical conductivity). <b>Aluminium</b> <b>foil's</b> heat conductive qualities make it a common accessory in hookah smoking: a sheet of perforated <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> is frequently placed between the coal and the tobacco, allowing the tobacco to be heated without coming into {{direct contact with the}} burning coal.|$|R
40|$|To inhibit {{dendrite}} formation for aluminium electrodeposition in room-temperature {{ionic liquid}} electrolyte, a promising method for electrodeposition of non-dendritic <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> on carbon cathodes is investigated. The effect of current density, deposition time, temperature, and cathode materials on the deposit morphology of <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> in AlCl 3 - 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium chloride (AlCl 3 -[Bmim] Cl) ionic liquid electrolyte was also studied. The prepared <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> are compact, bright {{and easy to}} peel off from the carbon electrodes after electrodeposition. The experimental {{results show that the}} high current density and low electrowinning temperature is responsible for the compactness of <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils.</b> The intensity of the (200) plane enhances with the increase of current density. Cathodic current efficiencies of the electrodeposition process are from 79 % to 87 %. The mechanisms of electrodeposition of non-dendritic <b>aluminium</b> <b>foils</b> in ionic liquids are proposed...|$|R

50|$|The first <b>{{aluminium}}</b> <b>foil</b> rolling plant, “Dr. Lauber, Neher & Cie., Emmishofen.” {{was opened}} in 1910 Kreuzlingen, Switzerland.

Neher's sons together with Lauber invented the endless rolling process and the use of <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> as a protective barrier, and tin foil began to be superseded by <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil.</b>|$|R
30|$|Using <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> as {{a witness}} coupon material, by exposing it to CC 2 for {{different}} durations, the amino acid content in CC 2 was quantitatively evaluated. To compare our results {{with those of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Johnson Space Center (NASA/JSC) OSIRIS-REx team, we used the same workflow system, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>foil,</b> with a thickness of 0.05  mm, was cut to 3 [*]×[*] 3  cm pieces and baked at 450  °C for 6  h. The baked <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> was placed in cleaned Pyrex Petri dishes (φ 28  mm) and introduced into CC 2 (Fig.  1 b). The cleaning procedure of the Petri dishes was based on the procedure described by Ishibashi et al. (2012). They were then baked {{in the same way as}} the <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil.</b> The baking of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> and cleaning of the Petri dishes were done in the manufacturing and cleaning room at the ESCuC. After enclosing the pieces of <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> in Petri dishes, they were brought to CC 2 in the planetary sample handling room at the ESCuC. After being evacuated and purged with nitrogen in the airlock of CC 2, the Petri dishes filled with <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> were introduced into CC 2. After their introduction into CC 2, the lids of the Petri dishes were opened, and the <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> was exposed to the environment in CC 2. Five witness coupons were prepared and exposed for 1  day, 2  days, 8  days and 31  days, with the last used as a reference without exposure as a blank witness coupon. Each of the coupons was folded using tweezers inside CC 2 and taken out of the chamber after closing the lids of the Petri dishes. The blank witness coupon was directly stored in the Petri dish after being baked together with the other witness coupons. The Petri dishes were wrapped in triplicate with baked <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> and transported to the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) for analysis.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the cooling efficiencies and nutritional variations of two different types of evaporative cooling structures made of different materials. The cooling chamber of one was made with <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> container and the second one made of aluminium container. These two containers were separately inserted inside a bigger clay pot inter spaced with clay soil of 5 cm. Freshly harvested oranges were used for the experiment and the temperature, relative humidity, vitamin C content and decay were monitored for a period of two weeks. The shelf life and qualities of the stored oranges in the <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> container were much longer and higher than the oranges inside the aluminium container. An average temperature of 25. 06 o C, 27. 00 o C and 32. 04 o C were recorded for the <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> container, <b>aluminium</b> container and the ambient respectively. Also an average relative humidity of 85. 13 %, 85. 34 % and 67. 68 % were recorded for the <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> container, <b>aluminium</b> container and the ambient respectively. The amount of vitamin C present in the fruit was determined at interval of 3 days from which an average content of 0. 8146 g/litre and 0. 8292 g/litre was obtained for the <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> container and <b>aluminium</b> container respectively. The <b>aluminium</b> <b>foil</b> container was able to minimise decay as well due to the higher relative humidity and low temperature in the structure...|$|R
