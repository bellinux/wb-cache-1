2500|$|The {{building}} sits at {{the southeast}} corner of Main and Second Streets. Originally, the building included 6 classrooms, 4 offices (principal's, secretary's, attendance, and main), and 2 restrooms. The central façade is flanked by two small wings, which protrude slightly towards Main Street, forming a small [...] "C" [...] shape. The foundation and walls are brick, which has since been stuccoed over. The windows were double-hung, three-over-three wood construction, in vertical proportion in groups of two to four with common sills. These have been replaced by <b>aluminum</b> <b>windows,</b> one-over-one single hung inserted into the original sash frames. Doors were originally [...] "wooden, single- light doors with multi-light transoms overhead", with most now replaced by modern units. Broad stairs led to the main entries in the front, back, and both sides, although the stairs on the south side were destroyed with the construction of the cafeteria addition. There are also several smaller sets of steps leading to the outside from minor entrances. The entrances are framed by pedimented parapets, which sit on pilasters. The roof has a low pitch with wide overhangs, and is covered with asbestos tiles in a diamond pattern.|$|E

Third floor windows are ornamented by limestone keystones.|$|E
50|$|The {{groundbreaking}} {{took place}} in the summer of 1952. German company Dyckerhoff, Widmann & Julius Berger was signed for the construction. The labor at the construction site was carried out by up to around 500 Turkish workers and engineers. Critical construction materials were imported. White Portland cement, glass and structural steel came from Germany, marble and ceramic fittings from Italy, and <b>aluminum</b> <b>window</b> castings, air-conditioning units and elevators from the United States.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most megabats {{endemic to}} the Comoros Islands, R. obliviosus thrives in captivity {{and has been}} a staple in the North American and Australian pet trades since the late 1990s. Because its care {{requirements}} are relatively minimal, their care is simple and low-cost. The average suburban household (fitted with <b>aluminum</b> <b>window</b> screens) serves as an excellent environment for these large bats, so long as ceiling fans and open fireplaces are responsibly maintained.|$|R
50|$|While Monsanto {{became the}} most {{successful}} agrochemical corporation in the world, Swann began to slide into poverty. He was forced to sell his castle in 1945 when he filed for bankruptcy. He nearly made a comeback by selling a new design for a furnace to process iron ore to the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, but the dictator reneged after paying only a modest down payment. Theodore Swann died selling <b>aluminum</b> <b>window</b> frames on February 5, 1955.|$|R

50|$|In 1996, the {{landlord}} received {{permission from the}} New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to install new windows after an inspection found that 20 percent of them were beyond repair. The plan called for replacing the building's 400 original mahogany windows with aluminum ones. An employee of {{the landlord}} said the repairs were necessary, {{and said that the}} company planned to install the <b>aluminum</b> <b>windows</b> and seek rent increases.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a concrete frame and the lateral force-resisting system consists of concrete shearwalls and single-level concrete moment frames. It was constructed on spread footings and caissons. Anodized <b>aluminum</b> <b>windows,</b> which {{are separated by}} slanting concrete walls with triangular forms, are recessed between the horizontal levels. Evenly spaced windows provide a consistent rhythm to the symmetrical building, which has a sprawling horizontal emphasis. The top tier of the {{building has}} a large flat roof with attached protruding vertical elements, providing additional texture to the structure.|$|E
50|$|The seven-story {{building}} sits on {{a simple}} base of Mount Airy granite. The walls above are clad in large, smooth blocks of Indiana limestone laid in a regular pattern. Bays on the midsection of each elevation are divided by pilasters (attached columns) or colonnades that form a loggia (open-air, arcaded space). The seventh story is slightly recessed. The portico is supported by Ionic columns. <b>Aluminum</b> <b>window</b> and door grilles accent the exterior. The low hipped roof is covered with red terra-cotta tiles.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{architectural}} coatings or architectural paints are {{paints and}} other coatings used to coat buildings and homes. [...] Strictly speaking, clear varnishes and lacquers are not paints. [...] Such products are usually designated for specific purposes such as roof coatings, wall paints, or deck finishes. [...] The coatings are typically applied with brushes, rollers or sprayers. [...] The coatings in question {{are intended for}} on-site application and do not include [...] "factory-applied coatings for building products such as vinyl siding or <b>aluminum</b> <b>window</b> frames that may ultimately be used for architectural end-uses".|$|R
50|$|The lobbies of the {{apartment}} structures at 200 West 15th Street and 200 West 16th Street possess finevaulted ceilings and tile decoration, which feature polychrome. The one located at 161 West 16th Street received an art deco makeover in 1989. By 2004 steel casement windows, with common one-over-one <b>aluminum</b> <b>windows,</b> had replaced the more vigorous impression which Farrar & Watmough sought to impart, {{in three of the}} four structures. However the edifice at 201 West 16th Street received replicas of the original steel casement windows in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Wood {{windows were}} used {{from the early}} 1900s to the present but became less of a {{mainstay}} of the industry in the 1960s. They are prevalent in the Northern United States. Steel and aluminum casements and Steel Vertical Operators were used from the 1950s through the 1960s. <b>Aluminum</b> <b>windows</b> {{were used in the}} 1960s through the present. Vinyl windows were established in the 1970s through the present. The last decade has also seen the admission of composite materials such as fiberglass and vinyl-wood-polymer type products.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is designed in a modernized Federal architecture style and {{is divided into}} two parts - an office tower and a three-story special function facility. The office {{building is}} a 30-story high rise structure with two mechanical penthouse levels above grade and two parking levels below grade. The high-rise structure is enclosed with Deer Isle granite, pre-fabricated, panelized, cladding system with punched <b>aluminum</b> <b>windows.</b> Crowning the entire building is an open barrel vaulted cage, placed atop a granite-sheathed, box-shaped penthouse housing the mechanical systems for the building.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The energy {{consumption}} of window accounts {{for nearly half}} of buildings. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the environmental impact of plastic <b>windows</b> and <b>aluminum</b> alloy <b>windows</b> production, including resource and {{energy consumption}}, waste emission. The result shows that energy consumption of plastic window production is only 0. 24 times of <b>aluminum</b> alloy <b>window</b> production, and the overall environmental impact of the former is 30 % of the later. This study is a quantitative description of energy consumption and environmental impact of two windows production pattern, which intends to fill the blank in LCA field of windows in China...|$|R

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} {{array of}} detectors {{to be used}} in the Burst and Transient Experiment (BATSE) for locating gamma ray burst sources is examined with respect to its ability to locate those sources by means of the relative response of its eight detectors. It was shown that the energy-dependent attenuation effects of the <b>aluminum</b> <b>window</b> covering each detector has a significant effect on source location determinations. Location formulas were derived as a function of detector counts and gamma ray energies in the range 50 to 150 keV. Deviation formulas were derived and serve to indicate the location error that would be cuased by ignoring the influence of the passive absorber...|$|R
