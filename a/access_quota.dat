40|$|The {{difficulty}} of reliably and accurately incorporating tariffrate quotas (TRQs) into trade models {{has received a}} lot of attention in recent years. As a result of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, TRQs replaced an assortment of tariff and nontariff instruments in an effort to standardise trade barriers, and facilitate their future liberalisation. Understanding the nuances of TRQs is now particularly crucial for New Zealand because of the preferential access arrangements that New Zealand has for a number of products in highly protected markets such as the European Union, Japan, and the United States. It has been argued that TRQs are complex instruments and are difficult to model because for any trade flow between two countries, one of three regimes may be applicable : 1. The import quota may not be binding and the within-quota tariff applies; 2. The quota may be binding, the within-quota tariff applies, and a quota rent is created; or 3. Trade occurs over and above the quota, in which case an over-quota tariff applies (although, even in this regime, someone is still able to collect the quota rent on within-quota trade). But even this characterisation, which many claim is too complex to model, is a major simplification of reality. Bilateral preferences are ubiquitous, and such preferences are usually included in the determination of multilateral market <b>access</b> <b>quotas.</b> It is usual, therefore, that the TRQ instrument has several tiers to the quota schedule, plus a number of within and over-quota tariff rates applicable on either a bilateral or a multilateral basis. Further trade liberalisation creates something of a dilemma for New Zealand. Any decrease in over-quota tariffs and/or increase in quota levels potentially reduces the value of quota rents, many of which accrue to New Zealand due to the bilateral preferences. It is important, therefore, that New Zealand trade negotiators understand how much additional trade is required to offset the loss of New Zealands quota rents. Modelling trade in the presence of TRQs {{is the only way to}} ascertain this knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to show that complex TRQs can be modelled very easily and precisely. The only catch is that the model must be formulated as a complementarity problem rather than the more conventional linear or nonlinear optimisation problem. The concept will be demonstrated using a simple 3 -region, single commodity spatial price equilibrium model of trade.

The first chapter introduces the subject and discusses why the market for fish is interesting and in particular why analyses of first-hand market prices can give insights into the effects of new regulations or natural variations changing the conditions for fisheries.

The results show that larger and better quality cod have higher kilo prices than smaller and average quality cod and that price differences have increased over time. It is also shown that the quantity landed of cod with different attributes affect the the price premiums of attributes. The results could be used when evaluating changes in the composition of landed cod. The third chapter is about the effects on bargaining power of fishers when quartely quotas were replaced by yearly quotas in the Swedish Baltic cod fishery in 2011.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} an overview of use rights, that sanction fishers, fisher groups and fishing communities to access and use fishery resources. The paper first reviews the various forms of use rights, ranging from access rights (territorial use rights and limited entry) to quantitative input (effort) and output (harvest) rights. It then explores the factors impacting on the determination of a desirable portfolio of use rights within specific circumstances. Given that there is no universally optimal arrangement, the choice will depend on such factors as (a) society’s objectives for the fishery, (b) the structure, history and traditions of the fishery, and (c) the relevant ecological, social, cultural and economic environment. Finally, the paper explores two major policy issues concerning use rights, concerning the choice between holding rights at the individual versus collective/group levels, and the choice among institutional arrangements for organizing use rights, specifically market-based versus strategic planning mechanisms.

The authors argue that, in the presence of market power on the buyers'side in the product markets combined with concentration in the license markets, the importing countries might retain part of this rent. Although the impact of imperfect competition on rent appropriation has been analyzed in literature, rent sharing has so far been ignored in both analytical and empirical work.

40|$|Abstract only. Concerns about declining {{stock and}} {{profitability}} in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry {{led to the}} introduction of individual transferable quota (ITQ) management in 1998. In this study, fisher groups were categorised by effort and quota ownership traits to examine response to revised management, and how profit drivers moderated this change. The number of investors who are not active fishers has steadily grown with a commensurate expansion of the lease quota market. The number of lease dependent fishers has remained steady through time while quota owner fishers have declined. In contrast to many other ITQ fisheries, the investor group has not consolidated into a small number of entities and there is little processor involvement. This was a result of fisheries rules explicitly designed to retain benefits of diverse ownership though a cap on the maximum allowed number of quota units per legal entity. Three categories of active fishers participate in the lease trade. Quota-transferring fishers lease quota both in and out, usually to secure <b>access</b> to <b>quota</b> {{at the start of the}} season with surplus quota being leased off later. Large-scale, lease quota dependent fishers have increased through time and are characterised by high fishing effort and high annual turnover but low profit per unit of fish. Small-scale lease quota dependent fishers utilise capital less fully and have less capacity to survive in the long run. These small scale lease fishers face barriers to entry into the large scale category through high upfront capital investment costs, which could hamper industry renewal. Potential issues for management that arise from lease-reliant fishers are (i) that their higher financial stress increases compliance risk and (ii) their lack of investment in quota assets reduces incentive for stewardship of the resource...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} effects of introducing quotas to an open <b>access</b> fishery. When <b>quotas</b> are introduced, effort should decrease. This leads to higher prices and lower costs. Thus, overall profits should increase. An empirical analysis of profits in the Norwegian cod fisheries is conducted. Quotas were introduced in this fishery in 1990, and the dataset used covers 1985 - 2005. The research question is: Did profits rise in Norwegian fisheries for cod, after quotas were introduced? Because the quotas limit {{the activity of the}} fishers, the stock is affected. In order to see whether quotas increased profits, it is necessary to do an analysis with levels of stock as it would have developed without the quotas. Therefore a simulation of the stock is done. This is used to simulate landings and profits. The empirical results suggest that there have been a considerable increase in profits for the fishers after 1990. Few variables on effort and opportunities explain profits. Binary variables for years with and without quotas, however, explain a lot of the change in profits. The effects of other changes to policy and market conditions are also controlled for. These indicate that the quotas increased profits in two rounds. First right after the introduction, and then again some years later, as fishers started to trade quotas...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. This paper {{focuses on}} Trade-Related Technical Assistance (TRTA) {{provided}} by the European Union to the Africa Caribbean Pacific (ACP) countries and other Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The context is {{the centrality of the}} development dimension in the current Doha Development Round and negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with regional groupings of ACP countries. These countries are challenged to elaborate their trade-related development agendas in the negotiations and the EU has to ensure that its support generates quantitative and qualitative results. Following an approach rooted in institutional theory, donor-driven TRTA is itself considered as {{an important part of the}} institutional framework with its own rules and constraints. The analysis of actual EU TRTA, building on the emergent literature, also takes into consideration country case studies and experience ‘in progress’ from a cluster of ‘all ACP’ TRTA programmes. From this some conclusions are drawn. The approach is less concerned with the debates around the key issues in the current Doha Development Round (DDR) and EPAs – market <b>access,</b> tariff and <b>quota</b> liberalization, adjustment and compensation – than how TRTA can best strengthen developing countries’ institutional capacity in trade so that they meet the challenges posed by the rule-based multilateral trading system and alleviate poverty. In the main, while there are emerging good practices and successes, it is concluded that enhanced institutional coherency will impact positively on the quality and results of TRTA...|$|R
40|$|The European common {{fisheries}} policy (CFP) advocates measures to sustain small-scale fisheries; hence, in the European Commission's {{proposal for a}} reformed CFP, these are exempted from a mandatory system with tradable fishing concessions. This opens up for management actions designed for small-scale fisheries, but also implies new management issues. This article provides insights into the topic based on a Swedish small-scale herring fishery in the western Baltic Sea that was exempted from an ITQ-system. The fishery has been profitable since the system was introduced, and the increasing effort of both incumbent fishermen and new entrants implies a situation where fishermen compete for a limited quota. The migratory pattern of the herring implies high densities in the southern parts of the fishing areas during spring and in the northern parts during autumn. This forms the basis for two different fisheries in the area, {{as well as for}} the current management proposal to divide the quota into a spring and an autumn part. This and other management proposals are discussed in the paper. The main conclusion from the case study is that, when exempting a fishery from tradable fishing concessions, it is important to build other institutions dealing with the fundamental problem of <b>access</b> to the <b>quota.</b> Failure to do so might result in an over-capacity issue and threaten the long-run development of an otherwise successful small-scale fishery.

40|$|Research PaperCommunity quota schemes (CQS) {{have been}} {{introduced}} in some UK fishery dependent areas {{in an attempt to}} address the detrimental effects of the current market based approach to quota management. The most established and largest scheme operates in the Shetland Isles, where there was concern quota holdings could be traded out-with the community. This study originated from a Scottish Executive research programme tasked with analysing the effectiveness of community quota schemes in the UK. This paper outlines the current approach to quota management in the UK and examines the compatibility of community quota schemes with the current Fixed Quota Allocation approach using Shetland as a case study. Research methods involved desk-based background research and face-to-face interviews with industry stakeholders in Shetland. Shetland CQS set out to preserve and improve fishing opportunities for the island community and allow young fishermen to affordably gain access to the local industry. Significant quota holdings were purchased by Shetland Islands council from other UK areas and Shetland fishermen were given preferential <b>access</b> to this <b>quota.</b> After an investigation by the EC, the Shetland CQS was found to contravene EU State Aid law. Enforced changes to the scheme ensured the competitive advantage of Shetlands catching sector was removed. However, {{both before and after the}} EU ruling the scheme failed to encourage new vessel builds or increase employment. In addition, fishermen disliked the lack of transparency and financial costs attached to FQA method of allocation. The current FQA system fails in terms of: Clarity of ownership; confusion over property rights; provision of a liquid and transparent market in fishing opportunities; inhibits investment and long-term planning. The Shetland experience suggests UK Quota management is at a crossroads. Fisheries managers have the task of incorporating a formal ITQ system with a more community-orientated approach...|$|R
40|$|A Landing Obligation (LO), or a {{requirement}} to land all catches of certain fish species, was introduced {{as part of}} the EU’s new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 2014. This DiscardLess policy brief focuses on initial experiences with LO implementation in the Baltic and Pelagic fisheries. It summarises the discard plans in these fisheries, presents stakeholder experiences from interviews, meeting attendance and literature review and highlights emerging issues relevant to all fisheries where the LO is being implemented. Background and main elements of the landing obligation. In March 2007, the Commission published a communication recognising the serious problem of discarding in European fisheries. A public consultation was held and discarding was subsequently highlighted in the Commission’s Green Paper on CFP reform. While a discard ban received significant support, industry recommended instead that discard reduction should be planned, on a fisheries basis, through creating incentives to enhance selectivity. An incident involving a UK trawler in Norwegian waters in 2008 generated public pressure to end discarding, which increased from August 2010 in response to a UK celebrity chef’s public campaign known as “Hugh’s Fish Fight”. In 2011 the Commission included an obligation to land catches of regulated species in its CFP reform proposal. The adopted CFP included a LO, which applied for Baltic and pelagic fisheries from January 2015. The main elements of the LO are as follows: Scope: The LO applies to all catches of species which are subjected to Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits or, in the Mediterranean, to a minimum landing size (MLS). Species that are not subject to TACs or MLS can still be discarded. Minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) : The LO requires that fish under the MCRS are landed but prohibits their use for direct human consumption. Catches of all fish, including fish below the MCRS must be recorded and counted against quotas. Exemptions: The LO does not apply to species and fisheries with demonstrably high survival rates for discarded fish. Also up to 5 % of the total catch of species may be discarded in cases where selectivity increases are difficult to achieve or where handling of unwanted catches creates disproportionate costs (de minimis exemptions). Discard plans: In the absence of multiannual plans groups of member states organised at a regional level develop discard plans in consultation with advisory councils. These plans are submitted as “joint recommendations”, which detail the species {{to be included in the}} LO, at which times and also any exemptions. Following review of the joint recommendations by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) the plans are adopted by the European Commission either in full or with amendments. Quota flexibility The LO requires that fishermen have <b>access</b> to <b>quotas</b> to cover their catches or they have to cease fishing (see “choke species problem” below). Accordingly, there are rules that allow for conditional transfer of quota between years and between species...|$|R
