5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

25|$|Gautham Subramaniam (Jayam Ravi) is {{a doctor}} from an Indian family who lives in Chennai. Since his father (Nizhagal Ravi) and mother are doctors, he {{wanted to become a}} doctor. Gautham gets an {{opportunity}} from the Government of India to go to Russia to represent India in a week long medical conference, along with five other young doctors. Gautham is delighted to receive this offer and packs his bags to fly to Russia. Meanwhile, his beloved is introduced on the frame which happens to be Shenba (Kangana Ranaut). She happens to be the same village girl in which Gautham's sister Sarasu (Anu Haasan) resides with her husband (Chetan) and so they two meet and fall in love. Despite initial frictions between her father and uncle (Pithamagan Mahadevan and Bose Venkat) with Gautham, they eventually agree to get the pair married. Gautham’s parents agree to the marriage, and as <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man,</b> Gautham is ready to marry Shenba after his return to India from his Russia trip.|$|E

25|$|Aubrey meets Admiral Ives, now in Gibraltar, who {{is pleased}} with the last mission of HMS Surprise, despite Aubrey's {{negative}} report. Mr Yarrow will rephrase it to make the success clearer to the Admiralty. The admiral is now a peer, his deepest wish, and he is <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man.</b> Aubrey dines with Laura Fielding and her husband, Lieutenant Fielding, who is now satisfied that his wife is true to him and thanks Aubrey for bringing her from Malta to Gibraltar (though it is Maturin who {{brought her to the}} ship, saving her from two assassins). Maturin receives news from his intelligence-chief in London, Sir Joseph Blaine, confirming high level infiltration of British intelligence by the French. Maturin's wife Diana has heard rumours of his pretended infidelity in Valletta, Malta, with Mrs Fielding for intelligence reasons. He sends her a letter via Andrew Wray, unsuspecting of Wray's role as a French agent. Maturin learns of his success in Malta, destroying the French intelligence network based there, all but André Lesueur taken.|$|E
500|$|David has no {{obligation}} {{to share with the}} Finley & Figg partners the proceeds of this case, which was his own initiative. However, his sense of loyalty prevents him from leaving an ailing firm and ailing fellows in the lurch. David returns to the office and tells Oscar and Wally of his settlement. He offers to pay the debts left from the Krayoxx fiasco, amounting to $200,000 and pays off the mortgage on the firm's office building, gives the loyal secretary Rochelle a $100,000 bonus and splits the remaining $1.2 million evenly with them (a far more generous settlement than they planned to give him, had the Krayoxx money come in). In return, the three of them are to sign a 12-month contract to enter an equal partnership and will no longer be an ambulance-chasing firm. A bit embarrassed, Oscar and Wally agree to the new contract. However, the two of them can't really function under these new terms, and later that year the partnership falls apart. Finley begins spending less time in the office and eventually retires <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man,</b> having recently remarried and being much more satisfied with his new wife, while Figg packs up and moves to Alaska. [...] Zinc opens his own product liability practice, David E. Zinc, Attorney-at-Law and hires Rochelle as his new secretary. Soon winning two further lead poisoning cases, he seems well embarked on a professionally and financially satisfying career.|$|E
2500|$|I love Shakespeare. He wrote {{some of the}} rawest stories, man. I mean look at Romeo and Juliet. That's {{some serious}} ghetto shit. You got this guy Romeo from the Bloods who falls for Juliet, a female from the Crips, and {{everybody}} in both gangs is against them. So they have to sneak out and they end up dead for nothing. Real tragic stuff. And look how Shakespeare busts it up with Macbeth. He creates a tale about this king's wife who convinces <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man</b> to chase after her and kill her husband so he can take over the country. After he commits the murder, the dude starts having delusions just like in a Scarface song. I mean the king's wife just screws this guy's whole life up for nothing [...]|$|E

2500|$|But on {{the opening}} night of Bombo, and the first {{performance}} at the new theatre, he suffered from extreme stage fright, {{walking up and down}} the streets for hours before showtime. Out of fear, he lost his voice backstage and begged the stagehands not to raise the curtains. But when the curtains went up, he [...] "was [...] standing in the wings trembling and sweating." [...] After being physically shoved onto the stage by his brother Harry, he performed and received an ovation that he would never forget: [...] "For several minutes, the applause continued while Al stood and bowed after the first act." [...] He refused to go back on stage for the second act, but the audience [...] "just stamped its feet and chanted 'Jolson, Jolson', until he came back out."

2500|$|In 2008, {{director}} Baz Luhrmann cast Jackman {{to replace}} Russell Crowe as the male lead in his much-publicized epic film, Australia, which co-starred Nicole Kidman. The movie {{was released in}} late November 2008 in Australia and the U.S. Jackman played a tough, independent cattle drover, who reluctantly helps an English noblewoman in her quest to save both her philandering husband's Australian cattle station and the mixed race Aboriginal child she finds there. Of the movie, Jackman said, [...] "This is pretty much one of those roles that had me pinching myself {{all the way through}} the shoot. I got to shoot a big-budget, shamelessly old-fashioned romantic epic set against one of the most turbulent times in my native country's history, while, at the same time, celebrating that country's natural beauty, its people, its cultures.... I'll die <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man</b> knowing I've got this film on my CV." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the war, Winston Churchill {{consulted}} {{him only}} once, in February 1943, on the advisability of his speaking out strongly against the continued neutrality of Éamon de Valera's Ireland. Baldwin saw {{the draft of}} Churchill's speech and advised against it, which advice Churchill followed. A few months after this visit to Churchill, Baldwin told Harold Nicolson, [...] "I went into Downing Street... <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man.</b> Of course it was partly because an old buffer like me enjoys feeling that he is still not quite out of things. But it was also pure patriotic joy that my country {{at such a time}} should have found such a leader. The furnace of the war has smeltered out all base metals from him". To D. H. Barber, Baldwin wrote of Churchill: [...] "You can take it from me he is a really big man, the War has brought out the best that was in him. His head isn't turned the least little bit by the great position he occupies {{in the eyes of the}} world. I pray he is spared to see us through".|$|E

2500|$|Connolly and {{his older}} sister, Florence (named for their {{maternal}} grandmother, and eighteen months his senior), were cared for by two aunts, Margaret and Mona Connolly, his father's sisters, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. [...] "My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I’m <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man</b> now but I still have the scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, your sister... We didn't dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare'. She used to get after them." [...] In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon {{with her husband and}} two children. [...] "My mother said, 'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.'" [...] "I said, 'Did you speak to her?' 'Oh, no, I didn't,' she said. I thought, 'Oh, my god. It's like being a ghost while you're still alive.' Walking behind your own child. Having a look.

2500|$|Having {{lost all}} close relatives, {{he moved in}} with his mother's family (the Kurodas). However, in January 1916, he moved into a {{boarding}} house near the junior high school (comparable to a modern high school) {{to which he had}} formerly commuted by train. Through many of Kawabata’s works the sense of distance in his life is represented. He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation. In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote: “I feel as though I have never held a woman’s hand in a romantic sense Am I <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> <b>man</b> deserving of pity?”. Indeed, this {{does not have to be}} taken literally, but it does show the type of emotional insecurity that Kawabata felt, especially experiencing two painful love affairs at a young age. One of those painful love episodes was with Hatsuyo Ito ( [...] , 1906-1951) whom he met when he was 20 years old. His unsent love letter to her was recently found at his former residence in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. According to Kaori Kawabata, Kawabata's son-in-law, an unpublished entry in the author's diary mentions that Hatsuyo was raped by a monk at the temple she was staying at, which led her to break off their engagement.|$|E
