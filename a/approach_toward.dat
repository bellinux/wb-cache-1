5|$|In {{part due}} to his {{advanced}} years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved {{in the affairs of}} other states, including those in the East African Community. Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation. In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the East African Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious <b>approach</b> <b>toward</b> regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the Congo Crisis, heading the Organisation of African Unity's Conciliation Commission on the Congo.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{warnings}} and watches were issued on two separate occasions as Nadine approached the Azores. At 1000UTC on September18, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for the islands of Flores and Corvo. Although the tropical storm watch was discontinued at 2100UTC, a tropical storm warning was implemented at that time for the islands of Corvo, Faial, Flores, Graciosa, Pico, São Jorge, and Terceira. At 1500UTC on September19, a tropical storm warning was also issued for São Miguel and Santa Maria. All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on September21. After re-generating, Nadine posed {{a threat to the}} Azores again, and thus, a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire archipelago at 1500UTC on October1. Nine hours later, 0000UTC on the following day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. After Nadine became extratropical, the warning was discontinued. On the storm's second <b>approach</b> <b>toward</b> the Azores, schools were closed and flight were cancelled.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{nature of}} labor {{market and the}} shift from the lifelong {{employment}} with a single employer to multiple careers has impacted development of new <b>approaches</b> <b>toward</b> career. Hence, the concept of boundaryless career as the opposite to the traditional, organizational career was proposed. Meanwhile, the construct of protean career focuses on self-directed vocational behavior. The paper aims to compare traditional and contemporary <b>approaches</b> <b>toward</b> career development. The emphasis is put on individual perspective versus organizational perspective. The authors strive to reveal what factors impact {{the success of the}} second or even the third career. The contemporary findings provided in scientific literature are discussed and analyzed. The researches focused on <b>approaches</b> <b>toward</b> career are seen as vast and complex. On the other hand, the complexity of phenomenon impacted inconsistency of different studies. Resulting conclusions about the implications of contemporary <b>approaches</b> <b>toward</b> career development would lead us to develop the framework and recommendations for future research and theory development...|$|R

25|$|For example, if {{the given}} {{manifold}} is a -sphere, then one can picture the tangent space {{at a point}} as the plane that touches the sphere at that point and is perpendicular to the sphere’s radius through the point. More generally, if a given manifold is thought of as an embedded submanifold of Euclidean space, then one can picture a tangent space in this literal fashion. This was the traditional <b>approach</b> <b>toward</b> defining parallel transport and was used by Dirac. More strictly, this defines an affine tangent space, which is distinct from the space of tangent vectors described by modern terminology.|$|E

As mayor of a newly united Jerusalem, Kollek’s <b>approach</b> <b>toward</b> the Arab {{inhabitants}} was governed by pragmatism.

Muslims continued to have access to al-Aqsa Mosque and Temple Mount for worship.

25|$|McClellan {{had chosen}} to {{approach}} the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, with an amphibious operation that landed troops {{on the tip of}} the Virginia Peninsula at Fort Monroe. His Army of the Potomac numbered 121,500 men, transported starting on March 17 by 389 vessels. McClellan planned to use U.S. Navy forces to envelop Yorktown, but the emergence of the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia and the Battle of Hampton Roads (March 8–9, 1862) disrupted this plan. The threat of the Virginia on the James River and the heavy Confederate batteries {{at the mouth of the}} York River prevented the Navy from assuring McClellan that they could control either the York or the James, so he settled on a purely land <b>approach</b> <b>toward</b> Yorktown.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{traditional}} attachment theory {{holds that}} the provision of a safe and predictable environment and caregiver qualities such as sensitivity, responsiveness to children's physical and emotional needs and consistency, support the development of healthy attachment. Therapy based on this viewpoint emphasizes providing a stable environment and taking a calm, sensitive, non-intrusive, non-threatening, patient, predictable, and nurturing <b>approach</b> <b>toward</b> children. Further, as attachment patterns develop within relationships, methods to correct problems with attachment focus on improving the stability and positive qualities of the caregiver-child interactions and relationship. All mainstream interventions with an existing or developing evidential foundation focus on enhancing caregiver sensitivity, creating positive interactions with caregivers, or change of caregiver if that is not possible with existing caregivers. Some interventions focus specifically on increasing caregiver sensitivity in foster parents.|$|E

25|$|On 12 October 1941, the 49th Army {{was placed}} on the Mozhaisk defense line in the Kaluga area, after giving up its sector to the 32nd Army. The Mozhaisk line was {{credited}} for slowing down the German <b>approach</b> <b>toward</b> Moscow. A day later, the army was transferred to the Western Front and saw its first combat in the Mozhaisk-Malyaroslavets Defensive Operation, which lasted until 30 October. In fierce fighting from 14 to 20 November, the 49th Army was able to weaken the advancing German XIII Army Corps, finally stopping it in early December on the line west of Serpukhov and Sukhodol, 20 kilometers southeast of Aleksin. During the Soviet counteroffensive at Moscow, the army fought in the Tula Offensive between 6 and 16 December, and the Kaluga Offensive between 17 December and 5 January 1942.|$|E
25|$|It is {{commonly}} {{said that the}} tune for Kol Nidre is missinai - unchanged since Moses climbed down from Mount Sinai - In the early 17th century, Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe of Prague, known as the Levush, mentioned that all cantors knew a set melody which was traditional for Kol Nidre. Jaffe was actually complaining that the widespread and solid adherence to this melody was hampering his efforts to introduce corrections into the lyrics. And yet there are probably no two synagogues in which the melody is chanted note for note absolutely the same. So marked is the variation {{in the details of}} the melody that a critical examination of the variants shows an <b>approach</b> <b>toward</b> agreement in the essentials of the first strain only, with transformations of the greatest diversity in the remaining strains. These divergences, however, are not radical, and they are no more than are inherent in a composition not due to a single originator, but built up and elaborated by many in turn, and handed on by them in distinct lines of tradition, along all of which the rhapsodical method of the hazzanut has been followed.|$|E
