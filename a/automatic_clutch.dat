5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch</b> was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
25|$|Underbones are small-displacement {{motorcycles}} with a step-through frame, {{descendants of}} the original Honda Super Cub. They are differentiated from scooters by their larger wheels and their use of footpegs instead of a floorboard. They often have a gear shifter with an <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
25|$|At Earls Court, London, in 1976, Batavus {{showed the}} seven-model range; six {{machines}} were {{powered by the}} 48cc Laura engine, with V-belt primary drive and <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch.</b> The exception was the top-of-the-range Mk 4S, with motorcycle styling and the Sachs four-speed motor. Specification include an electronic tachometer, battery-operated turn signals and heavy-duty suspension front and rear. This model, which has the overall dimensions of a full-sized motorcycle was the biggest machine sold by Batavus.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, McCormack {{noticed that}} one Honda dealer in Boise, Idaho was selling more Honda 50s than the {{combined}} total of all six dealers in Los Angeles. He {{found out that}} the Idaho dealer, Herb Uhl, was selling the CA100s as a trail bike by adding knobby tires for off-road traction and a [...] "cheater sprocket," [...] that is, increasing the final drive ratio by using a larger rear sprocket with more teeth, which increased the effective torque of the rear wheel, trading off lower top speed as a result. Uhl said the advantages of light weight and the <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch</b> allowed unskilled riders to enjoy off-road riding, in comparison to traditional big trail bikes that could be difficult to handle. McCormack shipped a version of Uhl's customized CA100 to Japan and requested Honda put it into production, and by March 1961 the Trail 50 was available to US dealers. Cycle World praised the simple pleasure of trail riding on the new bike, and it was a US sales success.|$|E

25|$|Scooter engine sizes range {{smaller than}} motorcycles, , and have all-enclosing {{bodywork}} {{that makes them}} cleaner and quieter than motorcycles, as well as having more built-in storage space. <b>Automatic</b> <b>clutches</b> and continuously variable transmissions (CVT) make them easier to learn on and to ride. Scooters usually have smaller wheels than motorcycles. Scooters usually have the engine {{as part of the}} swingarm, so that their engines travel up and down with the suspension.|$|R

2500|$|The {{new design}} also {{received}} mechanical upgrades including 30% larger brakes {{than those on}} the previous models. The I8 engine was also increased to [...] and produced [...] Options included a freewheeling clutch to disengage the driveline, {{as well as a}} selective-control <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A new [...] "E-stick" [...] option {{combined}} {{a manual}} 3-speed transmission with an <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch</b> as a low-cost {{alternative to the}} fully automatic transmission. The E-stick was also available in conjunction with an overdrive unit. The system cost $59.50, but offered stick-shift economy, performance, and driver control without a clutch pedal by using engine oil pressure and intake manifold vacuum to engage and disengage the clutch when shifting gears.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Leyland began {{experimenting with}} ideas for a rear-engined {{double-decker}} bus. [...] A prototype was built, {{with a body}} by Saunders-Roe, to the maximum permitted width of [...] [...] It was fitted with a turbocharged version of the Leyland O.350 engine, which was transversely mounted {{at the rear of}} the sub-frame. [...] The chassis was a platform-type frame of steel and light alloy with deep stressed side-members. An <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch</b> and self change gearbox were also fitted. [...] The vehicle was designated the PDR1 (R for [...] "Rear-engined").|$|E
5000|$|These small 17" [...] wheel {{bikes are}} {{intended}} for relatively slow off-road travel. They have 4-stroke engines ranging from 49 cc to 105 cc, and <b>automatic</b> <b>clutches.</b> All bikes have either 3- or 4-speed transmissions, plus a second choice of HIGH or LOW bands to apply the same gears to road travel or slower off-road travel. The early bikes achieved this by having two drive sprockets at the rear wheel, which required the rider to dismount and thread the chain onto the desired sprocket. Later bikes placed the two-stage choice within the gearbox, and required the rider to only move a lever.|$|R
25|$|Note: Figures in {{brackets}} are for <b>automatic</b> (including dual <b>clutch)</b> transmissions.|$|R
50|$|The car {{has only}} one wheel drive, meaning the engine {{transfers}} the torque to the rear right wheel. Torque is transferred to the wheel through a 2-speed manual transmission with an <b>automatic</b> dry <b>clutch.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In March 1978 the Swingback {{version was}} added, a two-door sedan which {{received}} a larger, opening rear window. The large rear window necessitated a slightly smaller {{opening to the}} engine compartment, but {{this was more than}} made up for by allowing for access to the rear luggage compartment from the outside. In March 1979, the Rex underwent a very minor facelift, the most visible results being new rims and slightly differing bumpers and a small spoiler in front. Then, in response to the very low priced Suzuki Alto, a decontented version of the Van called [...] "Family Rex" [...] was added in October 1979. It was priced at a very low ¥480,000 (under US$2,000 at the time). An <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch</b> version was added in March 1980.|$|E
2500|$|By November 1971, after a minor {{facelift}} {{including a}} new grille, the cars were called Suzuki Fronte 72. The sporty air-cooled engines were dropped as the more refined water-cooled units {{became more and more}} popular, except in the very lowest end of the market. In March 1972, water-cooled GD-W (deLuxe) and GU-W (standard) were added. In export markets, there was the Suzuki Fronte 500 with the 475cc LC50 engine, also marketed as the Suzuki LC50 (29PS, 115km/h). In October 1972 the Fronte 72 was replaced by the [...] "New Fronte" [...] (with a new fascia and bonnet). By this time, only the Standard model ("U") retained the air-cooled engine, with an available <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch.</b> The top-of-the-line [...] "GT-W Type II" [...] came equipped with front disc brakes, as does its sister model the Fronte Coupé GXCF.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1960, a five-door {{station wagon}} was added (WP310). The P310 was {{powered by the}} 1.2L Nissan E engine. A smaller-engine version (simply called [...] "310") was powered by the 1.0L Nissan C engine. The P311 and P312 (powered by the 60hp 1.2L Nissan E-1 engine) also had smaller-engined {{versions}} ("311" [...] and [...] "312") that were powered by the 45hp 1.0L Nissan C-1 engine. The 310 and 311 were equipped with a 3-speed manual transmission (fully synchronized for the 311 and 312). The station wagon was also available for the 311 and 312. The 312 was also available in a deluxe version (DP312). A trim model called the [...] "Fancy Deluxe" [...] (model code DP312-L) was marketed for the female driver; it featured a pale yellow exterior, pale yellow/grey interior, high heel shoe holder under the dash, a vanity mirror {{on the back of}} the driver's side sun visor, a turn signal relay that played music, curtains, <b>automatic</b> <b>clutch,</b> and bigger mirrors. By February 1961, a 1.2L overhead-valve engine (codenamed E-1) became an option on a higher-trim DX model.|$|E
5000|$|The {{new models}} were the XL-350, XL-500 and TT-500. All of these newer models {{featured}} {{front and rear}} disc brakes, headlight/taillights, chrome chain guards and <b>automatic</b> <b>clutches</b> with jackshafts. [...] Also new to these bikes were external spring shocks, front and rear, and noncontinuous forks and handlebars. The TT-500 was {{the top of the}} line newer model and featured a different chain guard as well as a two speed jackshaft. The XL-350 and XL-500 were identical, both featuring a single speed jackshaft, {{with the exception of the}} engine size—3 1/2 and 5 HP, respectively. Rupp also offered accessories for the bikes at an extra charge, including a front bicycle basket, windshield and crash bar.|$|R
50|$|The gearbox, {{controlled}} by a column mounted lever, was a three speed manual system coupled with a free-wheel device: in Autumn 1953 a four speed box was offered as an option. 1957 saw a further transmission advance with {{the availability of a}} Saxomat <b>automatic</b> centrifugal <b>clutch</b> on the DKW.|$|R

50|$|Attempts {{to improve}} fuel {{efficiency}} of automatic transmissions {{include the use}} of torque converters that lock up beyond a certain speed or in higher gear ratios, eliminating power loss, and overdrive gears that automatically actuate above certain speeds. In older transmissions, both technologies could be intrusive, when conditions are such that they repeatedly cut in and out as speed and such load factors as grade or wind vary slightly. Current computerized transmissions possess complex programming that both maximizes fuel efficiency and eliminates intrusiveness. This is due mainly to electronic rather than mechanical advances, though improvements in CVT technology and the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>clutches</b> have also helped. A few cars, including the 2013 Subaru Impreza and the 2012 model of the Honda Jazz sold in the UK, actually claim marginally better fuel consumption for the CVT version than the manual version.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{builds on}} the {{analysis}} of a automatic system for automotive <b>automatic</b> <b>clutches.</b> In this field of study there are some constraint {{to take into account}} and through them it is possible to find the best technological solution. The system under consideration is characterized as electromechanical, with an electric motor brush DC and reduction system very complex. The system was modeled using the Bond-Graph technique which allowed the drafting of the dynamical system equations, in state space form. In fact the system itself is quite complex {{due to the fact that}} multiple dynamic domains were taken into account. The result is a unique model where all the dynamics are represented, with constitutive equations. Three alternative solutions have been proposed to improve performance and reduce power consumption and system complexity. The prototypes were built and tested.
