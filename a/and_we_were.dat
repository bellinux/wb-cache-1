5|$|During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's {{electrical}} {{school in}} Phillip Street. It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets.

5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E

And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Gibson {{starred in}} Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet in 1990, as the eponymous {{character}} of the Shakespearean tragedy of the same name. It was the first film produced by Icon Productions, a production company he co-founded with Bruce Davey. Gibson's directorial debut was The Man Without a Face (1993), an adaptation of Isabelle Holland's novel of the same name. Two years later he directed and produced Braveheart, a historical epic drama in which he also portrayed Sir William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish knight. The film earned him a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Gibson went on to star in Ransom (1996), Payback (1999), What Women Want and The Patriot (both in 2000), <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> Soldiers (2002).|$|E

5|$|Laurie Mains had {{returned}} from South Africa to coach Otago in the 2001 NPC, and after Peter Sloane moved to the Blues, Mains was appointed the Highlanders coach for 2002. Their season started with a narrow 3028 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium, after leading 2827 at one point. That year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams; a Grand Slam {{that they had not}} achieved since 1998. The closest of those four victories was a 2120 win over the Stormers in Cape Town. They also defeated the Brumbies 2518 in Canberra, The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before dying from cancer in 2001. Highland prop said of the game against the Blues “While I’m sure Gordy was popular in Auckland during his time coaching up there, as he’d seemed to be everywhere he went, the trophy meant a huge amount to us <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> determined to be the first winners to honour his memory”. The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 153 at half time, and eventually won 2013. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders’ 4026 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. With their eight victories from the regular season, the Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch in their semi-final. The Crusaders won 3423 although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.|$|E

25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E

25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{having a lot of}} fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
