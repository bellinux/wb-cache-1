The specific degradation processes for a given pesticide are determined by its structure and by the environmental conditions it experiences. Redox gradients in soils, sediments or aquifers often determine which transformations can occur.

Chemical compounds in typical bacteria (such as DNA, lipids, sugars, etc.) and similar values of C:N ratios per particle are found in the microparticles formed abiotically. Microparticles are a potentially attractive food source to bacterivorous plankton. If this is the case, {{the microbial}} loop can be extended by the pathway of direct transfer of dissolved organic matter (DOM) via abiotic microparticle formation to higher trophic levels. This has ecological importance in two ways. First, it occurs without carbon loss, and makes organic matter more efficiently available to phagotrophic organisms, rather than only heterotrophic bacteria. Furthermore, <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformation</b> in the extended microbial loop depends only on temperature and the capacity of DOM to aggregate, while biotic transformation is dependent on its biological availability (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003).|$|E
5000|$|The {{genes for}} enzymes AtzA-C {{have been found}} to be highly conserved in atrazine-degrading organisms worldwide. In Pseudomonas sp.

The {{insertion}} elements flanking each gene suggest that they are involved in the assembly of this specialized catabolic pathway. Two options exist for degradation of atrazine using microbes, bioaugmentation or biostimulation. Recent research suggests that microbial adaptation to atrazine has occurred in some fields where the herbicide is used repetitively, resulting in more rapid biodegradation. Like the herbicides trifluralin and alachlor, atrazine is susceptible to rapid transformation in the presence of reduced iron-bearing soil clays, such as ferruginous smectites.

EE 2 is an endocrine disrupting compound, high in estrogenic potency. Although EE 2 exhibits low degree of biodegradability with common microorganisms in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), this compound can be biotransformed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) via a co-metabolism mechanism in WWTPs. This study aimed to investigate the effect of real wastewater on biotransformation of EE 2 by AOB. A preliminary experiment {{on the effect of}} nitrite and pH levels on <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformation</b> of EE 2 suggested that the <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformation</b> occurred at only pH < 6. 8. Biotransformation of EE 2 under the presence of municipal or industrial wastewater demonstrated that different types of wastewater affect EE 2 biotransformation differently. Organic matters in wastewater were believed to deteriorate EE 2 biotransformation via the competition effect. At a lower initial ammonium concentration, EE 2 biotransformation can be retarded and the extent of the deterioration was COD-concentration dependent. However, when an initial ammonium concentration was elevated, thisphenomena disappeared. This is because when increasing the amount of the primary substrate, more AMO enzymes can be produced resulting in unlimited transformation of all compounds in the tests reducing the competitive effect of organic matters on EE 2.

Understanding the transport and fate of these compounds in the vadose zone is crucial to identifying pollution sources, assessing the threat to groundwater, and evaluating the need and adequacy of cleanup. CHCs exist in various physical phases in the subsurface, linked by interphasal processes. These, combined with unsaturated water flow in the vadose zone, which is complicated by the multifluid (air and water) situation, geologic hetero-geneity, and a highly site-specific preferential flow pattern, create a possibly four-fluid flow condition, with interactions among different phases of CHCs and between chemicals and geologic materials.

S is found in a variety of both organic and inorganic forms undergoing a range of biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformations.</b> In watersheds with decreasing atmospheric S inputs, internal cycling is becoming dominant in affecting whether there is net loss or retention of S. Little attention has been given to the role of dissolved organic S (DOS) in affecting S biogeochemistry.

The objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify sorption and desorption of chlorpyrifos on colloidal materials in aqueous systems; (2) to investigate hydrolysis of chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems; (3) to evaluate the effects of colloidal materials {{on the fate of}} the sorbed chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems; and (4) to study <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformation</b> of chlorpyrifos in water;Six reference smectites, humic acid and suspended sediment collected from the Upper Cedar River near Janesville, Iowa were used for the present study. X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, ICP-AES and chemical analysis were employed to characterize the colloidal materials. GC and HPLC were used to quantify chlorpyrifos and its degradates in aqueous systems. The results indicate a large difference in sorption affinities and variation in desorption among smectites. The sorption affinity for chlorpyrifos was not correlated to cation-exchange capacity, surface area or surface charge density, but {{may be related to the}} fabric of smectite quasicrystals. Substantial sorption-desorption hysteresis was found for all smectites and the suspended sediment. Chlorpyrifos was strongly sorbed by HA with negligible desorption in aqueous solution. Chlorpyrifos degraded in aqueous systems with half-lives ranged from 27 to 158 days, depending on the chemistry of aqueous solutions. The rate of chlorpyrifos hydrolysis decreased in the presence of suspended smectites in aqueous systems. The formation of chlorpyrifos-colloid complexes inhibited hydrolysis and influenced fate of chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems, suggesting that sorption of chlorpyrifos on suspended sediment may potentially prolong the exposure time of organisms such as fish to chlorpyrifos in aquatic environments.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of catechol oxidation by soil metal oxides is investigated in a slurry reactor. This <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformation</b> {{is shown to}} consist in a three-step process. The first step is a heterogeneous reaction. Catechol undergoes fast, partial oxidation at the expenses of Fe and Mn oxides contained in the soil. In the second step, reduced Fe and Mn are released into the aqueous solution and immediately complexed by catechol. Metal-catecholate complexes are stable at the very low dissolved-oxygen concentration levels attained under nitrogen sparging. The third step is a homogenous reaction. The highly reactive intermediate produced by catechol partial oxidation initiates catechol polymerisation. Under nitrogen sparging, the polymerisation process ends rather rapidly, thus yielding only partial conversion of the phenol and producing low-molecular weight, water-soluble polymers. Further oxidation of the metal-catecholate complexes formed in the second step only occurs under air sparging. Thus, reactive intermediates are formed at much higher concentration levels than those attained when nearly no oxygen is present in solution. The polymerisation proceeds at a much faster rate until, under the experimental conditions adopted, complete catechol conversion is attained and high-molecular-weight, insoluble polymers are produced...|$|E
40|$|Poly- and perfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) are {{a family}} of anthropogenic chemicals widely used in the commercial and industrial applications due to their unique properties of stability, hydrophobicity and lipophobicity. Traditionally, PFASs are produced via two major manufacturing processes; electrochemical fluorination (ECF) and telomerization. Due to their persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation, ECF-associated chemicals perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) are placed into the Annex B of the Stockholm Convention (SC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in 2009. The ECF production has also been phased out gradually in the developed countries. However, the production of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) by telomerization has increased significantly. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} the biotransformation and <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformation</b> of FTOHs yielded perfluocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), which may be router for the ubiquitous distribution of PFCAs. Besides, some of the FTOHs intermediate metabolites have been demonstrated to be able to covalently bind with various biomolecules and thereby cause serious toxicity, while the final metabolites are showed to cause hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity. Recently, the environmental problems related to FTOHs have become the hotspots in environmental science, toxicology and epidemiology. This paper reviews the research progress on the production status, environmental occurrence, and the toxicities of FTOHs and the related metabolites. Finally, the currently existing problems and trends are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Assessing human {{exposure}} to chemicals from Superfund sites requires knowledge of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes {{occurring in the}} environment and specific information about the local environment and population {{in the vicinity of}} sites of interest. Although progress is being made in both areas, there is still a tremendous amount to be done. Participants at this meeting have identified several of the areas in need of greater understanding, and they are listed below. Movement of dissolved and volatile organics, especially NAPLs, in the subsurface environment. This includes study of the partitioning of compounds between NAPLs, air, water, and soil. Partitioning of volatilized chemicals between gaseous and aerosol components of the atmosphere. This includes understanding how these components influence both wet and dry deposition. Long-term movement from sediments into biota and how these affect chronic toxicity to sediment biota. Broad validation of PBPK models describing partitioning of compounds from sediment and water into fish. Reactions of chemicals sorbed to atmospheric particles. This includes application of laboratory models to real and varied atmospheric conditions. Interactions between biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformations</b> in soil and sediment. Applicability of physiological pharmacokinetic models developed in laboratory studies of experimental animals and clinical investigations of humans to environmental chemicals, concentrations, and routes of exposure in humans. Use of human and wildlife behavioral and biomonitoring information to estimate exposure. This includes better understanding of human variability and the applicability of information gathered from particular wildlife species. To successfully address these gaps in our knowledge, much more analytical data must be collected. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

The prairie pothole region (PPR) {{is among the}} most extensively altered ecosystems on Earth. This region covers approximately 780, 000 km 2 of central North America, and contains numerous glacially formed wetlands embedded in an agricultural landscape. These wetlands, commonly known as prairie pothole lakes (PPLs), provide essential ecosystem services. Over the last 150 years, agricultural drainage has resulted in severe loss of native prairie wetlands. The remaining PPLs continue to be threatened by nonpoint source pesticide pollution from agriculture. Currently, {{little is known about the}} fate and persistence of pesticides in PPLs. In this work, the <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformations</b> of commonly used pesticides in PPL sediment porewaters and surface water were explored. Chloroacetanilide and dinitroaniline pesticides were found to react rapidly with naturally abundant reduced sulfur species (i. e., hydrogen sulfide and polysulfides) in sediment porewaters via nucleophilic substitution and reduction reactions, respectively. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was also found to play a vital role in the reductive transformation. Next, the photodegradation of a suite of pesticides was investigated in PPL surface water under both simulated and natural sunlight. Enhanced pesticide removal rates pointed to the importance of indirect photolysis pathways involving photochemically produced reactive intermediates such as singlet oxygen and triplet excited-state DOM. Finally, the sedimentary sulfur speciation was examined by sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Sulfur species in PPL sediments were found to consist of organic (di) sulfides, sulfonate, sulfate, and the mineral pyrite. Notably, the fractional abundances of reduced and oxidized sulfur species fluctuate on a seasonal basis...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a module describing the dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) dynamics, including biological transformations by phytoplankton and bacteria, and physico-chemical processes (including DMS air-sea exchange). This module was integrated in the MIRO ecological model and applied in a 0 D frame in the Southern North Sea (SNS). The DMS(P) module {{is built on}} parameterizations derived from available knowledge on DMS(P) sources, transformations and sinks, and provides an explicit representation of bacterial activity in contrast to most of existing models that only include phytoplankton process (and <b>abiotic</b> <b>transformations).</b> The model is tested in a highly productive coastal ecosystem (the Belgian coastal zone, BCZ) dominated by diatoms and the Haptophyceae Phaeocystis, respectively low and high DMSP producers. On an annual basis, the particulate DMSP (DMSPp) production simulated in 1989 is mainly related to Phaeocystis colonies (78 %) rather than diatoms (13 %) and nanoflagellates (9 %). Accordingly, sensitivity analysis shows that the model responds more {{to changes in the}} sulfur: carbon (S: C) quota and lyase yield of Phaeocystis. DMS originates equally from phytoplankton and bacterial DMSP-lyase activity and only 3 % of the DMS is emitted to the atmosphere. Model analysis demonstrates the sensitivity of DMS emission towards the atmosphere to the description and parameterization of biological processes emphasizing the need of adequately representing in models both phytoplankton and bacterial processes affecting DMS(P) dynamics. This is particularly important in eutrophied coastal environments such as the SNS dominated by high non-diatom blooms and where empirical models developed from data-sets biased towards open ocean conditions do not satisfactorily predict the timing and amplitude of the DMS seasonal cycle. In order to predict future feedbacks of DMS emissions on climate, it is needed to account for hotspots of DMS emissions from coastal environments that, if eutrophied, are dominated not only by diatoms...|$|R
