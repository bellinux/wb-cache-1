Typeset using REVTEX 1 Recent experimental studies of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in an optical trap [1] have opened a new direction in the research of ultra-cold atomic clouds associated with their spin degree of freedom, or spinor BEC. An optical trap does not force atoms to align along {{the orientation of the}} strong confining magnetic field, as happens {{in the case of a}} magnetic trap, allowing the study of atoms confined in all hyperfine states.

40|$|Parametric solitons or {{simultaneous}} solitary waves (simultons), {{involving the}} optical x^(2) nonlinearity, {{have been the}} topic of much recent theoretical and experimental interest in nonlinear optics. We propose a novel mechanism by which a similar phenomenon may occur in nonlinear <b>atomic</b> <b>optics,</b> in which coherent molecule formation in a Bose-Einstein condensate {{takes the place of}} second harmonic generation. This requires a coupling that converts two atoms into one molecule, thus generating coupled atomic and molecular Bose-Einstein condensates. Our model includes a coherent molecular formation process (i. e., without dissipation) in an atomic BEC vapor, either through a Feshbach resonance or Raman photo-association. The coherently coupled atom-molecular condensate could provide a route to the observation of a localized three-dimensional BEC soliton, {{even in the absence of}} a trap potential. A possible application is in the free propagation of a non-diverging atom laser pulse, thus greatly increasing the intensity in an atom laser beam...|$|E
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the atomic optical system of an ytterbium atom in a time-dependent optical standing wave be used to experimentally observe quantum nonlinear motion and, in particular, predict the quantum behavior of a system whose classical analog ranges from completely integrable, to near integrable, and finally to globally chaotic motion. We extend previous treatments to include spontaneous emission. From the study of theoretical models of dissipative quantum nonlinear motion, {{it is known that}} even small amounts of dissipation can significantly alter the quantum dynamics through the destruction of coherences. In this paper we present some theoretical and numerical results of the effect of spontaneous emission on nonlinear nonintegrable dynamics in <b>atomic</b> <b>optics.</b> When spontaneous emission is included, we show that the nature of the light-atom interaction introduces interesting features not usually investigated in models of dissipative quantum nonlinear dynamics.

40|$|The {{diffraction}} {{of electrons}} by a standing wave of light was first proposed by Kapitza and Dirac in 1933. We observed this {{effect for the}} first time in September 2001 by showing separate electron diffraction peaks. It was first observed for a focused laser beam, where the standing wave of light serves as a thin light crystal. Later, the effect was also observed with an unfocused laser beam, where the standing wave serves as a thick light crystal, where scattering can only occur at the Bragg angle. ^ The theory behind the effect has been formulated within both <b>atomic</b> <b>optics</b> and electron optics communities. It involves the ponderomotive potential that an electron experiences within the electromagnetic field of two counter-propagating laser beams. The derivations of the differential equations given by both communities have identical results with their own benefits when making numerical calculations. These theoretical calculations fit well to our data, which falls between the limits of the diffraction and Bragg regimes. ^ To analyze the data collected in these experiments, the statistical behavior of the arrival of electrons, governed by the Poisson distribution, was taken into account. The Gaussian nature of the laser beam and its consequences on focusing needed to be addressed, along with how far from diffraction limited the laser beam actually was. ^ There may be a possibility of new effects arising from the interaction of electrons and light. The effect is like KDE, but modified to include two counter-propagating lasers of different frequency, the consequence of the longitudinal velocity of the electrons, and the role that the polarization of the laser light plays. ...|$|E
