5|$|A brief {{clip from}} Episode 4 of The Crusade exists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> start of The Space Museum. Episode 1 {{of the latter}} serial begins with the {{characters}} in period costume, briefly frozen in place. An off-camera cough heard on both soundtracks shows that the clip was a filmed insert from the previous (and currently missing) episode.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> {{end of the}} Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, {{cities in}} the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation {{in the production of}} stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E

5|$|Boys in the Sand is a {{landmark}} American gay pornographic film released <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> {{beginnings of the}} Golden Age of Porn. The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan. Boys in the Sand was the first gay porn film to include credits, to achieve crossover success, to be reviewed by Variety, {{and one of the}} earliest porn films, after 1969's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to gain mainstream credibility, preceding 1972's Deep Throat by nearly a year.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Dr. Ellie Arroway {{works for}} the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Fascinated by science and {{communication}} {{since she was a}} child, she listens to radio emissions from space, hoping to find evidence of alien life. David Drumlin, the president's science advisor, pulls the funding from SETI, because he believes the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S.R. Hadden, which allows her to continue the project <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Very</b> Large Array in New Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} on the star MOA-2009-BLG-387L using the NACO imager <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Very</b> Large Telescope array successfully distinguished the star's mass. The collected data from VLT and from observations during the microlensing event was run {{through a series of}} models and analyzed. An orbiting planetary body larger than Jupiter (or of a similar size, given uncertainties) was discovered. The discovery of the planet was reported on February 21, 2011 in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.|$|E
5|$|In Orson Welles's {{film version}} of Macbeth (1948), Fleance is briefly seen again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> end of the movie. He does not speak in this scene, but he has {{returned}} to Scotland with the army of Malcolm and Macduff, and is shown along with those hailing Malcolm as the new king after the killing of Macbeth.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing {{to one of the}} two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E

5|$|In any case, the {{succession}} of Nyuserre seems to have gone smoothly. A seal bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal {{is believed to have}} both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken together these seals reveal that, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the CIA and the Royal Lao Army had {{initially}} {{been given the}} responsibility of stopping, slowing, or, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least, observing the enemy's infiltration effort. In Laos the agency began Operation Pincushion in 1962 for that reason. The operation evolved into Operation Hardnose, in which CIA-backed Laotian irregular reconnaissance team operations took place.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the Brown {{decision}} are still debated. Notably, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, himself an African American, wrote in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995) that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least, Brown I has been misunderstood by the courts.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E

5|$|The {{action of}} this {{principle}} is exactly {{like that of}} the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.|$|E
