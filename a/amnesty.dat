40|$|Tax <b>amnesties</b> are {{frequently}} observed {{in developing and}} devoloped countries. Tax <b>amnesties</b> are applied frequently in our country too. When we think in short term, tax <b>amnesties</b> are good revunue sources but in long term they destroy taxpayers’ voluntary compliance. We obtained result from our survey in Manisa Central district that taxpayers opposite to the tax amnesties’ frequent application. Because tax <b>amnesties</b> made inequlity between taxpayers and caused negative effects on taxpayers’ behaviours and attitudues.

40|$|Proponents {{argue that}} tax <b>amnesties</b> raise revenue {{both in the}} short-run and long-run, by {{bringing}} former non-filers back into the tax system. Opponents contend that <b>amnesties</b> produce little short-run revenue and weaken incentives for long-run tax compliance. However, over the last 21 years, 27 states offered tax <b>amnesties</b> {{for a second or}} third time. While previous research has estimated the impact of specific tax <b>amnesties,</b> none have estimated how the impact changes when offered repeatedly. We find these additional tax <b>amnesties</b> generate less short-run revenue than predecessors and tend to magnify revenue losses associated with disincentives for long-run tax compliance...|$|R

5|$|In June 1985, {{three months}} after the miners {{admitted}} defeat and ended their strike, Benn introduced the Miners' <b>Amnesty</b> (General Pardon) Bill into the Commons, which would have extended an <b>amnesty</b> to all miners imprisoned during the strike.

5|$|Karmal's {{three most}} {{important}} promises were the general <b>amnesty</b> of prisoners, the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and {{the adoption of a}} new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, {{with the exception of the}} general <b>amnesty</b> of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general <b>amnesty</b> was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general <b>amnesty</b> on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.|$|E
50|$|Government {{authorities}} offered two <b>amnesties</b> for {{fighters from}} the opposition militia groups, which originated from {{remnants of the}} disbanded Home Army and other organizations.

Some were subjected to further prosecution and imprisonment, but the <b>amnesties</b> effectively terminated the anti-communist armed resistance movement.|$|R
40|$|Assuming {{a normal}} {{distribution}} of hazards, Dubin, Graetz, and Wilde (1992) analyze state tax <b>amnesties</b> in the 1980 s and conclude that states run <b>amnesties</b> {{in response to}} revenue yield motive. Given the increased frequency with which states enacted <b>amnesties</b> {{during and after the}} 2001 recession, we investigate if there is a possible shift from revenue yield motive to fiscal stress motive. We find that the normal distribution of hazards assumption along with the multicollinearity problem led prior research to an erroneous conclusion, and that fiscal stress is indeed the main determinant of initial and repeated tax <b>amnesties</b> enacted by states between 1982 and 2005.

These <b>amnesties</b> were not a sign of mercy; they never admitted mistakes or granted innocence, but excused or underplayed crimes and their significance. Instead, <b>amnesties</b> had a range of practical and political functions for the state, not least of which was to act as a ‘safety valve’ to release burgeoning pressures on the fledgling justice system and tensions between state and society.
