30|$|An {{aircraft}} {{is a major}} investment, with {{a useful}} economic life of 25 years or more. Operation of an aircraft includes airframe and engine performance.

50|$|In 1978 ARINC {{introduced}} ACARS (<b>Aircraft</b> Communications <b>Addressing</b> and Reporting System), a datalink {{system that}} enables ground stations (airports, aircraft maintenance bases, etc.) to upload data (such as flight plans) and download data (such as fuel quantity, weight on wheels, flight management system (FMS) data), via an onboard Communications Management Unit (CMU).|$|R
5000|$|By 1913 only France and Germany had {{developed}} field guns suitable for engaging balloons and <b>aircraft</b> and <b>addressed</b> issues of military organisation. Britain's Royal Navy would soon introduce the QF 3-inch and QF 4-inch AA guns and also had Vickers 1-pounder quick firing [...] "pom-pom"s {{that could be}} used in various mountings.|$|R
40|$|Every aircraft, {{military}} or civilian, must be grounded for maintenance {{after it has}} completed {{a certain number of}} flight hours since its last maintenance check. Flight and maintenance planning (FMP) of military <b>aircraft</b> <b>addresses</b> the problem of deciding which available aircraft to fly and for how long, and which grounded aircraft to perform maintenance operations on, in a group of aircraft that comprise a combat unit. The objective is to achieve maximum availability of the unit over the planning horizon. In this paper, we develop an optimization model for the FMP problem, and we illustrate its application and solution on a real life instance drawn from the Hellenic Air Force. We also propose two heuristic techniques for solving large-scale instances of the problem. We conclude with a discussion of the model based on the analysis of the obtained results...|$|R

50|$|One of Steinhoff's {{contributions}} {{was dealing}} with the high accident rate the air force was having with its F-104 Starfighters.

40|$|A {{system of}} {{study of the}} {{potential}} for a high speed commercial transport <b>aircraft</b> <b>addressed</b> technology, economic, and environmental constraints. Market projections indicated a need for fleets of transport with supersonic or greater cruise speeds by the years 2000 to 2005. The associated design requirements called for a vehicle to carry 250 to 300 passengers over a range of 5000 to 6000 nautical miles. The study was initially unconstrained in terms of vehicle characteristics, such as cruise speed, propulsion systems, fuels, or structural materials. Analyses led to a focus on the most promising vehicle concepts. These were concepts that used a kerosene type fuel and cruised at Mach numbers between 2. 0 to 3. 2. Further systems study identified the impact of environmental constraints (for community noise, sonic boom, and engine emissions) on economic attractiveness and technological needs. Results showed that current technology cannot produce a viable high speed civil transport. Significant advances are needed to take off gross weight and allow for both economic attractiveness and environment acceptability. Specific technological requirements were identified to meet these needs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe present Ped-Air, a {{pedestrian}} simulation system {{to model the}} loading, unloading, and evacuation of commercial <b>aircraft.</b> We <b>address</b> the challenge of simulating passenger movement in constrained spaces (e. g., aisles and rows), along with complex, coordinating behaviors between the passengers. Ped-Air models different categories of passengers and flight crew, capturing their unique behaviors and complex interactions. We exhibit Ped-Airs capabilities by simulating passenger movements on two representative aircraft: a single-aisle Boeing 737, and a double-aisle Boeing 777. We are able to simulate the following behaviors: stress, luggage placement, flight staff assisting passengers, obstructed exits for evacuation...|$|R
