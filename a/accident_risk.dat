2500|$|In Cannabis and driving: {{a review}} of the {{literature}} and commentary, the United Kingdom's Department for Transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving, finding [...] "Cannabis impairs driving behaviour. However, this impairment is mediated in that subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired.

The report summarizes current knowledge about the effects of cannabis on driving and <b>accident</b> <b>risk</b> based on {{a review of}} available literature published since 1994 and the effects of cannabis on laboratory based tasks. The study identified young males, amongst whom cannabis consumption is frequent and increasing, and in whom alcohol consumption is also common, as a risk group for traffic accidents. The cause, according to the report, is driving inexperience and factors associated with youth relating to risk taking, delinquency and motivation. These demographic and psychosocial variables may relate to both drug use and <b>accident</b> <b>risk,</b> thereby presenting an artificial relationship between use of drugs and accident involvement.|$|E

2500|$|Accidents {{and safety}} in the {{workplace}} have become areas of interest to I/O psychology. Examples of psychosocial injury hazards of interest to I/O psychology include fatigue, workplace violence, workplace bullying, and working night shifts. I/O researchers conduct [...] "stress audits" [...] that can help organizations remain compliant with various occupational safety regulations. Psychosocial hazards can affect musculoskeletal disorders. A psychosocial factor related to <b>accident</b> <b>risk</b> is safety climate, which refers to employees' perceptions {{of the extent to}} which their work organization prioritizes safety. By contrast, psychosocial safety climate refers to management's [...] "policies, practices, and procedures" [...] aimed at protecting workers' psychological health. Research on safety leadership is also relevant to I/O psychology. Research suggests that safety-oriented transformational leadership is associated with a positive safety climate and safe worker practices.|$|E
2500|$|An {{extensive}} 2013 {{review of}} 66 studies regarding crash risk {{and drug use}} found that cannabis was associated with minor, but not statistically significant increased odds of injury or fatal accident. The estimated fatal crash odds for cannabis (1.26) were lower than: opiates (1.68), [...] antianxiety medications (2.30), zopiclone (sleep medicine) (2.60), cocaine (2.96), and amphetamines (5.17).

The study concluded: [...] "By and large, {{the increase in the}} risk of accident involvement {{associated with the use of}} drugs must be regarded as modest...Compared to the huge increase in <b>accident</b> <b>risk</b> associated with alcohol, as well as the high accident rate among young drivers, the increases in risk associated with the use of drugs are surprisingly small." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2011, Nissan {{announced}} that {{customers in the}} United States and Japan reported problems in restarting their Leaf vehicles after switching the motor off. Nissan said the problem does not pose any <b>accident</b> <b>risk.</b> On April 15. Nissan {{announced that}} the problem only affected {{a small proportion of}} Leafs. Nissan engineers identified a programming error in an air conditioning system sensor that sometimes triggers an erroneous high voltage alert when the air conditioning unit is switched on, due to the increased demand for power. The system issues an Inhibit Restart command, which does not prevent driving the vehicle, but does prevent it restarting after it is turned off. [...] The solution requires reprogramming of the Vehicle Control Module by a Nissan dealer. Nissan announced a [...] "service campaign" [...] to apply the software fix to all 5,300 Nissan Leafs in operation around the world, but it was not an official recall because it was not a safety issue. The applied software update also improves the car’s on-board range calculation system, which several Leaf owners reported was overestimating the number of miles left. In addition, the update changes the state-of-charge bars display to provide a true reserve capacity; the driver now has up to five miles to find a charging spot after the car reaches the zero miles remaining mark.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of estimates of nuclear-power plant safety based on probabilistic safety analyses and discusses the means used to decrease core damage factors, large release frequency and cancer deaths due to nuclear accidents. Estimates made for new nuclear power plants show that these risks are negligibly small. The radiological effects of the Chernobyl accident are discussed and compared with the negligibly small effects of the TMI- 2 accident in the USA in 1978, the only accident with core damage that occurred in pressurized or boiling-water reactors. The <b>accident</b> <b>risks</b> in present and future nuclear-power plants are compared with the <b>accident</b> <b>risks</b> due to other energy sources. Considering the whole fuel cycle, from mineral extraction to waste management, the risks due to nuclear-power accidents are much smaller than the <b>accident</b> <b>risks</b> due to oil, gas or coal fuel cycles. This conclusion is obtained from historical data, taking into account the accidents that have really occurred over the last 40 years, and is confirmed by probabilistic safety analyses for various power industries.

It seems that motorcycles give the most contribution to accidents than other vehicles, especially in urban area. The accidents are caused by poor condition factors of the motorcycles.

40|$|Oil and Gas {{industry}} {{reported that}} the industry has highly hazardous environments, with multiple technological, human and environmental challenges which have potentially severe consequences to workers’ lives, assets loss, environmental pollutions and disruption of security of energy supply. The use of safety climate measures to assess safety performance in an organisation is considered as a proactive or predictive approach to safety management. There are insufficient empirical studies on the establishment of current safety performance in Ghana’s upstream oil and gas operations. This paper seeks to assess the current safety climate predictive influences on major <b>accident</b> <b>risks</b> in Ghana’s upstream oil and gas sector. Safety climate survey questionnaires made up of 60 items in 14 constructs {{were used to assess}} the current employees’ safety perceptions. 212 responses from upstream oil and gas workers were received and analyzed.
