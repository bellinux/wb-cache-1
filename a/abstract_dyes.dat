Low cost adsorbents prepared from tire rubber waste were used to remove cresol red dye from liquid solution. In order to save energy no agitation or activation were made on the adsorption process. This will naturally slow down the process, but time was compared to cost. The adsorbent weight, particle diameter and duration time were explored to measure {{the effectiveness of these}} parameters on adsorption rate. The best removal reached more than 81 % at adsorbent weight 12 g, particle diameter 2 mm, and duration of 21 days.

The degradation of three textile dyes (Indigo, RBBR and Sulphur Black), and the dye-containing liquid effluent and solid waste from the Municipal Treatment Station, Americana, São Paulo, Brazil, by the cyanobacteria Anabaena flos-aquae UTCC 64, Phormidium autumnale UTEX 1580 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 was evaluated. The dye degradation {{efficiency of the}} cyanobacteria was compared with anaerobic and anaerobic-aerobic systems in terms of discolouration and toxicity evaluations. The discoloration was evaluated by absorption spectroscopy. Toxicity was measured using the organisms Hydra attenuata, the alga Selenastrum capricornutum and lettuce seeds. The three cyanobacteria showed the potential to remediate textile effluent by removing the colour and reducing the toxicity. However, the growth of cyanobacteria on sludge was slow and discoloration was not efficient. The cyanobacteria P. autumnale UTEX 1580 was the only strain that completely degraded the indigo dye. An evaluation of the mutagenicity potential was performed by use of the micronucleus assay using Allium sp. No mutagenicity was observed after the treatment. Two metabolites were produced during the degradation, anthranilic acid and isatin, but toxicity did not increase after the treatment. The cyanobacteria showed the ability to degrade the dyes present in a textile effluent; therefore, {{they can be used}} in a tertiary treatment of effluents with recalcitrant compounds...|$|E

By comparing solutions and films of the mixed components with solutions and films of the antioxidant placed between the dye and UV source, we can show that the effect is not UV screening but is due to some form of intermolecular chemistry. We believe that this effect may account for the high stability of natural dyes in plant tissues, such as the skins of fruit, and may be usable to stabilize natural dyes in foods or textiles, especially if suitable nanoparticle structures can be developed...|$|R

40|$|<b>ABSTRACT</b> Voltage-sensing <b>dyes</b> {{were used}} to examine the {{electrical}} behavior of the T-system under passive recording conditions similar to those commonly used to detect charge movement. These conditions are designed to eliminate all ionic currents and render the T-system potential linear with respect to the command potential applied at the surface membrane. However, we found an unexpected nonlinearity in the relationship between the dye signal from the T-system and the applied clamp potential. An additional voltage- and time-dependent optical signal appears over the same depolarizing range of potentials where charge movement and mechanical activation occur. This nonlinearity is not associated with unblocked ionic currents and cannot be attributed to lack of voltage clamp control of the T-system, which appears to be good under these conditions. We propose that a local electrostatic potential change occurs in the T-system upon depolarization. An electrostatic potential would not be expected to extend beyond molecular distances of the membrane and therefore would be sensed by a charged dye in the membrane but not by the voltage clamp, which responds solely to the potential of the bulk solution. Results obtained with different dyes suggest that the location of the phenomena giving rise to the extra absorbance change is either intramembrane or at the inner surface of the T-system membrane...|$|R

40|$|<b>ABSTRACT</b> Some <b>dyes</b> of the {{methylene}} blue family serve as artificial inactivators of the sodium channels when present inside squid axons at {{a concentration of}} ^- 0. 1 mM. The dyes restore a semblance of inactivation after normal inactivation has been destroyed by pronase. In fibers that inactivate normally, the dyes hasten the decay of sodium current. Many dye-blocked channels conduct transiently on exit of the dye molecule after repolarization to the holding potential. In contrast, normally inactivated channels do not conduct during recovery from inactivation. Kinetic evidence shows that inactivation of a dyeblocked channel is unlikely or impossible, which suggests that dye molecules compete with inactivation "particles " for the same site. In the absence of tetrodotoxin, the dyes do not affect the ON gating current unless the interpulse interval is very short. If sufficient equilibration time is allowed during a pulse, the initial amplitude of the OFF gating current is reduced to near zero. This suggests that a dye molecule in a Na channel completely blocks that channel's gating current, even the fraction that is resistant to normal inactivation. Dyes block IN. and Ie with the same time course. This provides the strongest evidence to date that virtually all of recorded "gating current " is associated with Na channels. Tetrodotoxin greatly slows dissociation of dye molecules from Na channels and reduces gating current during both opening and closing of the channels...|$|R

Therefore, this study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTS) in dye removal of Acid Black 1 (AB 1) from colored wastewater. Methods: This laboratory study was conducted in the batch system and MWCNTS were used as absorbents to remove AB 1 dye. In fact, this study investigated the effect of various factors influencing dye removal, such as adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration, contact time, and pH. Results: The study results showed that pH= 3 is regarded the best pH for the dye removal. The equilibrium time for AB 1 dye absorption on MWCNTS was 60 minutes. As dye concentration increased, dye removal rate decreased. Besides, increasing the amount of adsorbent increased the dye removal efficiency and at the absorbent dose of 600 mg/L, dye removal efficiency was reported 98. 86 % and 94. 62 % for 30 and 50 mg/L dye concentrations respectively. AB 1 dye removal followed Langmuir isotherm and Pseudo-second-order kinetic models.

Aggregates were formed by irreversible heat denaturation of β-galactosidase below and above the protein’s unfolding temperature of 57. 4 ◦ C, and the presence of aggregates in heated solutions was confirmed by static light scattering. Interaction of Nile red with β-galactosidase aggregates led to a shift of the emission maximum (λmax) from 660 to 611 nm, and to an increase of fluorescence intensity. Time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements showed that Nile red detected large aggregates with hydrodynamic radii around 130 nm. By steadystate fluorescence measurements, it was possible to detect 1 nM of denatured and aggregated β-galactosidase in solution. The comparison with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that native β-galactosidase and small aggregates thereof had no substantial effect on the fluorescence of Nile red. Large aggregates were not detected by SEC, be-cause they were excluded from the column. The results with β-galactosidase demonstrate the potential of Nile red for developing complementary analytical methods that overcome the size limitations of SEC, and can detect the formation of large protein aggregates at early stages...|$|R
