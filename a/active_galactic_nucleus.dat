5|$|The {{standard}} model for an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{is based upon}} an accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core region of the galaxy. The radiation from an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus</b> results from the gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the disc. In about 10% of these galaxies, a diametrically opposed pair of energetic jets ejects particles from the galaxy core at velocities close to the speed of light. The mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood.|$|E

5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way, and therefore hosts an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location in the galaxy as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, {{the presence or absence of}} an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life, the metallicity of that location, and other factors. Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{afterglow}} of GRB970508 {{reached a}} peak total luminosity 19.82days after the burst was detected. It then faded {{with a power}} law slope over about 100days. The afterglow eventually disappeared, revealing the burst's host, an actively star-forming dwarf galaxy with an apparent magnitude of V=25.4±0.15. The galaxy was well fitted by an exponential disk with an ellipticity of 0.70±0.07. The redshift of GRB 970508's optical afterglow, z=0.835, agreed with the host galaxy's redshift of z=0.83, suggesting that, unlike previously observed bursts, GRB 970508 may {{have been associated with}} an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade our {{understanding}} of the faint radio sky has undergone a significant change. Our perception of weak radio sources has been deeply changed due to the discovery that the so-called radio-quiet <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei</b> are not, in fact, radio silent, but simply faint as they finally started to be detected. Moreover, a new, unexpected class of radio-loud <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei</b> has been recently discovered, the so-called infrared-faint radio sources. This class of rare objects discovered in deep radio surveys, is emerging as a potentially promising class of sources to pre-select high-redshift powerful radio-loud <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei.</b> In this Thesis, I present my contribution to the ongoing efforts {{to understand the nature of}} both these types of <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The future, planned sub-mJy radio surveys (the ones expected to be delivered by the new facilities like ASKAP and SKA) will sample <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the million, and the above mentioned classes will constitute a relevant fraction of the future radio catalogues. Developing methods to recognise them, and to correctly address their nature, is fundamental to fully exploiting these surveys...|$|R

5|$|In April 1965, the United States Naval Research Laboratory group {{launched}} an Aerobee 150 rocket {{equipped with a}} pair of Geiger counters. This flight discovered seven candidate X-ray sources, including the first extragalactic X-ray source; Virgo X-1 was designated as the first X-ray source detected in Virgo. A later Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range on July 7, 1967, yielded further evidence that the source of Virgo X-1 was the radio galaxy M87. Subsequent X-ray observations by the HEAO 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus</b> of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the X-ray emission.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus</b> at the core of M87.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Milky Way, {{there are}} no bright deep-sky objects for amateur astronomers in Serpens Caput, with nothing else above 10th magnitude. The {{brightest}} is NGC 5962, a spiral galaxy positioned around 28 megaparsecs distant with an apparent magnitude of 11.34. Slightly fainter is NGC 5921, a barred spiral galaxy with a LINER-type <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus</b> situated somewhat closer {{at a distance of}} 21 megaparsecs. A type II supernova was observed in this galaxy in 2001 and was designated SN 2001X. Fainter still are the spirals NGC 5964 and NGC 6118, with the latter being host to the supernova SN 2004dk.|$|E

5|$|Early {{spectral}} {{classification of}} the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers {{indicated that the}} properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts are classified as starburst galaxies, one quarter are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder are classified as low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not significantly different. Recent infrared observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} circumstellar {{habitable}} zone {{was introduced}} in 1953 by Hubertus Strughold and Harlow Shapley and in 1959 by Su-Shu Huang as the region around a star in which an orbiting planet could retain water at its surface. From the 1970s, planetary scientists and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life, including the impact that a nearby supernova may have on life's development. In 1981, Jim Clarke proposed that the apparent lack of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way {{could be explained by}} Seyfert-type outbursts from an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy. In the same year, Wallace Hampton Tucker analyzed galactic habitability in a more general context, but later work superseded his proposals.|$|E
5|$|French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while {{searching for}} objects that would confuse comet hunters. The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, {{it has an}} almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is an active supermassive black hole, which forms the primary component of an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), {{where it has been}} truncated—possibly by an encounter with another galaxy. Between the stars is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars.|$|E
40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei</b> are {{the most}} powerful, {{long-lived}} objects in the Universe. Recent data confirm the theoretical idea that the power source is accretion into a massive black hole.

50|$|In 1964 Salpeter and {{independently}} Yakov B. Zel'dovich {{were the}} first to suggest that accretion discs around massive black holes are responsible for the huge amounts of energy radiated by quasars (which are the brightest <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei).</b> This is currently the most accepted explanation for the physical origin of <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the associated extragalactic relativistic jets.|$|R
5000|$|Quasars (short for [...] "quasi-stellar radio source") {{were one}} of the first {{point-like}} radio sources to be discovered. Quasars' extreme red shift led us to conclude that they are distant <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei.</b> <b>Active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nuclei</b> have jets of charged particles which emit synchrotron radiation. One example is 3C 273, the optically brightest quasar in the sky.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E
25|$|Maffei 1 {{possesses}} a tiny blue nucleus {{at its center}} approximately 1.2pc across. It contains about 29 solar masses of ionized hydrogen. This implies that it has undergone recent star formation. There are no signs of an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (AGN) {{in the center of}} Maffei 1. The X-ray emission from the center is extended and likely comes from a number of stellar sources.|$|E
25|$|NGC 1365 {{is another}} {{barred spiral galaxy}} located at a {{distance}} of 60 million light-years from Earth. Like NGC 1097, it is also a Seyfert galaxy. Its bar is a center of star formation and shows extensions of the spiral arms' dust lanes. The bright nucleus indicates the presence of an <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus</b> - a galaxy with a supermassive black hole at the center, accreting matter from the bar. It is a 10th magnitude galaxy associated with the Fornax Cluster.|$|E

25|$|The European Space Agency's gamma-ray {{observatory}} INTEGRAL {{has observed}} gamma rays {{interacting with the}} nearby giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2, causing X-ray emission from the cloud. This energy was emitted about 350 years earlier by Sgr A*, possibly detectable from Earth around the year 1650. The total luminosity from this outburst (≈1,5 erg/s) {{is estimated to be}} a million times stronger than the current output from Sgr A* and is comparable with a typical <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> In 2011 this conclusion was supported by Japanese astronomers observing the Milky Way's center with the Suzaku satellite.|$|E
25|$|The narrow {{lines are}} {{believed}} to originate from the outer part of the <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> where velocities are lower, while the broad lines originate closer to the black hole. This is confirmed {{by the fact that}} the narrow lines do not vary detectably, which implies that the emitting region is large, contrary to the broad lines which can vary on relatively short timescales. Reverberation mapping is a technique which uses this variability to try to determine the location and morphology of the emitting region. This technique measures the structure and kinematics of the broad line emitting region by observing the changes in the emitted lines as a response to changes in the continuum. The use of reverberation mapping requires the assumption that the continuum originates in a single central source. For 35 AGN, reverberation mapping has been used to calculate the mass of the central black holes and the size of the broad line regions.|$|E
25|$|Although quasars appear faint {{when viewed}} from Earth, they are visible from extreme distances, being the most {{luminous}} objects in the known universe. The brightest quasar in the sky is 3C273 in the constellation of Virgo. It has an average apparent magnitude of 12.8 (bright enough to be seen through a medium-size amateur telescope), but it has an absolute magnitude of −26.7. From {{a distance of about}} 33 light-years, this object would shine in the sky about as brightly as our sun. This quasar's luminosity is, therefore, about 4 trillion (4 × 1012) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total light of giant galaxies like the Milky Way. This assumes the quasar is radiating energy in all directions, but the <b>active</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>nucleus</b> is believed to be radiating preferentially in the direction of its jet. In a universe containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, most of which had active nuclei billions of years ago but only seen today, it is statistically certain that thousands of energy jets should be pointed toward the Earth, some more directly than others. In many cases {{it is likely that the}} brighter the quasar, the more directly its jet is aimed at the Earth.|$|E
