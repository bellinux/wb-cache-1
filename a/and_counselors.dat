5|$|As {{the first}} President, Washington was {{responsible}} for appointing the entire Supreme Court. Due to this, he filled more vacancies on the Court than any other president in American history. In September 1789, Washington nominated John Jay as the first Chief Justice and nominated John Rutledge, William Cushing, James Wilson, John Blair, and Robert Harrison as Associate Justices. All were quickly confirmed by the Senate, but after Harrison declined the appointment, Washington appointed James Iredell in 1790. The Court’s first term began on February 2, 1790, at the Royal Exchange in New York City. However, with no cases on the docket and little pressing business (a few procedural matters decided and 26 attorneys <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> admitted to the federal bar), the term lasted for only eight days.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of the priesthood hierarchy are five auxiliary organizations that fill various roles in the church: Relief Society (a women's organization), the Young Men and Young Women organizations (for adolescents ages 12 to 18), Primary (an organization for children up to age 12), and Sunday School (which provides a variety of Sunday classes for adolescents and adults). Women serve as presidents <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> in the presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary, while men serve as presidents <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> of the Young Men and Sunday School. The church also operates several programs and organizations in the fields of proselytizing, education, and church welfare such as LDS Humanitarian Services. Many of these auxiliaries and programs are coordinated by the Priesthood Correlation Program, which is designed to provide a systematic approach to maintain worldwide consistency, orthodoxy, and control of the church's ordinances, doctrines, organizations, meetings, materials, and other programs and activities.|$|E

25|$|On April 18, 1490, {{after the}} death of Matthias, Emperor Maximilian I sent an offer to the Hungarian nobles in which he {{submitted}} his claims for the throne of Hungary based upon this treaty. He promised protection against Poland, assured the annexation of the Matthias conquests to Hungary, and pledged to keep the Hungarian clerks <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> in their offices. Otherwise, he threatened to use force to gain the submission of the Hungarian Kingdom. To enforce his influence over the royal election, he ordered numerous copies of the Peace Treaty of Wiener Neustadt to be printed and distributed among the elector nobility. This was the first instance in history for using the printing press for propaganda purposes.|$|E
25|$|Every hall {{is led by}} a rector. Rectors {{are made}} up of priests, {{religious}} sisters or brothers, and laypersons trained in ministry and/or education. They are full-time, live-in professionals who serve as pastoral leaders, chief administrators, community builders and university resources to their residents. Rectors often coordinate with professors, academic advisors, <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> to look after students and guide their formation into adulthood. They select, hire, train, and supervise hall staff: resident advisors (only chosen from the seniors) and assistant rectors (graduate students). Many residence halls also have at least one priest or lay faculty member in residence. Every hall has its own chapel and liturgical schedule with masses celebrated multiple times per week during the academic year.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all other}} {{students}}, {{students with disabilities}} experience sexual harassment in school as both victims and perpetrators. Some disabilities could cause a lack of control over impulses, a lack of awareness {{of the effects of}} their words and actions, and a lack of social skills needed to avoid sexually harassing behavior. In some circumstances, a student with disabilities could exhibit a behavior that would constitute sexual harassment without intentionally trying to be malicious or inappropriate. In these cases, where a disability could lead to sexually harassing behaviors, positive behavior intervention plans are often put into place by a team often including parents, school administrators, general education teachers, special education teachers, school psychologists, <b>and</b> <b>counselors.</b> These types of plans could also be made during Individualized Education Programmeetings regarding the student.|$|E
25|$|Islamisation in {{the region}} {{surrounding}} Malacca gradually intensified between the 15th and 16th centuries through study centres in Upeh, the district on the north bank of the Malacca River. Islam spread from Malacca to Jambi, Kampar, Bengkalis, Siak, Aru and the Karimun Islands in Sumatra, {{throughout much of the}} Malay peninsula, Java and even Philippines. The Malay Annals even reveals that the courts of Malacca and Pasai posed theological questions and problems to one another. Of the so-called Wali Sanga ('nine saints') responsible in spreading Islam on Java, at least two, Sunan Bonang and Sunan Kalijaga, are said to have studied in Malacca. The Portuguese apothecary and chronicler at the time of Malacca's fall, Tome Pires, in his Suma Oriental mentions that the rulers of Kampar and Indragiri on the east coast of Sumatra converted to Islam as a result of Sultan Muzaffar Shah's influence and went on to study the religion in Malacca. The Malay Annals also mentions a number of scholars who served at the Malacca royal court as teachers <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> to the various Sultans. Maulana Abu Bakar served in the court of Sultan Mansur Shah and introduced the Kitab Darul Manzum, a theological text translated from the work of an Arab scholar in Mecca. A scholar by the name of Maulana Kadi Sardar Johan served as a religious teacher to both Sultan Mahmud Shah and his son. In addition to Kitab Darul Manzum, the Malay Annals also mentions the Kitab al-luma' fi tasawwuf ('Book of Flashes'), a 10th-century treatise on Sufism by Abu Nasr al-Sarraj.|$|E
500|$|The program {{usually has}} 40–50 first-year students, 15 {{advanced}} students, and 15 counselors. Students are admitted by application—which includes {{a set of}} mathematical questions—or by showing [...] "a great eagerness to learn". First-year students meet daily for lectures in elementary number theory and thrice weekly for problem seminars. They are encouraged to think like scientists and devise their own proofs and conjectures to the problems posed, which occupies most of their free time. Ross designed the daily problem sets, and many questions contain his signature directions: [...] "Prove or disprove and salvage if possible." [...] Successful {{students are asked to}} return as students <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> in future summers. Returning students revisit the daily lectures and help first-years with their questions. They also can take advanced courses such as combinatorics and graduate seminars. Student problem sets are graded daily by the live-in counselors.|$|E

2500|$|This abuse {{proved to}} be a {{catalyst}} for anti-arena faculty in the school. Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell filed a union grievance demanding an end to class imbalances. Citing these imbalances, they called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, one which promotes inequities and abuses, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> (the system tends to produce [...] "incomplete" [...] schedules which must be dealt with after the scheduling period).|$|E
2500|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{has seen}} rapid {{growth and development}} as a profession in the last twenty years. School psychology began {{with the concept of}} intelligence testing leading to provisions for special education students, who could not follow the regular classroom curriculum {{in the early part of}} the 20th century. However, [...] "school psychology" [...] itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields. Educational psychologists are working side by side with psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, speech and language therapists, <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> in attempt to understand the questions being raised when combining behavioral, cognitive, and social psychology in the classroom setting.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1920s to the 1930s, school {{counseling}} [...] grew {{because of the}} rise of progressive education in schools. This movement emphasized personal, social, moral development. Many schools reacted to this movement as anti-educational, saying that schools should teach only the fundamentals of education. This, combined with the economic hardship of the Great Depression, led to a decline in {{school counseling}}. In the 1940s, psychologists <b>and</b> <b>counselors</b> selected, recruited, and trained military personnel. This propelled the school counseling movement in schools by providing ways to test students and meet their needs. Schools accepted these military tests openly. Also, Carl Rogers' emphasis on helping relationships and a move away from directive [...] "guidance" [...] to nondirective or person-centered [...] "counseling" [...] influenced the profession of school counseling.|$|E
