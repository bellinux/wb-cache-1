5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American <b>autobiography.</b> Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the <b>autobiography</b> by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose <b>autobiography</b> to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American <b>autobiography</b> as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} the social studies <b>autobiographies</b> of 46 students compiled over a 15 month period. Two major questions were addressed: (1) what motivational patterns are revealed in these <b>autobiographies</b> and (2) what differences and similarities exist in the <b>autobiographies</b> of students seeking alternative and traditional certification. Both groups noted the influence of family and other significant adults, and the influence of social studies teachers, both K- 12 and postsecondary, in their decisions to pursue social studies teaching careers. There were more similarities than differences between the two groups. The <b>autobiographies</b> echoed influences that are found in the literature, and reveal that active learning opportunities and inspiring teachers are important in motivating students to pursue careers in social studies education...|$|R
