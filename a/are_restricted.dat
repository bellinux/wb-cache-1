5|$|As a group, {{the house}} martins cannot easily be {{confused}} with any other swallows. Four species of the genus Tachycineta have white rumps and underparts, but they have bright metallic green or blue-green upperparts, longer tails, and <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to Central and South America. The variable plumages of the South Asian species and a confused taxonomic history has left their distribution ranges in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Coccothrinax is a genus of fan palms found {{throughout}} the Caribbean and in adjacent parts of southern Florida and Mexico. Most species are small to medium-sized, with maximum heights between 5 and 15 metres (17 and 49ft). Only one of the 53 species, C. readii, is absent from the insular Caribbean. Two species, C. argentata and C. barbadensis, are widespread, {{while most of the}} others <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to Cuba and Hispaniola.|$|E

5|$|Players {{select one}} of several {{characters}} from the DC Universe to engage in combat, aiming to knock out their opponent. The game {{is set in a}} 2.5D environment; while character models and backgrounds are rendered in three-dimensional graphics, the characters <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to fight within a two-dimensional space. Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, including its controls, game mechanics, narrative-driven campaign, and online functionality.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> {{to higher}} localities. It does not occur, however, {{on the upper}} slopes of the higher peaks, {{but it seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to the hygrophytic {{vegetation}} zone (cloud forest).|$|R

For employment, the analyses <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to respondents not in full-time study. For unemployment, the analyses <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to respondents in the labour force.|$|R
5|$|Reaction with excess {{fluorine}} {{produces the}} stable white tetrafluoride CeF4; the other tetrahalides are not known. Of the dihalides, only the bronze diiodide CeI2 is known; like the diiodides of lanthanum, praseodymium, and gadolinium, {{this is a}} cerium(III) electride compound. True cerium(II) compounds <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to a few unusual organocerium complexes.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} batches of double deckers have {{a height of}} , too tall to meet many height {{standards}} set by the provincial Ministry of Transportation.

5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, <b>restricted</b> distributions; this <b>is</b> most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|R

5|$|Although its {{evolutionary}} history—what the forerunner to {{the species}} {{was and how}} the close relatives branched off—is not well understood, the painted turtle is common in the fossil record. The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15million years ago. Fossils from 15million to about 5million years ago <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Airport is {{approximately}} 10miles (15km) away. The nearest major road is the A368, which {{runs along the}} southern edge of the lake and provides access from Bath and Weston super Mare. The A37 and A38 are slightly further away, providing access from Bristol. Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; some of these <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to those with fishing permits.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, the Adult Accompaniment {{rating was}} {{introduced}} which allowed films {{to be classified}} so that children under 14 <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> unless escorted by an adult. The classification was developed to open films of social significance to younger audiences which might otherwise have <b>been</b> <b>restricted.</b> In developing the new classification, provincial officials noted that the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> to adults only, although the film {{was based on a}} book that was studied by many high school students.|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of live (rose Bengal-stained) and dead infaunal foraminifera have been document-ed in short cores taken at four locations representing {{a narrow range}} of salinity settings in the mangrove swamps of the Setiu wetland, Terengganu, peninsular Malaysia. Cores were taken at mud-rich sites, two in the mid-swamp and two in the high swamp, from mainland-fringing mangrove swamps charac-terized by generally sandy substrates. Twenty-four taxa were recorded as live. Of these, two <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to the mid-swamp, eight <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to the high swamp, seven <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to shallow-infaunal depths (0 – 16 cm), and three <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to deep-infaunal depths (. 16 cm). Thirteen taxa occurred both shallow and deep infaunally and 13 occurred at both high- and mid-swamp sites. Only six taxa...|$|R
5|$|Buses, {{which are}} the most {{commonly}} used mode of transport, are run by government agencies and private operators. Kolkata is the only Indian city with a tram network, which is operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company. The slow-moving tram services <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to certain areas of the city. Water-logging, caused by heavy rains that fall during the summer monsoon, can interrupt transportation networks. Hired public conveyances include auto rickshaws, which often ply specific routes, and yellow metered taxis. Almost all of Kolkata's taxis are antiquated Hindustan Ambassadors by make; newer air-conditioned radio taxis are also in service. In parts of the city, cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled rickshaws are patronised by the public for short trips.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
