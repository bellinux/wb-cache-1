5|$|Chronicles mention more castes {{than the}} four {{commonly}} known castes in the Hindu social system, some <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> castes. One traveller's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudras. The Zakaya or Lahud caste consisted of communities specialising in dance and acrobatics. People in the professions of sailing, hunting, weaving, cobblery, basket making and fishing belonged to specific castes or subcastes. The Antyajas caste provided many menial {{services to the}} wealthy. Brahmins enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society; only those Kshatriyas in the Sat-Kshatriya sub-caste (noble Kshatriyas) were higher in status.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may have <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> fathers, each contributing sperm to {{a portion of}} the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E

5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized with <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E

Oxford, on the other hand, were paired with Wanderers, who had won the competition in both its first two seasons and never lost an FA Cup match. They had defeated the Engineers in the 1872 final and Oxford in the 1873 final. The first match finished in a 1–1 draw, necessitating a replay which Oxford won 1–0 to end Wanderers' grip on the competition.|$|E

In 2012 Sukarkhet Soron was declared officially by the government of Uttar Pradesh as the birthplace of Tulsi Das. His parents were Hulsi and Atmaram Dubey. Most sources identify him as a Saryupareen Brahmin of the Parashar Gotra (lineage), although some sources claim he was a Kanyakubja or Sanadhya Brahmin.|$|E

5|$|Donen briefly {{returned}} to the musical genre in 1958 with Damn Yankees!, based on George Abbott's Broadway hit. He again co-directed with Abbott in the same hands-off collaboration as their first film. Like The Pajama Game the film includes music by Adler and Ross and choreography by Fosse. It starred Tab Hunter, Gwen Verdon, and Ray Walston. Damn Yankees! is an adaptation of the Faust legend about {{a fan of the}} baseball team the Washington Senators who mentions that he would sell his soul to give the losing team a good hitter. Walston plays the Brooks Brothers-attired Devil who grants the fan his wish and transforms him into the muscular young hitter Joe Hardy (Hunter). Donen was able to shoot three real Senator-Yankee games on location with <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> hidden cameras. The low-budget film was a moderate financial success and received good reviews. It was also Donen's last musical film for many years.|$|E
5|$|Following Charan Singh's resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to {{look into}} the {{possibility}} of forming an alternate government. Reddy, convinced {{that they would not be}} able to form one, accepted Singh's advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn in after the election. Reddy's decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> ordinances on a broad range of matters from effecting changes in company law, providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the ordinances arguing that such momentous changes could not be made by a caretaker government.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{the colour}} of a tile is {{understood}} {{as part of the}} tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four-colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{evidence}} for the effectiveness of large-scale vaccination campaigns is well established. Vaccination campaigns helped eradicate smallpox, which once killed <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> one in <b>seven</b> children in Europe, and have nearly eradicated polio. As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, {{a major cause of}} bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988. It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections.|$|R
50|$|Land use {{along the}} stream has been {{traditionally}} agricultural, though spreading urbanization {{has affected the}} stream with erosion problems. Though extremely scenic, the Conestoga River is drastically impaired from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, mostly runoff from animal waste and excessive commercial fertilizer. Other pollution sources are sediments from intense cropping, development, and urban runoff. The stream flows through a pastoral landscape farmed extensively by Pennsylvania German farmers and along the eastern and southern {{outskirts of the city}} of Lancaster. Many covered bridges span its banks. Northeast of Lancaster city are many Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite farms; horse and carriage traffic frequents local roads. Many small dams impound its waters, most of them built long ago to power mills or generate electricity. Most dams are in disrepair and have been abandoned, though there is an active movement to remove <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>Seven</b> were removed between 1996 and 1999.|$|R
5|$|The storm's effects also {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} over 33,000cattleheads and inflicted a heavy blow to the country's November–December rice harvest. Crop damage occurred across 174,000hectares (430,000acres) of land in Bagerhat, Bhola, Khulna, and Satkhira districts as well as Cox's Bazar. The total gross weight of crop losses was estimated at 200,000tonnes (220,000tons), accounting for 70%of Bangladeshi crops that were ready for harvest. Extensive damage to infrastructure was reported across the nation. Most mud and straw houses and tin shed offices and schools were destroyed due to the storm. Telecommunications and electrical supplies were disrupted by the storm in at least sixteen towns and four coastal districts. In the capital city of Dhaka, debris and fallen trees caused by winds of up to 120km/h (75mph) {{resulted in}} both power outages and paralyzed traffic. The power outages also disrupted the city's distribution of water. In Shyamnagar Upazila, all mud and straw-constructed homes were destroyed. Overall, an official estimates suggested 50,000homes were destroyed across the country. However, independent investigations were more aggressive in their estimates, suggesting that over a million homes accounting for 60–80% of homes in coastal Bangladesh were destroyed, displacing <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> million people.|$|E

25|$|Valved brass {{instruments}} use {{a set of}} valves (typically three or four but <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> or more in some cases) operated by the player's fingers that introduce additional tubing, or crooks, into the instrument, changing its overall length. This family includes all of the modern {{brass instruments}} except the trombone: the trumpet, horn (also called French horn), euphonium, and tuba, {{as well as the}} cornet, flugelhorn, tenor horn (alto horn), baritone horn, sousaphone, and the mellophone. As valved instruments are predominant among the brasses today, a more thorough discussion of their workings can be found below. The valves are usually piston valves, but can be rotary valves; the latter are the norm for the horn (except in France) and are also common on the tuba.|$|E

25|$|Divergence among dialects of Malayalam embrace {{almost all}} aspects of {{language}} such as phonetics, phonology, grammar and vocabulary. Differences between any two given dialects can be quantified {{in terms of the}} presence or absence of specific units at each level of the language. To cite a single example of language variation along the geographical parameter, it may be noted that there are <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> seventy <b>seven</b> different expressions employed by the Ezhavas and spread over various geographical points just to refer to a single item, namely, the flower bunch of coconut. 'Kola' is the expression attested in most of the panchayats in the Palakkad, Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts of Kerala, whereas 'kolachil' occurs most predominantly in Kannur and Kochi and 'klannil' in Alappuzha and Kollam. 'Kozhinnul' and 'kulannilu' are the forms most common in Trissur Idukki and Kottayam respectively. In addition to these forms most widely spread among the areas specified above, there are dozens of other forms such as 'kotumpu' (Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram), 'katirpu' (Kottayam), krali (Pathanamthitta), pattachi, gnannil (Kollam), 'pochata' (Palakkad) etc. referring to the same item.|$|R

It has a semi-prehensile tail, needle sharp teeth and a long snout. The name derives from an Aboriginal word for tiny mythological beings that are hairy, have short feet and only come out at night.Ningauis use their sharp teeth to kill their insect prey by swiftly biting them around the head.

25|$|The cavalry was conscripted in {{the same}} way as in the old system, with each rusthåll {{providing}} a horse and horseman.

This was mainly done because it was easier to replace a fallen horseman than replace the master of the estate. Usually, the rusthåll was made up of only one estate, and possibly another supporting farmer. In exceptional cases, one rusthåll could support <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> horsemen.|$|E
25|$|Transmembrane receptors are {{typically}} classified {{based on their}} tertiary (three-dimensional) structure. But, if the three-dimensional structure is yet undiscovered, then they can be classified based on experimentally verifiable membrane topology. The simplest polypeptide chains are found to cross the lipid bilayer once; while others, such as the G-protein coupled receptors, cross <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> times. There are various kinds, such as glycoprotein and lipoprotein. Hundreds of different receptors are known and many more {{have yet to be}} studied. Many membrane receptors include transmembrane proteins. Each cell membrane can have several kinds of membrane receptor, in varying surface distribution. A specific receptor may also be differently distributed on different membrane surfaces, depending on the membrane sort and cell function. Since receptors usually cluster on the membrane surface, the placement of every receptor on each membrane surface is heterogeneous.|$|E
25|$|Modern ploughs {{are usually}} {{multiple}} reversible ploughs, {{mounted on a}} tractor via a three-point linkage. These commonly have between two and <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>seven</b> mouldboards– and semi-mounted ploughs (the lifting of which is supplemented by a wheel about halfway along their length) can {{have as many as}} eighteen mouldboards. The hydraulic system of the tractor is used to lift and reverse the implement, as well as to adjust furrow width and depth. The ploughman still has to set the draughting linkage from the tractor so that the plough is carried at the proper angle in the soil. This angle and depth can be controlled automatically by modern tractors. As a complement to the rear plough a two or three mouldboards-plough can be mounted {{on the front of the}} tractor if it is equipped with front three-point linkage.|$|E
