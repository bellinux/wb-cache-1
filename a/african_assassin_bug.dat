40|$|The prey choice {{behavior}} and predatory strategies of two East <b>African</b> <b>assassin</b> <b>bugs,</b> Scipinnia repax (St√§l 1961) and Nagusta sp. (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), were investigated {{in the field}} and the laboratory. Both of these species are from the subfamily Harpactorinae and specialize in eating spiders. They prey especially often on social jumping spiders (Salticidae) that build nest complexes (nests connected by silk) in vegetation near the shoreline of Lake Victoria. Both reduviid species associate with these nest complexes and prey on the resident salticids. Nagusta sp., but not S. repax, form groups on nest complexes with 2 - 3 individuals of Nagusta sometimes feeding together on a single salticid. In addition to social salticids, Nagusta sp. preys on Portia africana, an araneophagic salticid that often invades the same nest complexes. S. repax preys on salticid eggs and also on Nagusta. Although they avoid ants, Nagusta and especially S. repax prey on ant-mimicking salticids, suggesting that sensory modalities other than vision play a dominant role in prey detection...|$|R

50|$|<b>Assassin</b> <b>bugs,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} kissing bugs, {{are one of}} the largest and morphologically diverse families of true bugs feeding on crickets, caterpillars and other insects. Some <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> species are bloodsucking parasites of mammals, even feed on humans. They can be commonly found throughout most of the world and their size varies from a few millimeters to as much as 3 or 4 centimeters. The toxic saliva of the predatory <b>assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> contains a complex mixture of small and large peptides for diverse uses such as immobilizing and pre-digesting their prey, as well as defense against competitors and predators. <b>Assassin</b> <b>bug</b> toxins are small peptides with disulfide connectivity that target ion channels. They are relatively homologous to the calcium channel blockers omega-conotoxins from marine cone snails and belong to the four-loop cysteine scaffold structural class.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{developed}} {{in order to determine}} whether the selected species most commonly kept feeding insects affect fertility in captive bred <b>assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> Platymeris biguttatus. Used feeding insects were Blaptica dubia roaches, Acheta domestica crickets and larvae of Tenebrio molitor bugs. The reason of using <b>assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> Platymeris biguttatus was their popularity among breeders, their easy care needs and their superior fertility. <b>Assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> were kept in an air conditioned room with a constant temperature conditions and light regime. It has been shown that the given diet has no effect on fertility in this kind of bugs, also that breeding in groups has negative impact on fertility of this <b>assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> species. The results of this study could demonstrate the importance of proper feeding in keeping these bugs and help breeders to have better results...|$|R
