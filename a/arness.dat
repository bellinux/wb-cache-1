5000|$|Because of <b>Arness's</b> large (6' 7") {{physical}} presence, most of Matt's adversaries seemed overmatched {{unless there}} were several of them.

On a few occasions, he even proved himself capable of defeating burly bare-knuckle prize fighters, and he once noted {{that he had done}} a bit of boxing while serving in the Army. On television, Matt tended to be a man of fewer words, which can largely be attributed to the fundamental fact that television is a visual medium. Since the audience can see what is happening, there is less need to describe surroundings or events through the use of dialog. <b>Arness's</b> Matt thus naturally evolved into a [...] "strong, silent" [...] type of character who tended to act rather than talk at length about possible courses of action.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Energy {{has always}} been a major {{necessity}} for the day-to-day human life. For the socio-economic development, continuous supply of sufficient energy is very important. As a developing country, Bangladesh is finding it difficult in recent times to produce and transmit enough energy to fulfill the ever-growing demand. The natural resources are limited and are being exhausted at such an alarming rate, it is feared that natural gas, which is the main energy source of Bangladesh will be depleted by the year 2020. So it is now the best time to find alternative energy sources if the inevitable energy crisis is to be avoided. Renewable energy can be the solution to this problem as the climate and infrastructure of the country is very much favorable for h <b>arnessing</b> renewable energy. In this paper we have tried to analyze the prospect of using renewable energy as a solution for the current energy crisis in Bangladesh. We have talked about different forms of renewable energy, their prospect in Bangladesh and how far it can contribute to solve the problem...|$|R
