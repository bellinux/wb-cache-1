5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after the street on which it is located, and was the {{terminus}} of the short Piccadilly line branch from Holborn that was <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merger of two railway schemes. The station building {{is close to the}} Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near Aldwych. During its lifetime, the branch {{was the subject of a}} number of unrealised extension proposals that would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo.|$|E

The date's accuracy was confirmed by Liang's study of the building which matched with known information about Tang buildings.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey was {{a patron}} of scholarship, and {{employed}} scholars throughout his life, one of whom, Honorius of Kent, Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond. Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter {{and wrote a}} legal work on canon law. The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed {{into the hands of}} Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription.

5|$|The Shogunate took major steps {{towards the}} {{construction}} of a modern and powerful military: a navy with a core of eight steam warships had been built over several years and was already the strongest in Asia. In 1865, Japan's first modern naval arsenal was built in Yokosuka by the French engineer Léonce Verny. In January 1867, a French military mission arrived to reorganize the shogunal army and create the Denshūtai elite force, and an order was placed with the United States to buy the French-built ironclad warship CSS Stonewall, <b>a</b> <b>relic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Civil War. Due to the Western powers' declared neutrality, the Americans refused to release the ship, but once neutrality was lifted, the imperial faction obtained the vessel and employed it in engagements in Hakodate under the name Kōtetsu ("Ironclad").|$|E

In 1021, when Vaspurakan fell to Byzantine rule, Senekerim-Hovhannes took the relic to Sebastia, where the {{following}} year his son Atom founded the Surb Nshan Monastery. In 1025, following his death, Senekerim-Hovhannes was buried at Varagavank and the True Cross was returned to the monastery. Fearing an attack by Muslims, Varagavank Father Ghukas took the True Cross in 1237 to the Tavush region of northeastern Armenia. There he settled in the Anapat monastery, which was renamed Nor Varagavank. In 1318, the Mongols invaded the region and ransacked the monastery. All the churches were destroyed except St. Hovhannes, which had an iron door and was where the monks hid. Between 1320 and the 1350s, the monastery was completely restored.|$|E

2500|$|During <b>the</b> centuries <b>of</b> Roman rule, <b>the</b> Raeti became {{predominantly}} Latin-speakers.

However, a Raetian origin for Romansch is uncertain, as Rhaeto-Romance languages appear most closely related to the Gallo-Romance group, strengthening the argument that the Raeti had adopted Celtic speech before Latinisation.|$|R
