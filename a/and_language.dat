5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture <b>and</b> <b>language</b> arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of {{cultural}} diffusion.

5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures <b>and</b> <b>language</b> acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|Beonna's rule {{coincided with}} the anointing of Pippin III as king of the Franks after 742 and the {{subsequent}} disempowerment of the Merovingian dynasty, and also with the martyrdom of Saint Boniface and his followers in Frisia in 754. Two coins use a runic 'a' in the name Beonna; the runic 'a' has only been found elsewhere in Frisia, suggesting that there were both trading <b>and</b> <b>language</b> links between Frisia and East Anglia during the 8th century.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT.

Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
