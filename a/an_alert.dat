5|$|The first caustic {{event was}} {{detected}} by the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) on July 24, 2009. <b>An</b> <b>alert</b> was issued, which attracted many to cover the caustic event; as such, {{the end of the}} first caustic event was well-documented. The microlensing event's second caustic event was seven days later, an unusually long middle period for planetary microlensing events. <b>An</b> <b>alert</b> brought three different telescopes at SAAO and telescopes at ten different observatories to focus on the event.|$|E
5|$|In International elite competition, {{electronically}} tethered starting blocks {{sense the}} reaction {{time of the}} athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>Alert</b> Force was {{established}} at Loring AFB in October 1957. The wing began supporting the force with six B-52s in January 1958. In {{response to a}} conflict in Lebanon, the Alert Force was expanded to include the entire bombardment wing in July 1958, when the SAC bomber force went to full alert status. SAC's overall goal was achieved in 1960.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effectiveness of preceding synthesized voice warning mes-sages with <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> cue as <b>a</b> function {{of the amount of}} information presented by the voice synthesizer and the workload level in the primary task. Subjects performed a simplified air traffic control task in which they were required to monitor two visual displays and to enter commands via a standard keyboard. Emergency messages were always presented by phoneme-based synthesized speech. However, the presence of <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> cue (light and tone) prior to emergency messages and the presentation mode of noncritical messages (visual or auditory) were varied experimentally. When synthesized speech was used only for emergency messages, the presence of <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> cue lengthened the response time to the message. However, when computer-generated speech was used for multiple functions, more emergency messages were detected when <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> cue was used...|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>alert</b> {{was issued}} for the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa and Baja California Sur; army and navy units were on standby {{in case of}} an emergency. Roughly 50,000 people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters and thousands of others sought refuge in public buildings, such as schools and churches. Across La Paz, officials evacuated 3,000 families from hurricane-prone areas. In the towns of Altata and Guamúchil alone, army officials evacuated 5,000 coastal residents.|$|E
5|$|At 04:00 on {{the morning}} of 2 January, Viet Cong scouts around the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi {{reported}} hearing the sounds of truck and boat engines, so Hoang issued <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> order which prompted his troops to pick up their weapons and hurry to their foxholes. Most of the women, children, and old men in both hamlets fled and hid in the nearby swamps as soon as the order was issued.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs are diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), whereas the leopards, tigers, and lions are nocturnal (active mainly at night); diurnality allows better {{observation}} and {{monitoring of the}} animal. Hunting is the major activity throughout the day; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk, though males and juveniles often roam around at night. The cheetah is <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> animal; individuals often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations. Even while resting, they take turns at keeping a lookout.|$|E
50|$|One type of manhunt {{for which}} public {{participation}} is normally sought is <b>an</b> AMBER <b>Alert.</b> In <b>an</b> Amber <b>Alert,</b> {{the main purpose}} of the mission is to rescue the victim, ahead of the capture of the suspect. The public is usually given notice of <b>an</b> Amber <b>Alert</b> through additional forms of media, including highway overhead signs and text messaging.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{devised a}} system which {{continuously}} analyzes data exported from a Clinical Information System for the occurrence of exceptional or life-threatening clinical events. A configurable rule-based system was created to detect and act on such events. When detected, the system formats <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> message, dials <b>a</b> modem and transmits the message to a commercial satellite relay system. Ennunciated by <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> beep and blinking LED on a PCMCIA receiver card, the alert message appears on the screen of a Palmtop Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) carried by designated clinicians...|$|R
40|$|Users {{of modern}} digital {{libraries}} (DLs) can keep themselves up-to-date by searching and browsing their favorite collec-tions, or more conveniently by resorting to <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> ser-vice. The alerting service notifies its clients about new or changed documents. Proprietary and mediating alerting ser-vices fail to fluidly integrate information from differing col-lections. So far, no sophisticated {{service has been}} proposed that is integrated with the digital library software and cov-ers heterogeneous and distributed collections. This paper analyses the conceptual requirements of this much-sought after service for digital libraries. We demonstrate that the differing concepts of digital libraries and its underlying tech-nical design has extensive influence (a) the expectations, needs and interests of users regarding <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> service, and (b) on the technical possibilities of {{the implementation of the}} service. Our findings will show that the range of is-sues surrounding alerting services for digital libraries, their design and use is greater than one may anticipate. We also show that, conversely, the requirements for <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> ser-vice have considerable impact on the concepts of DL design. Our findings should be of interest for librarians as well as system designers. We highlight and discuss the far-reaching implications for the design of, and interaction with, libraries. This paper discusses the lessons learned from building such <b>a</b> distributed <b>alerting</b> service. We present our prototype im-plementation as a proof-of-concept for <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> service for open DL software.

5|$|During September and October 2010, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual {{increases}} in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at Nevado del Ruiz prompted <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> level of Yellow on October 1. Chemical {{analysis of the}} volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months a smattering of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight {{times as many as}} had been recorded from 2009–2010. 2010 marked the beginning of {{increases in}} sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a dramatic increase in earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E

5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with <b>an</b> <b>alert,</b> keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|The Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă {{had been}} an old enemy of Michael, having incited Andrew Báthory to send Michael the {{ultimatum}} demanding his abdication. His brother, Simion Movilă, claimed the Wallachian throne for himself and had used the title of Voivode since 1595. Aware of the threat the Movilăs represented, Michael had created the Banate of Buzău and Brăila in July 1598 and the new ban was charged of keeping <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> eye on Moldavian, Tatar and Cossack moves, although Michael had been planning a Moldavian campaign for several years.|$|E

5|$|The Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 was {{approved}} by the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent on December 9, 2010 and passed by the House of Representatives by 379 to 30 on December 16, 2010. The act does not stipulate a specific speed for the simulated noise but requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> sound that allows blind and other pedestrians to reasonably detect a nearby electric or hybrid vehicle, and the ruling must be finalized within eighteen months. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> posture.|$|E
5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur.

5|$|By August 1942, {{preparations}} were begun {{for a major}} operation, Jubilee, at Dieppe. The Dieppe raid {{took place}} on 19 August 1942. Johnson took off at 07:40 in Spitfire VB. EP254, DW-B. Running into around 50 Bf 109s and Fw 190s in fours, pairs and singly. In a climbing attack Johnson shot down one Fw 190 which crashed into the sea and shared {{in the destruction of}} a Bf 109F. While heading back to base, Johnson attacked <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> Fw 190 which met his attack head on. The dogfight descended from 8,000 to zero feet. Flying over Dieppe, Johnson dived towards a destroyer in the hope its fire would drive off the Fw 190, now on his tail. The move worked and Johnson landed back at RAF West Malling at 09:20. For the remainder of the year, the squadron was moved to RAF Castletown in September 1942 to protect the Royal Navy fleet at Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave <b>an</b> <b>alert</b> outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) {{to ensure}} {{coverage}} of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP {{by the end}} of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving <b>an</b> <b>alert,</b> as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.|$|E
