5|$|Following Spies' speech, {{the crowd}} was {{addressed}} by Parsons, the Alabama-born editor of the radical English-language weekly The Alarm. The crowd was so calm that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who had stopped by to watch, walked home early. Parsons spoke for <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before standing down {{in favor of the}} last speaker of the evening, the British socialist Samuel Fielden, who delivered a brief ten-minute address. Many of the crowd had already left as the weather was deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Saving Private Ryan: Music {{from the}} Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album for the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan, {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg. The album {{was produced by}} composer John Williams and distributed by DreamWorks Records. Recorded in Symphony Hall, Boston, Massachusetts, the scores were performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, {{with two of the}} ten compositions featuring vocals from the Tanglewood Festival Chorus. The soundtrack runs for <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> while the film itself lasts over two hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 16:56:54 BRT at FL370, {{and it was}} confirmed that neither Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see the oncoming traffic visually or initiate any evasive action prior to the collision. While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa Police arrested four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11. On February 10 he had a dispute with a gas station clerk about paying for gas {{and said he had}} to get something in the trunk of his car. The clerk called the police, the police arrested Williams with carrying a pistol without a license, but Williams was released later that day on a $500 bond. Later that night around 12:30a.m., Williams attacked an Alabama student with Hayes and Pettway and they stole the student's backpack. In a separate incident <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> later, Williams attacked another student while Hayes and Pettway waited in a car. Later Williams used one of the students' credit cards. Calloway was also arrested after he used a victim's student debit card with knowledge it was stolen. Following the arrests, Alabama suspended all four from the football team. Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E
5|$|The Duke's train had {{run more}} slowly through {{populated}} areas {{owing to the}} cheering crowds, {{and by the time}} it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, Phoenix and North Star, had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling for <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> and the water stop at Parkside was the only scheduled stop on the journey. Although it was beginning to drizzle, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to stretch their legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, Charles Arbuthnot, Prince Esterházy, the Earl of Wilton, L founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles {{on either side of the}} railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.|$|E
5|$|The November 2008 Carolinas tornado {{outbreak}} was a {{brief but}} deadly tornado outbreak which began shortly after midnight (local time), while many people were sleeping. Most of the eight tornadoes that touched down were produced by two supercell thunderstorms over North Carolina. At 12:25a.m. EST, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina as the risk of tornadoes increased. Not long after, the first tornado of the outbreak, an EF2, touched down in South Carolina. <b>Almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> later, the second tornado touched down in Robeson County, North Carolina. Three other minor tornadoes, two EF0 and an EF1, touched down {{over the next two}} hours. Around 3:10a.m. EST, the first of two killer tornadoes touched down near Kenly, North Carolina. The EF2 tornado destroyed a few homes and damaged several others. Roughly 20 minutes later, an EF3 tornado touched down in Wilson County. This tornado killed one person and injured a few others after destroying several homes. Total damages from the outbreak amounted to $2.5million, about half of which was a result of the EF3 tornado.|$|E

25|$|An ominous sign {{of things}} to come {{occurred}} on the afternoon of 8 February, when Melbourne was enveloped by a giant dust storm. The dust cloud was over 300 metres high and 500 kilometres long and was composed of an estimated 50,000 tonnes of topsoil from the drought-ravaged Wimmera and Mallee areas of north-west Victoria. Leading a dry cool change and preceded by record temperatures, the dust storm cut visibility in Melbourne to 100 metres, creating near darkness for <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hedgepeth left Rosario there {{briefly and}} {{returned}} around 11:30, {{after which they}} returned to their apartment together, arriving there around midnight. A half-hour later they left again, heading for Thrill, a nightclub in downtown Chapel Hill which admitted customers under the legal drinking age of 21 to dance. The two young women arrived at Thrill around 12:40 a.m. After <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{and a half of}} dancing, Rosario told police later that she was having an upset stomach and wanted to leave. Security cameras at the club show she and Hedgepeth leaving at 2:06 a.m.; it is the last visual record of her presence anywhere before the killing.|$|E

25|$|In June 1901, Hampshire {{were facing}} almost certain defeat against Lancashire at Aigburth, Liverpool. Hampshire were bowled {{out in the}} first innings for only 106, and Lancashire replied with 413–8 declared. When Hampshire opened the second innings, few people thought that Lancashire would need to bat again. J. G. Greig opened the batting and the score had reached 374, with one wicket {{remaining}} and Hampshire still seemingly heading for defeat. Robson came to the wicket as the last batsman in and he and Greig put on an unlikely 113 for the tenth wicket (Robson 52); Greig's innings was 249*. Lancashire's eventual target was 181 in 140 minutes; they closed at 111 for 5, rain having cut short play by <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
25|$|From June 2001, NSB {{introduced}} additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, {{giving a}} half-hour headway. NSB introduced their Class 93 locomotives in 2001: starting on 7 January {{they were used}} on the Salten Commuter Rail, which ran a higher frequency of departures between Rognan and Bodø. This service has become a success. This {{was not the case}} when the same trains were put in as replacements on the intercity trains. Although allowing for <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> faster travel, they had fewer amenities and little space. Passengers protested, and after trials from 2003, Di 4s with carriages were reintroduced during the summers from 2003 and all year from 2007. From 2006 the sleeper services were cut from Mosjøen and Mo i Rana.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 21, the Butts County Superior Court denied Davis's request to halt his execution. The Georgia Supreme Court also denied his appeal. Davis was due to be {{executed}} at 7pm EDT. The same night, Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary, announced that President Obama would not intervene in the case (while the president could not have pardoned Davis, he did {{have the authority to}} order a federal investigation that might have led to a delay in the execution). Davis filed a request with the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution. <b>Almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after Davis's scheduled execution time, the Supreme Court announced they would review his petition, thereby postponing the execution. The Supreme Court, however, denied Davis's petition, after deliberating for several hours.|$|E

50|$|The {{race was}} won by Italian Fausto Coppi. Coppi {{dominated}} the race, winning five stages {{and the mountains}} classification, {{and was a member}} of the winning Italian team. His dominance was so large that the Tour organisation had to double the prize money for second place to make the race interesting. At the end, Coppi had <b>a</b> margin of <b>almost</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> over the second-ranked cyclist, such a margin has never been achieved again.|$|R
5000|$|Several TVE cameramen and {{technicians}} recorded <b>almost</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of the event, providing {{the world with}} an audiovisual record of the attempt (which would be transmitted several hours after the coup ended).

As such the date is sometimes remembered as [...] "the Night of the Transistors." ...|$|R
25|$|The Battle of Al Rumaythah (26 September 2006) {{was fought}} {{during the morning}} in the Iraqi town of Al Rumaythah in Al Muthanna {{province}} between Australian forces of the Overwatch Battle Group (West) and unidentified Iraqi insurgents. The Australians had entered the town to hold discussions at the Iraqi Army barracks when they were engaged by {{a large number of}} insurgents in an intense exchange of fire during which a number of insurgents were killed. The incident lasted <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and although a number of insurgents were killed it was considered to have been a well coordinated attack. The Australians then withdrew in good order without loss of life, injury or serious damage to equipment. Although a small incident with few tactical—and no strategic—consequences, it was significant as being a rare contact involving Australian forces in Iraq after the end of major combat operations in 2003. The incident was also {{the first time that the}} Australians were directly targeted by anti-Iraqi insurgents.|$|E
25|$|On Memorial Day, 2011, 53-year-old Raymond Zack, of Alameda, California, {{walked into}} the waters off Robert Crown Memorial Beach and stood neck deep in water roughly 150 yards {{offshore}} for <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> His foster mother, Dolores Berry, called 9-1-1 {{and said that he}} was trying to drown himself. (There are conflicting reports about Zack's intentions.) Firefighters and police responded but did not enter the water. The firefighters called for a United States Coast Guard boat to respond to the scene. According to police reports, Alameda police expected the firefighters to enter the water. Firefighters later said that they did not have current training and certifications to perform land-based water rescue. Dozens of civilians on the beach, and watching from their homes across from the beach, did not enter the water, apparently expecting public safety officers to conduct a rescue. Eventually, Zack collapsed in the water, apparently from hypothermia. Even then, nobody entered the water for several minutes. Finally, a good samaritan entered the water and pulled Zack to shore. Zack died afterwards at a local hospital.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May, Macaroni was a 10/1 {{chance for}} the Derby at Epsom, with Lord Clifden {{starting}} the 4/1 favourite {{in a field of}} thirty-one. The race was run in difficult conditions with heavy rain and soft ground. Among the spectators was the Prince of Wales, who became the first member of the British Royal Family to attend the race since Prince Albert in 1840. The start of the race was delayed for <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> owing to a record thirty-two false starts caused by horses breaking away or failing to line up correctly. The huge field led to good deal of bumping and roughness, with three horses either falling or being brought down. Chaloner held up Macaroni in the early stages, before moving into fifth place entering the straight. A furlong from the finish, Lord Clifden went into a clear lead and looked the likely winner, but Macaroni produced a strong late run to catch the favourite in the last strides and win by a head. Rapid Rhone finished well to take third place. Macaroni's victory was warmly received in Newmarket, where the church bells were rung in celebration. Naylor marked his success by donating £1,000 to charities in his native city of Liverpool.|$|E
5000|$|The first movement, which {{requires}} <b>almost</b> half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{to play and}} has 1342 bars, is marked [...] "Allegro assai". Performance demands tremendous physical endurance, and great technical skills to cover features including arpeggios, octave runs, scales, leaps, grace notes, alternating hands, swiftly changing block chord motifs, tremolos, and 4-5 trills with the melody played on the same hand. Alkan stays close to the classical sonata form, using a double exposition, but the exposition and development sections are expanded greatly.|$|R
