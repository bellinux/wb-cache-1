40|$|Stable {{friction}} and positive slope of friction-speed is the typical criterion {{for a good}} clutch performance. Lubricated friction interfaces used for wet clutches produces different friction behavior depending on the lubricant conditions. Usually the lubricant conditions vary for different <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> (<b>ATF)</b> formulations implying e. g. water contamination and these conditions might influence {{the deterioration of the}} clutch plates. The aim {{of this paper is to}} verify additive adsorption on friction interfaces and ageing of the friction material in wet clutch system for a water contaminated commercial ATF (DEXRON® VI). Standard clutch plates are employed in an automated wet clutch test rig to evaluate the friction characteristics of the tested lubricant. For controlled test conditions (speed, contact pressure, oil temperature) and specific number of test cycles, the mean friction coefficient and the friction vs. speed relations are monitored during sliding test. The resultant tribofilms on the tested friction interface surfaces are characterized by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM- EDS), Attenuated Total Reflectance -Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS analysis). The spectroscopic techniques were used to analyse adsorbed additives on friction interfaces and made it possible to correlate measured data to the specific friction behavior obtained after water contamination of the ATF.

40|$|In {{automotive}} under-the-hood applications, electronics respectively their {{packaging materials}} {{come in contact}} with automotive fluids. The effect of <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>fluid</b> (<b>ATF)</b> on an anhydride-cured epoxy was investigated at temperatures up to 180 8 C for up to 1000 h. This study has shown that ATF retards the oxidative aging of the epoxy, presumably due to oxygen consumption. Where as in air the material underwent a thermo-oxidative aging with a mass loss of up to 4 % and a strong broadening of Tg to higher temperatures, in ATF a temperature dependent distinctive drop of Tg from 142 8 C to 126 8 C after 1000 h aging at 180 8 C, and a mass loss of maximum 1 % was observed which might be a thermal decomposition of the epoxy material. A slight broadening of the damping factors might indicate an intrusion of ATF components. A color change of the samples could be observed after aging in air and ATF, with the discoloration in air being more intense. An explanation for the color change might be either a minor amount of oxygen causing an oxidative discoloration reaction or the intrusion of colored ATF degradation products. While the oxidation-kinetics in air exhibited Arrhenius temperature-dependence the mechanism in ATF changed above 165 8 C. An acceleration of aging tests at temperatures beyond 150 8 C is therefore not possible...|$|E
