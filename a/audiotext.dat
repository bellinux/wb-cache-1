50|$|Within two years, the NTI {{papers were}} {{generating}} <b>Audiotext</b> revenue {{of more than}} $2 million per year, almost all of which translated directly into profit. Within four years that number would rise to more than $4 million annually. From 1990 through 2001 when Internet services became dominant in the electronic dating market, <b>Audiotext</b> generated more than $35 million in revenues for NTI. At one point it accounted for 11 percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, InfoSource, an <b>audiotext</b> service, and Ads by Phone, a {{telemarketing}} division, were launched. Cobweb, {{an internet}} service provider, started in August 1996. In August 1998, the South Hills {{edition of the}} Observer-Reporter was begun.|$|E
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{considering}} the <b>audiotexts</b> selection procedure for teaching future interpreters listening comprehension in English by correspondence. The author defines components of <b>audiotexts</b> selection criteria for teaching future interpreters by correspondence: primary (structural, lexical, phraseological, grammatical, functional authenticity, compliance with the students’ English language level program requirements, and genre correspondence) and secondary (novelty and motivation criterion, open source Internet criterion, cultural authenticity, phonetic and acoustic peculiarities, and reaction authenticity criterion). Peculiarities of such genres of <b>audiotexts</b> as interview, announcements, news and lectures have been researched. Valid and invalid <b>audiotexts</b> for future interpreters have been analyzed. The examples of <b>audiotexts</b> correspondence/lack of correspondence to the defined criteria have been described...|$|R
40|$|Professors Robert and Elizabeth Bjork, who {{immersed}} me {{in academia}} before I could read, and whose infectious love for learning led me down this path. Acknowledgements I wish to thank, first and foremost, my supervisor John Rumrich for {{his years of}} patient guidance and for his rewarding collaboration {{with me on the}} Paradise Lost <b>audiotexts</b> project. As my professor, he introduced me to textual studies and the work of his former student Stephen Dobranski, whose publications on Milton and print culture inspired me to move in a similar direction. I am also indebted to my other committee members. Janine Barchas pointed me to Genette’s Paratexts and provided copious and exacting commentary on my dissertation manuscript. She remained committed to my project even at those times when I failed to meet her expectations. Jerome Bump’s enthusiasm for a Web site on Dante’s Inferno that I created with another student in his seminar on literature and multimedia spurred my investment in literary interface design. He generously filled in for the late John Slatin, whose health did not permit him to remain on my committee but who taught me everything I know about Web accessibility. Guy Raffa sponsored my early work on Dante, and the vibrancy of his teaching style and Danteworlds project sometimes make me wish that I had been a graduate student in Italian. As my professor in three seminars and director of the Computer Writing and Research Lab, Peg Syverson instilled in me a scholarly approach to electronic pedagogy. I {{would also like to thank}} Coleman Hutchison, who helped me revise two chapters...|$|R
50|$|ClubCall was {{launched}} as a club-by-club telephone information service by BT Supercall (1983-87), the UK's first <b>audiotext</b> business {{set up by}} Kieran Levis following deregulation of the telecoms industry, which {{for the first time}} allowed fans to listen to a telephone news service dedicated to their team.|$|E
50|$|By {{the middle}} of 1991, the Phoenix and Denver papers were very {{profitable}} and Miami was breaking even. Those facts, coupled with the growing revenues from the <b>Audiotext</b> application allowed NTI {{to embark on a}} plan to rapidly expand into Top 15 markets across the country. The company enlisted a boutique investment banking firm to assist in constructing this plan.|$|E

"Since the I950s, {{the poetry}} reading {{has become one}} of the most {{important}} sites for the dissemination of poetic works in North America, yet studies of the distinctive features of the poem-in-performance have been rare (even full-length studies of a poet's work routinely ignore the <b>audiotext),</b> and readings no matter how well attended are rarely reviewed by newspapers or magazines."

50|$|After {{coordinating}} the Digitization of the Newspaper Archives Project {{in the early}} 90s, Strecker led a team that developed many high tech products like <b>audiotext</b> services (1993), the newspaper's full text annual CD-ROMs (1994-96) and a system similar to a BBS, which gave all the Folha de S.Paulo journalists and foreign correspondents access to the archives online, using telephone lines and microcomputers. Because of this work, Strecker was honored with the Folha Award on Journalism, Special Category, in 1995.|$|E
50|$|If {{a carrier}} offers {{services}} over common carrier transmission facilities that employ computer processing applications that {{act on the}} format, content, code, protocol or similar aspects of the subscriber's transmitted information; provide the subscriber additional, different, or restructured information; or involve subscriber interaction with stored information, the FCC consider this {{to fall into the}} enhanced services category. The Commission found that e-mail, voice mail, the World Wide Web, newsgroups, fax store-and-forward, interactive voice response, gateway, <b>audiotext</b> information services, and protocol processing are enhanced services.|$|E
50|$|Pay-per-call {{applications}} dated back to {{as early}} as 1971. Typically a caller would dial an advertised phone number with a 900 or 976 prefix. The caller would be billed a fixed amount per minute by the phone company. The phone company kept {{a portion of the}} revenue with the balance going to the sponsor of the call. There were many pay-per-call services: sports scores, weather forecasts, even dating lines. A new twist was added to this mix {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s. It was known as <b>Audiotext,</b> a relatively simple concept that combined a pay-per-call application with sophisticated answering machine technology ("IVR"). A person would call a 900 number and enter the voice mailbox number of the service or person for whom they wished to leave a message. Much like a voice-mail system in typical office environments, the person who owned the mailbox could listen to the recorded message at a later time and respond appropriately.|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{essential}} theme addressed here is {{the relevance}} and future ofvideotext and <b>audiotext</b> faced {{with the development of}} the Internet and broadband network applications. Issues such as user-friendliness, consumption, tariffing and contents regulation are considered as decisive factors in the survival of these technologies. The Internet has clearly led to the meltdown ofvideotext; the authors suggest that <b>audiotext,</b> despite being better equipped to survive, might well go the same way.

40|$|In the USA <b>audiotext</b> services, {{also known}} as 900 numbers, have been growing in {{popularity}} since the mid- 1980 s. But their success has raised numerous policy issues, and adverse publicity, especially in connection with adult programmes, has led to calls for federal regulation and has prompted the industry to make efforts to regulate itself. This study offers some systematic evidence {{about the content of}} 900 services and the ways they are offered. The authors conclude that abuses are not widespread, and therefore blanket regulation of the industry would not be appropriate. The carriers should monitor services providers more closely. ...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how the {{presentation}} of {{letters to the editor}} affect credibility assessments made by readers of those letters. By using a cognitive response approach, this paper purports that letters delivered anonymously through <b>audiotext</b> systems are deemed as credible as signed, written letters to the editor. Also, this study investigated whether the anonymous letters are more likely to influence readers 2 ̆ 7 thoughts on a given topic than letters that are signed. Involvement, in this study, is used as a control variable. As the feeling of involvement rises, so does the likelihood that letters are seen as credible. Using anonymity and letter format - the way the letter is presented - as independent variables and credibility as the dependent variable, this study shows a person determines whether letters to the editor are credible based on involvement levels rather than the way in which a letter is presented. Using an experimental design involving three experimental groups and a control group, this study exposed respondents to letters that were either written or delivered through a telephone <b>audiotext</b> system and those that were either signed or anonymous. Using a pretest and posttest design, the study determined a person 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in issues before being exposed to the stimulus. After exposure, respondents were tested to see if judgments of perceived credibility shifts occurred. Involvement was controlled in the analysis using regression...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two distinct elements, one critical and the other creative. The critical element, “Chapter One: The Library of Congress Archive of Recorded Poetry and Literature, 1941 - 1961,” situates the Library of Congress poetry-recording project {{in the context of}} Cold War attempts to create and project a robust American literary culture. The author examines the historical relationship between the <b>audiotext</b> archive and the literary canon, the role of authorialperformance in <b>audiotext</b> production, and the significance of the archival and testimonial process of recording poets reading their own work. In tracing the evolution of the Library of Congress project, the author shows how early auditory archive-building, despite its ad hoc practices, endorsed the authority of the short lyric and posited the voice as the ultimate hermeneutic key, while simultaneously reinforcing the canonization of High Modernist authors and New Critics who in print expressed disdain for this sort of authority-building. As anxiety about producing documentary evidence of a national culture spurred the identification of an artist’s aural performance with official sanction, institutional discourse [...] academic, governmental, and pedagogical [...] collided with the aesthetic discourse and technological ideology of the mid-twentieth century. The author concludes that despite attempts to recuperate a lost oral tradition, magnetic sound recording of poets reading aloud serves mainly to reconfigure and affirm the graphical authority of literary work even as we move into a post-print era.; The creative element, “Chapter Two: Famous Birds, A Collection of Poetry,” challenges the authority of the spoken voice which the author examines in the Library of Congress project by graphically, semantically, and syntactically deploying language in a way that seems to deny an authoritative oral expression. The “subject matter” of these poems might be characterized as soliloquies interrupted by the language of the world, such that any and all internal and external events that occur during the process of writing can be filtered and integrated into the poem...|$|E
40|$|Time {{compression}} {{increases the}} rate of speech without altering its pitch. The present study investigated time compression {{as a means of}} improving the efficiency of <b>audiotext</b> applications for a variety of user populations. Subjects from three age groups (20 - 30, 40 - 50, and 60 - 70 years old) and two native language groups (native and nonnative English speakers) interacted with a prototype of an Interactive Voice Response system. Four prototypes were constructed, each containing speech compressed at a different rate: 30 %, 20 %, lo%, and uncompressed. Each subject telephoned one of the prototypes to learn how t o use Call Forwarding and to order another telephone service feature. Compression rate did not significantly interact with age or native language. Across compression rates, 60 -year-olds spent significantly more time on the phone than did 20 - and 40 -year-olds. Moreover, 60 -year-olds were significantly less successful at forwarding phone calls, and reported more difficulty and confusion, than other subjects. Nonnative English speakers spent significantly more time on the phone than did native English speakers. Despite this difference, nonnative speakers were just as successful at forwarding phone calls, and rated the system and the announcer just as favorably as did native speakers of English. There was no main effect of compressio...|$|E
40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{the need for}} technical university students to improve critical thinking skills in listening at foreign language lessons. Critical thinking skills {{in the context of}} teaching English at high school are analyzed. Critical thinking refers to the ability of individuals to think and make the right decisions on their own. Critical thinking is used for learning a foreign language for a long time. Currently, the increase in critical thinking is one of the challenges facing teachers of foreign languages because of its critical importance in class. Three phases of critical thinking (evocation, meaning realization and reflection or thought) that relate to the three stages of work with the <b>audiotext</b> (before listening, while listening and after listening) are considered. Particular methods of critical thinking for students while teaching listening in the classroom on the subject ?Introduction into English for technical purposes? are suggested. Such techniques as ?table-KWK?, ?thin and thick questions?, ?keywords?, ?tree predictions?, ?insert?, ?blog?, ?Daisy Bloom?, ?writing poetry?, ?letter on a circle? and ?essay? are offered. Each method is provided with guidelines for the teacher on the use at foreign language lessons. Finally, this article concludes the importance of using the above mentioned methods of critical thinking as they contribute to preparing students for future careers. ? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ???????????? ???? ???????????? ???????? ??? ????????????????? ??????? ??????????? ?? ???????? ?? ???????????? ?????. ???????????????? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????? ? ????. ?????? ???????? ????????? ???? ????? ???????? ???????????? ????????

40|$|Rapid Order @ is an Ameritech Services <b>audiotext</b> {{system which}} lets {{consumers}} learn about and order 12 telephone services. The current menu structure {{is based on}} the development history of the services rather than on an intuitive organization for the consumer. Four studies were performed to develop a new menu structure which would be easier for consumers to use. The first study used cluster analysis to develop a menu structure. The second experiment tested the goodness of fit of the new menu compared to the old menu. Results showed that consumers were more accurate in determining where on the menu a service would be found with the new menu. In the third experiment, we changed the name of one of the menu categories and got an even greater improvement i n performance. Finally, we tested the same three menu structures using a phone prototype rather than a paper task and the results were similar to those with the paper task. Consumers were 18 % more accurate in locating a service on the best new menu than on the existing menu. These results strongly suggest that changing the Rapid Order menu will result in improved customer performance with the menu. They also illustrate how cluster analysis alone will not provide all the answers in menu design. The labeling of the clusters can {{have a significant effect on}} the goodness of fit of the menu...|$|E
