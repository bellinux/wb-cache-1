25|$|Benzene is used {{mainly as}} an {{intermediate}} to make other chemicals, above all ethylbenzene, cumene, cyclohexane, nitrobenzene, and alkylbenzene. More {{than half of the}} entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce phenol and <b>acetone</b> for <b>resins</b> and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes ca. 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating.|$|R

Fluid displacement {{is the preferred}} means of sediment dehydration, offering optimum structural preservation and facilitating desalination. Exchanges of deionized water, <b>acetone,</b> and low-viscosity <b>resin</b> are performed in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere to maintain anoxia in the sediments. Analysis of the rinsing fluids indicates both efficient removal of brine salts and minimal dissolution of redox-sensitive trace metals. This contrasts with oxic fluid displacement experiments, in which several metals appear {{to be removed from}} the solid phase during desalination.

30|$|To {{understand}} {{the impacts of}} RFDMW, SFDMW, and SM on the ultrastructure of C. vulgaris, we used TEM analysis. The pellets of C. vulgaris were fixed in 2  % paraformaldehyde + 2.5  % glutaraldehyde in 0.1  M sodium phosphate buffer. Subsequently, the pellets were rinsed in buffer and then fixed in 2  % OsO 4 in the same buffer for 1.5  h. The samples were then dehydrated in a graded series of acetone in PBS (10, 30, 50, 70, and 90  %) for 10  min at each level of acetone. Subsequently, at 100  % acetone, samples were dehydrated for 30  min. A mixture of <b>acetone</b> and <b>resin</b> (1 : 1) was used for 1  h resin infiltration, which was followed by overnight infiltration with 100  % resin. The next day, fresh resin (100  %) was used for a 2  h infiltration before final embedding and polymerization. Ultrathin sections (50  nm thick) were cut using a Diatome diamond knife and picked up onto copper (carbon coated) grids (200 mesh) then stained with 0.5  % uranyl acetate for 2  h and 3  % lead citrate for 5  min before viewing in a Philips CM 120 electron microscope.

40|$|The leaf cuticular {{ultrastructure}} of some {{plant species}} has been examined by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) in only few studies. Attending to the different cuticle layers and inner structure, plant cuticles have been grouped into six general morphological types. With the aim of critically examining the effect of cuticle isolation and preparation for TEM analysis on cuticular ultrastructure, adaxial leaf cuticles of blue-gum eucalypt, grey poplar, and European pear were assessed, following a membrane science approach. The embedding and staining protocols affected the ultrastructure of the cuticles analysed. The solubility parameter, surface tension, and contact angles with water of pure Spurr's and LR-White resins were within a similar range. Differences were however estimated for resin[*]:[*]solvent mixtures, since Spurr’s resin is combined with <b>acetone</b> and LR-White <b>resin</b> is mixed with ethanol. Given the composite hydrophilic and lipophilic nature of plant cuticles, the particular TEM tissue embedding and staining procedures employed may affect sample ultrastructure and {{the interpretation of the}} results in physicochemical and biological terms. It is concluded that tissue preparation procedures may be optimised to facilitate the observation of the micro- and nanostructure of cuticular layers and components with different degrees of polarity and hydrophobicity...|$|R
40|$|Guayule (Parthenium argentatum), a plant {{native of}} {{semi-arid}} regions of northern Mexico and south-ern Texas, United States, is an under-used source of hypoallergenic latex, {{a solution to}} the serious latex allergy IgE problem worldwide. This study aimed to develop near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) calibra-tions to assess resin and rubber contents in guayule plants. For achieving this goal a reference method (ASE; accelerated solvent extraction) was selected and optimized among three alternatives also including Soxhlet and Polytron. First resin (lipids, terpenes) was extracted with acetone from ground biomass at 40 ?C, and then rubber was extracted with hexane from left solid at 120 ?C. A set of 215 samples of guayule biomass (stems and branches) was collected from plants in two experimental fields located in France and in Spain and was analyzed for moisture, rubber and resin contents using the two solvent selected ASE methods. Near infrared spectra were recorded for all samples. Two thirds of the samples were randomly selected for calibration, the remaining being used for validation. For each constituent, calibration equa-tions were developed using modified partial least squares regression. The equation performances were evaluated using the performance to deviation ratio (RPDp) and R 2 pparameters, obtained by comparison of the validation set NIR predictions and corresponding laboratory values. Moisture content (RPDp = 6. 91; R 2 p = 0. 98) calibration enabled accurate determination of these traits. NIR models for hexane extract (rubber content) (RPDp = 4. 59; R 2 p = 0. 96) and <b>acetone</b> extract (<b>resin</b> content) (RPDp = 4. 87; R 2 p = 0. 96) were highly efficient and enabled accurate characterization of guayule biomass. On the other hand, this analysis showed that both laboratory tools, coupled with multivariate analytical techniques, could be used to differentiate the samples and accurately predict the chemical composition of this disparate set of agricultural biomass samples. This study demonstrated the ability of NIRS analysis for high throughput determination of resin and rubber contents in guayule biomass. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} investigates random soil {{movement as}} suggested by Culling (1963), concentrating {{on the development of}} a technique for testing this theory. The technique employed dispenses with the need for continuous monitoring and avoids the inherent problems of soil disturbance arising from the use of soil probes. The theory assumes random and diffusive soil movement leading to a distinctive pattern of soil densities, through time, about obstacles of varying shapes. Solutions for circular and elliptical cylindrical obstacles have been calculated (Culling, 1981). The existence of a soil density pattern has now been investigated for circular obstacles by examining soil from around telegraph poles using photo-microscopy and image analysis to facilitate rapid calculation. Soil samples were removed in brass tubes, dried with <b>acetone,</b> impregnated with <b>resin,</b> made into thin sections, photographed and analysed. From the soil:void ratios of each picture the changing micro-density of soil around an obstacle can be determined. Results indicate significant variations in the density values. Detailed inspection of the two-dimensional information reveals that under sloping site conditions there is a coherent pattern of soil density which reflects that predicted by the theory. Flat sites are also consistent in that there is no identifiable trend in the horizontal plane. The conclusion considers the adequacy of the research undertaken to evaluate the theory. <p...|$|R
30|$|Minimal carboxymethylation of the {{hydroxyl}} {{groups of}} wood cellulose with aqueous NaOH and monochloroacetic acid to introduce anionic charges on {{the surfaces of}} the cellulose microfibrils {{was developed in the}} next stage [33]. Because the carboxymethylation and preparation processes of CMCs from wood cellulose have been established at the industrial level, and because the safety standard issues of CMCs and their production systems have been already satisfied, the conventional industrial-scale carboxymethylation process is applicable to the pretreatment, which is advantageous. However, because carboxymethylation itself is a type of competition reaction between cellulose hydroxyl groups and water molecules always present in the reaction media, the reaction efficiency of introducing carboxymethyl groups only on the crystalline cellulose microfibril surfaces may not be so high. In a contradictory manner, introduction of sufficient amounts of cationic charges to wood cellulose microfibril surfaces originally having anionic charges using cationic polymers via paper chemistry technology has also been exploited as a pretreatment [34]. Partial acetylation of cellulose microfibril surfaces has also been applied to wood cellulose, in which mechanical disintegration of the partially acetylated cellulose fibers was applied to <b>acetone</b> or acrylic <b>resins</b> in the mechanical disintegration stage to reduce energy consumption and achieve homogeneous NFC distribution in the polymer matrix [26, 35]. Each pretreatment resulted in a remarkable reduction of fibrillation energy to lower than 10  % of that without pretreatment.|$|R

The toxin was concentrated and purified by sequentially applying batch adsorption chromatography on Amberlite XAD- 2 <b>resin,</b> <b>acetone</b> fractionation, and preparative isoelectric focusing in a flatbed granulated gel. Reverse-phase {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} was used to purify the toxin further and to eliminate contaminating ampholytes. The toxin was purified more than 2, 000 -fold and had a minimal effective dose of less than 0. 5 ng. It was biologically active after heating to 100 degrees C for 30 min and was not hydrolyzed by trypsin, pronase, and subtilisin, but it was inactivated by treatment with 0. 1 M 2 -mercaptoethanol or 4 X 10 (- 5) M dithiothreitol, suggesting that disulfide bonds are essential for retaining its biological activity. The amino acid analysis revealed 18 amino acid residues per molecule, which is {{in agreement with the}} composition of ST from a human strain of enterotoxigenic E. coli. The amino acid composition of our ST matched the published coding sequence of the last 18 codons of Tn 1618, a transposon isolated from the bovine enterotoxigenic E. coli strain B 41 and shown to be present also in some strains of porcine enterotoxigenic E. coli. These findings further support the existence of a form of ST common to bovine, porcine, and human strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli...|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{the term}} kompot or compote refers euphemistically to kompot, a {{traditional}} compote-like dessert popular in Central and Eastern European countries made of stewed fruit, spices, and sugar. The so-called kompot method of making a crude opiate [...] "cocktail" [...] intended for injection involves stewing the pods of the opium poppy in nearly boiling water and an acid, and using the strained liquid (essentially like kompot is produced from the raw ingredients). However, in 1976 two Polish students from Gdańsk discovered a simple way of making it by extracting opiate alkaloids from poppy straw by using ion exchange <b>resin,</b> <b>acetone,</b> ammonia water and a few other chemicals used in the last step of production. In this method, opium poppy pods and stems are boiled in water for a few hours without adding acid, and then filtered. Strongly acidic ion exchange resin is then added. The resin is filtered and the opiates are recovered with the addition of ammonia water. The resulting liquid is evaporated using a chemical condenser, then when dry (it is then called glazura - glaze) it is acetylated using acetic anhydride in an anhydrous environment of a non-polar solvent, for example toluene, diethyl ether, chloroform, or most commonly acetone. After acetylation, the solvent is evaporated to remove the acetic anhydride, and finally water is added. The amount of water added depends on the amount of plant material used {{in the beginning of the}} process, most often 30 milliliters per kilogram of dry plant material. Although the drug is primarily intended for intravenous injection, kompot extraction as described here produces an end product containing residual plant matter, waste chemicals, impure water, and other contaminants, making this dangerous substance to inject since such impurities can lead to abscesses or anaphylactic shock.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Root rot of {{ponderosa pine}} caused by Armillaria mellea was studied in a pine forest {{that had been}} under {{management}} for 30 years in Klickitat County, Washington. Information sources included disease survey, detailed observation and description of specific disease situations, and examination of roots in situ and removed. Roughly circular infection centers in stands of sapling and pole-sized pines appear to arise regularly from stumps of harvested old-growth trees, {{some of which have}} contained viable A. mellea for over 30 years. Distinctive concentric zones caused by the disease mark the infection centers. These zones differ in above-ground appearance, in degree of root decomposition, and in level of infection. Location of a specific zone depends on the interval since cutting of the old-growth tree, while zone width depends on tree sizes in the young stand. Distribution of root material in the interior zones is influenced most strongly by rooting characteristics of the former old-growth trees, and by activity of A. mellea and other decay agents over time, while in the young growth pines of the intermediate zones, time since lethal attack by A. mellea and tree size most influence root condition. Extensive examination of the outer zones disclosed that, in stands containing trees from 3 to 6 inches in diameter, infected root material extended into the healthy-appearing pines 11 ft beyond the outermost dead tree of the infection center, while in stands with trees up to 16 inches in diameter the extent reached 18 ft. A highly significant linear regression with good correlation was found between: 1) the extent of infected root material beyond the outermost dead tree; and 2) mean tree size of the affected stand. Infected root segments from beyond the outermost dead tree, within the region where infected and healthy roots intermingle, produced rhizomorphs, the assumed infection structures, when incubated in bags of moist quartz sand. The expansion rate of infection centers was calculated to be 2. 9 ft (0. 88 m) /year. Cross plating techniques indicated that the 1500 acre study area was occupied by a single strain of A. mellea, suggesting that spores are unimportant to the field disease cycle. Current loss to disease in the 1500 acre tract is 35 cu ft per acre per yr, three times the loss in 1957. From 1957 to 1971, the proportion of the area in which disease was detectable remained constant. The increased loss resulted from death of fewer, but larger, trees in 1971. In inoculation tests on ponderosa pine seedlings, A. mellea isolates from old-growth pine stumps and from young pine trees were pathogenic, while isolates from living hardwoods were weakly or nonpathogenic. Reliable methods are described for isolating A. mellea from infected tissues and of testing the capacity of naturally infected root materials to produce rhizomorphs. The abundance of A. mellea over a three year interval following five root removal treatments increased in missed root residues. Resinous lesions were commonly found at the site of A. mellea attack. Rarely does mycelium spread proximally along a living root from one of these lesions, but growth frequently occurs from the lesion toward the root tip following, or concurrent with death of the extremity. Girdling resinous lesions on lateral roots show little effect on tree vigor, while such lesions high on the tap root kill the tree. Soon after tree death, mycelial fans spread under the bark throughout the root system. To obtain insight on how the resinous lesions retard the fungus, tests were conducted on the effects of resin on growth of A. mellea in culture. Autoclaved <b>resin,</b> <b>acetone</b> extracts of <b>resin,</b> water extracts of resin, and non-sterilized resin all stimulated, rather than restricted, growth over non-resin containing media. Removal of phenols from the water extract of resin with polyvinylpyrrolidone destroyed the growth stimulating effect of the resin.

40|$|Gypsum affects many physical, {{chemical}} and mineralogical properties {{which in turn}} influences management, classification and sutability of the soils. This {{is the reason why}} accurate measurement of gypsum in soil is very important. In most of the soil science laboratories, the method of acetone,in spite of its too much limitation, is being used as a standard method. The purpose of this research was to compare different gypsum determination methods and to find the most suitable one. The study areas include Jafarabad of Borkhar and Sepahanshahr. Soil samples were collected from different horizons of the studied profiles and seven samples {{with a wide range of}} gypsum content were selected. Gypsum content of the soil samples were determined by methods of <b>acetone,</b> sodium carbonate, <b>resin,</b> calcium and magnesium difference, diluted extracted sulfate, ammonium carbonate, sodium citrate and hydrochloric acid. To calculate the recovery percentage of the methods, after adding a certain amount of gypsum with known purity percentage to the soil samples, gypsum content was determined again by above mentioned eight methods. To evaluate the suitability of the methods, in addition to the recovery percentage of the methods, coefficient of variability and extent of proximity of the regression line to the 1 : 1 line were used. The results revealed that among the used methods, the method of sodium carbonate is the most accurate one. Resin method is ranked as the second best method and can be used in non-saline soils as another accurate method for determination of gypsum content. Sodium citrate and hydrochloric acid methods for different amounts of gypsum and ammonium carbonate method for gypsum content up to 30 % are third in rank as far as their accuracy is concerned. Acetone, calcium magnesium difference and diluted extracted sulfate methods are not sufficiently accurate, because of low solubility of gypsum in water which is used as an extractant. In general, the most important determinant of accuracy of the methods is extractants of the gypsum among which the sodium carbonate has the highest efficiency...|$|R

OsO 4 is kept in the refrigerator in a jar and is made as a 4 % solution in water. It is very volatile and must be used in the hood. Osmium crystals take about a day to dissolve, so be certain that there is sufficient stock before you start your experiment. 1. Pellet microtubules at 15 - 20, 000 rpm in eppendorf tubes. Try to obtain a small and tightly packed pellet. - Remove supernatant and overlay pellet with glutaraldehyde solution. Fix at room temperature for ~ 1 hour. If necessary, this can be left overnight at room temperature. - If the pellet is large, loosen it {{from the bottom of the}} tube by making a small wedge with a Q-tip stick and using the stick to slide the pellet off the bottom. Then cut the pellet into small pieces with a razor blade. - Rinse the pellet with 2 - 4 changes of fixation buffer without the glutaraldehyde. - Postfix with 0. 5 - 1 % OsO 4 in the microtubule assembly buffer or in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7. 0 for ~ 1 hr at room temp or on ice. - Rinse the pellet with several changes of water and soak in 1 % uranyl acetate for 30 min - overnight, room temperature. NOTE: the pH of uranyl acetate is ~ 4. 0 so your water rinse should remove any PIPES, that would precipitate at low pH, or phosphate buffer, which precipitates as uranyl phosphate crystals. - Transfer the pellet to a glass scintillation vial and rinse with water. Then dehydrate specimen by 10 - 15 min incubations in acetone:water mixtures of 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and at least two 100 % acetone rinses. - Infiltrate the samples with plastic.
