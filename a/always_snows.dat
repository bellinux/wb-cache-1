6000|$|The way {{the snow}} [...] "goes" [...] for that poor woman is most unfair. It <b>always</b> <b>snows</b> much heavier in the {{particular}} spot where she is sitting than it does {{anywhere else in the}} whole street. Why, we have sometimes seen a heroine sitting {{in the midst of a}} blinding snow-storm while the other side of the road was as dry as a bone. And it never seemed to occur to her to cross over.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{were always}} going to teach me at Warner Grange, but it <b>always</b> <b>snowed,</b> or rained, or skated, I mean we skated, or something, {{whenever}} Hubert had time; but I am perfectly dying to learn." ...|$|R
50|$|Pluto {{runs his}} own {{neighborhood}} in Disney's Toontown Online. It's called the Brrrgh and it's <b>always</b> <b>snowing</b> there except during Halloween. During April Toons Week, a weekly event {{that is very}} silly, Pluto switches playgrounds with Minnie (all other characters do this as well). Pluto actually talks in Minnie's Melodyland.|$|R
50|$|It is {{situated}} at 1440 m altitude, being the highest resort in Romania. It {{lies in a}} conifer forest. It is a popular winter destination and in summer it is sought for its peacefulness. There is <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> and skiing lessons for its fresh air and for the easily accessible trekking routes.|$|R
50|$|The Östersund Ski Stadium (Östersunds skidstadion) is a {{cross-country}} skiing, biathlon and ski orienteering facility in Östersund, Sweden. In October 2013 it was appointed national stadium for Swedish biathlon. Since 2007 the stadium has <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> starting on 1 November, using leftover snow gathered by Östersund Municipality over {{the spring and}} summertime season.|$|R
2500|$|Oral {{subjects}} took a practical, not an abstract, {{approach to}} syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. In the far north, {{where there is}} snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> there. What colour are the bears? Typical response: [...] "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "They are {{north from}} the Türks, 14,000 li from the Chinese capital. They follow grass and water, but mostly {{live in the}} mountains. Their {{standing}} army is 30,000 men. There is <b>always</b> <b>snow,</b> and foliage does not fall down. They plough fields with horses. All horses are skewbald colors, therefore the state is also given the same name. They live in the north near a sea. Though they have horses, they do not ride them, but use their milk for food. They are frequently at war with Kirgizes".|$|R
50|$|The city, {{located in}} west-central Bolivia 68 km {{southeast}} of Lake Titicaca, {{is set in}} a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3650 m above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with his}} poetry, A Child's Christmas in Wales {{does not have}} a tight {{narrative}} structure, but uses descriptive passages designed to create an emotive sense of the nostalgia Thomas is intending to evoke. The story is told from the viewpoint of the author recounting a festive season as a young boy in a fictionalised autobiographical style. In the first passage, Thomas searches for a nostalgic Western belief in Christmas past with the line, [...] "It was <b>snowing.</b> It was <b>always</b> <b>snowing</b> at Christmas", furthering his idyllic memory of childhood past by describing the snow as being better and more exciting then, than the snow that he experiences as an adult. The prose is comedic, with exaggerated characters used either for comedic effect, or to show how childhood memories are enlarged through youthful interpretation.|$|R
2500|$|The stripe color varies {{due to the}} {{influence}} and interaction of other genes. Another genetic characteristic makes the stripes of the tiger very pale; white tigers of this type are called snow-white or [...] "pure white". White tigers, Siamese cats, and Himalayan rabbits have enzymes in their fur which react to temperature, causing them to grow darker in the cold. A white tiger named Mohini was whiter than her relatives in the Bristol Zoo, who showed more cream tones. This may have been because she spent less time outdoors in the winter. Kailash Sankhala observed that white tigers were always whiter in Rewa State, {{even when they were}} born in New Delhi and returned there. [...] "In spite of living in a dusty courtyard, they were <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> white." [...] A weakened immune system is directly linked to reduced pigmentation in white tigers.|$|R
500|$|In winter, North Carolina is {{somewhat}} {{protected by the}} Appalachian Mountains to the west. Cold fronts from Canada are typically reduced in intensity by the mountains. However, occasionally cold air can move from the north or northeast, east of the Appalachian Mountains, from Arctic high pressure systems that settle over the Northeastern or New England states. Other polar and Arctic outbreaks can cross the mountains and force temperatures to drop to about [...] in central North Carolina. Still, temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are extremely rare outside of the mountains. The coldest ever recorded temperature in North Carolina was [...] on January 21, 1985, at Mount Mitchell. The winter temperatures on the coast are milder due to the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream. The average ocean temperature in Southport in January is still {{higher than the average}} ocean temperature in Maine during July. Snow is common in the mountains, although many ski resorts use snowmaking equipment to make sure there is <b>always</b> <b>snow</b> on their land. North Carolina's relative humidity is highest in the winter.|$|R
50|$|Northern: Sierra de la Demanda, Sierra de Neila, Mesa de Cebollera and the Picos de Urbión in the northwest, the Sierra de Alcarama, Sierra de Peñalmonte, Sierra de Moncalvillo and the {{isolated}} Moncayo Massif in the north, <b>always</b> crested with <b>snow</b> in the winter, with its eastern prolongation the Sierra de Nava Alta.|$|R
5000|$|It averages {{over 500}} in of {{snowfall}} per season which ranks {{it among the}} top four ski resorts in North America. This is impressive where it is 670 mi inland and the snow that falls is nearly <b>always</b> powder <b>snow.</b> The reason for the abundant snowfall is twofold. First, the area is on the west slope or [...] "wet" [...] side of the Teton Range, topped by Grand Teton at 13775 ft and, second, {{because there is a}} moisture channel through the Rocky Mountains formed by the Snake River Plain in Idaho that channels moisture from the Pacific Ocean to the west slope of the Tetons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main source}} of income is tourism. Because of the high {{altitude}} of over 2000 mH, the place is free of forest and therefore with {{a clear view of}} the surrounding alpine peaks. In addition, there is <b>always</b> lots of <b>snow</b> the Arlberg-region, as well as a picture book landscape for the winter sports. This unique combination attracts many tourists each year.|$|R
50|$|The {{crossing}} of glaciers is potentially hazardous {{because of the}} potential for crevasses. These giant cracks in the ice are not <b>always</b> visible as <b>snow</b> can be blown and freeze over the top to make a snowbridge. To cross a glacier the use of a rope, crampons and ice axes are usually required. Deep, fast flowing rivers pose another danger that can be mitigated with ropes.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the aspects}} noted by Anglo-American reviewers was the {{deliberate}} theatricality {{in the style}} of filming: [...] "The film is entirely shot on sets that advertise their staginess - for example by the absence of ceilings revealed by the overhead shots, or their striking pastel colours (pinks, oranges and whites) and the repetition of frames filled with seemingly shifting partitions: etched glass, beads, ironwork, veils and so on." [...] "...The superbly sustained aura of delicate artifice - this is a Paris where it’s <b>always</b> silently <b>snowing,</b> even, at one point, indoors - lends the characters’ repeated attempts to break free of their boxed-in lives the ritualistic magic of a fairy tale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] Matteo said, [...] "those {{who have}} journeyed from Italy into France {{tell me that}} there are {{mountains}} there beside which Etna is as nothing. These mountains are a continuation of the range of hills which we can see from Venice. Their tops are <b>always</b> covered with <b>snow,</b> and cannot be ascended by man; whereas it is easy, they say, to reach the top of Etna." ...|$|R
50|$|Inaccessible Island {{is a small}} rocky island, {{the northernmost}} of the Dellbridge Islands, lying 1 nmi km {{southwest}} of Cape Evans, Ross Island, Antarctica. It is the most imposing of the group as it is nearly <b>always</b> bare of <b>snow</b> and rises to 95 m. The island was discovered by the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901-04) under Robert Falcon Scott and so named {{because of the difficulty}} in reaching it.|$|R
50|$|Mining is currently, and <b>always</b> has been, <b>Snow</b> Lake's major industry. Two {{separate}} mining ventures {{have operated}} {{in the community}} over the past 40 years. TVX/Kinross/High River operated the New Britannia Mine, which closed in January 2005, and HudBay Minerals, which operated 12 area mines. They were/are Lalor Mine, Chisel Lake, Stall Lake, Osborne Lake, Dickstone, Anderson Lake, Ghost Lake, Lost Lake, Spruce Point, Rod Mine, Photo Lake, and Chisel North.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{there is}} often - but not <b>always</b> - <b>snow</b> {{on the ground at}} Christmas in the {{northern}} states, except in the Pacific Northwest, with the northern Plains the most likely to see snow on the ground at Christmas. Some of the least likely white Christmases that have happened include the 2004 Christmas Eve Snowstorm, which brought the first white Christmas in 50 years to New Orleans. The 2004 storm also brought the first measurable snow of any kind since 1895 to Brownsville, Texas, and its twin city of Matamoros, Mexico. The Florida winter storm of 1989 also occurred immediately before Christmas causing a white Christmas for cities like Pensacola and Jacksonville. The same storm buried Wilmington, North Carolina and the rest of Southeastern North Carolina under 15 in of snow.|$|R
2500|$|Mehrdad Bahar {{regards the}} {{etymology}} {{of the name}} to be [...] "Ruta-staxma", i.e. the river that descends, and argues that Rostam {{could have been an}} ancient god of the river Helmand. The fact that Rostam's mother is called Rudabeh (i.e. The river of water) and his father is Zal who has white hair, Bahar continues the argument to say that Zal is a metaphor for mountains from which the river forms, whose head is <b>always</b> white with <b>snow.</b>|$|R
5000|$|With a new {{appointment}} {{firmly in}} hand, Snow married Jeannette Simmons and planned a delayed honeymoon in Europe {{for the summer}} of 1922. When they returned, he had a copy of James Joyce's newly released Ulysses hidden in his luggage. Hidden because Ulysses had been [...] "banned" [...] in America ahead of its actual publication. <b>Snow</b> <b>always</b> asserted, with some logic because of the dates involved, that he had [...] "smuggled the first copy of Ulysses into the United States." ...|$|R
50|$|At an {{elevation}} of 856 m, the city of Burgos experiences the continental-influenced Mediterranean climate (Kŏppen Cfb). Burgos' climate features very cool and windy winters due to altitude and an inland location. Winters <b>always</b> include <b>snow</b> and temperatures below freezing. Burgos' continentality is caused by two principal factors: distance from the sea and higher altitude. Temperature ranges can be extreme and Burgos is drier than Spain's coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is 546 mm and the average annual relative humidity is 72%. In winter, temperatures very often (almost every day) drop below freezing, often reaching temperatures as low as , and snowfalls are common, while the summer months see average high temperatures of 27.5 C. The lowest recorded temperature in Burgos was -21 C on 20 January 1885. The highest recorded temperature was 39 C on 13 August 1987.|$|R
50|$|In February 2013 an {{avalanche}} blocked the Bastan {{at the height}} of the Barèges Spa and the town was evacuated. On 31 May 2013 snow accumulated and there was {{an avalanche}} below the Lienz which covered nearly 200 metres of the bed of the Bastan. After a heatwave on 15 and 16 June followed by thunderstorms and incessant rain on 17 and 18 June there was rising water associated with snow melt. Hampered by the remains of the avalanche, the waters of the Bastan overflowed the road on the right bank, the Place de Barèges (Town Square), then the HLM parking, camping area, and seven houses but there were no injuries reported. The Thermal Baths of Barzun were also heavily damaged. The stricken town was evacuated on June 19 through an unusual opening of the Col du Tourmalet which is <b>always</b> under <b>snow.</b>|$|R
50|$|Huggies uses {{a system}} for the designs on their pants. Learning Designs {{illustrations}} do not follow any system, but the Cool Alert designs <b>always</b> reflect wintertime, <b>snow,</b> ice, etc., and the Night-Time pants always reflect night time and dreaming. On Pamper's Easy Ups, the designs show Dora and Diego in illustrations that reflect their activities that {{would be similar to}} that in the TV shows Dora the Explorer, Bob the Builder and Go Diego Go!. This also applies to most other companies using licensed characters.|$|R
50|$|Inflatables come {{in various}} sizes, {{commonly}} four feet or 1.2 meters tall (operated with a low-voltage DC power supply {{and a computer}} fan), and six or eight feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters) tall, running directly from AC mains electricity. Like inflatable rides, outdoor types are staked {{to the ground with}} guy wires (usually synthetic rope or flat straps) to keep them upright in the wind, though being rather flimsy this does not <b>always</b> work. Heavy <b>snow</b> or rainwater which has accumulated may also prevent proper inflation.|$|R
50|$|The icon of Archangel {{has been}} {{considered}} as the main patron of the village Mutso during the centuries. The icon was kept on the mount Daquekhi (დაქუეხი) (mountain Tebulosmta, თბულოსმთა) which is <b>always</b> covered by <b>snow.</b> People of the village {{were not able to}} go to the icon and pray there. They sacrificed an ox and asked the icon to come down to a more accessible place. The icon heard the prayer and moved to a holy place in Khone. After that, people started praying there.|$|R
60|$|It was March 1st, 1758, {{the morning}} we left Satanstoe, on this memorable excursion. The winter had proved as was common in our latitude, though there had been more snow along the coast than was usual. Salt air and snow do not agree well together; but I had driven in a sleigh over the Neck, most of the month of February, though there were {{symptoms}} of a thaw, and of a southerly wind, the day we left home. My father observed this, and he advised me to take the road through {{the centre of the}} county, and get among the hills, as soon as possible. Not only was there <b>always</b> more <b>snow</b> {{in that part of the}} country, but it resisted the influence of a thaw much longer than that which had fallen near the sea or Sound. I got my mother's last kiss, my father's last shake of the hand, my grandfather's blessing, stepped into the sleigh, took the reins from Dirck, and drove off.|$|R
50|$|Fron {{makes his}} way to Snowt, a large city on Monstania that <b>always</b> has <b>snow.</b> The town is overrun by berserk spirits and Fron has to fight his way to the castle, where he asks for {{permission}} to travel to Diamond Mountain, a sacred place that Chitta has gone to. Tia, worried, reunites with Fron and together they climb Diamond Mountain without permission. At the top, they find Chitta and Barambat, who is revealed to have once been a fairy who turned human to become more powerful and now wishes to cause the sinking of Monstania. Frustrated, Barambat admits that he would rather watch his old home sink than let the humans live there. Chitta and Fron defeat Barambat, who transforms into a grotesque ceature before being sealed in another world. The fairies approach Fron and Tia and inform them that they can no longer live on Monstania because the stone had been broken.|$|R
40|$|During {{the winter}} 1959 - 60, {{the authors have}} studied various {{characteristics}} of the snow cover in the basin of the river Ste. Anne de Beaupré. They observed that the density of <b>snow</b> <b>always</b> varied between 2. 0 and 2. 5. The classical method of converting 10 inches of snow to one inch of water then appears a debatable question. The graphs of snow precipitations established {{over a period of}} ten years suggest that the basin of the Ste. Anne de Beaupré is typical of a regime with two maximums which occur sometimes between December and March...|$|R
50|$|When {{travelling}} over glaciers, crevasses pose a grave danger. These giant {{cracks in}} the ice are not <b>always</b> visible, as <b>snow</b> can be blown and freeze over the top to make a snowbridge. At times snowbridges can be as thin as a few inches. Climbers and hikers use ropes {{to protect themselves from}} such hazards. Basic gear for glacier travel includes crampons and ice axes, and teams of two to five tie into a rope equally spaced. If someone begins to fall {{the other members of the}} team perform a self-arrest to stop the fall and then attempt a rescue.|$|R
5000|$|The poem was {{eventually}} set to a tune {{by an unknown}} composer. The song version is sometimes presented with lines about Christmas, rather than Thanksgiving. For instance, the line [...] "Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!" [...] becomes [...] "Hurrah for Christmas Day!". As a Christmas song, it has been recorded as [...] "A Merry Christmas at Grandmother's". Although the modern Thanksgiving holiday is not <b>always</b> associated with <b>snow</b> (snow in late November occasionally occurs in the northern states and is rare at best elsewhere in the United States), New England in the early 19th century was enduring the Little Ice Age, a colder era with earlier winters.|$|R
60|$|A violent southerly wind, with a scud of mist, and {{sometimes}} <b>snow,</b> <b>always</b> blew over the pass: {{but we found}} shelter on the north face, where I twice kindled a fire, and boiled my thermometers.* [On the 9th of September the boiling-point was 181.3 degrees, and on the 27th, 181.2 degrees. In both observations, I believe the kettle communicated a higher temperature to the thermometer {{than that of the}} water, for the elevations deduced are far too low.] On one occasion I felt the pulses of my party several times during two hours' repose (without eating); the mean of eight persons was 105 degrees, the extremes being 92 degrees and 120 degrees, and my own 108 degrees.|$|R
60|$|There, now, {{a little}} ahead, {{is a small}} hut, which marks {{the summit of the}} grand Scheidich. Our horses come up to it, and we dismount. Some of the party go in to sleep--I go out to climb a {{neighboring}} peak. At the foot of this peak lay a wreath of snow, soiled and dirty, as half-melted <b>snow</b> <b>always</b> is; but lying amid the green grass and luxuriant flowers, it had a strange air. It seemed a little spot of death in the green lap of rejoicing life--like that death-spot which often lies in the human heart--among all seeming flowers, cold and cheerless, unwarmed by the sunbeam, and unmelted by the ray that unfolds thousands of blooms around.|$|R
