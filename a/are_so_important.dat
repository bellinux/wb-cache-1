5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} {{with the fact that}} a Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other aircraft are kept circling until larger aircraft are parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. It {{is for this reason that}} plans to relocate the airport <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> in the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E

25|$|At first, Merengue Típico Cibaeño (traditional Cibanian merengue) {{was played}} on {{stringed}} instruments like the tres and cuatro, but when Germans {{came to the}} island in the late 19th century trading their instruments for tobacco, the accordion quickly replaced the strings as lead instrument. Típico groups play a variety of rhythms, but most common are the merengue and the pambiche. In the 1930s–50s a bass instrument was also often used. Called marimba, it resembles the Cuban marímbula, and is a large box-shaped thumb piano with 3-6 metal keys. The main percussion instruments, güira and tambora, {{have been a part}} of the ensemble since the music's inception, and <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> that they are often considered symbolic of the whole country. The güira is a metal scraper believed to be of native Taíno origin, while the tambora is a two-headed drum of African origin. Together with the European accordion, the típico group symbolizes the three cultures that combined to make today's Dominican Republic.|$|E

Both individuals and organizations have official seals, and they often have multiple seals in different sizes and styles for different situations.

Sometimes both types of seals, or large seals that bear both names and mottoes, are used to authenticate official documents.

2500|$|In his {{commentary}} on the [...] "Sefer Yetzirah", Saadia sought to render lucid and intelligible the content of this esoteric work {{by the light of}} philosophy and scientific knowledge, especially by a system of Hebrew phonology which he himself had founded.
