40|$|Natural biopolymers from plant sources contain many {{impurities}} (e. g., fat, protein, fiber, natural pigment and endogenous enzymes), therefore, {{an efficient}} purification process is recommended to minimize these impurities and consequently improve the functional {{properties of the}} biopolymer. The main objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of different purification techniques on the yield, protein content, solubility, water- and oil-holding capacity of a heteropolysaccharide-protein biopolymer obtained from durian seed. Four different purification methods using different chemicals and solvents (i. e. , A (isopropanol and ethanol), B (isopropanol and acetone), C (saturated barium hydroxide), and D (Fehling solution) ] to liberate the purified biopolymer from its crude form were compared. In most cases, the purification process significantly (p < 0. 05) improved the physicochemical properties of heteropolysaccharide-protein biopolymer from durian fruit seed. The present work showed that the precipitation using isopropanol and <b>acetone</b> (<b>Method</b> B) resulted in the highest purification yield among all the tested purification techniques.

For one method, 2 different chromatographic conditions also were used. Samples were fumigated for 7 days and aired for 2 or 7 days to obtain "aged" residues. The methods involved determination of PH 3 in the headspace over aqueous acidified acetone plus wheat (method a), over ground wheat (method b), over ground wheat plus headspace concentrations over ground wheat in acetone after transfer to another flask (method c), over ground wheat in <b>acetone</b> (<b>method</b> d), over whole wheat after microwave heating (method e), and over water after dilution of 0. 5 mL aqueous acetone leachate with 10 mL buffered sodium sulfate solution (method f).

40|$|Trace element {{analysis}} {{of human hair}} is widely used to provide an indicator of body burden, {{but there is a}} major problem associated with preparation. The washing procedure adopted before analysis represents still a critical point which deserves particular attention. This study aimed at comparing the efficiency of the most commonly used washing methods to identify the procedure which allows for satisfactory removal of external contamination alone. As results depend strongly on the element, toxic (Cd and Pb), essential trace (Cr, Cu, Se and Zn) and major (Ca, K and Mg) elements were tested. The comparison was carried out with six different methods which include use of ionic and non-ionic detergents, organic solvents, chelating agents and sonication. Removal efficiency varied according to the element and pretreatment, the highest being observed for EDTA and the lowest for sonication. Unsatisfactory results were found using an acetone/methanol mixture for the potential contamination caused by it. Organic solvents showed the highest removal efficiency for K and toxic elements, and seemed to be effective in removing a limited but significant fraction of element incorporated in the lipid matter of hair. The ionic detergent Na lauryl sulphate, instead, was more effective for essential elements, but also triggered a higher analytic variability. As detergents appear to remove only external contamination, a non-ionic detergent such as Triton X- 100 is proposed as a reliable alternative to the <b>acetone</b> <b>method</b> recommended by IAEA.

40|$|Trichoderma sp. {{grown in}} liquid medium {{produced}} a substance {{which has caused}} up to 90 % reduction in the infection capacity of the tobacco mosaic virus, measured in number of local lesions on Nicotiana glutinosa half leaf inoculations. Under the present experiments the fungus has been grown in liquid medium and the filtrates used in inactivation tests on the virus. From {{the fact that the}} liquid filtrate showed inactivation power after only two days of culture it is concluded that the inactivation is of the nature of a secretion of the fungus into the liquid medium. The inactivation proceeded within 2 minutes after mixture of the culture extract with the virus, no better results were obtained if the mixtures allowed to stand {{for a longer period of}} time. If cultures were grown in the light in the laboratory the inactivation power decreased after the second day as was found by Weindling (8), for the effect on Rhizoctonia sp. If grown in the dark the inactivator continues to increase in concentrations for at least 22 days. In the dark no spores formation could be observed. Physiological activity associated with spores formation may be the reason for the loss of inactivator in day light grown cultures where spores start to be formed after the second day of growth. Extraction of the inactivator with chloroform was attempted according to Weindling's method. The inactivator could never be completely extracted since the treated filtrate kept showing inactivation on tobacco mosaic virus. This suggests that the inactivator for the virus may be a different from the one found by Weindling against Rhizoctonia sp. By ultracentrifugation at 35, 000 r. p. m. no inactivator could be obtained from the filtrate.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of chaperonin GroEL and co-chaperonin GroES, {{there has been a}} deluge of literature investigating many aspects of the system. Substrate proteins are protected from aggregation through a cycle of capture, encapsulation, and release made possible through rigid body motions of the GroE system driven by a combination of allosteric controls influenced by nucleotide, potassium and denatured protein termed substrate protein (SP). This dissertation first explores the sequential transition of GroEL that maintains the rings operating in an alternating fashion. To do this, an intra-subunit, inter-domain mutant, GroEL D 83 A T state. Steady state ATPase assays, stopped-flow fluorescence, and gel filtration chromatography were all used to demonstrate that the trans ring must access the T state before ligands can be discharged from the cis ring. The dual-heptameric ring structure of GroEL and the post-translational assembly of the protein make creating mutants with a mutation within a single subunit of a ring almost impossible, however the ability to do so opens the opportunity for a myriad of experiments that explore the allosteric transitions of GroEL. Two potential recombination methods, acetone treatment and heat treatment, were investigated. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) were used to study recombination facilitated by such treatments. Recombination using the <b>acetone</b> <b>method</b> resulted in a one-in-one-out subunit exchange, however aggregation complicated the exchange. Heat treatment resulted in exchange of rings. Finally, dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to investigate stability and aggregation on the chaperonin. It was observed that the chaperonin is stable for over 30 days while incubated continuously at 37 °C in sterile buffered solution, however interesting aggregation kinetics are observed upon addition of acetone, the solvent used to strip SP from GroEL during the standard lab purification procedure.

30|$|The {{extracellular}} chitinase {{produced by}} R. stolonifer was extracted by Ammonium sulphate and cold <b>acetone</b> precipitation <b>method.</b> Among these two <b>methods</b> cold <b>acetone</b> precipitation <b>method</b> was found {{more suitable for}} precipitation which gives 12 fold more yield than the ammonium sulphate precipitation. Similarly Lee et al. (2009) reported precipitation of chitinase produced from Penicillium sp. LYG 0704 by using isopropanol (Lee et al. 2009). The chitinase was purified by one step purification technique using DEAE-Cellulose ion exchange column chromatography. The eluted single peak showing chitinase activity indicates that R. stolonifer produces single enzyme which hydrolyzes chitin efficiently, where as R. oligosporus produces two chitinases (Yanai et al. 1992). The purified enzyme was optimally active at pH 5.0 and temperature 30  °C which {{was similar to that}} of chitinase produced by various fungi such as Fusarium chlamydosporum (Mathivanan et al. 1998), Metarhizium anisopliae (Kang et al. 1999), Penicillium sp.

The approximate molecular weight of chitinase produced by R. stolonifer was 22  kDa, which is comparatively lower than the 50  kDa of R. oryzae (Chen et al. 2013), 68  kDa of P. ochrochloron MTCC 517 (Patil et al. 2013).

The extraction procedure requires only a single step extraction with a hexane/methanol/water mixture, followed by HPLC using a Spherisorb C 18 column, with a mobile phase consisting of acetone-water and a non-linear gradient of 50 %- 100 % <b>acetone.</b> The <b>method</b> was employed for examining the carotenoid composition observed during microaerophilic growth of R. rubrum strains, and was able to determine 18 carotenoids, 4 isoprenoid-quinones, bacteriochlorophyll a and bacteriopheophytin a as well as four different phosphatidylglycerol species of different acyl chain compositions. The analytical procedure was used to examine the dynamics of carotenoid biosynthesis in the major and minor pathways operating simultaneously in a carotenoid biosynthesis mutant of R. rubrum...|$|R
40|$|Lung {{infections in}} cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) patients {{are very serious}} and are usually fatal. Prolonged antibiotic treatment can result {{in the development of}} antibiotic resistance. Thus, studies are required to determine if traditional medicinal plants have any significant effects (i. e. antibacterial effects in this case) on certain bacteria causing lung infections in CF patients, providing possible alternative treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the effects of several Eastern Cape medicinal plants on specific bacteria causing lung infections in CF patients, for possible antibacterial activities. Four plants traditionally used to treat lung infections (Artemisia afra, Dodonaea angustifolia, Leonotis leonurus & Tulbaghia violacea), and different strains of four bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas species & Klebsiella pneumoniae), usually causing lung infections were investigated. Methanol, aqueous and <b>acetone</b> extraction <b>methods</b> were used to make extracts of the various plants chosen. A decoction of each plant was also investigated. An adapted microtitre plate method for testing the antibacterial activity of the plant extracts against the chosen bacteria was used. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each plant extract was determined by means of this method...|$|R
40|$|The Bruel and Kjaer Multi-gas Monitor Type 1302 can {{simultaneously}} {{measure up}} to five different volatile organic chemicals (VOCS) in a single air sample by using optical filters combined with a photo acoustic detection method. The monitor has previously been validated to measure VOCs in water, by purging aqueous samples into Tedlar{trademark} bags. The method used to measure VOCs in water has been adapted for use with soil. Soil samples are diluted with water and VOCs are purged with air from the resulting slurry into a Tedlar{trademark} bag. The contents of the Tedlar{trademark} bag are then analyzed with the multi-gas monitor. Data have been generated for the measurement of chloroform, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, and <b>acetone.</b> The <b>method</b> is linear for these VOCs from approximately 1 to at least 128 {mu}g/g of soil (ppM). There is no measurable cross interference of these VOCs with each other when more than one is present in a single soil sample. Contaminants other than those being measured may interfere with detection of these VOCS, so some prior site characterization is required. The method is easy to perform, rapid, reproducible, and sensitive enough for field screening applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{stoichiometry}} of chlorophyll a, pheophytin α and β-carotene in the {{photochemical reaction}} center of Photosystem II was analyzed by reversed phase {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) with methanol as the mobile phase, and by the shape of spectra of extracts in 80 % acetone. For the HPLC method the molar extinction coefficient of pheophytin a in methanol was redetermined, while for the spectroscopic method spectra of extracts in 80 % acetone were simulated by fitting with spectra of isolated chlorophyll a, pheophytin a and β-carotene in 80 % <b>acetone.</b> Both <b>methods</b> give internally consistent results, and suggest that the reaction center of Photosystem II isolated by a short Triton X- 100 treatment binds 6 chlorophyll a per 2 pheophytin a molecules. We also present evidence that prolonged exposure of the Photosystem II reaction center complex to Triton X- 100 does not result {{in the loss of}} chlorophyll from the complex. Based on a comparison with spectra reported in publications from other groups, we conclude that the chlorophyll to pheophytin ratio has previously been underestimated to sometimes very significant extents, and that, as yet, no Photosystem II reaction center particles have been purified that bind less than 5 – 6 chlorophyll a per 2 pheophytin a...|$|R
