40|$|A major {{challenge}} for the therapeutic use of many peptides and proteins is their short circulatory half-life. Albumin has an extended serum half-life of 3 weeks because of its size and FcRn-mediated recycling that prevents intracellular degradation, properties shared with IgG <b>antibodies.</b> <b>Engineering</b> the strictly pH-dependent IgG-FcRn interaction is known to extend IgG half-life. However, this principle has not been extensively explored for albumin. We have engineered human albumin by introducing single point mutations in the C-terminal end that generated a panel of variants with greatly improved affinities for FcRn. One variant (K 573 P) with 12 -fold improved affinity showed extended serum half-life in normal mice, mice transgenic for human FcRn, and cynomolgus monkeys. Importantly, favorable binding to FcRn was maintained when a single-chain fragment variable antibody was genetically fused to either the N- or the C-terminal end. The engineered albumin variants may be attractive for improving the serum half-life of biopharmaceuticals.

At present, the antibodies developed by genetic engineering to environmental hormones mainly include chimeric antibody, humanized antibody, antibody Fab, Fv antibody, single chain antibody (ScFv), and so on [53 – 56]. Xaver et al. [57] built a set of 16 different variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) chain combinations in order to investigate the interaction of VL and VH. One conclusion may be that VH was more important for binding affinity, and VL determined the sensitivity of assay. Keiko et al. [58] explained the principle that the binding affinities of VH and VL are usually weak {{in the absence of}} the antigen, while it would be strengthened in its presence. Therefore, they developed a novel transcriptional regulation system using separated VH and VL. This new method can be used in many fields such as gene therapeutics. Hideyuko et al.

40|$|In protein engineering, {{rational}} {{design and}} selection from combinatorial libraries are {{methods used to}} develop proteins with new or improved features. A very important protein for the biological sciences is the antibody that {{is used as a}} detecting agent in numerous laboratory assays. Antibodies used for these purposes are often ”man-made”, by immunising animals with the desired target, or by selections from combinatorial libraries. Naturally, antibodies are part of the immune defence protecting us from foreign attacks from e. g. bacteria or viruses. Some bacteria have evolved surface proteins that can bind to proteins abundant in the blood, like antibodies and serum albumin. By doing so, the bacteria can cover themselves in the host’s own proteins and through that evade being detected by the immune system. Two such proteins are Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus and Protein G from group C and G Streptococci. Both these proteins contain domains that bind to antibodies, one of which is denoted C 2 (from Protein G) and another B (from Protein A). The B domain have been further engineered to the Z domain. In this thesis protein engineering has been used to develop variants of the C 2 and Z domains for site-specific labelling of antibodies and for antibody purification with mild elution. By taking advantage of the domains’ inherent affinity for <b>antibodies,</b> <b>engineering</b> and design of certain amino acids or protein motifs of the domains have resulted in proteins with new properties. A photo crosslinking amino acid, p-benzoylphenylalanine, have been introduced at different positions to the C 2 domain, rendering three new protein domains {{that can be used for}} site-specific labelling of antibodies at the Fc or Fab fragment. These domains were used for labelling antibodies with lanthanides and used for detection in a multiplex immunoassay. Moreover, a library of calcium-binding loops was grafted onto the Z domain and used for selection of a domain that binds antibodies in a calcium dependent manner. This engineered protein domain can be used for the purification of antibodies using milder elution conditions, by calcium removal, as compared to traditional antibody purification. ...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{delivery}} vectors {{based on}} adeno-associated virus (AAV) are highly promising due to several desirable {{features of this}} parent virus, including a lack of pathogenicity, efficient infection of dividing and non-dividing cells, and sustained maintenance of the viral genome. However, several problems {{should be addressed to}} enhance the utility of AAV vectors, particularly those based on AAV 2, the best characterized AAV serotype.

40|$|Pediatric {{vaccines}} targeting bacterial capsular polysaccharides {{are more}} effective for certain types of bugs than others, and the manufacturing process as well as immunodominance of different glycan epitopes (glycotopes) {{can lead to a}} mixed immune response that does not protect against disease. To directly identify glycotopes that induce a protective response, Schumann et al. combined <b>antibody</b> reverse <b>engineering</b> with automated glycan assembly using Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 8 as a proof of concept. Promising glycotopes conjugated to a carrier protein induced protective antibodies in mice and were also immunogenic in rabbits. When combined with a commercially available pneumococcal vaccine, these glycoconjugates were able to boost the opsonophagocytic bacterial killing ability of sera from immunized rabbits. This approach leveraging semisynthetic glycoconjugates could lead to the design of more effective bacterial vaccines. Glycoconjugate vaccines based on capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) of pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae successfully protect from disease but suffer from incomplete coverage, are troublesome to manufacture from isolated CPSs, and lack efficacy against certain serotypes. Defined, synthetic oligosaccharides are an attractive alternative to isolated CPSs but require the identification of immunogenic and protective oligosaccharide antigens. We describe a medicinal chemistry strategy based on a combination of automated glycan assembly (AGA), glycan microarray–based monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (mAb) reverse <b>engineering,</b> and immunological evaluation in vivo to uncover a protective glycan epitope (glycotope) for S. pneumoniae serotype 8 (ST 8). All four tetrasaccharide frameshifts of ST 8 CPS were prepared by AGA and used in glycan microarray experiments to identify the glycotopes recognized by antibodies against ST 8. One tetrasaccharide frameshift that was preferentially recognized by a protective, CPS-directed mAb was conjugated to the carrier protein CRM 197. Immunization of mice with this semisynthetic glycoconjugate followed by generation and characterization of a protective mAb identified protective and nonprotective glycotopes. Immunization of rabbits with semisynthetic ST 8 glycoconjugates containing protective glycotopes induced an antibacterial immune response. Coformulation of ST 8 glycoconjugates with the marketed 13 -valent glycoconjugate vaccine Prevnar 13 yielded a potent 14 -valent S. pneumoniae vaccine. Our strategy presents a facile approach to develop efficient semisynthetic glycoconjugate vaccines...|$|R

Furthermore, additional development is required to ensure the potency of this allogeneic CAR T therapy, at least as potent as its autologous counterpart. Pursuing long-term survival of the universal CAR T cells remains important and a priority. Clinical trials and further studies of the mechanism and key molecules that are involved in the rejection of allogeneic universal T cells would help to develop strategies to achieve the goals. The development of proper pre-conditioning regimens and immune-tolerance induction strategies, such as those that have been developed for organs or bone marrow transplantation, would greatly facilitate the successful use of the allogeneic universal CAR T cells.|$|R
