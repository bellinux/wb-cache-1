40|$|This paper defines and operationalizes {{definitions}} of good <b>teaching,</b> scholarly <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> the scholarship of <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning {{in order to}} measure characteristics of these definitions amongst undergraduate instructors at McMaster University. A total of 2496 instructors, including all part-time instructors, were surveyed in 2007. A total of 339 surveys were returned. Indices of good <b>teaching,</b> scholarly <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> scholarship of <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning were developed. The data illustrated a strong correlation between good <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> scholarly <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> between scholarly <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> scholarship of <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning. The perceived value placed upon teaching varied across the different Faculties. New instructors and those engaged in scholarly <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> scholarship of <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning perceived <b>teaching</b> to be more valued than their peers.

This study {{investigates the}} effects of HIVIAIDS on educators, {{learners}} <b>and</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning situation. By means of a literature review the negative and devastating effects of HIVIAIDS on educators, learners <b>and</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning situation were highlighted. Furthermore, an empirical research was conducted with educators and learners {{to determine the extent}} of {{the effects of}} HIVIAIDS on educators, learners <b>and</b> the <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning situation.
