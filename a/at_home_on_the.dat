5|$|Feyenoord started October on {{the road}} against Vitesse Arnhem on 6 October with a 1–2 win after two first half goals by De Vrij and Pellè. Pellè's goal marked his tenth league goal this season. Their second match in October was played away in Deventer against Go Ahead Eagles on the 19th. The game ended in a 2–2 draw after Feyenoord gained the lead twice by goals of De Vrij and Immers. The team played Heracles Almelo <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 27th {{resulting}} in a 1–2 loss after a first half own goal by Nelom and second half red card for Pellè. Jean-Paul Boëtius scored the lone home goal {{at the end of}} the first half in Feyenoord's first ever home defeat against Heracles. Feyenoord played their last game of the month in the KNVB Cup against HSV Hoek <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 30th. They won this third round match 3–0 against the Hoofdklasse side due to a Vandepitte own goal and further goals by Bakkal and Te Vrede.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
5|$|Early in January Feyenoord {{announced}} they parted ways with Cissé. On 5 January, the club played a charity match in De Kuip against Excelsior to support cancer research. They won 1–0 after a late goal by Vilhena. After this friendly {{they went to}} Marbella for a one-week training camp which ended with the second and last friendly of the winter break. They lost this game 0–1 against reigning Swiss champion FC Basel. Feyenoord resumed the season on 19 January with a 5–2 away win against FC Utrecht in {{a game in which}} the club trailed twice. Schaken scored both in the first and second half; Pellè, De Vrij and Vilhena all added to the scoreline once. On 22 January, Feyenoord got knocked out of the KNVB Cup in the quarter-finals in a 3–1 loss to Ajax. The following Saturday Feyenoord lost 3–2 away at ADO Den Haag. Feyenoord's last match of the month was played <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 31st against Vitesse Arnhem. The match ended in a 1–1 draw after a first half goal by Pellè.|$|E

25|$|On March 3, 2015, Montreal {{became the}} first Canadian team, and only the second MLS team (after the 2013 Seattle Sounders FC) to {{eliminate}} a Liga MX side from the CONCACAF Champions League knockout stage when they eliminated Pachuca on away goals. They drew the first leg 2–2 in Pachuca and drew 1–1 <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> return leg, sending the Impact through on away goals. On April 29, 2015, Montreal {{became the first}} Canadian team to reach the CONCACAF Champions League Final where they lost to Club América, after a 1–1 draw at Estadio Azteca and a 4–2 loss in front of 61,004 fans at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal.|$|E
25|$|The city of Basel and {{the city}} of Zürich have a long-standing rivalry. Therefore, FCB's most {{traditional}} and fiercest rivals are Grasshopper Club Zürich and FC Zürich. In the past few seasons, the rivalry between FC Zürich and Basel has been fueled by Zürich's narrow league championship wins over Basel. Supporters from both sides have caused trouble in the past years, with the worst incident happening in May 2006. Basel had won the league in 2003–04 and 2004–05 and were set to make it three in a row if they won or drew against Zürich <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last day of the 2005–06 season. Zürich took the lead after a late goal from Iulian Filipescu and consequently won the match and the league. After the final whistle, players and fans from both teams started fighting on the pitch and in the stands. This incident has fueled hatred and bitterness between fans from FC Zürich and FC Basel. There is controversy about which rivalry is bigger, the one with Grasshopper or FC Zürich, but it usually depends on the success of these teams.|$|E
25|$|FCB {{were drawn}} into Group C {{alongside}} Barcelona, Shakhtar Donetsk and Sporting CP. Basel lost their opening game 2–1 at St. Jakob-Park on 16 September against Shakhtar. Fernandinho put the Ukrainians ahead on 25 minutes before Jádson doubled their lead just before half time. David Abraham scored a late consolation {{goal for the}} home team. Sporting CP were the opponents on Matchday 2 (1 October) and despite defending well and causing a few scares {{at the other end}} of the park, Basel were defeated 2–0 at the Estádio José Alvalade. On Matchday 3 (22 October), Barcelona visited Basel and came away with a 5–0 win, but a fortnight later it was a different story as FCB came away with a respectable 1–1 draw at the Camp Nou, with Eren Derdiyok scoring a late equaliser after Lionel Messi put Barça ahead. On 26 November, Basel travelled to Ukraine to play Shakhtar, where they were thrashed 5–0. Basel then faced Sporting <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final Matchday (9 December) and were defeated 1–0.|$|E

500|$|Some historians, such as Zabecki and Peter Lieb, {{also take}} issue with Rommel's absence from Normandy {{on the day of}} the Allied invasion, 6 June 1944.

500|$|Ponting {{started his}} 1994–95 {{campaign}} with a century against eventual Shield champions Queensland in Brisbane, {{in a performance}} that impressed Queensland captain Allan Border, who had just retired from international cricket after leading the national team for a decade. Border said of Ponting: [...] "He's just an outstanding prospect. The thing I like about him is he's very aggressive, he plays all the shots, he's equally <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front foot as the back foot. He cuts and pulls well, and he drives well. You don't often see that, {{the ability to get}} on [...] front foot and back foot and play equally well." ...|$|E
500|$|LocoRoco was {{envisioned by}} Tsutomu Kouno, who had {{previously}} work on development of Ico. While on a train during {{the second quarter of}} 2004, Kouno had used a PDA to sketch a game that would involve multiple similar characters that would not be in direct control of the player. He realized the planet-tilting aspect after seeing how rotating the phone with the sketch around would lead to a compelling game. At that time, the PlayStation Portable was nearing release, and Kouno felt the unit's shoulder buttons would be appropriate for the tilting controls. Kouno also opted to develop for the PSP to break the mold of other, more complicated sequels from PlayStation 2 games that were being developed for the unit and instead create something that [...] "really seemed <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PSP". Kouno also wanted [...] "every aspect of the game [...] to be unique", and led to his choices for graphics and music in the game.|$|E

500|$|Lohan {{returned}} to Disney in 2005, {{starring in the}} comedy , the fifth film in the series with the anthropomorphic car Herbie. Fully Loaded earned $144million worldwide, but it received mixed reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times called Lohan [...] "a genuine star who ... seems completely <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen", while James Berardinelli wrote that [...] "as bright a starlet as she may be, Lohan ends up playing second fiddle to the car." [...] While shooting the film in 2004, Lohan was hospitalized with a kidney infection brought on by stress in her personal life and from recording her first album while the film was in production, prompting Vanity Fair to label it Lohan's [...] "first disastrous shoot.". She also guest-starred in an episode of That '70s Show, of whose cast Wilmer Valderrama, her boyfriend at the time, was a regular member. According to Vanity Fair, the breakup with Valderrama contributed to Lohan's issues during the Herbie shoot. In 2005, Lohan became {{the first person to}} have a My Scene celebrity doll released by Mattel. She also voiced herself in the animated direct-to-DVD film My Scene Goes Hollywood, based on the series of dolls.|$|E
500|$|Halo Wars {{garnered}} generally positive reviews. The {{game has}} {{an average of}} 82/100 on aggregate web site Metacritic. Critics were split on whether Halo Wars was a successful console translation of the RTS genre. GameSpy's Allen Rausch argued that, as [...] showed that first-person shooters could work on consoles, Halo Wars [...] "is an RTS ... on a console ... and it works". Tom Price of TeamXbox said that gamers have been waiting {{a long time for}} a console RTS [...] "to get it right", and Halo Wars did so; reviewers for Official Xbox Magazine credited Ensemble with creating a strategy game that felt [...] "absolutely <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> console", rather than a [...] "poorly shoehorned ... port" [...] of a PC game with clumsy controls. 1UP's Thierry Nguyen was neutral about whether it was a good RTS game or Halo title, but called it a [...] "solid beginning towards what could be a really good console RTS". Digital Trends' Scott Steinberg said that, while not perfect, Halo Wars made a strong case for the viability of RTS on consoles; [...] "There's certainly the potential to have PC holdouts seriously reconsidering hoisting the controller." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle offered a dismissive summation of the game as [...] "a remedial game—real-time strategy for dummies", and stated that the game offered relatively little innovation when compared to other Halo titles.|$|E
