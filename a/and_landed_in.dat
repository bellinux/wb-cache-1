5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E

5|$|The {{airstrip}} at Kaiapit was reconnoitred on 11 September 1943 by No. 4 Squadron RAAF, which {{reported that}} it was apparently in good condition, with the Kunai grass recently cut. Lieutenant Everette E. Frazier, USAAF, selected a level, burned-off area near the Leron River, not far from Kaiapit, <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> an L-4 Piper Cub.

5|$|According to {{historical}} records, the first spaniel {{was brought to}} North America aboard the Mayflower which sailed from Plymouth, England <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> New England in 1620. The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and {{is now known as}} the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip). Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> the seat beside Ford. It did not go off and he was not injured.|$|E
5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> the street below. Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up}} by a passerby who gave it to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the South Tower collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a folding knife, and pepper spray. In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E

5|$|The Netherlands {{was a world}} {{military}} and commercial power by 1625, competing in the Caribbean with the English. The Dutch wanted to establish a military stronghold in the area, and dispatched Captain Boudewijn Hendricksz (also known as Boudoyno Henrico or Balduino Enrico) to capture Puerto Rico. On September 24, 1625, Enrico arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men. Enrico {{sent a message to}} the governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haros, ordering him to surrender the island. De Haros refused; he was an experienced military man and expected an attack in the section known as Boqueron. He therefore had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> La Puntilla.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier saw {{action in}} war again {{when it was}} {{deployed}} in the 1992–1995 conflict in Bosnia, part of the Yugoslav Wars. It launched raids on Serb forces and provided air-support for the international taskforce units conducting Operations Deny Flight and Deliberate Force against the Army of Republika Srpska. On 16 April 1994, a Sea Harrier of the 801 Naval Air Squadron, operating from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal, was brought down by a Igla-1 surface-to-air missile fired by the Army of Republika Srpska while attempting to bomb two Bosnian Serb tanks. The pilot, Lieutenant Nick Richardson, ejected <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> territory controlled by friendly Bosnian Muslims.|$|E

It departed at 18:22 for Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where it picked up 31 additional passengers. At 19:12 it departed for Baltimore, Maryland, where it picked up a final group of 17 passengers and departed for South Carolina at 20:30. During these flight segments, as he would later testify at the CAB hearing, the flight engineer opened the cross feed valves between the number three and four engines, since {{he had seen a}} drop in fuel pressure on the number 3 fuel pressure gauge after the initial takeoff from Columbia.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, Grant {{and his family}} stayed with Fish in Washington for two months before setting out on a world tour that lasted {{approximately}} {{two and a half}} years. Preparing for the tour, they arrived in Philadelphia on May 10, 1877, and were honored with celebrations during the week before their departure. On May 16, Grant and Julia left for England aboard the SS Indiana. During the tour the Grants made stops in Europe, the Mediterranean the Holy Land and points in the Middle East, meeting with notable dignitaries, such as Queen Victoria, Pope Leo XIII, Otto von Bismarck, Emperor Meiji and others. Grant was the first U.S. President to visit Jerusalem and the Holy Land. During the tour, supported by the Hayes administration transported on naval ships, Grant assumed an unprecedented diplomatic capacity, unofficially representing the United States to strengthen American interests abroad, while resolving issues for some countries in the process. Homesick, the Grants left Japan sailing on the City of Tokio escorted by a Japanese man-of-war, crossed the Pacific <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds.|$|E
5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E
5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> the gutter as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. The new king, Edward VIII, saw it fall and wondered whether it was a bad omen for his new reign. As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, Edward, Albert, Henry, and George, mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral. The vigil was not repeated until the death of George's daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936. Edward abdicated before the year was out, leaving his brother Albert, Duke of York, to ascend the throne (taking the regnal name George VI).|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} planned to send the brigade—which had been renamed the 1st Commando Brigade in late 1944—to India, however, {{the effect of the}} German Ardennes Offensive {{prevented}} this and in January 1945, still under the command of Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts, they crossed the English Channel by sea <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands from where they were deployed to Asten on the Maas. By the time they arrived the German advance had been largely halted and it was not until 23 January that the brigade was engaged in any large-scale operations. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Lewis, that night No. 6 Commando joined Operation Blackcock. Lewis had taken over from Courtenay-Coade after the latter had experienced complications from the head injury he had suffered in France earlier. As part of Blackcock, the unit advanced over the ice-covered Juliana Canal and took up positions at Maasbracht, in support of No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando's advance on St. Joostburg.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1943, the British Eighth Army, {{under the}} command of General Bernard Montgomery, crossed the Straits of Messina from Sicily <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> Calabria during Operation Baytown to seize the ports of Reggio and San Giovanni. The main {{invasion}} was planned for 9 September, with the U.S. Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark Clark, landing at Salerno on the western coast in Operation Avalanche, with Naples as their immediate objective. The Allies hoped that the invasion would persuade the Italian forces to surrender. If they did, the five Italian divisions in France and the twenty-nine in the Balkans would have to be replaced by German formations. Also, if the Germans then decided to continue the fight in Italy, they would have to redeploy some of their troops engaged on the Eastern Front or on occupation duties in France.|$|E
5|$|Press {{reports of}} the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because of {{misinformation}} disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of the Venus was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's attention to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited {{by the idea of}} leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio <b>and</b> <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there made his way back to London.|$|E
