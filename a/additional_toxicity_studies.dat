40|$|Carbon nanotubes, {{owing to}} their electrical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties, {{are one of}} the most {{promising}} nanomaterials for the electronics, computer, and aerospace industries. More recently, these unique materials are finding their niche in neuroscience. Here, we discuss the use of carbon nanotubes as scaffolds for neuronal growth. The chemical properties of carbon nanotubes can be systematically varied by attaching different functional groups. Such functionalized carbon nanotubes can be used to control the outgrowth and branching pattern of neuronal processes. We also discuss electrical interactions between neurons and carbon nanotubes. The electrical properties of nanotubes can provide a mechanism to monitor or stimulate neurons through the scaffold itself. The ease of which carbon nanotubes can be patterned makes them attractive for studying the organization of neural networks and has the potential to develop new devices for neural prosthesis. We note that <b>additional</b> <b>toxicity</b> <b>studies</b> of carbon nanotubes are necessary so that exposure guidelines and safety regulations can be set...|$|E
40|$|Although {{ketoconazole}} (KCZ) {{has been}} used worldwide for 30 years, its metabolic characteristics are poorly described. Moreover, the hepatotoxicity of KCZ limits its therapeutic use. In this study, we used liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to evaluate the metabolic profile of KCZ in mouse and human and identify the mechanisms underlying its hepatotoxicity. A total of 28 metabolites of KCZ, 11 of which were novel, were identified in this study. Newly identified metabolites were classified into three categories according to the metabolic positions of a piperazine ring, imidazole ring, and N-acetyl moiety. The metabolic characteristics of KCZ in human were comparable to those in mouse. Moreover, three cyanide adducts of KCZ were identified in mouse and human liver microsomal incubates as “flags” to trigger <b>additional</b> <b>toxicity</b> <b>study.</b> The oxidation of piperazine into iminium ion is suggested as a biotransformation responsible for bioactivation. In summary, the metabolic characteristics of KCZ, including reactive metabolites, were comprehensively understood using a metabolomics approach...|$|R
40|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} (AgNPs) {{are well}} known for their excellent antibacterial ability and superior physical properties, and are widely used in {{a growing number of}} applications ranging from home disinfectants and medical devices to water purificants. However, with the accelerating production and introduction of AgNPs into commercial products, there is likelihood of release into the environment, which raises health and environmental concerns. This article provides a critical review of the state-of-knowledge about AgNPs, involving the history, analysis, source, fate and transport, and potential risks of AgNPs. Although great efforts have been made in each of these aspects, there are still many questions to be answered to reach a comprehensive understanding of the positive and negative effects of AgNPs. In order to fully investigate the fate and transport of AgNPs in the environment, appropriate methods for the preconcentration, separation and speciation of AgNPs should be developed, and analytical tools for the characterization and detection of AgNPs in complicated environmental samples are also urgently needed. To elucidate the environmental transformation of AgNPs, the behavior of AgNPs should be thoroughly monitored in complex environmental relevant conditions. Furthermore, <b>additional</b> in vivo <b>toxicity</b> <b>studies</b> should be carried out to understand the exact toxicity mechanism of AgNPs, and to predict the health effects to humans...|$|R

30|$|Nanotechnology is {{subjected}} to inordinate progress in various fronts especially to make innovations in healthcare. Target-selective drug delivery and approaches for molecular imaging are the areas of prime importance for research where nanotechnology is playing a progressive role. This review provides readers with a wide vision on novel ongoing potentialities of various nanotechnology-based approaches for imaging and delivery of therapeutics. In order to obtain effective drug delivery, nanotechnology-based imaging has enabled us to apprehend the interactions of nanomaterials with biological environment, targeting receptors, molecular mechanisms involved in pathophysiology of diseases, and has made the real time monitoring of therapeutic response possible. Development of analytical technologies to measure the size of particles in nanometer ranges, and advent of latest manufacturing approaches for nanomaterials, has resulted in establishment of more effective methods for delivery of therapeutics {{for the treatment of}} ophthalmological, pulmonary, cardiovascular diseases, and more importantly cancer therapy. These new drug therapies have already been shown to cause fewer side effects and be more effective than traditional therapies. Furthermore, the imaging techniques have enhanced the determination of tumor location in human bodies and their selective targeting. Altogether, this comparatively new and thriving data suggest that <b>additional</b> clinical and <b>toxicity</b> <b>studies</b> are required further on the “proof-of-concept” phase. Nanomedicine cost and manufacturing at larger scale is also a matter of concern that needs to be addressed. Notwithstanding, future of nanomedicines is propitious.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The study {{characterizes the}} impact of obesity on {{postoperative}} radiation-associated toxicities in women with endometrial cancer (EC). Material and Methods. A retrospective study identified 96 women with EC referred to a large urban institution’s radiation oncology practice for postoperative whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) and/or intracavitary vaginal brachytherapy (ICBT). Demographic and clinicopathologic data were obtained. Toxicities were graded according to RTOG Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. Follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 11 years (median 2 years). Data were analyzed by χ 2, logistic regression, and recursive partitioning analyses. Results. 68 EC patients who received WPRT and/or ICBT were analyzed. Median age was 52 years (29 – 73). The majority were Hispanic (71 %). Median BMI at diagnosis was 34. 5 [*]kg/m 2 (20. 5 – 56. 6 [*]kg/m 2). BMI was independently associated with radiation-related cutaneous (p= 0. 022) and gynecologic-related (p= 0. 027) toxicities. Younger women also reported more gynecologic-related toxicities (p= 0. 039). Adjuvant radiation technique was associated with increased gastrointestinal- and genitourinary-related toxicities but not gynecologic-related toxicity. Conclusions. Increasing BMI was associated with increased frequency of gynecologic and cutaneous radiation-associated <b>toxicities.</b> <b>Additional</b> <b>studies</b> to critically evaluate the radiation treatment dosing and treatment fields in obese EC patients are warranted to identify strategies to mitigate the radiation-associated toxicities in these women...|$|R
