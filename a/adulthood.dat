5|$|Holmboe married twice. His first wife, Nikoline Antonie Finkenhagen, born 1804 in Toten, died in 1839 {{after five}} years of marriage. They had three daughters, two of whom (Fredrikke and Nikoline, Jr.) reached <b>adulthood,</b> and one {{stillborn}} son. He married his second wife, Ingeborg Thorp in 1842. She was born in 1812 in Voss. This marriage produced two sons, Christopher and Jens, and two daughters, Cathrine and Olava. Only Jens and Cathrine reached <b>adulthood.</b>|$|E

5|$|A sequel, , was {{released}} in 2002. A second sequel, , {{was released}} in 2005. The story continues a decade later with Anakin Skywalker now grown to <b>adulthood</b> with the character now played by Hayden Christensen.|$|E
5|$|Females {{can produce}} up to 185,000 eggs, and larvae develop {{offshore}} {{in several stages}} before their final moult to juvenile crabs in the intertidal zone. Young crabs live among seaweeds and seagrasses, such as Posidonia oceanica, until they reach <b>adulthood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into <b>adulthood</b> (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.|$|E
5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to <b>adulthood,</b> Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to <b>adulthood.</b> The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, two of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's {{children}} were still living. Karl Egon, as the surviving son, inherited the title Prince of Fürstenberg; {{he and his}} eldest sister lived into <b>adulthood</b> and produced families.|$|E
5|$|Kimball's {{presidency}} saw large {{growth in}} the LDS Church, {{both in terms of}} membership and the number of temples. Kimball was the first church president to state publicly that the church expects all able-bodied male members to serve missions in young <b>adulthood,</b> resulting in an increase in missionary service.|$|E
5|$|Kittens may {{be taken}} by several predators, {{including}} owls, eagles, foxes, coyotes, and bears, {{as well as other}} adult male bobcats; when prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach <b>adulthood.</b> Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reportedly observed preying on bobcats.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they reach}} <b>adulthood</b> most adult cicada species live for around another {{two to four}} weeks. During this time they feed on flowing sap from tree branches, and mating and egg laying occurs.|$|E
5|$|Sanaubar is Ali's {{wife and}} the mother of Hassan. Shortly after Hassan's birth, she runs away from home and joins a group of {{traveling}} dancers. She later returns to Hassan in his <b>adulthood.</b> To make up for her neglect, she provides a grandmother figure for Sohrab, Hassan's son.|$|E
5|$|The Feast for Fire/The Feast for Water. These feast {{days are}} usually taken as being {{when a child}} hits puberty and steps unto the path of <b>adulthood.</b> The Feast for Fire is celebrated for a male, and the Feast for Water for a female.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of many stick insects, {{including}} Timema, {{are attractive}} to ants, who carry them away to their burrows {{to feed on}} the egg's capitulum, while leaving {{the rest of the}} egg intact to hatch. The emerging nymph passes through six or seven instars before reaching <b>adulthood.</b>|$|E
5|$|A prophecy {{says that}} Troy will not fall if Troilus lives into <b>adulthood.</b> So the goddess Athena {{encourages}} the Greek warrior Achilles to seek him out {{early in the}} Trojan War. The youth is known to take great delight in his horses. Achilles ambushes him and his sister Polyxena when he has ridden with her for water from a well in the Thymbra – an area outside Troy {{where there is a}} temple of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Arundel was {{considered}} a great soldier by his contemporaries. He had been a successful commander in France, {{in a period of}} decline for the English, and his death was a great loss to his country. He was succeeded by his son Humphrey, who did not live to <b>adulthood.</b> The title of Earl of Arundel then went to John's younger brother William.|$|E
5|$|Ashley-Cooper {{was educated}} at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. As a child, his primary pursuits outside of getting an education, {{included}} mountain climbing and skiing. He also expressed {{a love of}} music, which continued into <b>adulthood</b> with his service {{as chairman of the}} London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1966 to 1980. On 8 March 1947, his father died unexpectedly of a heart disease and Ashley-Cooper became heir to the titles held by his grandfather and acquired the courtesy title of Lord Ashley.|$|E
5|$|By {{featuring}} {{the life of}} John of Lancaster from early childhood to young <b>adulthood,</b> Heyer conveys a full glimpse of medieval life – court intrigues {{as well as the}} lives of ordinary people are part of the story. Furthermore, while near to major historical players, John's apartness from power allows Heyer to create a fuller depiction of his life without having to change major historical events.|$|E
5|$|By most {{accounts}} Allen's first marriage was an unhappy one. His wife was rigidly religious, prone to criticizing him, and {{barely able to}} read and write. In contrast, Allen's behavior was sometimes quite flamboyant; and he maintained an interest in learning. In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783. Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, and Pamela), only two of whom reached <b>adulthood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and {{only a small percentage}} of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach <b>adulthood.</b> The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Catherine de' Medici married Henry, Duke of Orléans, {{the future}} Henry II of France, in Marseille on 28 October 1533. She {{gave birth to}} ten {{children}}, seven of whom survived to <b>adulthood.</b> Three of her sons became Kings of France, her eldest and her two sons whom were born after Louis; two of her daughters married kings; and one married a duke. Catherine outlived all her children except Henry III, who died seven months after her, and Margaret, who inherited her robust health.|$|E
5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach <b>adulthood,</b> Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching <b>adulthood.</b> Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.|$|E
5|$|Early {{speech or}} {{behavioral}} interventions can help {{children with autism}} gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching <b>adulthood,</b> though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{families}} {{is critical in}} developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping the family to cope improves outcomes in children. Prognosis may be improved by diagnosis {{at a younger age}} that allows for early interventions, while interventions in <b>adulthood</b> are valuable but less beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Cady Stanton, {{the eighth}} of eleven children, {{was born in}} Johnstown, New York, to Daniel Cady and Margaret Livingston Cady. Five of her {{siblings}} died in early childhood or infancy. A sixth sibling, her older brother Eleazar, died at age 20 just before his graduation from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Only Elizabeth Cady and four sisters lived well into <b>adulthood</b> and old age. Later in life, Elizabeth named her two daughters after two of her sisters, Margaret and Harriot.|$|E
5|$|Eystein Magnusson (Old Norse: Eysteinn Magnússon, Norwegian: Øystein Magnusson; c. 1088 – 29 August 1123) was King of Norway (as Eystein I) from 1103 to 1123 {{together}} with his brothers Sigurd the Crusader and Olaf Magnusson, although since Olaf died before <b>adulthood,</b> only Eystein and Sigurd were effective rulers of the country.|$|E
5|$|Gryllus firmus {{exhibits}} wing polymorphism; {{some individuals}} have fully functional, long hind wings {{and others have}} short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development, and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during <b>adulthood</b> and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.|$|E
5|$|Hinde married Mary Todd Hubbard, the {{daughter}} of Benjamin Hubbard, an English merchant, and they were married for 61 years. They had eight children that lived to <b>adulthood.</b> His daughter Ann Winston Hinde married Richard Southgate on July 30, 1799, in Newport, Kentucky. Hinde {{and his family were}} members of the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church in Newport, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|His career prospering, in 1838 Mallory courted and wed Angela Moreno, {{a member}} of a wealthy Spanish-speaking family living in Pensacola. Their {{marriage}} produced nine children, five of whom died young; surviving into <b>adulthood</b> were daughters Margaret ("Maggie") and Ruby, and sons Stephen R. Jr. ("Buddy"), and Attila ("Attie"). Buddy followed his father into politics, and he would eventually also serve as U.S. Senator from Florida.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{insects that}} go through {{incomplete}} metamorphosis are called nymphs {{or in the}} case of dragonflies and damselflies, also naiads. Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings, which are not developed until <b>adulthood.</b> With each molt, nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects.|$|E
5|$|In <b>adulthood,</b> Braille {{served as}} a {{professor}} at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely spent the remainder of his life refining and extending his system. It went unused by most educators for many years after his death, but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility {{has been shown to be}} a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to <b>adulthood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Invisible Circles is {{a concept}} album about the {{dynamics}} of quarrelsome families and psychological child abuse. The theme was inspired by guitarist Sander Gommans' work as an art teacher, {{in direct contact with}} dysfunctional families and teen-age problems. It is also a metal opera, with a storyline that follows the lives of an abused child and her parents since her conception to <b>adulthood.</b> The album was received with mixed reviews, but entered the charts in the Netherlands and Belgium.|$|E
