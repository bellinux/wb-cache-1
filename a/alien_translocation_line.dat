40|$|The {{chromosomes}} {{involved in}} twenty reciprocal translocations in G. hirsutum were reidentified {{by means of}} a specially designed crossing program. Each <b>translocation</b> <b>line</b> was crossed to appropriate monosomic, monotelodisomic, and/or <b>translocation</b> <b>lines.</b> The F₁ hybrids were then scored cytologically to verify the original chromosome identification. These twenty reciprocal translocations now become the cytogenetic tester set for G. hirsutum. Seed stocks for each verified <b>translocation</b> <b>line</b> will be maintained at, and distributed by, the University of Arizona. Nineteen of the twenty heterozygous translocations had a modal chiasma frequency per quadrivalent of four. Fourteen of these <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> formed predominantly ring multivalents at MI, and the remaining five translocations usually formed multivalents with at least one interstitial chiasma. One <b>translocation</b> <b>line,</b> which was originally produced by an interspecies cross, formed predominantly chains at MI. This increased amount of chaining in the quadrivalent is probably the result of interspecific chromosome material within the translocation reducing the chiasma frequency. The orientation of the centromeres in quadrivalents is influenced {{by the size of the}} chromosomes involved in the reciprocal translocation, and the constraints imposed by the chiasmata within the chromosome arms. Ten of the twenty reciprocal translocations studied formed predominantly alternate orientations at MI. Eight of these ten <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> were reciprocal <b>translocations</b> between two A subgenome chromosomes. This suggests that the large A subgenome chromosomes allow the quadrivalent to be more flexible, resulting in easy reorientation to the stable alternate configuration. Proximal chiasma formation influences the orientation and probable involvement of the homologous centromeres in spindle formation. Lines in which a high frequency of multivalents with interstitial chiasma were observed had a significantly lower frequency of multivalents with either one or two centromeres not involved in spindle formation of 3 : 1 orientations. In most of the heterozygous translocations, identification of each chromosome within the quadrivalent at MI was not possible.

The meiotic pairing behaviour of wheat 9 barley hybrids is presented, with special regard to the detection of wheat– barley homoeologous pairing using the molecular cytogenetic technique GISH. The effect of in vitro multiplication on the genome composition of intergeneric hybrids is discussed, and the production and characterization of the latest wheat/barley <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> are presented. An overview of the agronomical traits (b-glucan content, earliness, salt tolerance, sprouting resistance, etc.) of the newly developed introgression lines is given. The exploitation and possible use of wheat/barley introgression lines for the most up-to-date molecular genetic studies (transcriptome analysis, sequencing of flow-sorted chromosomes) are also discussed...|$|R

Analysis of the root tips and acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated {{that all of the}} male sterile lines and their maintainer lines were 1 BL/ 1 RS <b>translocation</b> <b>lines,</b> whereas the restorer lines were non- 1 BL/ 1 RS <b>translocation</b> <b>lines.</b> Furthermore, the chromosomes of 1 BL/ 1 RS wheat lines with T. aestivum cytoplasm and Aegilops cytoplasm (include Ae. kotschyi, Ae. ventricosa, Ae. variabilis) paired abnormally at different rates during meiotic metaphase I (MMI). The translocated segment size of the 1 RS chromosome and the specific nuclear–alloplasm interaction impaired the pairing of homologous chromosome in the background of the specific Aegilops cytoplasm at MMI. In addition, the frequency of abnormal chromosomal pairing was directly affected by the frequency of haploid production induced by parthenogenesis. The results of this study provide significant insights into the mechanism of parthenogenesis, which is probably due to the abnormal fertilization of synergid cells in alloplasmic 1 BL/ 1 RS wheat...|$|R
40|$|Wheat-rye translocations {{involving}} 1 RS and 2 RL of rye are {{the most}} useful sources of genes for disease resistance in wheat breeding. Rye genes are known to control resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Wheat-rye translocations {{have been widely used}} by breeders all over the world because genes located on translocated chromosome arms or fragments from the rye genome can determine a number of useful traits in wheat, such as high yield, wide adaptation, diseases and pest resistance. The wheat-rye <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> used in this study were derived from a cross between the Swedish bread wheat variety Topper and the line KR 99 - 139 being homozygous for the two different wheat-rye translocations 1 BL/ 1 RS and 2 RL/ 2 BS. BC 1 F 1 materials were obtained through one back-cross with either the line KR 99 - 139 or the variety Topper. Thereafter, BC 1 F 2 and BC 1 F 3 were obtained by once and twice selfing. In the obtained material, it was thereafter possible to define four different possible homozygous <b>translocation</b> combinations. Thus, <b>lines</b> containing both 1 RS and 2 RL translocations, containing only 1 RS or 2 RL and without any translocation were identified. For identification of the four possible homozygous wheat-rye <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> mentioned above, three different methods were used. First, lines of different types were characterized and isolated based on a phenotypical marker, i. e. if the plant showed red or green coleoptile colour. Plants with homozygous presence of 2 RL were known to develop red coleoptile, as a gene for red coleoptile has been verified to be present at 2 RL in these lines. The analyses of coleoptile colours were done in the BC 1 F 2 (obtained from selfed BC 1 F 1 lines determined by molecular markers at BAZ, Germany to be 1 RS– –/ 2 RL+–) and BC 1 F 3 (obtained from the BC 1 F 2 lines having a red coleoptile) wheat-rye <b>translocation</b> <b>lines,</b> where the variety Topper had been used for backcrossing. Moreover, the BC 1 F 2 (obtained from selfed BC 1 F 1 lines determined by molecular markers at BAZ, Germany to be 1 RS++/ 2 RL+–) wheat-rye <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> for which the KR 99 - 139 line was used for backcrossing, was selfed, and analyses of coleoptile colours were done in the BC 1 F 3 (on a representative sample of all combinations of presence and absence of 2 RL). The results from the coleoptiles colour analyses generally showed {{that it was possible to}} distinguish lines having 2 RL++ (red coleoptiles) and 2 RL– – (green coleoptiles). 7 Plants having 2 RL+– were sometimes classified as having green and sometimes as having red coleoptiles. Therefore, if coleoptiles colour is going to be used for selection of lines with presence/absence of 2 RL in homozygous form, at least two generations have to be analyzed and lines not segregating in either of the analyses can be judged as being homozygous as related to their coleoptiles colour. For identification of lines with presence of heterozygous 1 RS+– and homozygous 2 RL++ rye chromosome the Giemsa C-banding technique was used. The Giemsa C-banding techniques on the BC 1 F 3 segregating population generally resulted in well-defined sharp, distinct bands in the wheat-rye <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> and both the rye chromosome arms, 1 RS and 2 RL were identified. Additionally, five microsatellite (SSR) markers SCM 9, SCM 39, SCM 43, SCM 69 and SCM 75 were used for verification of the presence of 1 RS and 2 RL. Among the five SSR markers, SCM 9 and SCM 75 resulted in reliable amplification of expected products, 220 bp and 191 bp respectively. The line KR 99 - 139 containing both 1 RS and 2 RL showed correct amplification products with both mentioned primers while the bread wheat variety Topper without any rye chromosome showed no amplification with both SSR primers pairs. Resistance towards yellow rust and stem rust were evaluated through seedling resistance test in the greenhouse (Global Rust Reference Center, Denmark) to Puccinia striiformis, and adult plant resistance to Puccinia graminis, race Ug 99 (TTKSK) in Njoro, Kenya. For the seedling resistance test, pathogenicity of 17 races/isolates of yellow rust was used. The BC 1 F 3 which carries combination of 1 RS++/ 2 RL++, 1 RS++/ 2 RL+– and the KR 99 - 139 were found to be highly resistant to some races/isolates whether the variety Topper was fully susceptible to all races/isolates. The results showed Yr 9 to be one possible gene that could be responsible for the obtained yellow rust resistance. However, the results were not that clear so than not other possible genes could also be an alternative. For adult plant resistance towards Ug 99, a total of 28 of the BC 1 F 3 wheat-rye <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> and their parents were evaluated in the field of Njoro, Kenya. The results indicated that out of the 30 tested lines 20 were susceptible, 8 moderately susceptible to susceptible and in 2 lines the resistance to Ug 99 was identified. The two BC 1 F 3 wheat-rye <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> that were found to be resistant towards Ug 99 were both being homozygous for 1 RS++ and heterozygous for 2 RL+–. Thus, these results indicated presence of several genes/QTLs controlling resistance indicating possible epistatic effects of the genes involved. The lines identified as resistant will be utilized in combination with Tajik germplasm 8 to develop a mapping population for determining the underlying basis of resistance. To summarize results from the research outlined in this thesis indicate that wheat-rye <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> and used methods can be highly relevant for wheat breeding programs and further research...|$|R

40|$|A new wheat-Thinopyrum <b>translocation</b> <b>line</b> CH 13 - 21 was {{selected}} from the progenies derived from a cross between wheat-Th. intermedium partial amphiploid TAI 7047 and wheat line Mianyang 11. CH 13 - 21 was characterized by using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), multicolor-GISH (mc-GISH), multicolor-fluorescence in situ hybridization (mc-FISH) and chromosome-specific molecular markers. When inoculated with stripe rust and powdery mildew isolates, CH 13 - 21 displayed novel resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust which inherited from its Thinopyrum parent. The chromosomal counting analyses indicated that CH 13 - 21 has 42 chromosomes, with normal bivalent pairing at metaphase I of meiosis. GISH probed by Th. intermedium genomic DNA showed that CH 13 - 21 contained a pair of wheat-Th. intermedium translocated chromosomes. Sequential mc-FISH analyses probed by pSc 119. 2 and pAs 1 clearly revealed that chromosome arm 6 BS of CH 13 - 21 was replaced by Thinopyrum chromatin in the translocation chromosome. The molecular markers analysis further confirmed that the introduced Th. intermedium chromatin in CH 13 - 21 belonged to the long arm of homoeologous group 6 chromosome. Therefore, CH 13 - 21 was a new T 6 BS. 6 Ai# 1 L compensating Robertsonian <b>translocation</b> <b>line.</b> It concludes that CH 13 - 21 is a new genetic resource for wheat breeding programs providing novel variation for disease resistances...|$|R
40|$|Background: Wheat 1 BL/ 1 RS <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> {{are planted}} {{around the world}} for their disease {{resistance}} and high yield. Most of them are poor in bread making, which is partially caused by ω-secalins that are encoded by the ω-secalin gene family, which is located on the short arm of rye chromosome 1 R (1 RS). However, information on the structure and evolution of the ω-secalin gene family is still limited. Results: We first generated a physical map of the ω-secalin gene family covering 195  kb of the Sec- 1 locus based on sequencing three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of the 1 BL/ 1 RS translocation wheat cultivar Shimai 15. A BAC contig was constructed spanning 168  kb of the Sec- 1 locus on 1 RS. Twelve ω-secalin genes were arranged in a head-to-tail fashion, separated by 8. 2 – 21. 6  kb spacers on the contig, whereas six other ω-secalin genes were arranged head-to-tail, separated by 8. 2 – 8. 4  kb of spacers on clone BAC 125. The 18 ω-secalin genes can be classified into six types among which eight ω-secalin genes were expressed during seed development. The ω-secalin genes with the 1074 -bp open reading frame (ORF) represented the main population. Except for two pseudogenes, the N-terminal of the ω-secalin gene was conserved, whereas variations in the C-terminal led to a change in ORF length. The spacers can be sorted into two classes. Class- 1 spacers contained conserved and non-conservative sequences. Conclusion: The ω-secalin gene family consisted of at least 18 members in the 1 BL/ 1 RS <b>translocation</b> <b>line</b> cv. Shimai 15. Eight ω-secalin genes were expressed during seed development. Eighteen members may originate from a progenitor with a 1, 074 -bp ORF. The spacers differed in length and sequence conservation...|$|R
40|$|Turner {{syndrome}} (TS) {{results from}} whole or partial monosomy X and is mediated by haploinsufficiency of genes that normally escape X-inactivation. Although a 45,X karyotype is observed in {{half of all}} TS cases, the most frequent variant TS karyotype includes the isodicentric X chromosome alone [46,X,idic(X) (p 11) ] or as a mosaic [46,X,idic(X) (p 11) / 45,X]. Given the mechanism of idic(X) (p 11) rearrangement is poorly understood and breakpoint sequence information is unknown, this study sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of idic(X) (p 11) formation by determining their precise breakpoint intervals. Karyotype analysis and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} mapping of eight idic(X) (p 11) cell lines and three unbalanced Xp 11. 2 <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> identified the majority of breakpoints within a 5 Mb region, from ∼ 53 to 58 Mb, in Xp 11. 1 –p 11. 22, clustering into four regions. To further refine the breakpoints, a high-resolution oligonucleotide microarray (average of ∼ 350 bp) was designed and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed on all 11 idic(X) (p 11) and Xp 11. 2 <b>translocation</b> <b>lines.</b> aCGH analyses identified all breakpoint regions, including an idic(X) (p 11) line with two potential breakpoints, one breakpoint shared between two idic(X) (p 11) lines and two Xp translocations that shared breakpoints with idic(X) (p 11) lines. Four of the breakpoint regions included large inverted repeats composed of repetitive gene clusters and segmental duplications, which corresponded to regions of copy-number variation. These data indicate that the rearrangement sites on Xp 11. 2 that lead to isodicentric chromosome formation and translocations are probably not random and suggest that the complex repetitive architecture of this region predisposes it to rearrangements, some of which are recurrent...|$|R

40|$|Agropyron elongatum (Host.) Neviski (synonym, Thinopyrum ponticum Podp., 2 n = 70) {{has been}} used {{extensively}} as a valuable source for wheat breeding. Numerous chromosome fragments containing valuable genes have been successfully translocated into wheat from A. elongatum. However, reports on the transfer of powdery mildew resistance from A. elongatum to wheat are rare. In this study, a novel wheat-A. elongatum <b>translocation</b> <b>line,</b> 11 - 20 - 1, developed and selected from the progenies of a sequential cross between wheat varieties (Lankaoaizaoba, Keyu 818 and BainongAK 58) and A. elongatum, was evaluated for disease resistance and characterized using molecular cytogenetic methods. Cytological observations indicated that 11 - 20 - 1 had 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis using whole genomic DNA from A. elongatum as a probe showed that the short arms {{of a pair of}} wheat chromosomes were replaced by a pair of A. elongatum chromosome arms. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, using wheat D chromosome specific sequence pAs 1 as a probe, suggested that the replaced chromosome arms of 11 - 20 - 1 were 5 DS. This was further confirmed by wheat SSR markers specific for 5 DS. EST-SSR and EST-STS multiple loci markers confirmed that the introduced A. elongatum chromosome arms belonged to homoeologous group 5. Therefore, it was deduced that 11 - 20 - 1 was a wheat-A. elongatum T 5 DL∙ 5 AgS <b>translocation</b> <b>line.</b> Both resistance observation and molecular marker analyses using two specific markers (BE 443538 and CD 452608) of A. elongatum in a F 2 population from a cross between line 11 - 20 - 1 and a susceptible cultivar Yannong 19 verified that the A. elongatum chromosomes were responsible for the powdery mildew resistance. This work suggests that 11 - 20 - 1 likely contains a novel resistance gene against powdery mildew. We expect this line to be useful for the genetic improvement of wheat...|$|R
40|$|The {{chromosome}} arm 1 RS of rye (Secale cereal L.) {{has been}} used worldwide {{as a source of}} genes for agronomic and resistant improvement. However, the 1 RS arm in wheat has end-use quality defects that are partially attributable to the presence of ω-secalins, which are encoded by genes at the Sec- 1 locus. Various attempts in removing the Sec- 1 genes from the 1 RS. 1 BL translocation chromosome have been made. In the present study, two new primary 1 RS. 1 BL <b>translocation</b> <b>lines,</b> T 917 - 26 and T 917 - 15, were developed from a cross between wheat variety "A 42912 " and Chinese local rye "Weining. " The lines T 917 - 15 and T 917 - 26 carried a pair of intact and homogeneous 1 RS. 1 BL chromosomes. The line T 917 - 26 also harbored an expression deletion of some genes at the Sec- 1 locus, which originated from a mutation that occurred simultaneously with wheat-rye chromosome translocations. These results suggest that the accompanying mutations of the evolutionarily significant translocations are remarkable resources for plant improvement. Comparison of <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> with its wheat parent showed improvements in the end-use quality parameters, which included protein content (PC), water absorption (WA), sodium dodecyl sulfate sedimentation (SDSS), wet gluten (WG), dry gluten (DG) and dough stickiness (DS), whereas significant reduction in gluten index (GI) and stability time (ST) were observed. These findings indicate that 1 RS in wheat has produced a higher amount of protein, although these comprised worse compositions. However, in the T 917 - 26 line that harbored an expression deletion mutation in the Sec- 1 genes, the quality parameters were markedly improved relative to its sister line, T 917 - 15, especially for GI and DS (P < 0. 05). These results indicated that expression deletion of Sec- 1 genes significantly improves the end-use quality of wheat cultivars harboring the 1 RS. 1 BL translocation. Strategies to remove the Sec- 1 genes from the 1 RS. 1 BL translocation in wheat improvement are discussed...|$|R

Development of wheat–Th. bessarabicum <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> by backcrossing amphiploids {{in the absence of the}} Ph 1 gene (allowing intergenomic recombination) enables its practical utilization in wheat improvement. Using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and repetitive probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), six novel wheat–Th. bessarabicum <b>translocation</b> <b>lines</b> involving different chromosome segments (T 4 BS. 4 BL- 4 JL, T 6 BS. 6 BL- 6 JL, T 5 AS. 5 AL- 5 JL, T 5 DL. 5 DS- 5 JS, T 2 BS. 2 BL- 2 JL, and the whole arm translocation T 1 AL. 1 JS) were identified and characterized in this study. No background translocations between wheat genomes were observed. The involvement of 5 of the 7 chromosomes, and small terminal segments of the Th. bessarabicum chromosome arm were important, contributing to both reduced linkage drag of the derived lines by minimizing agronomically deleterious genes from the alien species, and high stability including transmission of the alien segment. All three wheat genomes were involved in the <b>translocations</b> with the <b>alien</b> chromosome, and GISH showed the Th. bessarabicum genome was more closely related to the D genome in wheat. All the introgression lines were disomic, stable and with good morphological characters. The work also generated a high-resolution karyotype of two accessions of Th. bessarabicum using multiple repetitive DNA probes for chromosome identification. A complete CS-Th. bessarabicum amphiploid (2 n= 8 x= 56, AABBDDJJ) was used and each individual Jgenome unambiguously identified. The established karyotype will be useful for the rapid identification of potential donor chromosomes in wheat improvement programs, allowing appropriate alien-chromosome transfer.
