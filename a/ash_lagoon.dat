50|$|The Dry Ash Removal System is {{launched}} of Tenova Takraf.September 29, 2015 — Enel Russia has today inaugurated the Dry Ash Removal System at Reftinskaya GRES one of {{its most}} significant environmental projects — and the only {{one of its}} kind in the Russian power generation sector. Overall, Enel Russia invested over 12.5 billion roubles in the project. For the first time in Russia, the traditional hydraulic treatment of the ash produced by a coal plant as a waste material, has been replaced by the new, dry method of transportation and storage. This new method will allow increase industrial use of ash: as long as it remains dry, it can be used in road construction, building materials, agriculture etc. The new Dry Ash Removal System is connected to the railway, which makes it possible to ship the dry ash to clients both by rail and by road. DARS potentially allows the shipping to clients of all of the ash produced by the power plant, namely up to five million tonnes per year. All ash that is not immediately requested by clients, is transported by a 4.5 km-long closed pipe conveyor belt to the <b>ash</b> <b>lagoon,</b> where ash stacks are levelled and compressed, preventing dry ash from flying away. Finally, a layer of loam is applied to the stack surface, and green grass is seeded.|$|E
40|$|A small {{percentage}} of the particles, present in the pulverized coal ash, consists of thin-walled hollow spheres or cenospheres. Their quantity depends on the carbon and iron contents present in the ash. The apparent density of these cenospheres is less than that of water and as such, they float on the ash slurry when it is impounded in the ash ponds or lagoons. Cenospheres are being used in different industrial applications, mainly due to their low density, high strength, and good thermal properties. However. it is important and mandatory to study and characterize these ash particles for a better and effective usage. As such, an effort. has been made in this paper to study physico-chemico-mineralogical and thermal properties of the cenospheres obtained from an <b>ash</b> <b>lagoon.</b> (C) 2001. ...|$|E

The samples were collected {{over a period of}} 1 year and therefore they were representatives of the annual consumption of coal as well as the annual production of the ashes. Special procedures were taken to separately burn the coal bought from different places so that the origins of the ash samples are traceable. The radionuclide contents, radon emanating fraction and porosity of the samples were measured. Mathematical models were then used to evaluate the radiological hazard of the ash samples when used in the building industry.

Results show that 89 % of the As is bound to the quasi-crystalline Fe/Mn oxides and hydroxide matrix in the sediments, whereas, the adsorbed and exchangeable As hosted by the clay minerals, representing those that are easiest to release from the sediment matrix, is below 10 % of the acid leachable As. These As in these sediment matrices represent the possible maximum amount of As that can be released and supplied to the groundwater and the adjacent marine environment. Of the 89 % reducible As, up to 4 % {{is associated with the}} easily reducible variety, whereas, the rest is more strongly bonded by the moderately reducible variety. Based on the long-term As content of the lagoon water, the average desorption rate of As is calculated to be very low [...] 0. 3 - 0. 5 % on the average and 0. 6 % on the maximum.

40|$|The use of coal as fuel in {{industry}} {{gives rise to}} waste such as fly ash and bottom ash. Fly ash has high content of silica and alumina thus can be potentially utilized as construction materials. Fly ash also contains heavy metals of 8. 95 ppm Pb, 5. 375 ppm Cu and 7. 798 ppm Cr.

40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) was {{commissioned}} by Mr John Clarkson, Alcan Smelting and Power UK, {{to carry out a}} desk study of the geology and hydrogeology information of the area around the waste landfill site and ash storage lagoons at Alcan, Lynemouth. The desk study was supplemented by a site visit. A main concern was the possibility that the ash in the lagoons might be contaminated by contact with leachate from the hazardous materials disposed in the landfill. The BGS was asked to provide an independent report on the contamination risk and of the suitability of the <b>ash</b> <b>lagoon</b> test bores plus any existing and proposed groundwater monitoring wells at the Alcan Lynemouth site to detect such contamination. An extensive search was made for previous site investigation reports. The information obtained, in particular the records of over 50 boreholes drilled in the study area since 1990, has been used to review the published geological interpretation and better understand the hydrogeological regime. In general the new information supports the existing solid geological interpretation, but enables improved understanding of the disposition of the superficial deposits including a glacial buried channel. The site is over a minor Coal Measure aquifer, the North Seaton Sandstone, which is underlain by a mudrock aquiclude sequence. Groundwater flow in the sandstone, is dominantly fracture controlled and is to the east. The groundwater system is isolated from the flooded, abandoned mine workings beneath the site where the water level is at about 90 m below Ordnance Datum and slowly rising. Saline intrusion is evident in the aquifer, and the saline interface appears to cut across the axis of the buried glacial channel. An unsaturated zone of sandstone hydraulically separates the landfill and the PFA lagoons from the water table in the North Seaton Sandstone aquifer. It is concluded that {{it is unlikely that the}} PFA will become contaminated from the landfill leachate via the groundwater pathway or through direct discharge of leachate through the retaining bunds. The Coal Measure sandstone is overlain, but hydrogeologically unconfined by a glacial till sequence where the flow is probably predominantly vertical through fractures. The landfill operates on the dilute and disperse principle and the limited hydrochemical data available indicates that the groundwater impact diminishes along a flow line from the landfill. The existing series of operational monitoring wells is useful in providing information on water levels to help determine direction of groundwater flow and hydraulic gradient, and chemical data to help determine the extent of saline intrusion from the sea and the extent of dispersion of contaminants from the landfill. However the limited area covered by the wells gives rise to uncertainty in the interpretation. These uncertainties are discussed and possible avenues of investigation and action recommended in order to reduce them. The recommendations include: • Increasing the range of parameters determined in the landfill monitoring wells to include major anions and cations as well as nitrate and ammonia. • Implementing the five additional monitoring wells proposed by URS with specific suggestions for screening of the two proposed on the eastern perimeter of the site • Including a new well, integrated into the monitoring network, at the south-west corner of lagoon 1 • Giving consideration to the complementary approach of building a numerical model for the sit...|$|E

The efficient recovery of cenospheres without polluting the <b>ash</b> ponds or <b>lagoons</b> is a serious concern of the global community. Cenospheres of different density and particle sizes are now available in markets for various applications. The analysis of physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of cenospheres is important as these properties influence the quality of a product. This study finds that cenospheres exists in various densities and they vary in their physical, chemical and mineralogical properties. This research also incorporates the fabrication of a new dry separator system and subsequent modifications of the separator to extract cenospheres from fly ash. The dry method of separation of cenospheres from fly ash can be performed using a centrifugal air classifier. Several factors e. g., geometry and dimensions of the separation chambers, location and rate of the tangential air injection, speed of the rotor and the rate of feeding of sample are responsible for creating an appropriate air field inside the separation chamber for efficient separation. After several modifications, the {{extraction of}} cenospheres from fly ash is still a problem in the newly fabricated dry separator that needs further modification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{combustion}} of coal {{around the}} world for power generation produces huge volumes of fly ash. In Europe alone this amounted to about 40 Mt in 2000 of which less than 50 % was utilized. The waste ends in <b>lagoons,</b> <b>ash</b> mounds, and landfill sites. Coal ashes have high concentrations of many trace elements, ome of which are of environmental concern. Although the origin of elements in coals is not considered in this chapter, other aspects of the geochemistry are, and in particular the location of elements within the coal as this influences the behaviour of elements during combustion. During combustion many elements are volatile and are concentrated on the surfaces of the ash particles. Analyses of input coal and combustion residues from Eggborough power station (UK) demonstrate retention of the majority of elements in the solid combustion products, and analyses of size-fractionated fly ash have enabled the percentage surface association to be calculated, which for elements such as As and Mo is considerable. A consideration f the general leach-ing behaviour leads to the conclusion that it is the surface-associated elements that are most susceptible to leaching in the aqueous environment. The pH is an important control on trace element mobility in water, and in leachates from fly ash ranges from 3. 3 to 12. 3. High...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} conductivity (water permeability) {{is one of}} the most significant transport properties of concrete and measuring it is a key step in predicting the performance of concrete as a barrier to the movement of fluids and ions. The transport properties are critical for the performance of the cover layer in protecting embedded reinforcement as waste containments barriers (which are considered in this paper) and other applications such as dams. The measurements are difficult to interpret due to experimental effects of sample size and changes of flow with time and the chemistry of the fluid used. The intrinsic permeability to water and synthetic leachate was determined and the relationship between the eluted volume passing and permeability was established for mortar mixtures having compressive strengths ranging from 5 to 20 MPa. Two mortar mixtures containing portland cement and one without portland cement and incorporating cement kiln dust, <b>lagoon</b> <b>ash,</b> and Ferrosilicate slag were tested. The effects of the sample size were also investigated. The results indicate a decrease in {{hydraulic conductivity}} for lower strength mixtures and a slight increase in permeability coefficient for the higher strength mixtures with increasing permeating volumes. Increasing the testing specimen size also slightly increased the coefficient of permeability in lower strength mixtures and decreased the coefficient in higher strength mixtures. The permeability coefficient did not change significantly with pore solution pressure...|$|R
40|$|A column {{leaching}} {{study was}} conducted in the laboratory to assess the leachate composition and heavy metal contamination of soils amended with coal fly ash. For this purpose, soils amended with two types of coal fly ash - freshly precipitated dry fly <b>ash</b> (DFA) and <b>lagooned</b> fly <b>ash</b> (LFA) - at levels ranging from 40 to 240 t ha were used. There was {{a significant increase in the}} EC (total salts) of the leachate due to fly ash amendment. The EC increased from 0. 62 dSm at control to 1. 57 dSm with DFA application at 240 t ha in Kathalagere soil. In DFA amended soils, there was a significant increase in leachate EC level at the beginning followed by a sharp decrease as the volume of leachate increased. This indicates that DFA has higher amount of readily soluble salts compared to LFA. The B content increased from 0. 63 mg L at control to 1. 60 mg L. Significant increases in SO 4 columns compared to control. The leachate was found to be highly saline (C 3) and having B concentration higher than the prescribed safe limits. The heavy metal loads left on the fly ash amended soils at the end of the leaching period were significantly higher compared to unamended soils. The heavy metal loads recorded at 240 t ha of DFA application were 267. 6, 2. 5, 68. 1 and 87. 7 mg kg of Cr, Cd, Ni and Pb respectively in Kathalagere soil...|$|R
40|$|Coal-based power {{generation}} produces over 750 Mt of coal ash per year globally, but under 50 % of world production is utilised. Large amounts of fly ash are either stored temporarily in stockpiles, disposed of in <b>ash</b> landfills or <b>lagooned.</b> Coal <b>ash</b> {{is viewed as}} a major potential source of release of many environmentally sensitive elements to the environment. This paper encompasses over 90 publications on coal fly ash and demonstrates {{that a large number of}} elements are tightly bound to fly ash and may not be easily released to the environment, regardless of the nature of the ash. This review provides an extensive look at the extent to which major and trace elements are leached from coal fly ash. It also gives an insight into the factors underlying the leachability of elements and addresses the causes of the mobility. The mode of occurrence of a given element in the parent coal was found to play an important role in the leaching behaviour of fly ash. The amount of calcium in fly ash exerts a dominant influence on the pH of the ash–water system. The mobility of most elements contained in ash is markedly pH sensitive. The alkalinity of fly ash attenuates the release of a large number of elements of concern such as Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sn or Zn among others, but at the same time, it enhances the release of oxyanionic species such as As, B, Cr, Mo, Sb, Se, V and W. The precipitation of secondary phases such as ettringite may capture and bind several pollutants such ash As, B, Cr, Sb, Se and V...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{used the}} ideas and methods, employed in previous studies of residual and weakly bonded soils, to help understand the shear strength and yielding characteristics of pozzolanically reacted fly <b>ash.</b> Samples of <b>lagoon</b> fly <b>ash</b> were supplemented by manufactured samples of fly ash/lime mortar. These were necessary {{to address the problem}} of wide variations and lack of observed bonding found in early tests on <b>lagoon</b> fly <b>ash.</b> The manufactured samples proved to be stronger and stiffer with a greater consistence between specimens, although their internal structure proved to be clumpy and the de-bonding method failed to remove all the bonding. The two forms of fly ash showed that the pozzolanic bonding was affected by confining pressure and axial strains. Under undrained conditions the build up of pore water pressures was shown to reduce the influence of pozzolanic bonding in stress space. The critical state line derived for the <b>lagoon</b> fly <b>ash</b> was linear to the extent of using conditions and also adequately described those of the mortar fly ash. As no one method for analysing the yielding characteristics could be found, a number of methods were cross-referenced in this research. Both forms of fly ash showed multiple yields that could be resolved to match the classic First and Second yield model. The loci of yields identified demonstrated the isotropic and anistropic nature of the mortar and <b>lagoon</b> fly <b>ashes</b> respectively. Despite the variations seen in the <b>lagoon</b> fly <b>ash</b> samples and the difference with the mortar samples the results point to common critical state parameters for unbonded fly ash and limiting condition for pozzolanic bonding within stress space...|$|R
