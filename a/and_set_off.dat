5|$|Around {{the same}} time, pathfinders from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company {{landed in the}} area between the River Orne and the River Dives. Brigadier Nigel Poett, {{commanding}} the 5th Parachute Brigade, along with a small team accompanied the pathfinders. Disoriented after landing, Poett heard Brotheridge's Sten gun <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> for the bridges with the only man he could locate. Unteroffizier Weber, the only German to escape 'D' Company's attack, retreated to Bénouville and reported the bridge had been captured.|$|E
5|$|France was in {{constitutional}} crisis in 1830, which reached a peak in late July as the July Revolution began and riots erupted across Paris. Although {{moved by the}} death and destruction taking place around him, Etty felt {{that the purpose of}} his visit was to study paintings, and continued to attend the Louvre to copy paintings as the violence raged in the surrounding streets. On 31July he decided to abandon the trip; abandoning his proposed onward journey to Brussels and Antwerp, he collected the five copies he had made in the Louvre <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> for London.|$|E
5|$|After Skanderbeg's raid into Macedonia {{the year}} before, the Sultan decided to {{strengthen}} his fortresses in the area. He then sent Şeremet bey to Ohrid, a city close to Skanderbeg's domains, with 14,000 cavalry to prevent another Albanian incursion. After learning of this, Skanderbeg prepared to march against Şeremet. The pasha's men, however, were stationed {{both inside and}} outside the city, making it difficult to defeat them. Before marching, Skanderbeg received news that Pius had arrived in Ancona and died upon seeing the crusader fleet. He left Cimarosto with an Italian force in Valikardhë (near modern-day Bulqizë in eastern Albania). Skanderbeg then decided to march against Şeremet anyway <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> with 12,000 cavalry three hours after dusk. After one day of marching, Skanderbeg reached Macedonia and began pillaging the land.|$|E

A customer of the farm delivery service later walks into the restaurant looking for Tina, leaving behind a box of blueberries. Bob and his wife Linda (John Roberts) discover marijuana hidden in the box <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> to find the children, with Mickey leading them to the farm's location. As they arrive and take back the children, a SWAT team– led by the aforementioned customer, who is actually an undercover DEA agent– shows up and arrests the hippies.

5|$|In all, the Renaissance {{could be}} viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel {{approaches}} to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|In the evening, {{after the}} ceremony, {{the royal family}} decided to leave their palace in Athens for Tatoi, but city {{residents}} opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only. It {{was the last time}} that Alexander would be in direct contact with his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> into exile.|$|E
5|$|Montejo was {{appointed}} alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province {{with the aid}} of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. D'Avila was sent from eastern Yucatán to conquer Acalan, which extended southeast of the Laguna de Terminos. Montejo the Younger founded Salamanca de Xicalango as a base of operations. In 1530 d'Avila established Salamanca de Acalán as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucatán. Salamanca de Acalán proved a disappointment, with no gold for the taking and with lower levels of population than had been hoped. D'Avila soon abandoned the new settlement <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> across the lands of the Kejache to Champotón, arriving there towards the end of 1530, where he was later joined by the Montejos.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{landed in}} eastern Crimea {{as part of}} the 51st Army during the Kerch–Feodosiya landing operation, which occurred in late-December 1941 <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula. The landing operation sought to relieve Soviet forces trapped in Sevastopol in southwestern Crimea, but a German counterattack in mid-January forced the Soviets, including the 390th division, to retreat eastward; they eventually were cornered in the Kerch Peninsula. As a result of language problems due to lack of Russian speakers in the division, the 390th was made into an Armenian national division in February and given an Armenian commander. The division was destroyed in the final German offensive, Operation Bustard Hunt, in May, and officially disbanded soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a {{distinguished}} Russian official who {{offered to take}} him to Emma Harbour on the coast, a week's journey away, where he could look for a ship to Alaska. Bartlett accepted, and on 10 May, though still weak from his journey and an attack of tonsillitis, said goodbye to Kataktovik (who was remaining for the time being in Emma Town), <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> with the baron. On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area. On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler Herman and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska. They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore. After three days' waiting they turned south, and landed at St Michael, where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of Karluk's fate. He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the United States revenue cutter Bear, which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{consider}} India's {{modern age}} {{to have begun}} sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company {{set the stage for}} changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.|$|E

5|$|In 1173 HenryII betrothed his {{youngest}} son, Prince John, to {{the daughter of}} Count Humbert, an influential lord in Provence. John had no land, {{but as part of}} the arrangement Henry promised him the castles of Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau. HenryII's eldest son, also called Henry, had been crowned King of England alongside his father but had no land of his own and was angered by the situation. His discontent grew and Henry the Young King demanded some of the land promised to him be handed over, claiming to have the support of the English barons and his father-in-law, King LouisVII of France. While the king was at Limoges he was informed of a conspiracy involving his wife and sons to overthrow him. Choosing to keep his eldest son by his side, HenryII set off north to Normandy, ensuring along the way that his castles in Aquitaine were prepared for war. En route they stayed at Chinon; under the cover of darkness Henry the Young King escaped <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> to Paris to join the court of LouisVII. Two of Henry the Young King's brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, joined him in rebellion along with the barons of France and some in England. War followed, lasting until 1174, and Chinon, Loudun, and Châtellerault were key to HenryII's defence.|$|E
5|$|Jardine was not {{successful}} in the final Test, won by Australia. He {{was used as an}} opener, due to an injury to Sutcliffe, and made just 19 and a first ball duck. Once both of his innings were completed, on the fifth day of a match which lasted eight days, he left the match <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> across Australia to catch a boat to India for a holiday. It is not clear if this was planned or if he had simply had enough. Jardine never provided an explanation, to the Australian press nor afterwards. Later, Jardine wrote about the Australian crowds, complaining over their involvement, but praising their knowledge and judgement of the game and describing them as more informed than English crowds. He also expressed later reservations to Bob Wyatt about Percy Chapman, saying that he would have shot him if a gun was available. Jardine did not appear in first-class cricket in the 1929 season due to business commitments.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} side of the parade are two early 18th century magazines, altered in the 19th century. These were {{specially}} designed to avoid the use of iron, which might have generated sparks <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> an explosion, instead being built using wood and copper; they are the only remaining examples of their type in Britain. The Landport Gate lies behind the magazines, and has a gatehouse, called the Dead House, above the passageway leading into the interior of the fort. Past the north-west bastion, the soldiers' barracks would have stood opposite those of the officers', but was destroyed after the war and only the foundations of the building remain. The south-west magazine also holds a covered magazine, similar to that in the north-east bastion. Just to the west of the Water Gate is the fort's guardhouse and chapel, dating from the late 17th century and one of the oldest surviving places of worship within a British artillery fortress.|$|E
5|$|Only part of Captain King’s force, {{including}} 35 of Lieutenant Angus's 70 sailors, {{succeeded in}} making a landing at the Red House. Under fire from the defenders, the invaders charged Lieutenant Lamont’s detachment of the 49th Regiment. The sailors, armed with pikes and swords, closed in for hand-to-hand fighting. Lamont's troops drove back the attackers three times but King made a fourth assault which hit the British left flank and overwhelmed them; capturing Lamont and killing, taking or dispersing all of his men. The victorious Americans {{set fire to the}} post, spiked the guns <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> back to the landing-point, where they expected their boats to have re-landed in order to evacuate them. However, in the moonless darkness, King’s force became dispersed and split into two parties: one led by King and the other by Lieutenant Angus. Angus returned to the landing-point and found only four of the party’s ten boats there. Unaware that the six missing boats had not in fact landed, Angus assumed that King had already departed, and he re-crossed the river in the remaining boats. When King’s party reached the landing-point, they found themselves stranded. A search downriver found two unattended British boats, in which King sent half of his men, and the prisoners that he had captured, over the Niagara while he waited with his 30 remaining men for more boats to come from Buffalo and pick him up.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in charge}} of the Constantinople hospital, he {{attempted}} to elope with one of his patients, but was captured and tried for breach of conduct, as the female patient was in fact the wife of a Turkish officer. While being deported to Canada, Harrison escaped while his ship was docked in Morocco. Making his way to Ireland, Harrison posed as a Catholic and joined the Free State Army. After he was discovered, he quickly crossed to Wales to treat the coal miners there for silicosis. In 1923 Harrison married his fourth wife, Eva Olwen Bowen in Cardiff, still without divorcing his three previous wives, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>off</b> with her on an adventure in the Caribbean. It is thought that Harrison deserted her sometime in the mid-1920s. During the 1930s Harrison worked in 15 countries and dependencies across Latin America and the Middle East. For one year, he served as the physician for a guerrilla army fighting the Japanese, who were then engaged in the Second Sino-Japanese War with China. After 1938, Harrison traveled to Shanghai using borrowed funds from a medical school classmate in Jamaica and from his own brother in Ontario, and set up a private medical practice, assisting the Chinese Red Cross wherever possible.|$|E
