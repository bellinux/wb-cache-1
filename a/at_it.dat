5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare <b>at</b> <b>it</b> directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E
5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} bald eagles will attack incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> , <b>it</b> {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E

5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. <b>At</b> , <b>it</b> combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E

Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting <b>at</b> <b>it</b> directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E
