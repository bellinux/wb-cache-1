5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt.

In <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure.

To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Linear IgA disease (LAD; <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> childhood) is a dapsone-responsive, {{acquired}} immunobullous disorder {{mediated by}} IgA antibodies directed at target antigens within the epithelial basement membrane. These antigens {{have not been}} completely characterized. OBJECTIVES: To identify the target antigens in LAD, and to correlate these with the antibody isotype. METHODS: We used 101 LAD sera without IgG antibodies detected by indirect immunofluorescence. The sera were analysed by immunoblotting for IgA (65 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 36 <b>children)</b> <b>and</b> IgG (61 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 34 <b>children)</b> autoantibodies, on salt-split, urea-extracted epidermal tissue extracts. RESULTS: Antigens were targeted in LAD by IgA antibodies (54 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 23 <b>children),</b> IgG antibodies (34 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 19 <b>children),</b> <b>and</b> both isotypes (30 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 16 <b>children).</b> Three major antigens were recognized by IgA antibodies: LAD 285 (22 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> three <b>children),</b> BP 230 (30 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> eight <b>children)</b> <b>and</b> BP 180 (collagen XVII), including the 97 -kDa ectodomain (52 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 20 <b>children).</b> Seven 'minor' antigens were occasionally detected (18 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 13 <b>children).</b> IgA antibodies bound multiple antigens (33 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> nine <b>children)</b> more frequently than single antigens (21 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 14 <b>children),</b> but the binding to multiple antigens was more restricted in children than in adults. IgG antibodies mainly bound a single antigen (29 <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> 16 <b>children),</b> predominantly BP 180. CONCLUSIONS: There was variation in the autoantibody response within the disease and the patient, with regard to target molecules and autoantibody class. The finding that IgG as well as IgA autoantibodies predominantly target BP 180 supports a pivotal role for collagen XVII in <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> childhood LAD. The IgG response was very restricted compared with IgA autoantibodies (P < 0. 01). Autoantibodies from children had a more restricted antigen repertoire than from adults (P < 0. 05). Epitope spreading is common in LAD and {{is affected by the}} class of autoantibody and age of the patient...|$|R

In April 2013, a shortlist of six mascot designs (which were produced by professional graphic designers, with the sketches by the children as models) were released, including a raccoon, beaver, moose, two pixie creature twins, porcupine and an owl. The final six were selected based on originality, how well they represent Canadian culture and the branding of the Games, and the appeal they had amongst <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> On April 22, 2013, the general public was allowed to vote for the mascot they felt was the best.

5|$|In <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> {{over the}} age of 12, {{linezolid}} is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E
