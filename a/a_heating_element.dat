25|$|Any {{metal or}} {{conductive}} object placed into the microwave {{will act as}} an antenna to some degree, resulting in an electric current. This causes the object to act as <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> This effect varies with the object's shape and composition, and is sometimes utilized for cooking.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{faced with}} PID {{controllers}} {{is that they}} are linear, and in particular symmetric. Thus, performance of PID controllers in non-linear systems (such as HVAC systems) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element)</b> but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so overshoot can only be corrected slowly â€“ it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, though this reduces performance (it increases settling time).|$|E
25|$|Like vacuum {{distillation}}, {{steam distillation}} {{is a method}} for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive. The temperature of the steam is easier to control than the surface of <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element,</b> and allows {{a high rate of}} heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature. This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.|$|E

The <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> temperature is regulated by the Atmel microprocessor, depending on the temperature specified by an user.

Platinum silicide is a semiconductor material. Ferrosilicon is an iron alloy that also contains some calcium and aluminium.|$|R
25|$|Aquarium heaters combine <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> with a thermostat, {{allowing}} the aquarist to regulate water temperature {{at a level}} above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.|$|E
25|$|One may {{reasonably}} {{maintain an}} average and acceptable temperature for the snake {{by the use}} of <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> or infrared light bulbs. A gradient must be offered within the enclosure to allow the snake to bask in the heat or go to cooler areas in the tank. Optimum humidity can be difficult to maintain and research must be done on the snake to determine the correct level. More than 80% humidity must be maintained for caging an anaconda species from the tropical region, while a slightly less than 30% humidity must be maintained for a species of a desert region. Photoperiods are often used with most species of snake; natural light is best for this, but low UV percentage bulbs can also be used. Captive anacondas have a reputation for unpredictability and aggression due to the temperaments of wild-caught specimens first collected for captive breeding, but with proper care, green anacondas can and do make for calm, relatively sedate pets. Due to their immense size and power however, proper respect and caution should always be maintained, and they are best left to experienced adult owners who can provide them with the proper requirements.|$|E
500|$|ExxonMobil's in situ {{technology}} (ExxonMobil Electrofrac) uses electrical heating {{with elements}} of both wall conduction and volumetric heating methods. It injects an electrically conductive material such as calcined petroleum coke into the hydraulic fractures created in the oil shale formation which then forms <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> [...] Heating wells are placed in a parallel row with a second horizontal well intersecting them at their toe. [...] This allows opposing electrical charges to be applied at either end.|$|E

50|$|A flameless lighter {{is a safe}} {{alternative}} to traditional lighters. The flameless lighter uses <b>an</b> enclosed <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> which glows, so that the device does not produce an open flame.

500|$|For {{the next}} century, {{molybdenum}} had no industrial use. [...] It was relatively scarce, the pure metal {{was difficult to}} extract, and the necessary techniques of metallurgy were immature. Early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise of increased hardness, but efforts to manufacture the alloys {{on a large scale}} were hampered with inconsistent results, a tendency toward brittleness, and recrystallization. In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to applications as <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas. In 1913, Frank E. Elmore developed a froth flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the primary isolation process.|$|E
500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem {{that will only}} affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with <b>a</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> [...] A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|E

50|$|In many late model automobiles, a {{mass airflow}} sensor (MAF sensor) is used to {{accurately}} determine the mass flowrate of intake air used in the internal combustion engine. Many such mass flow sensors use <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> and <b>a</b> downstream temperature sensor to indicate the air flowrate. Other sensors use a spring-loaded vane. In either case, the vehicle's electronic control unit interprets the sensor signals as a real time indication of an engine's fuel requirement.|$|R
50|$|Induction cooking <b>heats</b> <b>a</b> cooking vessel by {{magnetic}} induction, {{instead of}} by thermal conduction from a flame, or <b>an</b> electrical <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> Because inductive <b>heating</b> directly heats the vessel, very rapid increases in temperature can be achieved.|$|R

50|$|William Lawrence Bragg had {{discovered}} X-ray crystallography in 1911 {{which was a}} method of using an x-ray tube to aim x-rays at an element and measure the diffraction lines and spectra produced.
