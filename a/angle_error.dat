50|$|Dynamic {{calibration}} {{is needed}} {{when there are}} long waveguide runs between the antenna and first down converter (see Superheterodyne receiver). This compensates for temperature changes that alter the size and length of wave-guide, which will cause phase variations that produce incorrect <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> signals for long wave-guide runs. The Cal term is created by injecting a calibration signal into the receive waveguide while {{the system is not}} active (sum and delta). The <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> of the calibration signal is used to evaluate <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> during normal operation.

50|$|To {{improve the}} roll {{stability}} in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an active steering system in 2012; this allowed {{the use of}} a combined Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) strategy. The active steering system output {{is a function of the}} vehicle’s tilt <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> (the difference between the actual and ideal tilt angle), therefore at steady state when there is little or no tilt <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> the front wheel steer angle matches the driver’s steer demand. However, in transient situations, such as upon turn-in, a tilt <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> exists and the active steering system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver’s steering input. In extreme conditions it will also initiate a countersteering action whereby the front wheel momentarily steers in the opposite direction to that intended by the driver. As the cabin approaches the desired tilt angle, the magnitude of the tilt <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> is reduced and the front wheel steer angle takes on the value demanded by the driver.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the convergence problem of autonomous mobile robots with inaccurate sensors, which may return the erroneous location of other robots. In this paper, we newly introduce a uniform error model, {{which is a}} restricted variant of the original observation-error model proposed by Cohen and Peleg [4]. The degree of an observation error is characterized by distance <b>errors</b> and <b>angle</b> <b>errors.</b> While the original model (non-uniform model) allows that two or more points can have different error degrees, the uniform error model assumes that {{the same amount of}} error degree is incurred to all observed points in a single observation. The main focus of our study is to reveal how much such uniformity expands the feasibility of the convergence. In the non-uniform error model, {{it has been shown that}} no algorithm can achieve the convergence if the maximum <b>error</b> <b>angle</b> is more than or equal to π/ 3. This paper shows that the convergence problem is solvable under the uniform error if the maximum <b>error</b> <b>angle</b> is less than π/ 2. We also prove that there is no convergence algorithm for the maximum <b>error</b> <b>angle</b> more than or equal to π/ 2 even in the uniform error model, which implies the optimality of our algorithm in the sense of <b>angle</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{inertial}} sensor systems (RISS) {{have been introduced}} by many researchers as a low-cost, low-complexity sensor assembly that can be integrated with GPS to provide a robust integrated navigation system for land vehicles. In earlier works, the developed error models were simplified {{based on the assumption}} that the vehicle is mostly moving on a flat horizontal plane. Another limitation is the simplified estimation of the horizontal tilt angles, which is based on simple averaging of the accelerometers’ measurements without modelling their <b>errors</b> or tilt <b>angle</b> <b>errors.</b> In this paper, a new error model is developed for RISS that accounts for the effect of tilt <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> and the accelerometer’s errors. Additionally, it also includes important terms in the system dynamic error model, which were ignored during the linearization process in earlier works. An augmented extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed to incorporate tilt <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> and transversal accelerometer errors. The new error model and the augmented EKF design are developed in a tightly-coupled RISS/GPS integrated navigation system. The proposed system was tested on real trajectories’ data under degraded GPS environments, and the results were compared to earlier works on RISS/GPS systems. The findings demonstrated that the proposed enhanced system introduced significant improvements in navigational performance...|$|R

Line-of-sight elevation (LOSE) <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> are under 1 deg. Apparent Doppler ground velocities, as large as 2 m/s, are considerably less than in a previous flight experiment in 1981. No evidence was found of a Schuler resonance phenomenon common to inertial navigation systems (INS), however the aperiodic nature of the apparent velocities implies an error in the INS-derived ground speeds. Certain features and subtleties in the ground returns are explained in terms of atmospheric structure and characteristics of the ADLS hardware and software. Finally, least squares and low-pass filtering techniques are suggested for eliminating errors during post-processing...|$|R

30|$|From Fig. 6 to Fig. 8, we can {{conclude}} that if only add the position errors in scheme 1, the pitch angle, roll angle and position of EKF algorithm all have obvious errors at 100 s, 200 s, 300 s and 400 s. While the pitch and roll <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> of SRKF algorithm are relatively small, and the errors increase with the increasing of the added errors. And it is nearly {{the same for the}} head angles between these two methods, for the magnetometer measurements are relatively accurate and could restrain the head angle divergence effectively. In addition, if only add the magnetometer errors in scheme 2, the head <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> of EKF algorithm are relatively larger than SRKF algorithm at 150 s, 200 s, 350 s and 400 s. However, the pitch and roll <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> and position errors are essentially the same between these two algorithms. The reason lies in the magnetometer errors could cause outliers of head angle, however, {{due to the fact that}} GPS measurements are rather accurate, it could restrain the divergence of head angle of EKF algorithm to some extent, and SRKF could effectively restrain the outliers. In Scheme 3, this paper add the position errors and magnetometer errors simultaneously, the EKF algorithm has great attitude and position errors at the time of adding measurement outliers. Whereas, the SRKF algorithm can restrain the outliers effectively at these moments, and the attitude and position accuracy are obviously better than the EKF algorithm. In conclusion, when the measurement outliers exist for the MIMU/GPS/Magnetometer integrated system, the effect of the SRKF algorithm is a lot better than the traditional EKF algorithm, which could effectively restrain the outliers and maintain a better attitude and position accuracy.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{main idea}} of the paper is {{investigation}} of the maximum values of current and <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> of the current transformers {{and the nature of}} their changes in steady-state and transient power system conditions in which the possible output of errors beyond the normalized range of values, as well as a comparison of the degree of change of current and <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> of the current transformers for power supply auxiliary wiring devices of relaying protection in these conditions. Research methods. The authors used the method of simulation and visualization of the current transformer operation of computers, intended for supply of secondary circuits of relay protection devices in steady and transient conditions of supply power system and different operating modes. The obtained results. The authors defined the percentage of the maximum current and angular error of the primary current transformation to the secondary circuit of the current transformer which are caused by the presence of the magnetizing current and resistive losses in the magnetic system of the test current transformer; their comparison is performed and conclusions are drawn regarding their changes in steady-state and transient conditions, in particular, the fact is established that the current errors in emergency conditions vary to a much greater extent than the angular and under certain conditions may extend beyond the value of the normalized state standards. Scientific novelty. The authors developed the modern method of investigation of current and <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> of the current transformers for auxiliary supply of relay protection devices based on the use of a computer model of an ideal current transformer with a linear no hysteresis B-H curve, which has similar characteristics and primary and secondary circuit parameters to study the real transformer current. Practical significance. The results can be used in researching the optimum operating current transformers conditions and the development of new principles of perform measurement and logical circuits of relaying protection, in particular, it was concluded that in order to provide the more sensitive and selective protection we can use the devices based on the principle of their action to respond only to the phase relation between the currents of the current transformers and connections that have to be rebuilt only from the <b>angle</b> measurement <b>errors...</b>|$|R
50|$|The SARH system {{determines the}} closing {{velocity}} using the flight path geometry shown in Figure 1. The closing velocity {{is used to}} set the frequency location for the CW receive signal shown {{at the bottom of}} the diagram (spectrum). Antenna offset angle of the missile antenna is set after the target is acquired by the missile seeker using the spectrum location set using closing speed. The missile seeker antenna is a monopulse radar receiver that produces <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> measurements using that fixed position. Flight path is controlled by producing navigation input to the steering system (tail fins or gimbaled rocket) using angle errors produced by the antenna. This steers the body of the missile to hold the target near the centerline of the antenna while the antenna is held in a fixed position. The offset angle geometry is determined by flight dynamics using missile speed, target speed, and separation distance.|$|E
50|$|The method tracks {{independently}} of the beam directions, and can thus track in two dimensions. It is also said to be independent of the <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> inherent in the Doppler algorithm. However, as the radial resolution (along the beam) is far better than the lateral resolution which also decreases with depth, both the angle independence and the tracking ability across the sector is lower. Also, instead of angle independency, the resulting strain values are dependent on the ROI (Region Of Interest) size and shape. Finally, {{in order to achieve}} tracking quality, the values are in most commercial applications smoothed by a spline smoothing function along the ROI, so the regional measurements are not pure regional, but rather to a degree, spline functions of the global average. In addition, the method has a lower sampling rate due to the limited frame rate of B-mode, which reduces tracking validity, especially at high heart rates.|$|E
50|$|The burden in a CT {{metering}} circuit is the largely resistive impedance presented to its secondary winding. Typical burden ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5 VA, 3 VA, 5 VA, 10 VA, 15 VA, 20 VA, 30 VA, 45 VA and 60 VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 can tolerate an impedance {{of up to}} 0.2 Ω on the secondary circuit before its accuracy falls outside of its specification. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and phase <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> scales at the CT's rated burden. Items {{that contribute to the}} burden of a current measurement circuit are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate conductors. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the meter and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices.|$|E
