50|$|Zygosaccharomyces is a genus of yeasts in {{the family}} Saccharomycetaceae. It was first {{described}} under the Saccharomyces genus, but in 1983, it was reclassified to its current name in the work by Barnett et al. The yeast {{has a long history}} as a well-known spoilage yeast within the food industry because several species in this genus are significantly resistant to many of the common food preservation methods. For example, the biochemical properties Z. bailii possesses to achieve this includes high sugar tolerance (50-60%), high ethanol tolerance (up to 18%), high acetic <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> (2.0-2.5%), very high sorbic and benzoic <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> (up to 800-1000 mg/l), high molecular SO2 tolerance (greater than 3 mg/l) and high xerotolerance.|$|E
50|$|Increased acidity {{levels in}} {{breeding}} areas may be problematic for moor frog populations, as it reduces survival {{and growth of}} the aquatic embryos and larvae. When exposed to acidity, moor frogs were however shown {{to be able to}} adapt relatively rapidly (within 16-40 generations). Local adaptation to acidity is also possible in survival during the embryonic stage, during which frogs are most sensitive to severe acidity. Moreover, compared to those from neutral sites, acid origin populations have higher embryonic and larval <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> (survival and larval period were less negatively affected by low pH), higher larval growth but slower larval development rates, and larger metamorphosing size. Divergence in embryonic <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> and metamorphic size correlates most strongly with breeding pond pH, whereas divergence in larval period and larval growth correlates most strongly with latitude and predator density, respectively.|$|E

Genetic improvement is the best solution and molecular-marker-assisted selection has proved to be an efficient tool for developing barley cultivars with <b>acid</b> soil/aluminium <b>tolerance.</b> In this study, barley variety Svanhals-introduced from CYMMIT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) -was identified as acid soil/aluminium tolerant and the tolerance was mapped to chromosome 4 H in 119 doubled haploid (DH) lines from a cross of Hamelin/Svanhals. The HvMATE gene, encoding an aluminium-activated citrate transporter, was selected as a candidate gene and gene-specific molecular markers were developed to detect <b>acid</b> soil/aluminium <b>tolerance</b> based on the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the HvMATE gene identified a 21 -bp indel (insertion-deletion) between the tolerant and sensitive cultivars. The new marker was further mapped to the QTL (quantitative trait loci) region on chromosome 4 H for <b>acid</b> soil <b>tolerance</b> and accounted for 66. 9 % of phenotypic variation in the DH population. Furthermore, the polymorphism was confirmed in other tolerant varieties which have been widely used as a source of <b>acid</b> soil <b>tolerance</b> in Australian barley breeding programs.

40|$|Background: Acid soil is {{a serious}} {{limitation}} to crop production all over the world. Toxic aluminium (Al) cations in acid soil inhibit root growth and reduce yield. Although a gene tolerant to acid soil has been identified, {{it has not been}} used in malting barley breeding, which is partly due to the <b>acid</b> soil <b>tolerance</b> gene being linked to unfavorable malting quality traits. Results: A Brazilian malting barley variety Br 2 was identified as tolerant to acid soil. A doubled haploid (DH) population was developed from a cross between Br 2 and the Australian acid-sensitive cultivar Hamelin. The DH population was tested for <b>acid</b> soil <b>tolerance</b> in native <b>acid</b> soil and a hydroponic system with pH 4. 2, pH 4. 2 + Al or pH 6. 5, and genotyped using SSR, DArT and gene-specific markers. A single QTL was detected for all parameters related to <b>acid</b> soil <b>tolerance.</b> The QTL was mapped to the known HvMATE location on chromosome 4 H. Sequence alignment of the HvMATE gene identified 13 INDELs and 87 SNPs, where one SNP coded for a single amino acid difference between the two varieties. A gene-specific marker was developed to detect the single nucleotide polymorphism between Hamelin and Br 2. This marker co-segregated with aluminium tolerance and accounted for 79 % of phenotypic variation for <b>acid</b> soil <b>tolerance.</b> Conclusion: The present study identified a novel source of <b>acid</b> soil/Al <b>tolerance</b> from a Brazilian malting barley cultivar Br 2. This variety tolerated Al toxicity but was sensitive to low pH which is similar to most other Al-tolerant varieties. A gene-specific marker Cit 7 was developed based on the HvMATE gene sequence. Cit 7 will improve the efficiency of molecular-assisted selection of new barley varieties with <b>tolerance</b> to <b>acid</b> soil. Multiple alleles exist for the <b>acid</b> soil <b>tolerance</b> gene on chromosome 4 H, so a malting barley variety that tolerates acid soil could be developed by selecting suitable tolerant alleles.

50|$|It is {{debated whether}} the 3000m should be {{classified}} as a middle distance or long distance event. In elite level competition, 3000 m pace is more comparable to the pace found in the longer 5000 metres event, rather than Mile pace. The world record performance for 3000 m equates to a pace of 58.76 seconds per 400 m, which {{is closer to the}} 60.58 seconds for 5000 m than the 55.46 seconds for the Mile. However, the 3000 m does require some anaerobic conditioning and an elite athlete needs to develop a high tolerance to lactic acid, as does the Mile runner. Thus, the 3000 m demands a balance of aerobic endurance needed for the 5000 m and lactic <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> needed for the Mile.|$|E
40|$|As {{potential}} {{to adapt to}} environmental stress can be essential for population persistence, knowledge on the genetic architecture of local adaptation is important for conservation genetics. We investigated {{the relative importance of}} additive genetic, dominance and maternal effects contributions to <b>acid</b> stress <b>tolerance</b> in two moor frog (Rana arvalis) populations originating from low and neutral pH habitats. Experiments with crosses obtained from artificial matings revealed that embryos from the acid origin population were more tolerant to low pH than embryos from the neutral origin population in embryonic survival rates, but not in terms of developmental stability, developmental and growth rates. Strong maternal effect and small additive genetic contributions to variation were detected in all traits in both populations. In general, dominance contributions to variance in different traits were of similar magnitude to the additive genetic effects, but dominance effects outweighed the additive genetic and maternal effects contributions to early growth in both populations. Furthermore, the expression of additive genetic variance was independent of pH treatment, suggesting little additive genetic variation in <b>acid</b> stress <b>tolerance.</b> The results suggest that although local genetic adaptation to acid stress has taken place, the current variation in <b>acid</b> stress <b>tolerance</b> in acidified populations may owe largely to non-genetic effects.

50|$|Though proteobacteria display {{impressive}} <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance,</b> most {{retain a}} circumneutral cytoplasm to avoid denaturation of their acid-labile cell constituents. Archaea such as Ferroplasma acidiphilum, which oxidises ferrous iron, {{have a number}} of intracellular enzymes with an optimum similar to that of their external acidic environment. This may explain their ability to survive pH as low as 1.3. The differing cell membranes in archaea compared to the bacteria may hold part of the explanation; ether lipids that link isoprene, compared to proteobacteria’s di-ester linkage, are central to the difference. Though lacking a cell wall, F. acidiphilum cell membranes contain caldarchaetidylglycerol tetraether lipids, which effectively block almost all proton access, Thermoplasma acidophilum also uses these bulky isoprenoid cores in its phospholipid bilayer.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{ecological}} plaque hypothesis explains caries {{development as}} the result of the enrichment of acid tolerant bacteria in dental biofilms in response to prolonged periods of low pH. Acid production by an acid tolerant microflora causes demineralisation of tooth enamel and thus, individuals with a greater proportion of acid tolerant bacteria would be expected to be more prone to caries development. Biofilm <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> could therefore be a possible biomarker for caries prediction. However, little is known about the stability of biofilm <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> over time in vivo or the distribution throughout the oral cavity. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess intra-individual differences in biofilm acid-tolerance between different tooth surfaces and inter-individual variation as well as stability of <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> over time. Results: The majority of the adolescents showed low scores for biofilm <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance.</b> In 14 of 20 individuals no differences were seen between the three tooth sites examined. In the remaining six, acid-tolerance at the premolar site differed from one of the other sites. At 51 of 60 tooth sites, acid-tolerance at baseline was unchanged after 1 month. However, <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> values changed over a 1 -year period in 50 % of the individuals. Conclusions: Biofilm <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> showed short-term stability and low variation between different sites in the same individual suggesting that the <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> could be a promising biological biomarker candidate for caries prediction.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty {{isolates}} of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with inhibitory activity against pathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of fish, shrimp and shellfish.

40|$|Molybdenum mimics certain insulin {{actions in}} vitro. We have {{investigated}} the effects of oral administration of Na 2 MoO 4 (Mo) for 8 wk on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Mo decreased hyperglycemia and glucosuria by 75 % and corrected the elevation of plasma nonesterified fatty <b>acids.</b> <b>Tolerance</b> to glucose loads was improved, and glycogen stores were replenished. These effects were not due to a rise of insulinemia.

Finally, Mo totally reversed the low expression and activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in liver, but not in white adipose tissue. In conclusion, Mo exerts a marked blood glucose-lowering effect in diabetic rats by an insulin-like action. This effect results in part from a restoration of hepatic glucose metabolism and {{is associated with a}} tissue-specific correction of lipogenic enzyme gene expression, both processes being essentially mediated by reversal of impaired pretranslational regulatory mechanisms.

The acid stress imposed {{in a typical}} assay for <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> (log-phase cells in minimal glucose medium) was shown to comprise both inorganic (i. e., low pH) and organic acid components. A gene previously determined to affect <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance,</b> atbR, was identified as pgi, the gene encoding phosphoglucoisomerase. Mutations in pgi were shown to increase <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> by preventing the synthesis of organic acids. Protocols designed to separate the stresses of inorganic from organic acids revealed that the regulators ς 38 (RpoS), Fur, and Ada have major effects on tolerance to organic acid stress but only minor effects on inorganic acid stress. In contrast, the two-component regulatory system PhoP (identified as acid shock protein ASP 29) and PhoQ proved to be important for tolerance to organic acid stress but had little effect against organic acid stress. PhoP mutants also failed to induce four ASPs, confirming a role for this regulator in <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Acid shock induction of PhoP appears to occur {{at the transcriptional level}} and requires the PhoPQ system. Furthermore, induction by acid occurs even in the presence of high concentrations of magnesium, the ion known to be sensed by PhoQ. These results suggest that PhoQ can sense both Mg 2 + and pH. Since phoP mutants are avirulent, the low pH activation of this system has important implications concerning the pathogenesis of S. typhimurium.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Listeria monocytogenes to {{tolerate}} low-pH environments {{is of particular}} importance because the pathogen encounters such environments in vivo, both during passage through the stomach and within the macrophage phagosome. In our study, L. monocytogenes was shown to exhibit a significant adaptive <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> response following a 1 -h exposure to mild acid (pH 5. 5), which is capable of protecting cells from severe acid stress (pH 3. 5). Susceptibility to pH 3. 5 acid is growth phase dependent. Stationary-phase Listeria cultures are naturally resistant to the challenge pH (pH 3. 5), while exponential-phase cultures require adaptation at pH 5. 5 to induce <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Adaptation requires protein synthesis, since treatment with chloramphenicol prevents the development of <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Induction of the <b>acid</b> <b>tolerance</b> response also protects L. monocytogenes against the effect of other environmental stresses.

40|$|Abstract Background During the {{transmission}} route from poultry {{to the human}} host, the major foodborne pathogen C. jejuni may experience many types of stresses, including low pH caused by different acids. However, not all strains are equally sensitive to the stresses. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the response to acid stress of three sequenced C. jejuni strains with different <b>acid</b> <b>tolerances</b> using HCl and acetic acid. Results Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used for proteomic analysis and proteins were radioactively labelled with methionine to identify proteins only related to acid exposure. To allow added radioactive methionine to be incorporated into induced proteins, a modified chemically defined broth was developed with the minimal amount of methionine necessary for satisfactory growth of all strains. Protein spots were analyzed using image software and identification was done with MALDI-TOF-TOF. The most acid-sensitive isolate was C. jejuni 327, followed by NCTC 11168 and isolate 305 as the most tolerant. Overall, induction of five proteins was observed within the pI range investigated: 19 kDa periplasmic protein (p 19), thioredoxin-disulfide (TrxB), a hypothetical protein Cj 0706 (Cj 0706), molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein (MogA), and bacterioferritin (Dps). Strain and acid type dependent differences in the level of response were observed. For strain NCTC 11168, the induced proteins and the regulator fur were analysed at the transcriptomic level using qRT-PCR. In this transcriptomic analysis, only up-regulation of trxB and p 19 was observed. Conclusions A defined medium that supports the growth of a range of Campylobacter strains and suitable for proteomic analysis was developed. Mainly proteins normally involved in iron control and oxidative stress defence were induced during acid stress of C. jejuni. Both strain and acid type affected sensitivity and response. </p...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{tolerance}} is {{well known}} to be key to fungal survival in many habitats, but our mechanistic understanding of how organisms adapt to heat stress is still incomplete. Using Metarhizium robertsii, an emerging model organism for assessing evolutionary processes, we report that pyruvate is {{in the vanguard of}} molecules that scavenge heat-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). We show that, as well as inducing a rapid burst of ROS production, heat stress also downregulates genes for pyruvate consumption. The accumulating pyruvate is the fastest acting of several M.  robertsii ROS scavengers, efficiently reducing protein carbonylation, stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential, and promoting fungal growth. The acetate produced from pyruvate-ROS reactions itself causes <b>acid</b> stress, <b>tolerance</b> to which is regulated by Hog 1 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Heat stress also induces pyruvate accumulation in several other fungi, suggesting that scavenging of heat-induced ROS by pyruvate is widespread...|$|R
