25|$|The Reformed Churches (Liberated) are {{conservative}} in doctrine and practice. They {{do not allow}} women to hold special offices (elders, deacons, pastors), but in the 1990s they did approve women voting in church elections. They reject so-called Higher Criticism of the Bible. Liturgically, they favour {{the use of the}} Genevan Psalter in their worship services, although in the last decade a number of classical hymns has also been approved for use in the worship service. In recent years evangelical influences have become stronger (e.g. a more contemporary style of the worship, including new songs and hymns and the use of a praise band). A minority of the members and ministers are questioning some traditional doctrines, and <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a different approach on issues like the ordination of women, homosexual relationships, etc. A large middle group, however, wants to hold on to classical Calvinism.|$|E
25|$|The unusual {{lifestyle}} and growth pattern of Kiryas Joel {{has led to}} litigation {{on a number of}} fronts. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet that the Kiryas Joel school district, which covered only the village, was designed in violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment, because the design accommodated one group on the basis of religious affiliation. Subsequently, the New York State Legislature established a similar school district in the village that has passed legal muster. Further litigation has resulted over what entity should pay for the education of children with disabilities in Kiryas Joel, and over whether the community's boys must ride buses driven by women. A case against the village is currently pending in federal district court; plaintiffs, who <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> the village to be dissolved, say that Kiryas Joel is a theocracy whose existence violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, where local government leaders abuse the laws, such as those for tax-exempt status, zoning, and sanitation, to favor members of their own sect and persecute other Orthodox Jews. They also say that the leaders commit vote fraud by intimidating dissident voters and busing in non-residents.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} popular areas for the vrijmarkt in Amsterdam is the Jordaan quarter, but the wide Apollolaan {{in front of the}} Hilton hotel in {{southern}} Amsterdam is gaining in popularity. [...] Children sell their cast-off toys or garments at the Vondelpark, also in southern Amsterdam, and in a spirit of fun passers-by often offer the young sellers more than they <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> the goods. [...] Until 1996 the vrijmarkt began the evening before and continued for 24hours. [...] This was ended in the hope of gaining a pause in the celebrations so preparations could be made for the daytime activities. Utrecht, uniquely among Dutch municipalities, retains the overnight vrijmarkt.|$|E

[...] Despite rainy weather, hundred of people showed up to carry signs, light candles, and place stuffed turtles on the beach.

[...] This second motion asked {{for permission to}} [...] "attempt to feed" [...] Schiavo by mouth. Judge Greer denied the second motion on March 8, saying [...] "it has become clear that the second motion {{is part and parcel}} of the previous motion on medical evaluations. The same declarations are being used for both motions and the motion appears to be an alternative pleading to the previous motion. Both <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> an experimental procedure." [...] The following day, Greer denied the first motion as well, citing that an affiant doctor for Michael cautioned that fMRI was an experimental procedure that should be conducted in an academic setting, because Schiavo had already undergone swallowing tests and failed, and because VitalStim had only been performed on patients who were not in a PVS. Greer noted that [...] "most of the doctor affidavits submitted are based on their understanding of Schiavo's condition from news reports or video clips they have seen. Many are obviously not aware of the medical exams undertaken for the 2002 trial." ...|$|E

Samaras then started the next match against Motherwell in the SPL {{and set up}} another goal for Anthony Stokes, Celtic {{went on to win}} the match 2–1 after being 1–0 down. Samaras went on to score his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 5–0 win over St Mirren. Manager Neil Lennon said that; [...] "He got his goal, which we've been waiting on a long time. His play was fantastic. He is a talent and all we <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> is consistency. He has shown everyone today what he is capable of when he is in full flow. The rest took a leaf from his book." [...] After an impressive performance in Celtic's 1–1 draw against Italian league leaders Udinese, fellow Serie A side Palermo expressed an interest in Samaras. He had been playing as a left midfielder in the previous few weeks, and the Daily Record said that his good form since returning to the team had helped re-ignite Celtic's season. On 24 December, Samaras started as a striker and scored twice as Celtic beat Kilmarnock 2–1.|$|E

In {{only half of the}} cases a reference period is taken into account and in half the reasons for working more/less in the survey week than usual <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for.</b> Contractual hours <b>are</b> hardly <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> and so <b>are</b> paid and unpaid overtime hours.

60|$|Dr. C. J. Romanes {{tells of}} a female {{chimpanzee}} who was taught to count straws up to five. She held the straws in her hand, exposing the ends to the number requested. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> three, she held up three. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> four, she held up four. All this is a mere matter of training. But consider now, Mr. Burroughs, what follows. When she <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> five straws and she had only four, she doubled one straw, exposing both its ends and thus making up the required number. She did not do this only once, and by accident. She did it whenever more straws <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> than she possessed. Did she perform a distinctly reasoning act? or was her action the result of blind, mechanical instinct? If Mr. Burroughs cannot answer to his own satisfaction, he may call Dr. Romanes a nature-faker and dismiss the incident from his mind.|$|R

2500|$|In 1863, the now Emperor Napoleon III {{began to}} loosen {{some of the}} {{restrictions}} on political opposition. Thiers was encouraged to re-enter political life by his friends, and by a new acquaintance, the Prussian ambassador to Paris, Otto von Bismarck. Thiers {{decided to run for}} election to the Assembly. On 31 May 1863, at the age of sixty-six, he was elected as a deputy for Paris. He returned to the Assembly on 6 November 1863 and took his seat, but found that under Napoleon III the protocol had changed. Instead of speaking from the tribune, members were only allowed to speak from their seats. Thiers was uncomfortable with this way of speaking, and his first few speeches were failures, but he soon mastered the form. On 11 January 1864 he delivered a blistering attack on Napoleon's government, and listed the [...] "necessary liberties" [...] he said were lacking in France: [...] "Security of the citizen against violence from individuals or from the arbitrary use of power; [...] liberty, but not impunity, for the press; free elections; freedom of the people's representatives; [...] and public opinion expressed by the majority guiding the steps of the government. These are the liberties that the people <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> today; [...] tomorrow, in a tone very different, they may be demanding them."
