5|$|Taste is {{the most}} {{important}} sense in sheep, establishing forage preferences, with sweet and sour plants being preferred and bitter plants being more commonly rejected. Touch and sight <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in relation to specific plant characteristics, such as succulence and growth form.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{atmospheric}} circulation bands consist {{of the trade}} winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. Ocean currents <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} basically {{describes the}} existence of the jet stream, a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the tropopause which is (even though other factors <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important)</b> the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole.|$|E

5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E
5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> {{causes of}} {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{is mainly}} on the ground, and the bird's diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, {{such as those of}} brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common knotgrass, fat hen, common chickweed and yarrow. Grasses <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important,</b> particularly cereals, and grain makes up {{a significant part of the}} food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks which can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.|$|E

5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the American Dialect Society chose #BlackLivesMatter {{as their}} {{word of the}} year. Yes! Magazine picked #BlackLivesMatter {{as one of the}} twelve hashtags that changed the world in 2014. memes <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in garnering support for the Black Lives Matter new social movement. Information {{communication}} technologies such as Facebook and Twitter spread memes and are important tools for garnering web support in hopes of producing a spillover effect into the offline world. However,Blue Lives Matterand other opponents of BLM have also used memes to criticize and parody the movement.|$|E
5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E

5000|$|The town {{is still}} part of the region called [...] "Los Altos de Jalisco", which is one {{important}} milkshed for the center of Mexico. Dairy products manufacturing has increased recently. Agriculture <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important,</b> mainly beekeeping, and crops like chili pepper, corn and beans. Retail industry <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important,</b> especially furniture warehouses and livestock forage.|$|R
5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|MFGM {{phospholipid}} components such as phosphatidylcholine {{are a key}} constituent of {{the intestinal}} mucus barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, {{are present in the}} apical membrane of the gut epithelia, and <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense.|$|E
5|$|Malawian cuisine is diverse, with tea {{and fish}} being popular {{features}} of the country's cuisine. Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> components of the cuisine and economy. Lake Malawi {{is a source of}} fish including chambo (similar to bream) usipa (similar to sardine), and mpasa (similar to salmon and kampango). Nsima is a food staple made from ground corn and typically served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. It is commonly eaten for lunch and dinner.|$|E

5|$|Munich, Hamburg, Cologne and Düsseldorf <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> design, {{production}} and trade hubs {{of the domestic}} fashion industry, among smaller towns. Renowned fashion designers from Germany include Karl Lagerfeld, Jil Sander, Wolfgang Joop, Philipp Plein and Michael Michalsky. Important brands include Hugo Boss, Escada, Adidas, Puma, Esprit and Triumph. The German supermodels Claudia Schiffer, Heidi Klum, Tatjana Patitz, Nadja Auermann and Toni Garrn, among others, have come to international fame.|$|E
5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both shallow and deep marine waters {{where they can be}} benthic or pelagic, but they <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E
5|$|The {{biocidal}} {{effects of}} some heavy metals {{have been known}} since antiquity. Platinum, osmium, copper, ruthenium, and other heavy metals, including arsenic, are used in anti-cancer treatments, or have shown potential. Antimony (anti-protozoal), bismuth (anti-ulcer), gold (anti-arthritic), and iron (anti-malarial) <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in medicine. Copper, zinc, silver, gold, or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations; small amounts of some heavy metals are used to control algal growth in, for example, cooling towers. Depending on their intended use as fertilisers or biocides, agrochemicals may contain heavy metals such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, or lead.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{diagenesis}} <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> in the decomposition of bone tissue.|$|R

5|$|The immune system, {{particularly}} the innate component, plays a decisive role in tissue repair after an insult. Key actors include macrophages and neutrophils, but other cellular actors, including γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important.</b> The plasticity of immune cells {{and the balance}} between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals are crucial aspects of efficient tissue repair. Immune components and pathways are involved in regeneration as well, for example in amphibians. According to one hypothesis, organisms that can regenerate could be less immunocompetent than organisms that cannot regenerate.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{is popular}} as a visitor {{attraction}} and a summer resort. Fisheries and the harvesting {{of food and}} fodder plants <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> on Dal. Weeds from the lake are extracted and converted into compost for the gardens. It {{also serves as a}} flood lung of the Jhelum River. Swimming, boating, snow skiing (particularly when the lake is frozen during the severe winter), and canoeing are amongst some of the water sports activities practised on the lake.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>important</b> {{in biological}} responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are {{largely responsible for}} the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.|$|E
