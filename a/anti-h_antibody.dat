A species-specific H antigen is expressed in the core proteins of the polar flagella of V. vulnificus. Of 435 V. vulnificus isolates identified bacteriologically, 432 (99. 3 %) were agglutinated in the slide test within 2 min after {{the addition of the}} anti-V. vulnificus H coagglutination reagent. Other than Vibrio pelagius, the reagent did not agglutinate 19 heterologous Vibrio spp. tested, including 290 V. cholerae, 22 V. mimicus, 395 V. parahaemolyticus, and 16 V. fluvialis isolates recovered from seafood and the marine environment. The serological resolution of the coagglutination reaction was enhanced if the organism under test was suspended in 0. 1 M Tris buffer- 0. 1 mM EDTA- 1. 0 % Triton X- 100 (TET) for 24 h before serological examination. The TET buffer also increased the sensitivity of the coagglutination reaction 100 -fold over that for isolates suspended in 0. 3 % formalinized phosphate-buffered saline before testing. The anti-H coagglutination test is a rapid, serologically specific, and inexpensive procedure for identifying V. vulnificus one step beyond primary isolation...|$|E

In 45 patients with typhoid, a significant elevation of immunoglobulin M (IgM) level was noted {{from the first}} week of illness onwards. Eighteen TAB-vaccinated persons also showed a significant elevation of IgM levels. In typhoid sera, the anti-O and <b>anti-H</b> <b>antibodies</b> were mostly 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 -ME) sensitive. The rise of IgM level correlated well with the 2 -ME-sensitive anti-O and <b>anti-H</b> <b>antibodies</b> seen in typhoid patients. The anti-O antibodies in the TAB-vaccinated group were almost entirely 2 -ME sensitive, but both 2 -ME-sensitive and -resistant <b>anti-H</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in the TAB group. A marked increas in C 3 level was also noted in patients with typhoid. The cell-mediated immunity (CMI), as measured by leukocyte migration inhibition tests, was demonstrable in 15 of 22 patients with typhoid. On the other hand, only 8 of the 20 normal subjects, 5 of the 16 fever control cases, and 6 of the 18 TAB-vaccinated individuals gave a positive CMI. The latter three groups were comparable with each other but were significantly different from the typhoid patients.

STUDY DESIGN: We analysed <b>anti-H.</b> pylori IgG <b>antibodies</b> in the serum and cervical mucus of 67 patients diagnosed with idiopathic infertility using the Quanta Lite H. pylori IgG test. The penetration of normal sperm, in 15 cervical mucus samples positive for <b>anti-H.</b> pylori <b>antibodies</b> and in 15 negative samples, was assessed using the simplified slide test. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation emerged between <b>anti-H.</b> pylori IgG <b>antibody</b> concentrations in the serum and in the cervical mucus (r= 0. 9275; p< 0. 00001). In the 15 anti-H. pylori IgG mucus-positive samples the slide test showed abnormal penetration by the spermatozoa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the presence of <b>anti-H.</b> pylori <b>antibody</b> in the cervical mucus can be involved in female infertility, interfering with sperm progression. Considering the close correlation found between serum and cervical mucus <b>anti-H.</b> pylori <b>antibody</b> titres, measuring serum antibodies could become an additional test, in particular in couples with unexplained infertility...|$|R

A cohort of 150 SSc patients were selected and tested by Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF), Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE), Immunoblot (IB) using various extracts as antigenic source and RNA precipitation. By preparing a nuclear (IB-nuclear) and a metaphase chromosomal-enriched extract (IB-MC-pellet) from HeLa cells {{as well as a}} nucleolar (IB-nucleolar) and a histone (IB-histone) extract from rat liver nuclei, we assessed their sensitivity and specificity for anti-Topo 1, anti-U 3 RNP, anti-H- 1, anti-snRNPs antibodies and ACA. IB-nuclear revealed the highest frequency of anti-Topo I antibodies, while CIE, IB-nucleolar and IB-MC-pellet, when compared to IB-nuclear showed a sensitivity of 89 %, 87 % and 95 %, respectively. IB-MC-pellet was unique for ACA recognition, while IB-nucleolar and IB-MC-pellet showed excellent sensitivity for anti-U 3 RNP and <b>anti-H,</b> <b>antibody</b> detection. We conclude that IB-nuclear is a highly sensitive system for anti Topo I antibodies determination, but CIE reveals a good sensitivity {{to be used as a}} first screening test. IB-nucleolar or IB-MC-pellet are important techniques to detect the variety of antibodies to nucleolus and chromatin-related constituents.

40|$|Factor H (fllH globulin), 1 an {{important}} control protein {{of the alternative}} pathway of complement (C) activation, is recognized as having three characteristic functions: (a) acceleration of the decay dissociation of the C 3 convertase (C 3 b,Bb) by binding to C 3 b and displacing activated factor B (Bb) (1); (b) function as an essential cofactor for the cleavage inactivation of fluid-phase C 3 b by factor I (C 3 b-inactivator) (2); and (c) potentiation of the factor I cleavage of bound C 3 b (1). Factor H also binds to B lymphocyte membrane receptors that are specific for H and triggers the B cells to release endogenous factor I (3). In addition, Hammann and co-workers (4) have recently reported that purified H triggers lymphocyte blastogenesis. In the present study, an antibody directed to the binding site (idiotype) of anti-H was used to characterize the structure of B cell membrane H receptors. This strategy for receptor characterization was first described by Sege and Peterson (5), who demonstrated that an antibody to the idiotype of anti-retinol-binding protein (RBP) reacted with prealbumin, thus identifying prealbumin as the probable carrier ("receptor") for RBP in the blood. The basis for applying this approach to H receptor characterization was {{the hypothesis that the}} binding site of H receptors might be structurally similar to the idiotype of <b>anti-H</b> <b>antibody</b> and, thus, that antibody to the idiotype of anti-H might react with membrane H receptors. Accordingly, an anti-H idiotype serum was prepared by injecting rabbits with purified goat F(ab') 2 antihuman H. Several lines of evidence indicated that one of the rabbit-anti-goat-antihuman H anti-idiotype antibodies (aaH) isolated from this antiserum was specific for human B cell H receptors. Both actH immunoprecipitation and H-agarose affinity chromatography were then used to characterize the molecular weight of the H receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) ...|$|E

Aim and Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the baseline Widal titre of the apparently healthy population of a tertiary care centre of Uttarakhand. Material and Methods: Blood samples were collected from healthy blood donors (n= 500) of the age group of 18 - 60 years, of both the sexes, who attended our blood bank from September 2013 to November 2013 and were analyzed for the presence of Salmonella antibodies by carrying out the Widal tube agglutination test. Results: Of the 500 serum samples which were tested, 255 (51 %) serum samples were positive for agglutinins (≥ 1 : 20) and 245 were negative. The most frequently recorded titre of the reactive sera was 1 : 40 for the anti-O antibodies and 1 : 80 for the <b>anti-H</b> <b>antibodies</b> for Salmonella enterica serotype typhi and this was the baseline titre.

(ii) Compare the sensitivity and specificity of both anti-O and <b>anti-H</b> <b>antibodies.</b> (iii) Compare the validity of single versus paired serum samples with a rising titer for the diagnosis of typhoid fever. Methods Duplicate serum samples were obtained from 150 patients clinically diagnosed as typhoid fever patients. Moreover, single serum samples were obtained from 25 patients with febrile diseases other than typhoid fever. All samples were tested using the four different Widal brands and Salmonella Typhi IgM anti-LPS ELISA Results - The results of Widal tests differed markedly using the four Widal brands in terms of sensitivity and specificity at three cut-off values of 1 / 80, 1 / 160 and 1 / 320. Remel brand gave the highest sensitivities and the lowest specificities and Dialab brand gave the highest specificities and the lowest sensitivities for both anti-O and <b>anti-H</b> <b>antibodies</b> at the three cut-off values. - Four fold rise in the antibodies titer was not demonstrable among clinically diagnosed typhoid fever patients -H agglutinins were less sensitive and less specific than O agglutinins Conclusions -Widal test results showed marked discrepancies using different Widal brands.

Apart from the detection of these antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), it is desirable to obtain additional information concerning the presence of certain virulence factors of H. pylori that are currently detected by immunoblot analysis. At present, the immunodiagnosis of an H. pylori infection includes two separate methods: ELISA and immunoblot analysis. Here, we report the development and evaluation of a new rapid flow microparticle immunofluorescence assay (FMIA) for detection of <b>anti-H.</b> pylori <b>antibodies</b> in human serum.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 167 patients with infertility and 837 age- and gender-matched controls (blood donors) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting to determine the seropositivity for H. pylori infection. The presence of <b>anti-H.</b> pylori <b>antibodies</b> in samples of follicular fluid, vaginal secretions and sperm was determined using the same techniques. The possible cross-reactivity with spermatozoa of anti-H. pylori hyperimmune sera and human antibodies was studied by immunofluorescence.

RESULTS: The prevalence of infection was significantly higher in patients than controls (49. 1 % v. 33. 5 %, P < 0. 001). Follicular fluids from infected patients contained specific antibodies in all cases, sperm samples in about 50 % of cases, and vaginal secretions in a minority of cases. Sera to H. pylori whole antigens and VacA reacted with the tails and the pericentriolar area of human spermatozoa (which are rich in tubulin); sera to urease and heat-shock protein (Hsp) did not. Follicular fluids with <b>anti-H.</b> pylori <b>antibodies</b> immune reacted with spermatozoa. A linear homology was found between beta-tubulin and three H. pylori proteins, flagellin, VacA and CagA. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori infection may increase the risk of developing reproductive disorders or worsen the clinical expression of this syndrome...|$|R
40|$|IgG {{fractions}} were purified on {{a protein}} G-agarose column from sera of both {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) patients and healthy donors. All IgG fractions, after elution with 0. 5 M acetic acid, reacted with histones in an anti-histone ELISA assay, and IgG anti-histone activity was in all instances higher in the IgG fraction than in the corresponding whole serum. This was shown {{to be due to}} the presence in serum of histone-binding components that inhibited IgG binding to histones. Both normal human and SLE patients' sera had these histone-binding components, and disparity between serum-positive and -negative anti-histone antibody (AHA) tests was not dependent on differences in the blocking capacity but on IgG antibody levels and avidity. Interaction of normal serum IgG fraction with all five histones was of low avidity, whereas interaction of IgG from AHA-positive SLE sera with both H 1 and H 2 B had high avidity. Low-affinity antibodies to every histone fraction, but also high-affinity <b>anti-H</b> 1 <b>antibodies,</b> were preferentially inhibited. Our data indicate that several serum protein components are inhibiting histone/anti-histone interaction and may play a protective role against both high-affinity <b>anti-H</b> 1 <b>antibodies</b> present in SLE patients, and natural, low-affinity, anti-histone antibodies. As some acute phase proteins, notably C-reactive protein, bind to histones, it is conceivable that they play such a role. High-affinity <b>anti-H</b> 2 B <b>antibodies,</b> present in some SLE patients, and not inhibited by these serum components, may, on the other hand, participate in the pathogenesis of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{intensive}} research, {{the etiology}} of acute anterior uveitis (AAU) remains poorly defined. Infection with gram-negative bacteria such as Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Chlamydia have already been suggested as a possible trigger event for AAU. Helicobacter pylori is also a gram-negative bacterium, shares the lipopolysaccharides, but did not {{attract the attention of}} many ophthalmologists until recently. Having in mind the relatively high incidence of H. pylori infection in the population, we propose that H. pylori may also be a trigger factor for AAU. Patients and Methods: The presence of <b>anti-H.</b> pylori <b>antibodies</b> in matching serum and aqueous humor samples of 15 idiopathic AAU patients was determined using a commercial Western blot assay. Control serum and aqueous humor were obtained from five patients undergoing cataract surgery. Results: Six out of 15 AAU patients (40 %) were serum-positive for H. pylori, and half of these (n = 3) also had <b>anti-H.</b> pylori <b>antibodies</b> in the aqueous humor. All five aqueous humor and sera controls tested negative for H. pylori infection...|$|R

This indicates a steady rise of H. pylori carrier rates with age. The overall H. pylori prevalence rate was 54. 9 %. The positivity of H. pylori in teenagers appeared to be double that reported in Western countries. Whether this is related to the younger age of peptic ulcer presentation in Hong Kong compared with Western countries is not known. However, {{there was no significant difference}} of the H. pylori rates between males and females of each age group although a male predominance has been well established for peptic ulcer in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
