40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a concept of}} platoon movement of autonomous vehicles (smart cars). These vehicles have <b>Adaptive</b> or Advanced <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> (ACC) system also called Intelligent <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> (ICC) or <b>Adaptive</b> Intelligent <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> (AICC) system. The vehicles are suitable to follow other vehicles on desired distance and to be organized in platoons. To perform a research on the control and stability of an AGV (Automated Guided Vehicles) string, we have developed a car-following model. To do this, first a single vehicle is modeled and since all cars in the platoon have the same dynamics, the single vehicle model is copied ten times to form model of platoon (string) with ten vehicles. To control this string, we have applied equal PID controllers to all vehicles, except the leading vehicle. These controllers {{try to keep the}} headway distance as constant as possible and the velocity error between subsequent vehicles - small. For control of vehicle with nonlinear dynamics combi­nation of feedforward control and feedback control approach is used. Feedforward control is based on the inverse model of nominal dynamics of the vehicle, and feedback PID control is designed based on the linearized model of the vehicle. For simulation and analysis of vehicle and platoon of vehicles – we have developed Matlab/Simulink models. Simulation results, discussions and conclusions are given {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R

The analysis of the effect of mixing on capacity and stability of traffic system is based on these results. It’s found that throughput increases with the proportion of ACC vehicles when flow is below capacity conditions. But above capacity, speed variability increases and speed drops with Constant Time Gap (CTG) control ACC compared with human drivers...|$|R

25|$|The Ford scored well in test {{drives and}} the media was pleased {{with some of the}} new {{features}} available in the 2010 Ford Taurus. Some of these features include all wheel drive, cross traffic alert, collision warning, blind spot monitoring and <b>adaptive</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> However, others criticized the lack of interior room and reduced sight lines despite its full-sized exterior, and Edmunds noted that the eighth-generation Honda Accord (which competes in the mid-size category) had superior driving dynamics and a more efficient design and offered almost as much interior space as the Taurus despite considerably smaller external dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> {{function}} senses {{the speed}} and pace of vehicles ahead, and can automatically adjust the speed the car is traveling at accordingly to maintain one of four user selectable gaps. Pre-Collision Braking uses the same cameras to monitor {{the activity of the}} vehicles ahead, and alerts the driver visually and audibly. If the driver fails to act, more alerts will be sounded and the car will actively brake itself. According to the IIHS, the Legacy prevented a collision while traveling at 25mph towards a stopped obstacle. When the car was first released for the 2015 model year, Lane Departure with Sway warning was included in the Eyesight package. This function watched the driver's position within the lane lines, and alerted the driver if they were drifting out of the lane (if a turn signal was used, this alert was not activated), with Sway warning notified the driver if they appeared to be unable to stay centered in the lane, suggesting they may be overly drowsy. For the 2016 model year, a Lane Keep Assist was added, which applied steering torque to prevent the driver from drifting from the lane. This function is active above 40 miles an hour. Also standard on all cars with the Eyesight system are adaptive fog lights aid in turns and cornering and is based on the steering wheel degree.|$|E
40|$|Current {{use case}} {{guidelines}} typically recommend a goal-driven process for use case creation and, in many cases, this approach indeed works sufficiently well. Yet, in our experience, this goal-driven approach {{does not seem}} to offer the best fit for every kind of function, e. g. for highly context-sensitive automotive driver assistance systems. For these functions we suggest selecting a context-driven process for use case creation. In this paper we first show the effectiveness of goal-driven use case creation for a usual car telephone function. Then we demonstrate the limits of this approach for an <b>adaptive</b> vehicle <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> function (the Distronic system). Finally we present our basic ideas of a context-driven use case creation process and evidence its advantages as compared to the goal-driven approach using the example of the Distronic function. 1...|$|R

40|$|Advanced <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (ACC), {{also known}} as <b>adaptive</b> or {{intelligent}} <b>cruise</b> <b>control,</b> not only maintains the driver-set vehicle speed, but also adjusts the vehicle's speed {{to that of a}} preceding vehicle, and helps to maintain a pre-selected headway time to the vehicle ahead. ACC systems can have a favourable effect on road safety when used on motorways with non-congested traffic. In these conditions ACC has a moderating effect on the driving speed, and decreases the percentage of very short headway times. Negative safety effects can be expected if ACC is used in busy traffic, and on rural and urban roads other than main roads. Furthermore, ACC can {{have a positive effect on}} fuel consumption and road capacity. New generations of even more intelligent ACC are being developed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the impacts of}} <b>Adaptive</b> (Intelligent) <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (ACC) laws on the traffic flow.

Explicit comparison of two ACC laws, Constant Time Headway (CTH) and Variable Time Headway (VTH), are based on these results. It is found that the latter one has better performance in terms of capacity and stability of traffic. Throughput increases with the proportion of CTH vehicles when flow is below capacity conditions. But above capacity, speed variability increases and speed drops with the CTH traffic compared with manual traffic, while the VTH traffic always performs better...|$|R
40|$|A {{modeling}} tool is described {{for studying the}} nature and relative frequency of driving conflicts {{that are likely to}} be encountered when the innovation called <b>Adaptive</b> (or intelligent) <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (ACC) becomes a common automotive option. ACC constitutes an enhancement to a standard <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> system which allows the subject vehicle to adapt to the speed of a preceding vehicle at an appropriate distance by controlling the engine and/or power train / andlor brake. Thus, ACC-assisted drivers can merely set a desired speed and then permit the system to deal with the conflicts in longitudinal separation that arise when other vehicles are approached. However many design and operating variables can influence the quality of the conflict-resolution processes. It is further recognized that all the operating variables appear as stochastic variables each with it...|$|R
40|$|As {{more and}} more Intelligent Transportation System {{in-vehicle}} equipment enters the general consumer market, the authors are {{about to find out}} how different design engineers are from ordinary drivers. Driver information systems are being developed and installed in vehicles at an ever-increasing rate. These systems provide information on diverse topics of concern and convenience to the driver, such as routing and navigation, emergency and collision warnings, and a variety of motorists services, or yellow pages functions. Most of these systems are being developed and installed in isolation from each other, with separate means of gathering the information and of displaying it to the driver. The current lack of coordination among on-board systems threatens to create a situation in which different messages on separate displays will be competing with each other for the drivers attention. Urgent messages may go unnoticed, and the number of messages may distract the driver from the most critical task of controlling the vehicle. Thus, without good human factors design and engineering for integrating multiple systems in the vehicle, consumers may find ITS systems confusing and frustrating to use. The current state of the art in human factors research and design for in-vehicle systems has a number of fundamental gaps. Some of these gaps were identified during the Intelligent Vehicle Initiative Human Factors Technology Workshop, sponsored by the US Department of Transportation, in Troy, Michigan, December 10 [...] 11, 1997. One task for workshop participants was to identify needed research areas or topics relating to in-vehicle human factors. The top ten unmet research needs from this workshop are presented. Many of these gaps in human factors research knowledge indicate the need for standardization in the functioning of interfaces for safety-related devices such as collision avoidance systems (CAS) and <b>adaptive</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>controls</b> (ACC). Such standards and guidelines will serve to make the safety-critical aspects of these systems consistent across different manufacturers, thereby reducing the likelihood of driver surprise. A second area to emerge from the Workshop concerns research into techniques for integrating multiple devices in vehicles. This type of research is needed to support the development and validation of standards and guidelines, and is discussed in the second section. The majority of the top ten research types identified in the Workshop fall under the need for a Science of Driving, which is discussed in the last section of this paper...|$|R

Each of these methods has been already applied to specific case studies, different from method to method. This paper has therefore the purpose of implementing and com-paring them over a common benchmark, allowing us to assess the main properties, characteristics, and strong/weak points of each method. In the simulations, a realistic model of the SMART car, including gear box and engine nonlinearities, is considered. A description of the methods to be compared is presented, and the comparison results are collected in a table. In particular, the tradeoffs between complexity and accuracy of the solution, as well as computational aspects are highlighted.
