5000|$|At that time, {{the concept}} of NeuroML was closely linked {{with the idea of}} {{developing}} a software architecture in which a base application loads a range of plug-in components to handle different aspects of a simulation problem. Neosim (2003) was developed based on this goal, and early NeuroML development was closely <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> approach. Along with creating Neosim, Howell and Cannon developed a software library, the NeuroML Development Kit (NDK), to simplify the process of serializing models in XML. The NeuroML Development Kit implemented a particular dialect of XML, including the [...] "listOfXXX" [...] structure, which also found its way into SBML(Systems Biology Markup Language), but did not define any particular structures at the model description level. Instead, developers of plug-ins for Neosim were free to invent their own structures and serialize them via the NDK, in the hope that some consensus would emerge around the most useful ones. In practice, few developers beyond the Edinburgh group developed or used such structures and the resulting XML was too application specific to gain wider adoption. The Neosim project ended in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Neodymium-doped {{solid state}} lasers {{continue}} to be the laser source of choice for industrial applications. Direct pumping of the upper Nd laser level at 885-nm (rather than at the more traditional broad 808-nm band) offers the potential of improved performance through a reduction in the lasing quantum defect, thereby improving system efficiency, reducing cooling requirements, and enabling further TEM00 power scaling. Because of the narrow 885-nm absorption feature in Nd:YAG, certain systems may benefit from the use of wavelength-locked diode pump sources, which serve to narrow and stabilize the pump emission spectrum to keep it closely <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> absorption feature. To date, high power diode laser locking schemes such as internal distributed feedback Bragg gratings and externally aligned volume holographic grating optics, VHG’s, have not been widely implemented due to the increased cost and assumed performance penalty of the technology. However, recent advancements in the manufacture of stabilized diode pump sources which utilize external wavelength locking now offer improved spectral properties with little-to-no impact on power and efficiency. [...] Benefits of this approach include improvements in laser efficiency, spectral linewidth, and pumping efficiency.|$|E

Overall, estimates show that wages in Italy are inflexible, but this is mainly due to real wage rigidity rather than downward nominal wage rigidity. Between 50 and 80 % of all notional wage changes that lie below a sort of inflation-related or union-set threshold are forced <b>to</b> <b>align</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> level.

The testing specimens are taken from the fresh slaughtered Boer sheepskin and they are prepared into four categories; horizontal (unshaved), horizontal (shaved), vertical (unshaved) and vertical (shaved) according to ASTM International Standard test method for tensile strength of leather (D 2209).
