5|$|On 3 December 2011, Hughes {{was arrested}} and bailed on charges of sexual assault after an {{incident}} in Croydon. He was then charged with the offence on 30 January 2012. In May 2012 Hughes {{was found guilty of}} common assault and fined £500, but the charge of sexual <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> dropped.|$|E
5|$|Stuart's cavalry {{action in}} {{indirect}} {{support of the}} infantry <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful. He was met and stopped by Union cavalry {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg about three miles (5km) to the east, in East Cavalry Field.|$|E
5|$|The <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> {{ordered by}} Adolf Hitler, to {{eliminate}} the gains made by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra and the subsequent weeks, and by reaching the coast {{in the region of}} Avranches {{at the base of the}} Cotentin peninsula, cut off the units of the Third United States Army which had advanced into Brittany.|$|E

5|$|The raid was {{intended}} to take 40 minutes. The actual time between the team's entry in and exit from the compound was 38 minutes. According to the Associated Press, the <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> completed in the first 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|A police {{van with}} two {{officers}} arrived {{a short time}} after the shootings began, at around 11:00. They entered the yard of the college where they were shot at by Saari, and forced to retreat. From around 11:45 to 12:00 further police units, bolstered {{by a number of}} armoured vehicles, began to arrive on the scene. They attempted to enter the building through the main corridor, but this <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> aborted due to the black smoke that was emanating from within the building.|$|E
5|$|Bell's retrial in the Barker <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> {{scheduled}} for December 6. Three {{days before the}} trial began, {{he pleaded guilty to}} a reduced charge of battery, and was sentenced to 18months in a juvenile facility, with credit for time served. He agreed to testify against any of the other assault defendants at trial. All appeals were dropped as part of the plea agreement.|$|E
50|$|Cases {{of sexual}} abuse are {{considered}} in many states to qualify as “sexual assault” under the law; sexual <b>assault</b> <b>is</b> often arbitrated through rape or sexual battery statutes. Cases of sexual <b>assault</b> <b>are</b> arbitrated differently according to individual state laws and statutes.|$|R
40|$|Absolute Pacifism (or AP) is {{the thesis}} that no act of <b>assault</b> <b>is</b> morally permissible. This entails that all acts of self-defensive <b>assault</b> <b>are</b> impermissible. This essay defends AP against non-eliminativist {{theories}} of justified self-defensive <b>assault</b> - that <b>is,</b> theories of self-defensive assault which, contrary to AP, claim {{that at least some}} instances of self-defensive <b>assault</b> <b>are</b> morally permissible. Chapter 1 begins by defining assault and AP and subsequently exploring a species of AP wedded to the Doctrine of Double Effect (or DDE). Chapter 2 defends AP against {{the thesis that}} self-defensive <b>assault</b> <b>is</b> morally permissible but not morally obligatory. Against this, it is argued {{that there can be no}} mere right to self-defensive assault since that right would render permissible causing unnecessary harm. Chapter 3 defends AP against the thesis that self-defensive <b>assault</b> <b>is</b> not only morally permissible but also morally obligatory. Against this, it is argued that there can be no duty to engage in self-defensive <b>assault</b> because there <b>is</b> a trivializability constraint which makes the existence of those duties impossible. Since if there are permissible instances of self-defensive <b>assault</b> they <b>are</b> either mere rights or duties, and since there are no instances of either, it follows that there are no instances of permissible self-defensive assault...|$|R
50|$|Frontal <b>assaults</b> <b>were</b> {{also the}} cause of massive {{casualties}} in the trench warfare of World War I. In many cases, frontal <b>assaults</b> <b>were</b> made by thousands of men towards trenches defended by machine gun emplacements, artillery and barbed wire with predictable and tragic results.|$|R
5|$|Gen. Lee {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} at about 2:30 p.m., as Rodes's men were in mid-attack. Seeing that a major <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> underway, he lifted his restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his attacks from the morning. First in line was Heth's division again, with two fresh brigades: Pettigrew's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginians.|$|E
5|$|In mid-May, aerial {{reconnaissance}} near Mont Sorrel indicated that German forces were preparing an attack. Royal Flying Corps (RFC) observers had noted {{the existence of}} works curiously resembling the Canadian positions, well behind the German lines. The Germans were also observed digging new sap trenches which implied that an <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> intended. The Canadian Corps had just begun developing plans to overrun the more dangerous German positions, when the Germans executed an assault of their own.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Infantry Division's Operation Showdown {{launched}} {{in the early morning}} hours of 14 October 1952, with the 31st Infantry and 32nd Infantry at the head of the attack. The target of the <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> the Triangle Hill complex northeast of Kumhwa. The 7th Infantry Division remained in the Triangle Hill area until the end of October, when it was relieved by the 25th Infantry Division. The 7th Infantry Division was highly praised by commanders for its tenacity through the fight.|$|E

5|$|The Itzas' {{continued}} resistance {{had become}} a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all. The final <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> {{made possible by the}} gradual opening of the road from Mérida to Petén; by December 1696 this road had reached the lake shore although it was unfinished and still almost impassable in places. By this time the deep divisions between the political leaders of the Itza were such that a unified defence of the Itza kingdom had become impossible.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{launched}} a counter-attack on the Allied lodgement around Scarlet Beach. A three-pronged action, the counter-attack saw a diversionary attack to the north, while the Sugino Craft Raiding Unit attacked from the sea, and two infantry regiments assaulted the centre aiming towards {{the beach and}} the Heldsbach plantation. It had been intended that once the beachhead was overwhelmed, that the 79th and 80th Infantry Regiments would link up and then clear the Finschhafen and Langemark Bay areas; but the <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> poorly co-ordinated and failed to achieve sufficient weight to overcome the Australians, while also suffering {{from a lack of}} artillery. The seaborne <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> interdicted by US Navy PT boats, which inflicted heavy casualties, and was destroyed by Allied machine gunners on the beach. In the centre, though, the Japanese were able to break through to Siki Cove, and in the process isolated several Australian units, including those fighting on the western flank around Jivevenang, forcing the Australians to resort to air drops to keep their forces supplied.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> {{thoroughly}} prepared. The {{plan was}} for six Portuguese squadrons under dom João da Silva {{to block the}} entrance to the bridge, isolating the redoubt from Fort San Crisóbal. The fort would in turn be attacked by Alfonso Futrado and Simon Correa da Silva. Maestre de Campo dom Diogo Gomes was given the task of cutting the communication lines along the Guadiana river and Pedro Almado of distracting several minor forts nearby. Some cavalry regiments were deployed in the expectation of a fierce Spanish resistance.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} erupted on October 17, 1918, with {{an attack}} by 100 rebel cacos on a gendarmerie barracks. The <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> repulsed with significant loss of life, and commanding officer Lieutenant Patrick Kelly earned Haiti's Médaille militaire and a promotion to captain {{for his role in}} the defense of the barracks. A wave of small-scale rebel attacks on isolated gendarmerie outposts followed; over a six-month period in 1919, the gendarmerie reported more than 130 engagements with cacos.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} {{target was}} RAF Fighter Command. The service's destruction would deny the British their air superiority asset. Throughout July and early August, the Germans made preparations for Adlertag. The {{date of the}} <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> postponed several times because of bad weather. Eventually, it was carried out on 13 August 1940. The German attacks on 13 August inflicted significant damage and casualties on the ground, but, marred by poor intelligence and communication, they {{did not make a}} significant impression on Fighter Command's ability to defend British air space.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> {{preceded by}} a massive artillery bombardment {{that was meant to}} soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repulsed with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Underestimating the {{strength}} of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which at that time numbered about 11,000 personnel, Ichiki's unit conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek {{on the east side}} of the Lunga perimeter. Ichiki's <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> defeated with heavy losses for the Imperial attackers. The Marine units counterattacked Ichiki's surviving troops after daybreak, killing many more of them. All but 128 of the original 917 of the Ichiki Regiment's First Element were killed in the battle.|$|E
5|$|A second regimental-sized {{attack against}} 3 RAR at Balmoral was {{launched}} by the North Vietnamese at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion assault preceded by 60mm and 80mm mortar fire from the south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as the North Vietnamese sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms fire from their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles. The main assault began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined effect of this firepower stopping the North Vietnamese on the wire before they could penetrate the position. Although the <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships engaged the North Vietnamese, directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps to be withdrawn from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all the material needed for the <b>assault</b> <b>was</b> on hand, on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E
