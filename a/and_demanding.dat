40|$|PURPOSE: Patients' {{oral health}} needs are {{estimated}} through dialogue and professional assessment. The concepts of need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> {{are vital to}} studies of dental care and oral health. Need does not always lead to demand for treatment or to utilization, depending on the gatekeeping processes between need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization. <b>Demand</b> must be accepted {{with the understanding that}} there is no objective need <b>and</b> that <b>demand</b> depends on the patient's opinion. In accordance with this, the need for prosthodontic treatment is highly individual and is not automatically related to oral health status, making need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> difficult to measure in that respect. Therefore, sociodental factors should be included and evaluated in studies of need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> for utilization of prosthodontic care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This theoretical and analytic paper focuses on the gatekeeping processes between need <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization of prosthodontic care. RESULTS: The concept of gatekeeping refers to the social and psychologic processes that transform need into <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> into utilization. It implies that they are complex processes that can render great differences between <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> actual utilization. CONCLUSION: It is not possible to estimate a patient's needs for prosthodontic care, since there is no objective need. <b>Demand</b> <b>and</b> utilization are factors that {{play an important role in}} the gatekeeping process. These factors are dependent on the patient's opinion, which is influenced by numerous factors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonparametric model for estimating sharp bounds on the median of the disturbances in the simultaneous equations model and applies it to {{estimation of the}} supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> shift variables. A large literature has estimated shift variables in a supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> framework to analyze {{the causes of the}} fluctuations of the key economic variables. In the existing parametric approaches, the supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> shift variables are, however, unidentified either by using only observa-tions of the intersections of the S&D curves or without specifying the S&D functional forms and distributions for the disturbances. In contrast, the model in this paper requires only observations of the intersections of upward-sloping supply <b>and</b> downward-sloping <b>demand</b> curves. It is ap-plied to estimation of the bounds on macro supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> shocks since model specification issues have been serious area of conflict in study of the sources of business fluctuations, and estimation of the bounds on labor supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> shift variables since an existing research on the causes of wage changes could not identify supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> shifters due to the availability of data...|$|R

The costs of a mismatch between supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> are growing in many industries. Companies have tried various approaches, however these approaches, while useful, have failed to address a number of the drivers of supply-demand mismatch. The literature study starts with an overview of supply chain management. The study covers the various concepts of supply chain management, the importance of supply chain performance, the challenges of managing supply chains, demand management, supply management, as well as the relationship between supply <b>and</b> <b>demand.</b> The literature study continues to cover the various concepts related to the alignment of supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> within a supply chain. The study covers the effects of the misalignment between supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> within a supply chain, traditional approaches to align supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> the transformation to a more responsive organisation. The various approaches to decrease the supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> lead time gap are also discussed. The literature study concludes with an overview of the supply chain of Kraft Foods South Africa, as well as the global Kraft Foods organisation. The review covers the challenges, the sustainable growth plan, the organisational set-up, sources and product range, geographical layout, people, functions and technology involved in Kraft’s supply chain.

With this aim in mind, the authors discuss a model which explains the factors that can affect the production of healthcare, <b>demand</b> for healthcare, <b>and</b> finally, the inequalities between healthcare supply <b>and</b> <b>demand.</b> This analysis proves that, due to imbalances between supply <b>and</b> <b>demand,</b> there is an excess of demand that is equal to waiting lists.
