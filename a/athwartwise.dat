60|$|We {{walked to}} the {{farthest}} point of the island, and I {{have never seen a}} more dismal place than it was on this sunless and east-windy day, being the farthest point out into the melancholy sea, which was in no very agreeable mood, and roared sullenly against the wilderness of rocks. One mass of rock, more than twelve feet square, was thrown up out of the sea in a storm, not many years since, and now lies <b>athwartwise,</b> never to be moved unless another omnipotent wave shall give it another toss. On shore, such a rock would be a landmark for centuries. It is inconceivable how a sufficient mass of water could be brought to bear on this ponderous mass; but, not improbably, all the fragments piled upon one another round these islands have thus been flung to and fro at one time or another.|$|E
50|$|Crosstree- {{two short}} metal arms that are {{attached}} to a mast <b>athwartwise</b> about mid height. Mast side stays are tensioned by running through the outboard end of the arms, often forming a diamond shape. Similar to a spreader.|$|E
50|$|Early long boats {{used some}} form of {{steering}} oar but by the 10th century the side rudder (called a steerboard, the source for the etymology for the word starboard itself) was well established. It consisted of a length of timber about 2.4 m long. The upper section was rounded to a diameter of about 150 mm. The lower blade was about 1.8 x 0.4 m. The steerboard on the Gokstad ship in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway, is about 8 in wide, completely flat inboard and with about a 3 in maximum width {{at the center of}} the foil. The head of the rudder shaft had two square holes about 200 - 300 mm apart. When the rudder was in its normal position the tiller was inserted in the upper hole so that the tiller faced <b>athwartwise.</b> The shaft was attached to the gunwale by a U shaped joint. Near the stern, about halfway down the starboard topsides, was a rounded wooden block about 150 mm in diameter and 100 mm high, with a central hole for a rope. This corresponded to a hole in the midsection of the rudder blade. From the outside the rope ran through the blade, through the round block and topsides and was fastened inside the hull. The flexibility of the hemp rope allowed the blade to pivot. When beached or in shallow water the tiller was moved to the lower hole, the blade rope was slackened and the rudder head pulled up so the rudder could operate in shallow waters. Modern facsimiles are reported to steer quite well but require a very large amount of physical effort compared to the modern fore and aft tiller.|$|E
5000|$|The sail {{was held}} in place by the mast which was up to 16 m tall. Its base was about 250 x 180 mm. The mast was {{supported}} by a large wooden maststep called a kerling ("Old Woman" [...] in Old Norse) that was semicircular in shape. (Trent) The kerling was made of oak, and about 700 mm wide and up to 6 m long in the larger ships. It usually heavily tapered into a joint with the internal keelson, although keelsons were by no means universal. The kerling lay across two strong frames that ran width-wise above the keel in the centre of the boat. The kerling also had a companion: the [...] "mast fish," [...] a wooden timber above the kerling just below deck height that provided extra help in keeping the mast erect. It was a large wooden baulk of timber about 3 m long with a 1.4 m slot, facing aft to accommodate the mast as it was raised. This acted as a mechanism to catch and secure the mast before the stays were secured. It was an early form of mast partner but was aligned fore and aft. In later longships there is no mast fish-the mast partner is an <b>athwartwise</b> beam similar to more modern construction. Most masts were about half the length of the ship so that it did not project beyond the hull when unstepped. When lowered the mast foot was kept in the base of the mast step and the top of the mast secured in a natural wooden crook about 1.5 - 2.5 m high, on the port side, so that it did not interfere with steering on the starboard side.|$|E
