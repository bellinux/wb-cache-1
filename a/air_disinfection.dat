However, its exceptionally low toxicity, broad materials compatibility, and low odor combined with its antimicrobial properties indicates that it approaches the ideal for <b>air</b> <b>disinfection</b> purposes in occupied spaces. Much of the scientific work with triethylene glycol {{was done in the}} 1940s and 1950s, however that work has ably demonstrated the antimicrobial activity against airborne, solution suspension, and surface bound microbes. The ability of triethylene glycol to inactivate Streptococcus pneumoniae (original citation: pneumococcus Type I), Streptococcus pyogenes (original citation: Beta hemolytic streptococcus group A) and Influenza A virus in the air was first reported in 1943. Since the first report the following microorganisms {{have been reported in the}} literature to be inactivated in the air: Penicillium notatum spores, Chlamydophila psittaci (original citation: meningopneumonitis virus strain Cal 10 and psittacosis virus strain 6BC), Group C streptococcus, type 1 pneumococcus, Staphylococcus albus, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens Bizio (ATCC 274). Solutions of triethylene glycol are known to be antimicrobial toward suspensions of Penicillium notatum spores, Streptococcus pyogenes (original citation: Beta hemolytic streptococcus Group A [...] ), Streptococcus pneumoniae (original citation: pneumococcus Type I), Streptococcus viridans, and Mycobacterium bovis (original citation: tubercle bacilli Ravenel bovine-type). Further, the inactivation of H1N1 influenza A virus on surfaces has been demonstrated.

30|$|Titanium alloys, such as Ti 6 Al 4 V, {{are widely}} used in {{orthopedic}} and dental applications due to their low density, excellent mechanical and anti-corrosive properties and good biocompatibility [10]. One {{of the reasons for}} these beneficial properties is the thin passivation layer which spontaneously forms {{on the surface of the}} alloy, predominantly composed of amorphous or poorly recrystallized titanium dioxide (TiO 2) [11, 12]. The inert TiO 2 layer minimizes ion release from the implant to the surrounding tissues and hence inflammatory reactions in the body [13]. In addition, a singular property of TiO 2 is its semiconductor character, with a band gap of approximately 3.2  eV, which means that the oxide can be excited under illumination with wavelengths within the ultraviolet (UV) spectra. It has been widely reported that illumination of TiO 2 with UV light produces hydrophilization of its surface [14, 15], and is able to induce photocatalytic surface reactions under excitation. TiO 2 photocatalysis acquires strong oxidizing power and can decompose various microorganisms and organic compounds by generating active oxygen species [16, 17]. For this reason, industrial applications of anti-bacterial TiO 2 -coated surfaces can be found in different areas such as water <b>disinfection,</b> <b>air</b> purification or food surface preparation [17 – 21].|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE : Transmission {{is driving}} the global {{tuberculosis}} epidemic, especially in congregate settings. Worldwide, natural ventilation {{is the most common}} means of <b>air</b> <b>disinfection,</b> but it is inherently unreliable and of limited use in cold climates. Upper room germicidal ultraviolet (UV) <b>air</b> <b>disinfection</b> with air mixing {{has been shown to be}} highly effective, but improved evidence-based dosing guidelines are needed. OBJECTIVES : To test the efficacy of upper room germicidal <b>air</b> <b>disinfection</b> with air mixing to reduce tuberculosis transmission under real hospital conditions, and to define the application parameters responsible as a basis for proposed new dosing guidelines. METHODS : Over an exposure period of 7 months, 90 guinea pigs breathed only untreated exhaust ward air, and another 90 guinea pigs breathed only air from the same six-bed tuberculosis ward on alternate days when upper room germicidal <b>air</b> <b>disinfection</b> was turned on throughout the ward. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The tuberculin skin test conversion rates (. 6 mm) of the two chambers were compared.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that many pathogenic microorganisms can reside in water. Similarly, many microbial pathogens can be suspended in <b>air.</b> However, <b>disinfection</b> processes for <b>air</b> are generally not as well developed as those for water. In situations involving groups of people in confined space, such as class rooms, surgery rooms, and airplane cabins, a shared air space provides opportunities for disease transmission. To reduce the danger of infections transmitted {{from one person to}} another, the addition of UV treatment in an air recirculation system may be employed. With this in mind, the primary goal of this research was to evaluate and develop an effective UV disinfection system for a recirculating air system. The specific focus will be an aircraft cabin air; however, it is expected that the principles that govern the design of this system will extend to other applications. This objective was met by first developing biodosimetry for evaluating reactor efficiency. A second step {{in the process of developing}} this system was to examine various reactor/systems by numerical modeling. ^ Laboratory experiments involved measurements of UV dose-response behavior for several airborne microorganisms. These experiments involved a range of non-pathogenic microorganisms as surrogates for airborne microbial pathogens; Bacillus subtilis spores and coliphage MS 2. These microorganisms were grown in pure cultures, and were selected to mimic the range of characteristics that represent airborne pathogens in confined space. UV dose-response behavior of these microorganisms was measured as a function of relative humidity. ^ Various reactor geometries were evaluated by a process of numerical prototyping, which involved the combined application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and radiation intensity (I) field models. The effects of UV-based treatment on microbial air quality were also examined mathematically. The objective of this modeling effort was to develop a reactor system that satisfies the constraints imposed by an aircraft cabin environment. ^ The feasible reactor system for aircraft cabin recirculation system was designed in this effort, based on the power and space requirements needed to deliver germicidal UV doses that are likely to be effective for control of airborne pathogenic microorganisms.

Under steady state conditions the effective air changes per hour associated with upper-room UVC ranged from 18 to 1000. The surprisingly high end of the observed range resulted from the extreme susceptibility of vaccinia virus to UVC at low relative humidity and use of 4 UVC fixtures in a small room with efficient air mixing. Increasing the number of UVC fixtures or mechanical ventilation rates resulted in greater fractional reduction in virus aerosol and UVC effectiveness was higher in winter compared to summer for each scenario tested.

However, the classical germination technology, which includes 2 - 3 days of soaking and 5 - 8 days of germination due to the considerable duration and laboriousness of the process, does not meet the requirements of modern technology and the constantly growing rates of industrial production, so this problem requires finding new and improving existing scientific and technical solutions.

The effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection protocols was measured in six broiler houses on two farms through visual inspection, adenosine triphosphate hygiene monitoring and microbiological analyses.

40|$|The use of {{heterogeneous}} photocatalysts for the abatement {{of environmental}} problems has received increased attention {{during the last three}} decades. The photocatalyst used in most of these studies was titanium dioxide. This fact relates to the unique physical and chemical properties of titanium dioxide and similar semiconductor materials, such as ZnO, MgO,WO 3, Fe 2 Oa, CdS, etc. that may be utilized {{for a wide range of}} potential applications. Specifically, upon ultraviolet irradiation these materials exhibit photocatalytic activity that enables the oxidative destruction of a wide range of organic compounds and biological species on their surface. In addition, these materials may also exhibit photocatalytically induced superhydrophilicity that converts the hydrophobic character of the surface to hydrophilic when exposed to UV light. This causes the formation of uniform water films on the surface of these materials, which prevents the adhesion of inorganic or organic components and thus retains a clean surface on the photocatalyst. Photocatalytic materials may be deployed on surfaces of various substrates, such as glass, ceramics or metals to provide layers that exhibit photocatalytic activity when they are exposed to light. Excitation of a photocatalyst leads to the creation of electrons and holes in the semiconductor material. Furthermore, these electrons and holes interact with molecules adsorbed on the semiconductor and can induce charge transfer process that results in the degradation of the adsorbate. The commercial potentials of heterogeneous photocatalysis are huge, including medical applications, application in the field of architecture (particularly for the cultural heritage purposes, facade paints, etc.), automotive and food industries (cleaner technologies, non-fogging glass and mirrors, product safety), textile and glass industry, as well as in environmental protection (water and <b>air</b> purification and <b>disinfection).</b> After the discovery that the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds is generally more efficient in the gas phase than in the liquid phase, and the fact that the treatment cost may be significantly lower than that of the water phase photocatalytic treatment, the scientific interest has shifted towards the application of photocatalysis for air treatment.

The present study is concerned with the application of pulsed UV-rich light as an effective means of <b>air</b> <b>disinfection.</b> For this, a system was developed which involved the passing of volumes of air through a path of pulsed UV-rich light.

Also, in an attempt to establish the extent of airborne bacterial contamination which can occur in specific situations, the microbiological air quality of university lecture theatres was monitored. The results obtained demonstrate a significant increase in airborne bacterial populations due to the presence of large student congregations. In addition, the application of UV-rich pulsed light was shown to be effective in reducing the levels of airborne bacteria within samples of air taken from the lecture theatres.

40|$|Photocatalytic {{purification}} {{of organic}} pollutants, contaminants and hazardous microorganisms {{is an interesting}} approach toward pollution control. Using photosensitive catalysts, undesirable organic compounds can be completely mineralised. Among photosensitive catalysts, nanostructured anatase titanium dioxide has long been regarded as excellent catalyst scientifically and commercially {{for a wide range}} of applications, especially in sterilisation, <b>disinfection,</b> <b>air</b> purification, water treatment, and deodorisation. Although research work on anatase photocatalyst has been intensively pursued, the development of photocatalytic self-cleaning treatment for fibrous materials with low thermal and chemical resistance, particularly in keratinous fibres, is still at infantile stage. The core motivation for conducting this present study is to investigate and modify the photocatalytic property and compatibility of anatase titanium dioxide on naturally-occurring keratinous fibres. Attempts were successful to produce an innovative photocatalytic self-cleaning keratinous fibrous material, in which environmental-friendly photocatalytic self-cleaning property was conferred on keratin fibers by coating low temperature-synthesised colloid of anatase nanocrystals using the conventional dip-pad-cure surface coating treatment. The synthesis parameters of the photocatalytic self-cleaning colloid formulation in terms of chemicals used, synthesis preparation time, and formulation concentration were studied to advance the photocatalytic efficiency. The anatase adhesion to the surface of keratinous fibers was also improved so as to enhance the photoactivity and its sustainability using surface activation techniques such as wettability pre-treatment, silicone surface modification, and microwave-generated plasma afterglow treatment. On the other hand, the photocatalytic activity of anatase has been limited by its specific excitation source to ultraviolet light. To date, current debate centeres on the limited use of solar energy in triggering advanced oxidation process due to the large photonic band gap (3. 2 eV) of anatase. In order to take full advantage of the photoreaction, the synergistic effects of chemical doping on the visible-light photocatalysis of anatase were also studied in this investigation. The properties of anatase nanocrystals were modified by doping with metals and non-metal in order to tune the oxidising power of anatase to the visible light region. The spectroscopic and physicochemical characteristics of the modified-anatase have been determined. The findings revealed that the modified-anatase spectral response was extended to the visible light region and concurrently the electron-hole recombination was retarded, resulting in accelerating the visible-light photoactivity. This research provides insights on the structure-property-use relationship of anatase titanium dioxide in biomaterial applications under ultraviolet and visible light conditions. In addition, development of keratin fibers with self-cleaning function helps in preserving our limited natural resources such as water, energy, and petrochemical detergents for a more sustainable environment by reduction of the laundering cycles through exploiting new possibilities of self-cleaning materials in the society...|$|R

Opisane su osnovne zakonitosti heterogene fotokatalize, uglavnom na fotokatalizatoru TiO 2, i dane su definicije temeljnih pojmova. Detaljno je razmatran utjecaj različitih procesnih varijabli i parametara na ukupnu brzinu fotokatalitičkog procesa. Istaknut je problem deaktivacije najčešće proučavanog fotokatalizatora, TiO 2, te su opisani uzroci i mehanizmi deaktivacije na odabranim primjerima. Cilj rada bio je pregled tehničkih aspekata vezanih uz primjene heterogene katalize u zaštiti zraka, a pritom je velika pozornost posvećena različitim izvedbama fotoreaktora. The use of heterogeneous photocatalysts for the abatement {{of environmental}} problems has received increased attention {{during the last three}} decades. The photocatalyst used in most of these studies was titanium dioxide. This fact relates to the unique physical and chemical properties of titanium dioxide and similar semiconductor materials, such as ZnO, MgO,WO 3, Fe 2 Oa, CdS, etc. that may be utilized {{for a wide range of}} potential applications. Specifically, upon ultraviolet irradiation these materials exhibit photocatalytic activity that enables the oxidative destruction of a wide range of organic compounds and biological species on their surface. In addition, these materials may also exhibit photocatalytically induced superhydrophilicity that converts the hydrophobic character of the surface to hydrophilic when exposed to UV light. This causes the formation of uniform water films on the surface of these materials, which prevents the adhesion of inorganic or organic components and thus retains a clean surface on the photocatalyst. Photocatalytic materials may be deployed on surfaces of various substrates, such as glass, ceramics or metals to provide layers that exhibit photocatalytic activity when they are exposed to light. Excitation of a photocatalyst leads to the creation of electrons and holes in the semiconductor material. Furthermore, these electrons and holes interact with molecules adsorbed on the semiconductor and can induce charge transfer process that results in the degradation of the adsorbate. The commercial potentials of heterogeneous photocatalysis are huge, including medical applications, application in the field of architecture (particularly for the cultural heritage purposes, facade paints, etc.), automotive and food industries (cleaner technologies, non-fogging glass and mirrors, product safety), textile and glass industry, as well as in environmental protection (water and <b>air</b> purification and <b>disinfection).</b> After the discovery that the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds is generally more efficient in the gas phase than in the liquid phase, and the fact that the treatment cost may be significantly lower than that of the water phase photocatalytic treatment, the scientific interest has shifted towards the application of photocatalysis for air treatment. This paper describes the basics of heterogeneous photocatalysis, mainly on TiO 2 and the application of photocatalytic processes for air treatment purposes. Review of more interesting practical application of heterogeneous photocatalysis for the treatment of polluted air is presented. Special efforts are made to describe the technical aspects of the photocatalytic processes and to characterize different photocatalytic reactors in use for air treatment...|$|R
40|$|Public health {{concerns}} such as multi- and extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis, bioterrorism, pandemic influenza, and {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} have intensified {{efforts to prevent}} transmission of infections that are completely or partially airborne using environmental controls. One such control, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), has received renewed interest after decades of underutilization and neglect. With renewed interest, however, come renewed questions, especially regarding efficacy and safety. There is a long history of investigations concluding that, if used properly, UVGI can be safe and highly effective in disinfecting the air, thereby preventing transmission of a variety of airborne infections. Despite this long history, many infection control professionals are not familiar with the history of UVGI and how it has, and has not, been used safely and effectively. This article reviews that history of UVGI for <b>air</b> <b>disinfection,</b> starting with its biological basis, moving to its application in the real world, and ending with its current status...|$|E

The intent {{of this article is to}} review the air cleansing technologies available to protect building occupants from the intentional release of bioterror agents into congregate spaces (such as offices, schools, auditoriums, and transportation centers), as well as through outside air intakes and by way of recirculation air ducts. Current available technologies include increased ventilation, filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) UVGI is a common tool in laboratories and health care facilities, but is not familiar to the public, or to some heating, ventilation, and air conditioning engineers. Interest in UVGI is increasing as concern about a possible malicious release of bioterror agents mounts. Recent applications of UVGI have focused on control of tuberculosis transmission, but a wide range of airborne respiratory pathogens are susceptible to deactivation by UVGI. In this article, the authors provide an overview of <b>air</b> <b>disinfection</b> technologies, and an in-depth analysis of UVGI-its history, applications, and effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} a review on methods and {{technologies}} for air cleaning from micro organisms and viruses, which are applicable {{with the present}} HVAC practices. The advantages and the drawbacks of air dilution, filtration (HEPA, ULPA), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), plasmacluster ions and other technologies for <b>air</b> <b>disinfection</b> and purification is critically analyzed {{with respect to the}} used today air distribution principles. The importance of indoor air characteristics, such as temperature, relative humidity and velocity on the efficiency of the methods is analyzed with consideration of nature of the pathogens themselves. Recent encouraging studies show the benefit of using essential oils as antimicrobial and anti-fungal agents (thyme, bay, cinnamon, clove, etc.). Though their application is confined to the food industry and pharmaceutics, some promising results show possible applicability in the field of ventilation and air conditioning to deactivate the airborne micro-organisms. The applicability of the methods with different types of ventilation used at present indoors, i. e. total volume ventilation (mixing and displacement), as well as advanced air distribution techniques (such as personalized ventilation) is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Airborne {{transmission}} of microorganisms is recognised {{as being a}} significant source of infection, with potentially fatal illnesses such as tuberculosis and meningitis spread via this route. Consequently, more research is required in this area to both establish the physical mechanisms of airborne transmission in specific environments and develop effective means of achieving <b>air</b> <b>disinfection.</b> The present study is concerned with an investigation of air quality in university lecture theatres. Due to high student numbers and absence of air quality control within lecture rooms, there is potential for the build-up of airborne contamination and therefore cross-infection. In this study a SAS-Super 180 sampler was used to take microbial and fungal counts before, during and after a 1 hour lecture in order to identify the variation in airborne contamination levels that occur, with results demonstrating a significant increase in airborne populations due to the presence of large congregations. Various environmental parameters were also monitored to examine their effect on the microbial air load. Also, a pulsed UVlight system developed by the EPAST group (which has had success in surface and liquid applications) was used to disinfect the air, and results highlight the effectiveness of the PUV system for the inactivation of airborne microorganism...|$|E

40|$|In upper-room {{ultraviolet}} germicidal irradiance (UVGI) design, irradiance is {{an important}} characteristic, with two opposing dominant dynamics: high-level irradiation on the microorganism and minimum levels of irradiance on human skin and eyes. The use of high-level ray-tracing procedures is followed in establishing radiance and irradiance levels. The main constants in a room influencing these calculations are the spectral and spatial characteristics of the radiation sources in the inter-reflecting surfaces inside the luminaire, {{as well as the}} surfaces in the room. The most important characteristic to be determined for the radiation source prior to calculations is its spatial radiant intensity distribution. This characterization is performed using a gonioradiometer. The complexity of the physical construction of the luminaire will {{determine the extent to which}} measurements have to be taken. Accurate gonioradiometer readings provide the required radiant intensities in all directions for computer-aided design (CAD), and can also be used to determine the total radiant flux leaving the luminaire, as well as calculating isoirradiance surfaces around the UVGI luminaire. This study will present a laboratory experimental approach to deriving the radiant intensity distribution of a UVGI luminaire. The UVGI luminaire is then characterized in situ, and compared with the gonioradiometric output.

40|$|Abstract: The {{assessment}} of {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) risks to building occupants has become a complex and challenging issue for building owners and facility managers. Recent research has defined causal links between construction practices and infection rates in health care building and renovation projects. Attention to IAQ management during building construction is being elevated because of its potential role in fungal, mold, related problems in buildings. Advanced environmental control techniques and are now being developed to better manage IAQ in health care facilities, including improved particulate control, <b>air</b> <b>disinfection</b> systems, moisture control, and pressurization strategies. Each of these creates additional sequencing and process requirements during construction with related implications for construction cost and schedules. As a result, {{the role of the}} contractor in managing and implementing indoor air quality in health care construction and renovation is becoming increasingly complex. This paper presents an analysis the relationships emerging between IAQ technologies and construction practices, with an emphasis on heath care facility construction. A case study of IAQ management during construction is presented to illustrate the lack of current formal processes, and the implications of state-of-the art infection control strategies on construction projects. Recommendations are made for improved assessment, control, and monitoring of moisture in buildings during construction {{as an example of how}} to improve current practice. Future directions for research in this critical area of the construction industry are also provided...|$|E
