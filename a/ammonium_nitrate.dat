5|$|The Haber-Bosch {{method for}} synthesizing <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> {{represented}} {{a major breakthrough}} and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints. It was first patented by German chemist Fritz Haber. In 1910 Carl Bosch, while working for German chemical company BASF, successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents. In the years after World War II, the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, {{in sync with the}} increasing world population.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E

Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E

The federal government claimed the incident was an attempt to steal his police car. On October 2, 1978, the EPB and Volunteers infiltrated an armory and took 500 pounds of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> dynamite cartridges, 988 blasting caps and 17,500 feet of primacord. In September 1979, the EPB revealed that it was working in conjunction with the Volunteers, FARP and FALN.|$|E
5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E
40|$|Uptake of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrate</b> by {{the roots}} of spruce trees at a N-limited control site and a site {{subjected}} to ammonium sulphate fertilisation with 150 kg N ha(- 1) in one dose were determined shortly after and two years subsequent to the treatment. The changes in the rates of nitrogen uptake by the roots were compared with changes in microbial nitrogen conversion that are connected with the production of N 2 O in, and the emission of these atmospheric trace gases from soils by nitrification and denitrification. Uptake of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrate</b> by {{the roots of}} the N-limited trees were low and initially were strongly enhanced by fertiliser application. This increase was mainly due to an increase in <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrate</b> available to the roots in. the soil-water. Two years subsequent to the fertiliser application, <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrate</b> contents of the soil-water were still enhanced compared to the untreated control site, but uptake of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrate</b> by the spruce roots was completely shut down. At the N-limited control site competition between root uptake of inorganic N and its microbial conversion was largely in favour of root uptake by the spruce trees. The rates of nitrification and denitrification of inorganic N were minute under these conditions and appreciable N 2 O emission was not observed. Application of ammonium sulphate transiently enhanced both root uptake and microbial N conversion, and was connected with increased emission of N 2 O. In the long term, ammonium sulphate application completely inhibited <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrate</b> uptake by the trees, irrespective of enhanced concentrations of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrate</b> in the soil-water. As a consequence, considerable amounts of inorganic N were still available for microbial conversion 2 years after fertiliser application. At this time nitrification rates were still high at the fertilised site, but the nitrate produced was not further converted by denitrification. It is assumed that nitrate produced by nitrification is subjected to microbial immobilisation. Under these conditions N 2 O emission from the control site and the fertilised site were low and did not differ significantly...|$|R

5|$|Office {{space was}} {{initially}} {{found in the}} Monsanto offices at 1515 Nicholas Rd, which became known as Unit I. Unit II was the Monsanto Rocket Propellant works off Betty Lane near Ohio State Route 741. While it was administered by Monsanto, it was not used by the Dayton Project. The site handled explosives including <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and ammonium picrate, but no radioactive materials were handled there. Work at Unit II ceased {{in the fall of}} 1945. Consideration was given to using it in December 1946, but this proposal was rejected in favor of erecting a Quonset hut at Unit III.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E
5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E

5|$|Norsk Hydro {{announced}} in 1963 a savings plan for its four plants in Norway; Chief Executive Officer Rolf Østbye {{made it clear}} that new technology in the production of ammonia would force the closure of the plant at Rjukan, {{and replace it with a}} petroleum-based process at Herøya. The Rjukan situation, as it was named in the press, became a source of conflict between the local community and Norsk Hydro; initially 250 jobs were to be moved to Herøya, but in 1964 Norsk Hydro applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Herøya—what would become the death sentence for the Rjukan Line. Permission for the construction of the power line was granted in 1968. Production of fertilizer was moved to Herøya and Glomfjord, and Rjukan transferred to production of kalkammonsalpeter in 1963 and <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan had}} been {{producing}} a deficit since 1982.

In 1988 Norsk Hydro terminated the ammonia production, and in 1991 they also closed down the production <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and potassium nitrate, along with the Rjukan Line. Within a few years the number of Norsk Hydro employees in Rjukan had been reduced from 1,760 to 530 people; 24 of these were employed by Norsk Transport operating the railway and railway ferries. All the employees were either retired or moved to other areas of Norsk Hydro's enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E

5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Federal agents {{obtained}} a warrant {{to search the}} house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned {{that he was being}} hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} excess {{nutrients}} from water ecosystems requires oxidation of toxic ammonium by {{two types of}} bacteria; one oxidizes ammonium to nitrite and the other oxidizes nitrite to nitrate. The oxidation of ammonium is often incomplete and nitrite accumulates. Nitrite is also toxic, and is converted by the ammoniumoxidizing bacteria to nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas. Here we use mathematical modeling to analyze a potential solution to the problems related to incomplete oxidation of ammonium. We propose that a single engineered nitrifying bacterium should be capable of complete oxidation of high concentrations of <b>ammonium</b> to <b>nitrate.</b> Our model is based on available data on ammonium- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. The model predicts that insertion of highly expressed genes of a nitrite oxidation system into the genome of an ammonia-oxidation bacterium should result in complete oxidation of <b>ammonium</b> to <b>nitrate</b> in nutrient-overloaded conditions. Due to its increased capacity to fully oxidize <b>ammonium</b> to <b>nitrate,</b> the proposed bacterium would display dramatically reduced production of nitrous oxide, and therefore might have great potential to reduce the greenhouse effect of nutrient-overloaded water system...|$|R

5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, which usually contains all the rare earths {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter. Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of fractional crystallization of La(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, or by ion-exchange techniques when higher purity is desired.|$|E
25|$|The main nitrogen-based {{straight}} fertilizer is ammonia or its solutions. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (NH4NO3) is also widely used. Urea {{is another}} popular source of nitrogen, having the advantage {{that it is}} solid and non-explosive, unlike ammonia and <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> respectively. A few percent of the nitrogen fertilizer market (4% in 2007) has been met by calcium <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (Ca(NO3)2•NH4NO3•10H2O).|$|E
25|$|In admixture, the {{combined}} solubility of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and urea {{is so much}} {{higher than that of}} either component alone {{that it is possible to}} obtain a stable solution (known as UAN) with a total nitrogen content (32%) approaching that of solid <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (33.5%), though not, of course, that of urea itself (46%). Given the ongoing safety and security concerns surrounding fertilizer-grade solid <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> UAN provides a considerably safer alternative without entirely sacrificing the agronomic properties that make <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> more attractive than urea as a fertilizer in areas with short growing seasons. It is also more convenient to store and handle than a solid product and easier to apply accurately to the land by mechanical means.|$|E
