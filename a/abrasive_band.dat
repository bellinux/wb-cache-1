5000|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} 82, {{indicating}} [...] "universal acclaim" [...] based on 33 critics. [...] Praising Honeys for its [...] "roomier, more open sound" [...] that gives [...] "the album more of a snarling quality than its more guttural predecessor," [...] Gregory Heaney wrote for Allmusic that [...] "Honeys is punk rock for everyone who's had to dedicate less time to their ideals and more time toward paying the cable bill and buying diapers". Describing the album as the band's best to date, Ian Cohen wrote for Pitchfork that [...] "Pissed Jeans allow themselves enough versatility to keep Honeys intense and interesting throughout, fashioning a loser's history of alt.rock that honors {{some of the most}} <b>abrasive</b> <b>bands</b> to get a deal post-Nevermind. [...] Noting how Honeys further refined Pissed Jeans' sound, PopMatters' Matthew Fiander lauded the album as [...] "scathing and brilliant".|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{the mini}} album {{was due to}} be titled Gala, after Salvador Dalís wife, Gala Dalí, but Scar was {{ultimately}} chosen as the title [...] "because it juxtaposed the image of Lush and highlighted the <b>band's</b> <b>abrasive</b> side", according to Anderson.|$|R
50|$|Pink is {{the tenth}} album by Japanese {{experimental}} music band Boris. It was originally released in 2005 through Diwphalanx Records in Japan and subsequently reissued in 2006 by American label Southern Lord Records. The album received favorable reviews, particularly for incorporating more melody into the <b>band's</b> <b>abrasive</b> sound.|$|R
50|$|Enemymine was a Washington-state-based indie {{rock band}} {{known for their}} very loud and <b>abrasive</b> music. The <b>band</b> {{consisted}} of three members; two bass guitarists and a drummer. Mike Kunka of godheadSilo played bass and provided vocals on all songs, while Zak Sally from Low also played bass and Danny Sasaki played drums. Ryan Baldoz also played bass. Enemymine has played shows with Jucifer, Melvins, Mindless Self Indulgence, Burning Brides, the Rapture, Melt Banana, among others.|$|R
40|$|In {{article is}} {{executed}} analysis to {{efficiency of the}} functioning the cleansing equipment for different type vegetable cheese: potatoes, carrot, pommel and the other type potatoes. He is indicative of that {{that much of the}} cleansing equipment uses as worker organ abrasive put, which improvement is one of the directions of increasing to his efficiency and improvements of his field-performance data. Classical model of the motion club is considered In process of the analysis in camera of the cleansing machine. For optimization of the process peelings is installed path of the motion and is calculated corner of the flight club with cone-shaped chalice. When shaping the models is considered apart taken tuber of the potatoes. Expecting his uniform sphere and without regard influence upon it other club, have defined the path of his motion on cone-shaped chalice and corner, under which tuber flies to wall. The Corner of the slopping cone chalices 30 degrees took to horizon. Integrating equation on time, got the equation of the energy balance, from which possible select required for peelings time. The Further analysis conducted the methods of the numerical experiment in system Mathcad. Got in this experiment results allow to optimize the drawing a fixing <b>abrasive</b> <b>bands,</b> taking into consideration designed methods of the shaping for such object, as worker organs cleansing machines, technology of the intermittent fixing covering. The Following stage of modeling expected consideration of the process peelings for collection cleaned club, on which expected the separate cleaned objects (for instance, potato tubers) springy element, changing their (in flat production) hard disk united between itself springy spring. Consideration this elaborated models have allowed to install the frequencies of the free fluctuations of this system and, accordingly, moments of the osculation worker organ that in significant measure defines the topology of the abrasive covering...|$|R
500|$|A highly {{divisive}} record, Agharta further challenged Davis' jazz {{audience and}} was widely panned by contemporary critics; reviewers found the music discordant, and complained of Cosey's loud guitar sounds and Davis' sparse trumpet playing. It was reevaluated positively in subsequent years, while {{a generation of}} younger musicians {{was influenced by the}} <b>band's</b> <b>abrasive</b> music and cathartic playing, particularly Cosey's effects-laden free improvisations. Agharta became viewed as an important jazz-rock record, a dramatically dynamic group performance, and the culmination of Davis' [...] spanning the late 1960s and mid-1970s.|$|R
2500|$|Hovercraft was an {{instrumental}} experimental rock group that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1993. It was co-founded by its core duo of guitarist/samplist/tape looper Ryan Shinn, and bassist Beth Liebling. Liebling and Shinn {{would use the}} pseudonyms [...] "Sadie 7" [...] and [...] "Campbell 2000", respectively, throughout {{the duration of the}} band's history. Hovercraft has been cited {{as one of the most}} <b>abrasive,</b> non-commercial sounding <b>bands</b> ever to receive major-label distribution for its albums. Though somewhat overlooked and sometimes heavily criticized because of the band's early association with a platinum-selling rock star, the group was largely well respected and well received by critics and developed a cult following.|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of sintered corundum abrasives {{used in both}} bonded and in the embankment of abrasive tools currently poses substantialproblems for their choice of technology to specific tasks. Therefore performed a comparative study of ownership structures and capacitiesof elected representatives machnining sintered corundum abrasives of different generations, and this is normal sintered alumina,submicrocrystalline alumina sintered and nanocrystalline alumina sintered. Were studied some properties {{of a set of}} abrasive particles,physicochemical properties and structural and mechanical and technological properties. The studies used the method of microscopicmeasurement to determine the shape of abrasive particles, the pycnometer to determine the density of abrasive, a spectrometer todetermine the chemical composition of the magnetic analyzer for determining the magnetic fraction, scanning electron microscope toanalysis of abrasive grains and a special position to designate the machining capacity abrasive grains. The results showed a significantincrease in machining capacity sintered corundum abrasives with increasing degree of fragmentation of the crystallites sintered corundum <b>abrasives</b> and distinctive <b>bands</b> in the emerging microchip. The originality of the development provides a comparative summary ofproperties of sintered corundum abrasives of different generations and functions obtained by the author making the change in value indexof machininhcapacity grit from cutting speeds for different generations of sintered corundum...|$|R
