5|$|A {{reorganisation}} of Australian cricket {{took place}} {{in the wake of the}} tour. The first national body to control the game, the Australasian Cricket Council (ACC), was formed to co-ordinate the Australian Test team. Previously, private entrepreneurs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> themselves organised international cricket. Lord Sheffield donated money to the ACC, which was used to purchase a trophy for the champion domestic team. Trott appeared in Victoria's inaugural Sheffield Shield match, against New South Wales in December 1892. He scored 63 and 70 not out in a winning effort. The ACC appointed Trott as one of the six players to select the touring team for England.|$|E
50|$|Theoretically, because <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is {{cancelling}} out two {{numbers on the}} list for every win and adding only one number for every loss, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> needs to have his proposition come at least 33.34% to eventually complete the list. For example, if the list starts with seven numbers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> wins five times and loses three (62.5% winning percentage) the list is completed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> wins <b>the</b> desired amount, if the list starts with seven numbers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> wins 43,600 times and loses 87,193 times (33.34% winning percentage) <b>the</b> list completes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> wins.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Player</b> tells Guildenstern {{that all}} paths end in death. Guildenstern snaps <b>and</b> draws <b>the</b> <b>Player's</b> dagger from his belt, {{shouting}} at {{him that his}} portrayals of death do not {{do justice to the}} real thing. He stabs <b>the</b> <b>Player</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Player</b> appears to die. Guildenstern fully believes he has killed <b>the</b> <b>Player.</b> Seconds later, <b>the</b> Tragedians begin to clap <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Player</b> stands up <b>and</b> brushes himself off, revealing the knife to be a theatrical one with a retractable blade. The Tragedians then act out the deaths from the final scene of Hamlet.|$|R
5|$|After he {{declined}} offers {{to pursue a}} professional playing career, Ward coached the game for 22years. Most of that time was spent as an assistant coach, and he served in that capacity at Maryland from 1952 to 1957, Oklahoma from 1957 to 1958, Iowa State from 1958 to 1965, and Army in 1966. At the United States Military Academy, Ward enjoyed the strictly regimented environment, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> appreciated his aggressiveness.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Ross {{came from}} Maryland after winning three ACC titles over four years. Ross' first season at Tech {{experienced}} a severe talent vacuum after Curry's departure, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> Ross inherited resisted the changes he demanded. The team only won two games, and Ross contemplated ending his coaching career after a humbling loss to Wake Forest in 1987. Ross decided {{to remain at}} Tech and continued to rebuild Tech's program. The turning point came in 1989 with the recruitment of Shawn Jones and several other key freshman. After two seasons and only five total wins, Jones helped the Jackets rebound {{at the end of}} the 1989 season.|$|E
5|$|Burke stated on March 27 that {{he would}} almost {{certainly}} enter the draft if Michigan won the national title. On April 9 before boarding the airplane to return from the NCAA Final Four, head coach Beilein met with Burke, Hardaway, Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek {{the advice of the}} NBA advisory committee. The draft board had until April 15 to develop each individual report <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> have until April 28 to enter the draft. On April 13, reports surfaced that Burke would announce {{that he would}} enter the NBA draft at a press conference the following day. On April 14, he entered the 2013 NBA draft.|$|E

5|$|By convention, {{the game}} pieces {{are divided into}} white and black sets, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> are {{referred}} to as White and Black respectively. Each player begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color, which consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.|$|E
5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
5|$|During the war it {{had become}} clear that private {{patronage}} {{was no longer a}} practical means of sustaining Britain's musical life; a state body, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – the forerunner of the Arts Council – was established, and given a modest budget for public subsidy. The council made it a condition of sponsoring the LSO that the profit-sharing principle should be abandoned <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> made salaried employees. This renunciation of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by the players, and the offered subsidy was declined.|$|E

5|$|Gotcha is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari and released in October 1973. It {{was the fourth}} game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move through a maze, which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if they do, a point is scored, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> reset positions. The game emits an electronic beeping sound, which increases in pace as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time.|$|E
5|$|However, {{before the}} start of the 1947–48 NBL season, Maurice White, the {{president}} of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team, pulled the team out of the league. White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> of White's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} owners, led by {{commissioner}} David Stern, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> led by director Billy Hunter and president Derek Fisher {{of the labor}} union National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), began in early 2011 and continued through November. The main issues dividing both sides were the division of revenue {{and the structure of}} the salary cap and luxury tax. Owners proposed to reduce the players' share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard salary cap and a harsher luxury tax, hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players wanted to keep the current soft salary cap structure intact.|$|E

50|$|Other {{games that}} use poker hand rankings may {{likewise}} {{be referred to}} as poker. Video poker is a single-player video game that functions much like a slot machine; most video poker machines play draw poker, where <b>the</b> <b>player</b> bets, a hand is dealt, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can discard <b>and</b> replace cards. Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after <b>the</b> draw <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> initial bet.|$|R

Darkness {{has started to}} consume the plane, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> must discover that the Helvault, a magical prison, has been holding the archangel Avacyn as well as demons. Thalia, a cathar of the Church of Avacyn, broke open the Helvault and released Avacyn {{as well as all}} of the demons. In the Return to Ravnica block, players were encouraged to affiliate themselves with a guild and take control of the city of Ravnica by completing the maze discovered by Niv - Mizzet.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Alvarez (2009) nearly went {{unsigned}} as {{he faced}} a contentious {{process in which}} Alvarez and the Pirates reached an initial deal after the signing deadline (with permission from MLB); his agent Scott Boras <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Players</b> Association filed a grievance challenging this post-deadline deal, and ultimately the Pirates renegotiated a deal with him in September that year. The Pirates have had seven compensatory picks overall since the first draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 2006. The season was {{characterized}} by inconsistent play, criticism of the coaching {{by the media and}} players, and Manning's struggles. They won five straight following a 1–2 start, giving them a two-game lead in the NFC East, but they lost six of their last seven games, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> publicly clashed with Coughlin. One of the team's worst losses was a 24–21 defeat to Tennessee, in which the team surrendered a 21-point 4th-quarter lead. Following a season-ending win at Washington, the Giants made the playoffs as a wild card in spite of their record, but were defeated 23–20 by Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|The founders' {{ambition}} was {{to build}} an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. After the outbreak of war the orchestra's private backers withdrew <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative. In the post-war years the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals; the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic, founded respectively in 1946 and 1947, achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older orchestras, including the LPO.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} heavy rain in Liverpool {{in the week}} before the first leg. Nevertheless, Austrian referee Erich Linemayr decided that the first leg on 9 May would still go ahead.

The referee took the decision to abandon the game after 27 minutes with the match to be played the next day.|$|E
5|$|As a captain, Gilligan was well-liked by {{players and}} commentators, {{although}} many {{did not believe}} he was an effective tactician. Nevertheless, under his leadership, Sussex became an attractive, competitive team. He encouraged the search for young talent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> consequently discovered became {{the backbone of the}} club into the 1930s. As a fielder, he inspired his teams to become good fielding sides. In addition, as MCC captain of a team which toured India in 1926–27, he encouraged Indians {{to take responsibility for their}} own cricket board instead of allowing white Englishmen to run Indian cricket, and lobbied the MCC to bestow Test match status on the Indian team. As MCC president, he played a part in the D'Oliveira affair in 1968. He died in 1976, aged 81.|$|E
