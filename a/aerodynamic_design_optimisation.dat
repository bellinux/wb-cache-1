40|$|AbstractEngineering design {{problems}} always require {{enormous amount}} of real-time experiments and computational simulations {{in order to assess}} and ensure the design objectives of the problems subject to various constraints. In most of the cases, the computational resources and time required per simulation are large. In certain cases like sensitivity analysis, design optimisation etc. where thousands and millions of simulations have to be carried out, it leads to have a life time of difficulty for designers. Nowadays approximation models, otherwise called as Surrogate Models (SM), are more widely employed {{in order to reduce the}} requirement of computational resources and time in analysing various engineering systems. Various approaches such as Kriging, Neural Networks, Polynomials, Gaussian processes etc. are used to construct the approximation models. The primary intention of this work is to employ the k-fold cross validation approach to study and evaluate the influence of various theoretical variogram models on the accuracy of the surrogate model construction. Ordinary Kriging and Design of Experiments (DOE) approaches are used to construct the surrogate models by approximating panel and viscous solution algorithms which are primarily used to solve the flow around airfoils and aircraft wings. The method of coupling the surrogate models with a suitable optimisation scheme to carryout an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>design</b> <b>optimisation</b> process for aircraft wings is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Global {{tradeoffs}} for <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>design</b> of Supersonic Transport (SST) {{have been}} investigated by Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The objectives are to reduce both drag and sonic boom to make next-generation SST more feasible. Adaptive Range Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (ARMOGAs) are utilised for the efficient search. The trade-offs are analysed by Self-Organising Map (SOM), which provides a topology preserving mapping from the high dimensional space to two dimensions. ARMOGAs and SOM can be good design tools to conduct <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>design</b> <b>optimisations</b> and analyse the results. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} High Lift System (HLS) {{application}} of complex <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>design</b> problem using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) coupled to Game strategies. Two types of optimization methods are used; {{the first method}} is a standard PSO based on Pareto dominance and the second method hybridises PSO with a well-known Nash Game strategies named Hybrid-PSO. These optimization techniques are coupled to a pre/post processor GiD providing unstructured meshes during the optimisation procedure and a transonic analysis software PUMI. The computational efficiency and quality design obtained by PSO and Hybrid-PSO are compared.

40|$|The use of {{adaptive}} wing/aerofoil designs is being considered as promising techniques in aeronautic/aerospace since they can reduce aircraft emissions, improve aerodynamic performance of manned or unmanned aircraft. The paper investigates the robust <b>design</b> and <b>optimisation</b> for one type {{of adaptive}} techniques; Active Flow Control (AFC) bump at transonic flow conditions on a Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) aerofoil <b>designed</b> to increase <b>aerodynamic</b> efficiency (especially high lift to drag ratio). The concept of using Shock Control Bump (SCB) is to control supersonic flow on the suction/pressure side of NLF aerofoil: RAE 5243 that leads to delaying shock occurrence or weakening its strength. Such AFC technique reduces total drag at transonic speeds due to reduction of wave drag. The location of Boundary Layer Transition (BLT) can influence the position the supersonic shock occurrence. The BLT position is an uncertainty in <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>design</b> due to the many factors, such as surface contamination or surface erosion. The paper studies the SCB shape <b>design</b> <b>optimisation</b> using robust Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with uncertainty in BLT positions. The optimisation method {{is based on a}} canonical evolution strategy and incorporates the concepts of hierarchical topology, parallel computing and asynchronous evaluation. Two test cases are conducted; the first test assumes the BLT is at 45 % of chord from the leading edge and the second test considers robust <b>design</b> <b>optimisation</b> for SCB at the variability of BLT positions and lift coefficient. Numerical result shows that the optimisation method coupled to uncertainty design techniques produces Pareto optimal SCB shapes which have low sensitivity and high aerodynamic performance while having significant total drag reduction...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decades {{evolutionary}} algorithms {{have been successfully}} applied to various <b>design</b> <b>optimisation</b> problems. It {{has been shown that}} the representation of the problem is crucial for a high performance of the method. One important aspect is the trade-off between the demands for a high geometric variability in shape generation and a minimum number of optimisation parameters. In this paper, free form deformation is coupled with evolutionary <b>design</b> <b>optimisation</b> in order to overcome this trade-off. Free form deformation methods have been initially developed in the field of solid and surface modelling allowing intuitive shape modifications by moving the control points of a lattice which encloses an arbitrary target geometry. Therefore it allows to decouple the complexity of the design to be optimised from the optimisation parameter. Evolutionary computation is a well established optimisation method for shape or <b>design</b> <b>optimisation</b> and belongs to the global stochastic optimisation methods. A population of possible designs is maintained and adapted from generation to generation via reproduction, variation operators like mutation and recombination and a selection method. The combination of free form deformation with evolutionary <b>design</b> <b>optimisation</b> of complex systems is illustrated by an optimisation of a three-dimensional high performance compressor airfoil. Hence the potential of coupling this kind of representation with a fluid mechanical <b>design</b> <b>optimisation</b> problem is emphasized. The optimisation parameters are defined by a lattice of control points which at the same time modify the geometry as well as the computational grid which is needed by the flow solver. Finally, the resulting shapes of the optimisation are presented and compared to the initial design to show the applicability of the proposed method. 2.
