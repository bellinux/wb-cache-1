In April 2012, General Atomics announced possible upgrades to USAF Reapers, including two extra [...] fuel pods under the wings to increase endurance to 37 hours. The wingspan can also be increased to , increasing endurance to 42 hours. The USAF has bought 38 Reaper Extended Range (ER) versions, carrying external fuel tanks (which don't affect weapon capacity), the heavy-weight landing gear, a four-bladed propeller, a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance among external tank, wing, and fuselage fuel sources, and an <b>alcohol</b> <b>water</b> injection (AWI) system to shorten required runway takeoff length; these features increase endurance from 27 to 33–35 hours, while the company is still pitching the lengthened wing option. The Reaper ER first flew operationally in August 2015. The aircraft also has the sensor ball replaced with a high-definition camera, better communications so ground controllers can see the higher quality video, software to enable automatic detection of threats and tracking of 12 moving targets at once, {{and the ability to}} [...] "super ripple" [...] fire missiles within 0.32 seconds of each other.|$|E

First synthesis was performed in a recycled azeotropic mixture of isopropyl <b>alcohol</b> - <b>water</b> 87. 7 % - 12. 3 %, and second in a filtrate obtained after first synthesis, which {{was a mixture of}} isopropyl <b>alcohol</b> - <b>water</b> 70. 4 % - 29. 6 %. After the second synthesis and filtration, recycled azeotropic mixture isopropyl <b>alcohol</b> - <b>water</b> 87. 7 % - 12. 3 % was regenerated from the filtrate by rectification. Considering this, the technology for beneficial use of recycling isopropyl <b>alcohol</b> - <b>water</b> mixture as reaction medium for tetraalkyl thiuram disulfides synthesis was developed. Such concept contributes to extraordinary economical benefit of implemented optimal laboratory synthesis at semi-industrial level. High yields of tetraalkyl thiuram disulfides syntheses were obtained at both laboratory and semiindustrial level.

Toners typically contain <b>alcohol,</b> <b>water,</b> and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners.

5000|$|As gin was the {{predominant}} {{drink in the}} 1920s, many variations were created by mixing cheap grain alcohol with water and flavorings and other agents, such as juniper berry juice and glycerin. Because the preferred sort of bottle was too tall to be topped off with water from a sink, they were filled from a bathtub tap. In addition, mixing grain <b>alcohol,</b> <b>water</b> and flavorings in vessels large enough to supply commercial users, had to be small enough for the operation to go undetected by the police. The common metal bathtub in use at the time would have been ideal as {{would have been a}} ceramic bathtub, hence the name, 'bathtub gin'. Note: distillation requires closed distillation apparatus and can not be accomplished in an open vessel such as a bathtub and so stories of distilled alcoholic products produced in an open bathtub are very likely untrue.|$|E
