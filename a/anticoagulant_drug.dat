40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether the finding of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with venous thromboembolic episodes should influence the duration of treatment with <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> by mouth. METHODS [...] A retrospective study {{was carried out in}} 19 patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and a history of venous thromboembolic episodes. The median follow up from the first venous thromboembolic episode was 93 months and the median age at this episode was 26 years. The patients had in total 34 venous thromboembolic episodes. The total follow up period comprised 32 periods with and 23 periods without <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs.</b> RESULTS [...] The probability of being free of recurrent venous thromboembolic episodes, calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, was significantly influenced by the use of <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs.</b> Patients receiving oral anticoagulants had at eight years a 100 % probability of survival without recurrence, whereas patients in whom <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> were stopped had a 50 % probability of a recurrent venous thromboembolic episode at two years, and a 78 % probability of recurrence at eight years. CONCLUSION [...] Patients with venous thromboembolic episodes and antiphospholipid antibodies have a high risk for recurrent venous thromboembolic episodes and long term treatment with <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> by mouth is an effective prophylaxis...|$|R
25|$|Antithrombin (AT) {{is a small}} protein {{molecule}} that inactivates several enzymes of the coagulation system. Antithrombin is a glycoprotein produced by the liver and consists of 432 amino acids. It contains three disulfide bonds {{and a total of}} four possible glycosylation sites. α-Antithrombin is the dominant form of antithrombin found in blood plasma and has an oligosaccharide occupying each of its four glycosylation sites. A single glycosylation site remains consistently un-occupied in the minor form of antithrombin, β-antithrombin. Its activity is increased manyfold by the <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drug</b> heparin, which enhances the binding of antithrombin to factor IIa (Thrombin) and factor Xa.|$|E

PNH increases the risk of venous thrombosis but is also associated with hemolytic anemia (anemia resulting from destruction of red blood cells). Both HIT and PNH require particular treatment.|$|E

40|$|Antithrombotic therapy (including {{antiplatelet}} and <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs)</b> is {{the cornerstone}} of the current medical treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). This therapy and particularly the new antiplatelet and <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> have significantly reduced the ischemic risk, but have increased bleeding complications. Recently, several studies have emphasized the negative prognostic impact on long-term mortality of these bleeding adverse events. Thus, new assays to estimate the bleeding risk and the efficacy of these antithrombotic drugs are clearly in demand. Regarding the <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs,</b> new promising data have emerged about the thrombin generation assay (TGA). TGA measures the ability of plasma to generate thrombin. TGA may be used to check coagulation function, to value risk of thrombosis and to compare the efficacy of different anticoagulants employed in clinical management of patients with ACS. The TGA result is a curve which describes the variation of thrombin's amount during the activation of the coagulation cascade. All available <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> influence the principal parameters generated by TGA and so it is possible to evaluate the effects of the medical treatment. In this review we provide {{a brief description of the}} assay and we summarize the principals of previous studies by analyzing the relationship between <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> and TGA. Moreover, a brief summary of its ability to predict ischemic and bleeding risks has been provided...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} recognition that thrombotic complications may occur {{in patients with}} cirrhosis, and literature on antithrombotic treatment in these patients is rapidly emerging. Due to extensive haemostatic changes in patients with cirrhosis, careful monitoring of anticoagulant therapy may be required. Recent data suggest that plasma levels of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are substantially underestimated by the anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) assay in patients with cirrhosis. We studied the in vitro recovery of antithrombin (AT) -dependent and -independent <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> in plasma from 26 patients with cirrhosis and 30 healthy controls and found substantially reduced anti-Xa levels when AT-dependent <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> {{were added to the}} plasma of patients with cirrhosis.

In contrast, the recovery of rivaroxaban and dabigatran was identical between patients and controls. These data suggest that the anti-Xa assay cannot be used to monitor AT-dependent <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>drugs</b> in patients with cirrhosis, as it substantially underestimates drug levels.
