In London, with the help of Rabbi Schonfeld, Dunner set up the London Beis Yaakov Seminary for girls of {{post-school}} age, one of the first of its kind in the United Kingdom.

25|$|As {{the second}} Dutch attack on Fontenoy went in, the main allied {{formation}} moved towards the French {{position on the}} plateau. Cumberland took up his place alongside Ligonier {{at the head of}} 20 battalions, 15 British and 5 Hanoverian to their left, led by the British Guards Brigade, each with their two battalion guns, about 13,000 to 15,000 men, drawn up in two disciplined lines, each six ranks deep. However, the narrowness of the defile through which the attack had to pass forced the Hanoverians back to form a third line behind the British. As the British and Hanoverians advanced the French pushed forward the four small three-pounder battalion guns of the Gardes Françaises Brigade and the four of Aubeterre Brigade, the fire from these was added to the bombardment from the Redoubt d'Eu. Cumberland responded by deploying seven of the Guards Brigade's three-pounder battalion guns to push them back. The Duc de Gramont, of Dettingen infamy, was killed by a shot from these. As the column advanced up a slight rise, the British brought up a battery of twelve six-pounder cannons {{to the front of the}} column at such close range that the Gardes Françaises left their supported defensive position against orders, as they had at Dettingen, and advanced, unsupported, in an attempt to take the guns. Both sides exchanged fire at close range. From the Redoubt of d'Eu and Fontenoy the French cannon poured tremendous flanking fire. Whole allied ranks were swept away, but still they pressed forward in perfect order as if on parade, the better to foster cohesion and the better to overawe their opponents. Saxe had never believed that the allies would conceive or execute such a manoeuvre, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> the one weak spot of his defence – a third redoubt between Fontenoy and the Redoubt of Eu would have rendered the allied advance impossible.|$|E

As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, {{with a handful of}} tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far. Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman [...] "Dutch" [...] Cota, was able to land relatively unscathed.|$|E

2500|$|Attempts to {{date the}} Exodus to a {{specific}} century have been inconclusive. [...] places the event 480 years before the construction of Solomon's Temple, implying an Exodus at c. 1450 BCE, but the number is rhetorical rather than historical, representing a symbolic twelve generations of forty years each. There are major archaeological obstacles to an earlier date. Canaan, also known as Djahy, {{was part of the}} Egyptian empire, so that the Israelites would in effect be escaping from Egypt to Egypt, and its cities were unwalled and do not show destruction layers consistent with the Bible's account of the occupation of the land (Jericho was [...] "small and poor, almost insignificant, and unfortified (<b>and)</b> <b>here</b> <b>was</b> also no sign of a destruction" [...] (Finkelstein and Silberman, 2002).

The lack of evidence has led scholars to conclude that the Exodus story does not represent a specific historical moment.|$|E

The album marks the band's first new release since signing with Warner Bros. (distributed through Sire Records) and the first with the band's current lineup. Musically, the album differs from previous efforts, {{as a result of}} experimentation with new instruments (strings, synths, harmonica and alternative percussion) and the inclusion of guest vocals (Tom Higgenson on [...] "Bored Of Your Love"). Tonally, the album includes more mature themes such as religion ("Black Wedding") and politics ("Are There Giants Too, In The Dance?"). In contrast to the heavily literature-inspired Something Real, only one song from here, here and here has been definitively linked to a novel ("Hug Me" [...] was inspired by Brave New World), and several songs were written by Dia in response to her then recent breakup ("Going Away"). The title of the album comes from the eponymous closing track, which alludes to the composition process of Mozart in the lines: [...] "'Here, Here, and Here.'

Duffy, now in high demand, appeared on Mint Royale's See You in the Morning as a back-up singer. Duffy was introduced to Jeanette Lee of Rough Trade Records in August 2004, after singing Richard J.

Lee with Rough Trade would eventually manage Duffy.

Duffy {{was quoted as saying}} Bettye Swann [...] "is one of my biggest inspirations" [...] particularly her song [...] "Cover Me" [...] because [...] "it marks the time I got interested in physical contact.
