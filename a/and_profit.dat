5|$|A Slight Specimen of Moral Songs, such as I wish some {{happy and}} condescending genius would {{undertake}} {{for the use}} of children, and perform much better... The sense and subjects might be borrow'd plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon, from all the common appearances of nature, from all the occurrences in the civil life, both in city and country: (which would also afford matter for other Divine Songs.) Here the language and measures should be easy and flowing with chearfulness, and without the solemnities of religion, or the sacred names of God and holy things; that children might find delight <b>and</b> <b>profit</b> together.|$|E
5|$|Heublein {{promoted}} Michael A. Miles to run {{the chain}} in 1977 and Miles is credited with saving the ailing company by instituting its back-to-basics formula. Miles refurbished the stores, and introduced indoor seating and drive-thru windows. Electronic tills produced daily customer counts, inventories <b>and</b> <b>profit</b> and loss statements, so that problems could be identified quickly. KFC expanded internationally in the 1970s and 80s, particularly in Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Miles also lured Sanders back, and listened to his recommendations for the business. Subsequent changes resulted in 30 months of consecutive per store sales increases by late 1980.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s however, Tucker's {{views of}} slavery changed notably with {{personal}} experience, <b>and</b> <b>profit,</b> realized in his purchase {{and sale of}} slaves for his account {{and that of his}} father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the insipid benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} relationship between earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> retained earnings and the feasibility of reconciliation of the two accounts by outside corporate investors. Deductive conclusions are based on data derived from publicly available literature, seventeen earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> studies prepared by selected certified public accounting firms, and {{an interview with a}} representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ Ninety-two potential transactional differences between earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> retained earnings are analyzed and classified as resulting in no differences, timing differences, or permanent differences between the accounts. Corroborative inferences are drawn from the data developed from the seventeen earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> studies <b>and</b> from the interview with the representative of the Internal Revenue Service. ^ This dissertation concludes that earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> retained earnings (1) only in extremely rare situations are equal in amount and (2) cannot be reconciled using publicly available information. In addition, the inference is drawn that retained earnings is not a valid surrogate for earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits.</b> The consequences of these conclusions and inference are that outside investors are not receiving useful information about earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> cannot generate that information. ^ The dissertation recommends that the United States Congress define earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits,</b> that the Internal Revenue Service require calculation of the account by all corporate taxpayers on an annual basis, and that the Financial Accounting Standards Board consider the issue of reconciliation of earnings <b>and</b> <b>profits</b> <b>and</b> retained earnings. In addition, recommendations for future research in this area are offered. ...|$|R

5|$|The Andersons {{sold their}} {{intellectual}} <b>and</b> <b>profit</b> participation rights to Thunderbirds and their other productions in the 1970s. As a result, {{they had no}} developmental control over subsequent adaptations of their works. Thunderbirds was first remade for TV in the early 1980s as Thunderbirds 2086. In this anime re-imagining, set 20 years after the original, the vastly expanded IR is based within an arcology and operates 17 Thunderbird machines. It was inspired by Thunderhawks, an updated story concept by Gerry Anderson and Reg Hill that later served {{as the basis for}} Anderson's Supermacromation series Terrahawks.|$|E

Canaris arrives and reveals he will let the virus continue {{as a form of}} population control <b>and</b> <b>profit.</b> Cally's blood is {{to be used as a}} vaccine for the virus. Cally and Stirling board the gunship, while Sinclair chooses to stay behind. Nelson flies into the quarantine zone to speak with Sinclair and she gives him a recording of the conversation, the evidence to bring down Canaris. The recording is later broadcast to the rest of the country. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang. Looking at the head, the marauders cheer, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.|$|E
5|$|Against this existential {{threat and}} fraying social order, the film also explores how {{individual}} characters bend or break existing rules for both selfish and selfless reasons. Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine on herself, Dr. Sussman continues experiments {{on a cell}} line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fiancé {{to leave the city}} before a public quarantine is imposed, Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand <b>and</b> <b>profit</b> for investors in Alternative Medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (fomites) to infect other people. These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi-narrative hyperlink cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced.|$|E

5|$|Writing for American Humor, {{academic}} Robert G. Pielke {{observed that}} the sketch was a very well-done, and moving, reflection on NBC management's fealty to Nielsen ratings <b>and</b> <b>profit.</b> Pielke went on to analyze the sketch and characterized it {{as an example of}} Saturday Night Live resisting conformist authority. He commented that an injustice had been wrought by NBC the company, whereas the NBC executives who came to shut down Star Trek were simply pawns in the process. He posited that the U.S.S. Enterprise crew members were against cancelling the television program because their self-worth had become tied to it. Pielke noted that {{within the confines of the}} sketch's plot itself, as each crew member realized there was no option other than cancellation, they each showed their actual identity and humanity.|$|E
