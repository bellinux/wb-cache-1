5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|The web series {{begins as}} Jake Fischer arrives in Bright Falls to {{interview}} Dr. Hartman {{on his new}} book, an assignment from his publication agency. After a series of encounters with local townspeople, Jake soon finds himself the victim of long periods of lost time and black outs. He finds himself {{waking up in the}} middle of a forest and other locations where he had not been previously. He also develops an aversion towards lights <b>and</b> <b>daytime.</b> The longer he stays in Bright Falls, the more violent his behaviour becomes. When he realises this, he tries to duct-tape himself to a refrigerator and recording videotape himself in his sleep to see what might be causing the behaviour. It is implied that he is being completely taken over by the Dark Presence, to the point of murdering several people. He then vanishes, just before the arrival of Alan and Alice Wake.|$|E

In fact, despite keeping the same on-air branding and logos used as affiliates of the E! system, they do not bear the Citytv branding. However, {{as part of a}} renewal of their affiliation agreements with Citytv on May 3, 2012, CKPG, CHAT and CJFC were to begin simulcasting the Vancouver edition of Breakfast Television from CKVU-DT, starting in fall 2012 as the stations began carrying 90% of Citytv's morning <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> programming from the CKVU schedule grid.|$|E
25|$|The Q44 SBS was {{approved}} in June 2015, with no changes {{from the original}} routing, which runs between Queens and the Bronx. Due to community opposition, bus lanes were only installed on {{a small portion of}} the route between Roosevelt Avenue and the Long Island Expressway in Downtown Flushing and Queensboro Hill, and on Archer Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard in Jamaica; portions of the Archer Avenue lanes were installed before the implementation of SBS. The route began service on November 29, 2015. The Q44 is the first Q-prefixed route to have Select Bus Service, which replaces both the Q44 late-night local <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> limited-stop buses; local bus service in Queens is provided by the Q20A/B, while there is no local equivalent in the Bronx. The Q20A/B and the Q44 SBS are based out of the Casey Stengel Depot.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} meeting with Genie, James Kent {{initially}} observed no reactions from her but eventually drew a small amount of nonverbal and verbal responsiveness with a small puppet. Playing with this and similar puppets quickly became her favorite activity and, apart from her tantrums, accounted for most of the few times she expressed any emotion during the early part of her stay. Within a few days she started learning to dress herself and began voluntarily using the toilet, but she continued to suffer from nighttime <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> incontinence which only slowly improved. Kent quickly realized there would be {{a large number of people}} working with Genie, and was concerned that she would not learn to form a normal relationship unless somebody was a steady presence in her life, so he decided to accompany her on walks and to all of her appointments.|$|E
25|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a common}} term {{for all of the}} {{behaviors}} which relate to the promotion of good sleep. These behaviors are used as the basis of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs. Behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the time that you are planning on going to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful thoughts from view.|$|E
25|$|The {{city and}} {{municipality}} {{are located in}} a region called the Central Highlands. Two thirds of the municipality {{is made up of}} mountainous terrain with the rest valley floor. The city proper is located at 2,200 meters above sea level in a small valley surrounded by hills. The most important of these hills include Cerro Huitepec, San JosÃ© BocomteneltÃ©, Cerro San Felipe, Cerro El Extranjero, Cerro Cruz Carreta, El Arcotete and Cerro Tzontehuitz. While it is in a tropical zone, its climate is temperate due to the altitude. The climate is also humid, with cloud cover in the winter months that keeps temperatures down and can produce cold nights. Average temperature between December and April is 18Â°C. The area receives most of its rain in the summer to early fall. However, the cloud cover that exists in winter is generally absent <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> temperatures can go up to 35Â°C with high humidity.|$|E

25|$|Seven Network aired {{the first}} episode as a 90-minute special in January 1982, during the Christmas/New Year non-ratings period, and the {{official}} broadcast date of the final episode was 19 August 1987. There are 972 half-hour episodes, although during the series' original run, later episodes were shown in an hour-long format. No figures are available for {{how many of these}} longer episodes made up the show's run. The series was broadcast on the Seven Network, initially four days a week for half an hour at 19:00, but in later years, in two one-hour shows per week, and finally in one one-hour show per week, although this may have varied in different parts of Australia. Sons and Daughters became the highest rated programme in its slot, and was the most-watched Australian soap of the 1980s. The series eventually began to suffer from declining ratings, and was ultimately cancelled. During the 1990s the programme was repeated throughout Australia, usually in early morning <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> slots.|$|E
25|$|The Philadelphia Eagles {{wear their}} white jerseys {{at home for}} preseason games <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> games {{in the first half}} of the regular season from September to mid-October when the {{temperature}} is warmer. In night contests {{in the first half of}} the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they have done it earlier before), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the Dallas Cowboys on November 4, 2007 to make the Cowboys wear their road blue jerseys. Since moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, the Eagles have worn white at home for at least their home opener, with the exceptions for the 2010 home opener (see next paragraph), the 2011 home opener against the New York Giants, the 2016 home opener against the Cleveland Browns, and the 2017 home opener against the Giants.|$|E
25|$|Antagonism of the H1, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and Î±1-adrenergic receptors {{is thought}} to have sleep-promoting effects and to be {{responsible}} for the sedative effects of TCAs including those of doxepin. Although doxepin is selective for the H1 receptor at doses lower than 25mg, blockade of serotonin and adrenergic receptors may also be involved in the hypnotic effects of doxepin at higher doses. However, in contrast to very low doses of doxepin, rebound insomnia <b>and</b> <b>daytime</b> sedation are significantly more frequent than placebo with moderate doses (25 to 50mg/day) of the drug. In addition, one study found that although such doses of doxepin improved sleep measures initially, most of the benefits were lost with chronic treatment (by 4weeks). Due to limited data however, more research on potential tolerance and withdrawal effects of moderate doses of doxepin is needed. At these doses of doxepin, dry mouth, an anticholinergic effect, was common (71%), and other side effects such as headache (25%), increased appetite (21%), and dizziness (21%) were also frequently observed, although these adverse effects were notably not significantly more frequent than with placebo in the study in question. In any case, taken together, higher doses of doxepin than very low doses are associated with an increased rate of side effects as well as apparent loss of hypnotic effectiveness with chronic treatment.|$|E
