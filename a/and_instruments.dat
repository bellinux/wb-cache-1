5|$|Native Americans {{were the}} {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of the}} land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles <b>and</b> <b>instruments.</b> African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot.|$|E
2500|$|With sound {{reinforcement}} system, PA system <b>and</b> <b>instrument</b> amplifier speaker enclosures, {{cables and}} {{some type of}} jack or connector are typically used. Lower- and mid-priced sound system <b>and</b> <b>instrument</b> speaker cabinets often use 1/4" [...] speaker cable jacks. Higher-priced and higher powered sound system cabinets <b>and</b> <b>instrument</b> speaker cabinets often use Speakon connectors. Speakon connectors {{are considered to be}} safer for high wattage amplifiers, because the connector is designed so that human users cannot touch the connectors.|$|R

The verb cut is transitive and therefore requires a direct object. The composite role allows the knife to undergo its own action.|$|R

5|$|Some locally-made items {{included}} prismatic obsidian blades and a polished nodule of iron pyrite {{for use as}} a mirror. Other {{items included}} weapons <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> for navigation. A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter objects from England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany. In the end about 1,500 artifacts were retrieved from the San Esteban, 85% of them from the conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
5|$|While {{construction}} of the spacecraft in which the telescope <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the {{construction of}} the OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, {{construction of the}} spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar, {{including}} French chanson performed by artists such as Poopy, reggae, gospel music, and pop rock performed by bands such as Green and AmbondronA. Jazz has been popularized by artists such as Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists such as Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently bands like Oladad are experimenting with the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles <b>and</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E
5|$|After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Lancashire and began collecting books <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy. In the summer of 1639, he left home and moved about 18 miles along the coast to the village of Much Hoole, where it is thought he took up a post as a tutor for the children of the Stones family, who were prosperous haberdashers living at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton.|$|E
5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, {{disagreed}} with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones {{on the basis of}} sound production, but membranophones {{on the basis of the}} shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> containing vibrating air.|$|E

5|$|As an {{homage to}} the venue, the stage was {{decorated}} with roses. The multi-leveled set-up consisted of New York City fire escape routes. Other parts of the stage had a ladder reaching the mezzanine floors and a replica of an F train carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and jackets, <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> adorned with red roses. The main set list for the residency encompassed songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. Some tracks were performed in acoustic versions.|$|E
5|$|Daara J {{was formed}} in 1997 and quickly became popular in Senegal from the release of their first {{cassette}} album, Daara J. They followed in 1999 with a more politically themed recording, Xalima, which integrated numerous musical ideas <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> from Senegal and other African countries. 2003's Boomerang was critically acclaimed and furthered the combination of various musical and lyrical influences of the previous two recordings. Activism has also been {{an important aspect of}} the group's philosophy since it was founded.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{music in}} the US is varied across the country's {{numerous}} ethnic groups. The Native American tribes each play their own varieties of folk music, most of it spiritual in nature. African American music includes blues and gospel, descendants of West African music brought to the Americas by slaves and mixed with Western European music. During the colonial era, English, French and Spanish styles <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> {{were brought to the}} Americas. By the early 20th century, the United States had become a major center for folk music from around the world, including polka, Ukrainian and Polish fiddling, Ashkenazi, klezmer, and several kinds of Latin music.|$|E

5|$|In melody-dominated homophony, {{accompanying}} voices provide chordal {{support for}} the lead voice, which assumes the melody. Some popular music today might be considered melody-dominated homophony, voice typically taking on the lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice. In many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, and often the role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse <b>and</b> <b>instruments</b> subsequently taking solos, during which the other instruments provide chordal support.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{has also}} become a home {{for a number of}} Mediterranean fusion projects. These include Al Darawish, a {{multicultural}} band based in Sicily and led by Palestinian Nabil Ben Salaméh. The Luigi Cinque Tarantula Hypertext Orchestra is another example, as is the TaraGnawa project by Phaleg and Nour Eddine. Mango is one of the best-known artists who fused pop with world and mediterranean sounds, albums such as Adesso, Sirtaki and Come l'acqua are examples of his style.
