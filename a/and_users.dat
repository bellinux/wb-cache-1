5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, <b>and</b> <b>users</b> must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E

The model was examined through the LISREL. Findings The results indicate that IS/IT usage <b>and</b> <b>user</b> satisfaction is largely influenced by perceived usefulness. Among the organizational factors, top management support was found to have the strongest effect on IS/IT usage <b>and</b> <b>user’s</b> satisfaction, followed by availability of training <b>and</b> <b>user</b> involvement.
