5|$|<b>A</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic is {{available}} to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E

5|$|While there, Lennon was {{inspired}} to embark on two recording projects: to make an album of the old rock 'n' roll songs that inspired {{him to become a}} musician, and to produce another artist. In December 1973, Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album, Rock 'n' Roll. The alcohol-fueled recording sessions became legendary. Every musician in L.A. wanted to participate, but soon Lennon's drinking and Spector's erratic behavior (which included his firing <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio control room) caused the sessions to break down. Then Spector, who claimed to have been in a car accident, took the sessions tapes and was unreachable.|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E
5|$|Solanas {{moved to}} New York City in the mid-1960s, {{working as a}} writer. She met pop artist Andy Warhol {{and asked him to}} produce her play, Up Your Ass. She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing and/or stealing, {{followed}} by Warhol expressing additional indifference to her play. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, I, a Man, paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the SCUM Manifesto. Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1968.|$|E

25|$|Gun {{ownership}} {{figures are}} generally estimated via polling, by such organizations as the General Social Survey (GSS), Harris Interactive, and Gallup. There are significant disparities {{in the results}} across polls by different organizations, calling into question their reliability. In Gallup's 1972 survey, 43% reported having a gun in their home, while GSS's 1973 survey resulted in 49% reporting <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home; in 1993, Gallup's poll results were 51%, while GSS's 1994 poll showed 43%.

25|$|Richard Dean Anderson as Angus MacGyver, {{a secret}} agent who {{prefers not to}} carry or use a firearm, due to a {{childhood}} accident with a revolver {{that resulted in the}} death of a friend. However, MacGyver is willing to use an acquired gun, its parts, or its bullets in non-standard ways, such as a substitute for a wrench. There are three exceptions when he uses a gun for its original intended purpose: in the pilot episode, MacGyver is seen firing an AK-47 on a mission in the opening gambit (7:51 into the episode); he holds two kidnappers at gunpoint in the opening scene of episode 10, season one; and, is seen using <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TV movie Trail to Doomsday. He is often suspicious of militaristic attitudes within the government; he sees the Los Angeles-based Phoenix Foundation, his employer, as an alternative to more conventional (and violent) means of law enforcement.|$|E
25|$|In May 1999, Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, {{and other}} activists protested the December 1998 fatal police {{shooting}} of Tyisha Miller in central Riverside, California. Miller, a 19-year-old African-American woman, had sat unconscious {{in a locked}} car with a flat tire and the engine left running, parked at a local gas station. After her relatives had called 9-1-1, Riverside Police Department officers {{who responded to the}} scene observed <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young woman's lap, and according to their accounts, she was shaking and foaming at the mouth, and in need of medical attention. When officers decided to break her window to reach her, as one officer reached for the weapon, she allegedly awoke and clutched her firearm, prompting several officers to open fire, hitting her 23 times and killing her. When the Riverside County district attorney stated that the officers involved had erred in judgement but committed no crime, declining to file criminal charges against them, Sharpton participated in protests which reached their zenith when protestors spilled onto the busy SR 91, completely stopping traffic. Sharpton was arrested for his participation and leadership in these protests.|$|E

25|$|At the compound, Tom {{promotes}} Aldo to Associate. Realizing it was Paulie {{who sold}} Vito out to Sollozzo, Sonny orders Clemenza {{to have him}} killed. Clemenza assigns the hit to Aldo. After Gatto is dead, Tom sends Aldo to accompany Rocco Lampone (Michael Dobson) to Hollywood to intimidate a studio executive named Jack Woltz (Doug Abrahams) into giving Vito's godson, Johnny Fontane, the starring role in a new film. Rocco and Aldo decapitate Woltz' prized stallion, and place the head in his bed as he sleeps, terrifying him into casting Fontane. Back in New York, the Corleones purchase an apartment in Midtown for Aldo and Frankie. Sollozzo and McClusky arrange a meeting with Michael {{to try to come}} to bring the conflict to a peaceful resolution. However, Michael plans to assassinate them. Clemenza has Aldo hide <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toilet of the restaurant where the meeting is taking place, and Michael kills them both. Aldo then drives him to the docks, where he leaves for Sicily. Meanwhile, Vito is released from hospital and promotes Aldo to Soldier, officially making him a made man of the Corleone family.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{questioned}} how Baader and Raspe managed to obtain <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-security prison wing specially constructed for the first generation RAF members. Independent investigations showed that the inmates' lawyers were able to smuggle in weapons and equipment despite the high security, something that the lawyers themselves denied, arguing that every meeting with their clients was observed by jailers. The claims were based primarily on the testimonies of Hans-Joachim Dellwo, brother of RAF prisoner Karl-Heinz Dellwo, and Volker Speitel, the husband of RAF member Angelika Speitel, who were arrested on 2 October 1977 and charged with belonging to a criminal organisation. The fact that they both received lighter sentences, and after release were given new identities, raises {{the question as to}} whether they were acting under police pressure and immunity proposal (as {{was the case with the}} ex-RAF members and perjurers Karl-Heinz Ruhland and Gerhard Müller). However based on these testimonies, the defense attorneys Armin Newerla and Arndt Müller were tried in 1979 and one year later they were convicted of weapon smuggling receiving three and a half years and four years and eight months sentences respectively.|$|E
25|$|In this outdoor hunting {{scene the}} horizon line is almost {{on top of}} the canvas. Seven people are present, along with {{numerous}} animals. A man with a hunting horn (Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur) {{can be seen in the}} foreground, his back turned to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension is in the air as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background with a woman and child nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The faceting however does not partake in the size-distance relation, as one would expect. The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The hunting horn in the foreground is almost identical in size and in faceting to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads. This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition.|$|E

500|$|Lennon {{initially}} {{teamed up}} with producer Phil Spector to record the album, letting Spector have full control. Spector chose some of the songs, booked the studio, and the musicians. When news got around that Lennon was in Hollywood making a record, every musician there {{wanted to be part}} of the sessions. In mid-October 1973, sessions were booked at A Studios, with many of them having over 30 musicians, but the sessions quickly fell into disarray—fueled by alcohol. Spector once showed up dressed in a surgeon's outfit and shot <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ceiling of the studio, hurting Lennon's ears. [...] On another occasion, a bottle of whiskey had spilled on the A Studio's mixing console causing future sessions to be banned from the facility. Unknown to Lennon, each night Spector would remove the master tapes from the studio, and move them to his house. Spector then disappeared with the session tapes and would not be heard from for several months. Spector made one cryptic call to Lennon, claiming to have the [...] "John Dean tapes" [...] from the recent Watergate scandal; Lennon deduced that Spector meant he had the album's master tapes. When a car accident on 31 March 1974 left Spector in a coma, the project was put on indefinite hold. In mid-1974, Lennon returned to New York with Pang and began writing and recording a new album of original material, Walls and Bridges. Shortly before these sessions began, Al Coury, then-head of A/promotion for Capitol Records retrieved the Spector tapes. Not wanting to break stride, Lennon shelved the tapes and completed work on Walls and Bridges.|$|E
