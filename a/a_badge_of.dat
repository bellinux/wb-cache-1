5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E
5|$|Clan badge: There {{have been}} two clan badges (or plant badges) {{attributed}} to Clan MacAulay: cranberry and scots pine. Both clans MacAulay and MacFarlane have been attributed with <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> cranberry. Clan MacFarlane, also a west-Dumbartonshire clan, claims a descent from Alwyn II, Earl of Lennox. The badge of scots pine {{has been attributed to}} all seven clans of Siol Alpin: Clan Grant, Clan Gregor, Clan MacAulay, Clan Macfie, Clan Mackinnon, Clan Macnab, and Clan MacQuarrie.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder of}} the Scouting movement, Robert Baden-Powell, wore six beads, as did Sir Percy Everett, then Deputy Chief Scout and the Chief's right hand. Baden-Powell's beads are on display at Baden-Powell House in London. Everett endowed his six beads to be worn by the Camp Chief of Gilwell as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> office. Since that time the wearer of the sixth bead has {{generally}} been the director of leader training at Gilwell Park.|$|E

5|$|In the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, {{the most}} senior non-commissioned ranks wear the 1957 version of the coat of arms as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> rank, {{representing}} {{the fact that they}} have received the Queen's warrant (as opposed |to the Queen's commission for officers). The revised 1957 and 1994 Arms of Canada are both protected official government symbols used to represent the state under the Federal Identity Program. Permanent resident cards issued from 2015 feature a holographic representation of the 1957 version of the coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2008, the House of Commons {{was granted}} its own heraldic symbol {{following}} {{a request by}} Commons Speaker Peter Milliken to the Canadian Heraldic Authority. The new symbol for Parliament is <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> the escutcheon in the Arms of Canada superimposed on the mace used by the House of Commons {{as a symbol of}} its authority derived from the Crown. The Senate was granted a similar badge on 15 April 2008, using its own mace. Parliament as a whole has been granted the right to use the escutcheon of the Arms of Canada, superimposed over the maces of the Commons and Senate in saltire.|$|E
5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of South Africa was the United Kingdom's Union Jack as South Africa {{was part of the}} British Empire. The South Africa Red Ensign was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Order of Karađorđe's Star was {{categorized}} {{as a senior}} state award, and organized into four classes. The Grand Cross of Karađorđe's Star, the highest class, consisted of <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> the Order on a sash and breast star; a Grand Officer of Karađorđe's Star was decorated with a badge necklet and a slightly smaller breast star; a Commander of Karađorđe's Star was only awarded a badge necklet; and {{the recipient of the}} Order's fourth class, the Officer of Karađorđe's Star, would receive a small triangular chest ribbon. The Order was usually awarded for services to the Karađorđević dynasty, the Serbian state or the Serb people, while Karađorđević princes received a Grand Cross at baptism. Recipients included both soldiers and civilians, though until 1906 only Serbian citizens were permitted to receive the award.|$|E

25|$|Freed, Ryti did {{not return}} to public life. He {{concentrated}} on writing his memoirs but was not successful due to ill health.

25|$|This {{stayed close}} to the Roman pattern, {{especially}} for officers (see Gallery section for example). A breastplate of armour, under which {{the bottom of a}} short tunic appeared as a skirt, often overlaid with a fringe of leather straps, the pteruges. Similar strips covered the upper arms, below round armour shoulder-pieces. Boots came to the calf, or sandals were strapped high on the legs. A rather flimsy-looking cloth belt is tied high under the ribs as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> rank rather than a practical item.|$|E
25|$|Most Japanese {{people and}} {{agencies}} have adopted customs {{to deal with}} these issues. Address books, for instance, often contain furigana or ruby characters to clarify the pronunciation of the name. Japanese nationals are also required to give a romanized name for their passport. The recent use of katakana in Japanese media when referring to Japanese celebrities who have gained international fame has started a fad among young socialites who attempt to invoke a cosmopolitan flair using katakana names as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> honor. All of these complications are also found in Japanese place names.|$|E
25|$|After {{the initial}} 1936 ban on hijab in Iran, {{the rules of}} dress code were relaxed, and after Reza Shah's abdication in 1941 the {{compulsory}} element in the policy of unveiling was abandoned. According to Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, between 1941 and 1979, wearing hijab was no longer offensive, but still considered {{it to be a}} real hindrance to climbing the social ladder, <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> backwardness and a marker of class. A headscarf, let alone the chador, prejudiced the chances of advancement in work and society not only of working women but also of men, who were increasingly expected to appear with their wives at social functions.|$|E
