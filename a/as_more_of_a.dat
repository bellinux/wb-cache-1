5|$|Despite its later {{importance}} to Britain, Gibraltar was initially {{seen by the}} British Government <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bargaining counter than a strategic asset. Its defences continued to be neglected, its garrisoning was an unwelcome expense, and Spanish pressure threatened Britain's vital overseas trade. On seven separate occasions between 1713 and 1728 the British Government proposed to exchange Gibraltar for concessions from Spain, but on each occasion the proposals were vetoed by the British Parliament following public protests.|$|E
5|$|Richard White as Gaston – A vain {{hunter who}} vies for Belle's hand in {{marriage}} and is {{determined not to}} let anyone else win her heart. He serves as a foil personality to the Beast, who was once as egotistic as Gaston prior to his transformation. Gaston's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain, an assignment he found difficult at first. In the beginning, Gaston is depicted <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> narcissist than a villain, but later he leads all the villagers to kill the beast, enraged that Belle would love a Beast more than him.|$|E
5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} have accepted these numbers, {{especially since the}} ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point. Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 being seen <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E

25|$|In Pausanias' interpretation, Androgeos {{being killed}} by the bull is {{presented}} <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident, which, however, Minos is remarked to not have believed.|$|R
5|$|The {{net effect}} of the Dutch {{campaign}} was a pax Hollandica (Dutch peace), assuring VOC control in the southwest of the island. The Dutch called their new area of control the Verenigde Dorpen (United Villages), a deliberate allusion to the United Provinces of their homeland. The campaign was vital to the success and growth of the Dutch colony, which had operated <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trading post than a true colony until that point.|$|E
5|$|These {{numbers are}} (by ancient standards) consistent, {{and this could}} be {{interpreted}} that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis. Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number1,207 being seen <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliadand generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Though the League for Social Reconstruction began <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{discussion}} group than a political party, {{it became a}} force in Canadian politics by the mid-1930s. After Havelock joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, along with several {{other members of the}} League, he was pressured by his superiors at the University to curtail his political activity. He did not, continuing to act as an ally and occasional spokesman for Underhill and other leftist professors. He found himself in trouble again in 1937 after criticising both the government's and industry's handling of an automotive workers' strike. Despite calls from Ontario officials for his ouster, he was able to remain at Victoria College, but his public reputation was badly damaged.|$|E

50|$|Howard Hampton {{also put}} his name forward. While he was also <b>a</b> senior member <b>of</b> the Rae cabinet, he was viewed <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outsider, {{particularly}} because he was from northern Ontario and not based in Toronto.|$|R
50|$|Dj.Fresh {{incorporates}} <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> {{styles in}} his production, including hip hop, EDM, house, jazz, and R&B, though he self-identifies <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> R&B than a hip hop producer. He uses analog equipment including turntables and vinyl, and a MIDI controller keyboard. He also uses Ableton Live and occasionally brings in live instrumentation.|$|R
5|$|The number 1,207 appears {{very early}} in the {{historical}} record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet; others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean. However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800. This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.|$|E
25|$|The tilt {{continued}} through Henry VIII {{and onto the}} reign of Elizabeth I. Under Elizabeth's rule, tournaments were seen <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parade or show than an actual martial exercise.|$|E
25|$|Khalid had a {{reputation}} as a supporter of women's rights and a Western reformer, and his wife, Sheikha Fawqai Al Qasami, was a playwright and an active campaigner for women's issues. Sheikh Saud was seen <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traditionalist.|$|E
50|$|Bornedal {{stated that}} {{he was drawn to}} The Possessions script, having seen it <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> allegory for divorce than as a true horror film. Actors Sedgwick and Morgan were brought in to play the Breneks; Morgan chose to {{participate}} after seeing Calis' audition tape. Parts of the movie were filmed at a former mental institution, Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|Arefayné Fantahun {{writes that}} while we {{associate}} most other authors with a single, emblematic work, Kebede Michael produced many: “in the case of Kebede Michael … what echoes in our Ethiopians’ heads is the idea <b>of</b> him <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> institution than the title of any one book …. That institution is the collectivity of Kebede Michael’s literary production”.|$|R
2500|$|Punctuation can be {{perceived}} <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exception than <b>as</b> {{a general rule}} in Asokan Brahmi. For instance, distinct spaces in between the words appear frequently in the pillar edicts {{but not so much}} in others. ("Pillar edicts" [...] refers to the texts that are inscribed on the stone pillars oftentimes with the intention of making them public.) [...] The idea of writing each word separately was not consistently used.|$|R
25|$|The ABC dramedy Dirty Sexy Money (which {{ran from}} 2007 to 2009) {{was in a}} way a soap opera parody but, in actuality, was styled <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> satire that {{operated}} in a humorous way similar to a parody. The series was critically acclaimed, but only lasted for two seasons.|$|E
25|$|Yanji {{is often}} {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Korean, rather than Chinese, community. Two all-Korean television channels are produced locally, and others can be freely received from both North and South Korea. Korean cuisine is highly popular and available everywhere. An annual Korean folk festival takes place each September in Yanji, featuring traditional Korean music, dance, painting, and sports.|$|E
25|$|Writing in 1946, {{shortly after}} the scale of The Holocaust became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since {{challenged}} rumor that Nazis fabricated human soap. Historian of ideas Andrei Oișteanu analyzes Relgis' text <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.|$|E
40|$|In {{the end it}} was <b>a</b> bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disappointment. Not {{much blood}} on the mat or any clear knockouts. Gorgeous George did better than expected: there was some smart money on him to be on the canvas early, but it didn’t happen. Vince Cable was the most depressingly {{realistic}} and emerged <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> honest broker because of it. The other parties still largely sidestepped the issues of exactly which spending areas would feel the axe swinging...|$|R
25|$|On 10 July 1718 he {{was convicted}} of {{manslaughter}} for having killed Bowen, another actor, in a duel which the victim had himself provoked. Quin was not severely punished, the affair being regarded <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident than a crime. The public took <b>a</b> similar view <b>of</b> another episode in which Quin, on being attacked by a young actor who had been angered by the sarcastic criticism of his superior, drew upon him and killed him.|$|R
50|$|As stated earlier, in 2008, {{schools in}} the Val Müstair {{switched}} from Vallader to Rumantsch Grischun as their written language. When they switched back to Vallader in 2012 following a referendum, it showed that Vallader is in danger but is still without a doubt seen as a (if not the most) reliable language, especially for writing. Since Jauer is used almost solely for speech, this allows more room for Vallader to exist <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entity {{in the world of}} writing.|$|R
25|$|In 1989 a push {{was made}} to redefine Varsity Scouting <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patrol-based program within the Troop. Varsity Patrols for older Scouts {{pursuing}} athletic interests, and Venture Patrols for older Scouts pursuing outdoor high adventure were introduced, both having roots in LDS Scouting tradition. Varsity Patrol were to emphasize sports. Venture Patrols pursue outdoor high adventure activities. Varsity Patrols were eventually discontinued, but Venture Patrols remain {{a part of the}} official literature0-8395-3009-9, 1998.|$|E
25|$|On his {{religious}} views, Wittgenstein {{was said to}} be greatly interested in Catholicism and was sympathetic to it. In his university years, he expressed belief in the resurrection of Jesus. However, he did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to Norman Malcolm, Wittgenstein saw Catholicism <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> way of life than as a set of beliefs he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.|$|E
25|$|Democritus {{was born}} in Abdera, Thrace, around 460BC, {{although}} some thought it was 490 BC. His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from those of his mentor Leucippus, as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the 19th-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scientist than other Greek philosophers; however, their ideas rested on very different bases.|$|E
25|$|Msiri now had {{the power}} and {{influence}} {{to be able to}} form alliances <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> equal with warlords such as Tippu Tip, who controlled the eastern Congo from Lake Tanganyika up to what is now Uganda in the north-east, and the Nyamwezi leader Mirambo who controlled the land route between Lake Tanganyika and the coast, and he sought to emulate them. Msiri achieved what other tribes and the Portuguese had tried without as much success, which was to trade across the continent, with both coasts.|$|R
2500|$|In 2000, {{after the}} two-year hiatus, Yanni {{released}} If I Could Tell You, his first studio album in seven years. The album sold 55,000 copies {{in its first}} week and landed at No. 20 on the Billboard charts, his highest debut to date. Yanni described the album <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> even-tempered [...] "listening" [...] album, less dramatic than the live concert albums Live at the Acropolis or Tribute. He explained that he himself created all of the album's sounds, including apparent vocalizations, through the manipulation of sound in his studio.|$|R
50|$|ACHS {{was formed}} in 1925 to create <b>a</b> network <b>of</b> {{affiliated}} societies and promote high standards for scholarship and leadership on campus. The intention of the founding societies was {{to establish and maintain}} desirable standards for groups wishing to call themselves honor societies. Today it effectively operates <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old boy network. The purported standards include criteria for membership, governance and chapter operation. Four organizations were represented at a preliminary meeting held on October 2, 1925. They were Alpha Omega Alpha, the Order of the Coif, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the first}} season of Sports Night is a sitcom, it often is portrayed <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comedy-drama {{representative}} of some of Sorkin's later work on The West Wing. Sorkin intended for the series' humor to be drier and more realistic than typical sitcoms. He initially wanted the show to be recorded without a laugh track, but ABC network executives insisted on including one. The volume of the laugh track faded as Season One continued and was abandoned {{at the beginning of}} Season Two.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 1939, the Pact of Steel {{was signed}} by Galeazzo Ciano and German foreign {{minister}} Joachim von Ribbentrop, effectively allying the two powers. Despite the fairly good relations the two states had had, many Italians were against this alliance, thinking of it <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> submission to Germany, knowing that Italian interests were likely not to be favored in the relationship. The alliance also technically forced Italy to join in any war that Germany had entered, so that Germany could at any time present the treaty and force Mussolini to enter, though they did not end up using this right.|$|E
25|$|Shrout’s study {{concluded}} that women who experienced negative appraisals, like self-blame and causal attribution, led to emotional distress and increased health-compromising behavior (Shrout, 2017). Studies show that men typically only experience distress from a physical or sexual affair, while women are more bothered by emotional or relational affairs. However, women are more affected than men. This is due perception (Shrout, 2017). Women perceive relationships <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> priority and are usually more emotionally attached (Palermo, 2015). Following a study of coping differences between genders, Binghamton University and University College London researchers say it’s evolutionary and we can blame our ancestors for this.|$|E
50|$|Call of Duty: Combined Forces was a {{proposed}} concept draft {{originally intended to}} be a sequel to Call of Duty: Finest Hour. However, due to multiple legal issues that arose between Spark Unlimited, Electronic Arts, and Activision as well as other production problems, the game's draft and scripts never came to be. The game was projected to cost $10.5 million to produce after Finest Hour was complete. Eventually Activision deemed the pitch <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expansion than something entirely new, causing the company to reject the proposal and end their contract with Spark Unlimited shortly after.|$|R
40|$|At its {{fundamental}} level, {{engineering is}} problem solving. An engineer must have problem solving abilities with {{some level of}} expertise. However, gaining these skills is challenging since design is often viewed <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> art than science. This paper investigates the cognitive aspects of design expertise. We conclude that expertise relies on knowledge of the basic principles {{and the application of}} this theory. Examining the differences between expert and novice problem solving highlights this. Fundamental to the differences in problem solving ability and strategies is the level of sophistication, appropriateness, and completeness of their mental representations of the problem. 1...|$|R
40|$|Conceptual modelling, {{determining}} what {{to include in}} the model and at what level of detail, affects model performance directly. However, it has so far received little attention in the literature mainly because conceptual modelling is viewed <b>as</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> art than science. This paper describes a study on conceptual modelling in which data on the time spent on the different topics during real simulation projects by an expert and by novice modellers was collected and analysed. There were several differences between the data for the expert and the data for the novices, possibly indicating a difference in the modelling style...|$|R
