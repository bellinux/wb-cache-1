5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
