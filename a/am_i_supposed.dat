We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself.

In May 2007, Fight Like Apes won Phantom FM's Topman Unsigned Band Search; their prize was to be a support act of The Holloways at show in Dublin. Fight Like Apes played both Electric Picnic (their first major Irish festival) and Hard Working Class Heroes in 2007 and also performed at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City.

2500|$|Gaye {{had also}} been deeply {{affected}} by the social ills plaguing the United States at the time, and covered the track [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", in 1969, which became a UK hit for Gaye in 1970.

[...] MacKenzie was not specifically referring to the coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and made no mention of the tragedy during the interview, but the Liverpool Echo published a piece reporting MacKenzie's statements and criticising the apparent lack of shame or regret over the Hillsborough coverage implied by them (and the fact that MacKenzie may still regard the misleading coverage as a [...] "good story").|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} the What's Going On album, Gaye recorded {{a cover of}} the song, [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including Curtis Mayfield. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by The Temptations in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social {{events such as the}} 1965 Watts riots and once asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to keep singing love songs?" [...] When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do protest music, Gordy cautioned him, [...] "Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far." ...|$|E

[...] In the 1980s, Donahue was the first national television program to reveal widespread child molestation by Catholic priests, something for which he was widely criticized. In 2002 he told Oprah Winfrey, [...] "I once did a priest pedophilia show on St. Patrick's Day, and a priest called in and said, 'How <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to work on a playground with children?'

Before American Idol, he was a non-profit organizer, working with children with special needs. He has spoken of suffering from emotional depression and credited the children that he worked with for helping him to recover from his illness. He has also said that the children motivated him to audition for American Idol. He auditioned in Pittsburgh with [...] "How <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Supposed</b> to Live Without You".

Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her?

Before joining Blue Mink in late 1969 she sang solo, and her cover version of [...] "Picture Me Gone" [...] is still a Northern Soul favourite today, as is [...] "What <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>Supposed</b> To Do", from 1968, a two-minute B-side tune co-written with future Led Zeppelin member John Paul Jones, then working as one of London's most in-demand session bassists. (Bell also sang backup on Joe Cocker's [...] "Bye Bye Blackbird" [...] in 1969, which featured a guitar solo from another Led Zeppelin member, Jimmy Page.) Jones later arranged, produced and recorded Bell's 1973 RCA album Comin' Atcha. She contributed to the soundtrack of the romance film A Touch of Class (1973). She also sang backup for the Dave Clark Five's single release, [...] "Everybody Get Together", and contributed backing vocals to Elton John's 1972 album, Honky Chateau.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was also}} the {{solution}} of a second governess, a young person to come in by the day and really do the work; but to this Miss Overmore wouldn't for a moment listen, arguing against it with great public relish and wanting to know from all comers--she put it even to Maisie herself--they didn't see how frightfully it would give her away. [...] "What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to be at all, don't you see, if I'm not here to look after her?" [...] She was in a false position and so freely and loudly called attention to it {{that it seemed to}} become almost a source of glory. The way out of it of course was just to do her plain duty; but that was unfortunately what, with his excessive, his exorbitant demands on her, which every one indeed appeared quite to understand, he practically, he selfishly prevented. Beale Farange, for Miss Overmore, was now never anything but [...] "he," [...] and the house was as full as ever of lively gentlemen with whom, under that designation, she chaffingly talked about him. Maisie meanwhile, as a subject of familiar gossip on what was to be done with her, was left so much to herself that she had hours of wistful thought of the large loose discipline of Mrs. Wix; yet she none the less held it under her father's roof a point of superiority that none of his visitors were ladies. It added to this odd security that she had once heard a gentleman say to him {{as if it were a}} great joke and in obvious reference to Miss Overmore: [...] "Hanged if she'll let another woman come near you--hanged if she ever will. She'd let fly a stick at her as they do at a strange cat!" [...] Maisie greatly preferred gentlemen as inmates in spite of their also having their way--louder but sooner over--of laughing out at her. They pulled and pinched, they teased and tickled her; some of them even, as they termed it, shied things at her, and all of them thought it funny to call her by names having no resemblance to her own. The ladies on the other hand addressed her as [...] "You poor pet" [...] and scarcely touched her even to kiss her. But it was of the ladies she was most afraid.|$|E
