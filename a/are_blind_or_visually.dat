3000|$|The {{medical model}} of {{disability}} views {{individuals with disabilities}} as people who are broken because of their impairments.

40|$|This {{contribution}} to the forum discusses Dickens’s representations and use of embossed systems of print for readers who <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>visually</b> impaired, explains the controversy surrounding the choice of system for such readers, and examines the disability rights issues involved in the debate. Noting the personal stake that Dickens had in the matter, the article outlines my own response to his position - in the fictional portrait of Harriet Dickens, the novelist’s blind sister-in-law, in 'Harriet and Letitia', my novel-in-progress. My work suggests how one of Dickens’s female dependents might have contested his power and control: by using a typograph to write over - or, rather, through - his own manuscripts and publications, transforming text into subtext and challenging his gendered concept of disabled expression...|$|R

The importance of the set is for more accessibility in any environment through ultrasonic waves which signals to the sunglasses, cane, and wristband. The 3 components would stimulate protection and awareness for the person and can be managed by the user and doctor, if necessary. With the U. C. A.

50|$|The census {{computed}} disability {{based on}} whether the respondent <b>was</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>visually</b> impaired, partially sighted, deaf or dumb, hard of hearing, mentally ill, historically suffered mental disorders, mentally retarded or physically challenged. There were a total of eight disabilities thus considered compared to 1990 census when only five disabilities were counted. The loss of feelings in fingers as defined by United Nations was not considered as disability for the survey. There were 256,690 persons in the country, constituting 2.7 per cent of the population, who were disabled. Western Province had 4 per cent disabled individuals, while Copperbelt had only 0.4 per cent disabled persons. The major reasons of disability were computed on account of diseases (38.4%), followed by injury (17.2%), prenatal causes (13.7%) and others (9%). The disabled were higher in rural areas compared to urban and males formed 53 per cent of disabled.|$|R

40|$|Background. The authors {{present a}} {{preventive}} physiotherapy programme intended {{to improve the}} well-being of persons who have <b>been</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>visually</b> impaired since birth or experience partial or complete loss of vision later in life {{as a result of}} injury or disease. Methods. Different methods and techniques of physiotherapy, kinesitherapy and relaxation used in the rehabilitation of visually impaired persons are described. Results. The goals of timely physical treatment are to avoid unnecessary problems, such as improper posture, tension of the entire body, face and eyes, and deterioration of facial expression, that often accompany partial or complete loss of vision. Regular training improves functional skills, restores the skills that have been lost, and prevents the development of defects and consequent disorders of the locomotor apparatus. Conclusions. It is very difficult to change the life style and habits of blind and visually imapired persons. Especially elderly people who experience complete or partial loss of vision later in their lives are often left to their fate. Therefore blind and visually impaired persons of all age groups should be enrolled in a suitable rehabilitation programme that will improve the quality of their life. </p...|$|R
