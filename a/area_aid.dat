5000|$|In 1977, Butcher {{became the}} first black woman to hold the {{position}} of assistant administrator to AID Africa. [...] One of Butcher’s “first actions upon becoming assistant administrator for Africa, was to examine the steps AID had taken in the past to provide opportunity for entities owned, managed or principally identified with minorities and women to serve in its program as contractors and grantees…” [...] In her new position, Butcher testified before Congress in hearings dealing with the inadequacy of small business contracting policies in the Africa Bureau due to contracting barriers constructed during the Ford administration. [...] Butcher believed that AID had a responsibility “to assure that contractors exercise equal opportunity employment,” [...] and this responsibility had been “virtually ignored.” [...] “In addition to compliance with existing law and contracting regulations, Butcher proposed several new initiatives, one of which established the Minority Involvement Office in the Africa Bureau.” [...] Later that year, “Butcher returned to Congress to explain why the U.S. should be more responsive to Africa’s development.” [...] Butcher called Africa “the stepchildren of our foreign assistance program” and informed Congress of the minimizing AID assistance since 1962, but was encouraged by the “current $155 million in development assistance.” [...] During her address, Butcher outlined initiatives to “overcome hunger and malnutrition…train personnel in agricultural skills… construct the rural infrastructure necessary for delivery of inputs and information and the outward movement of produce… assist in the development of educational systems to give greater attention to the geographical allocation of our assistance in terms of common or interrelated problems among the countries of the continent…” [...] Each fiscal year Butcher would “map out her imaginative programs and her vision of enlarging the role of AID in assistance programs in Africa” to the House Subcommittee. In 1979, Butcher noted that Africa was lagging “behind…the rest of the countries in the developing world.” [...] She attributed this lag to the geographical isolation of Africa and the shortage of trained manpower, an <b>area</b> <b>AID</b> Africa specifically targeted. [...] In order to avoid falling on deaf ears after her frequent testimonials, Butcher would tie U.S. incentives into reasons why the U.S. should focus on supporting Africa’s development programs. Specifically, Butcher pointed out Africa possesses “substantially confirmed or highly probable deposits of important minerals.” ...|$|E
40|$|Cytoarchitectonic {{characterization}} of borders {{is necessary for}} stereological studies (e. g., total cell number estimation), in which particular cortical areas have to be defined. In this study, cytoarchitectonic characteristics are described and illustrated for the rat ventral or orbital frontal cortical areas, i. e., the lateral-, ventrolateral-, ventral- and medial-orbital areas; and for the lateral frontal cortical areas, i. e., the agranular insular and the dorsolateral orbital cortical area. Each cytoarchitectonic-defined boundary is corroborated {{by one or more}} of the immunocytochemical stainings for dopaminergic fibers, SMI- 32 positive neurons, calbindin and parvalbumin positive neurons. Each immunocytochemical staining, however, shows a characteristic subset of the cytoarchitectonical borders. The dorsal agranular insular <b>area</b> (<b>AId)</b> and the dorsolateral orbital area (DLO) have been subdivided into a dorsal and a ventral part based upon differences between these parts in the Nissl and immunocytochemical stainings. The posterior part of VLO has a different structure and is, therefore, indicated as VLOp (VLO, posterior part). © 2007 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

40|$|Improvement in {{information}} sharing and communication about the foreign aid resources between the donors and the aid-recipient countries {{have always been}} considered very important. In recent years, the integration of advanced technology {{in the area of}} aid coordination has received a tremendous amount of attention. The following thesis studies the influence of technology in the <b>area</b> <b>aid</b> coordination within the context of Afghanistan. Guided by the Actor-Network Theory, the thesis examines how the social and technological aspects of the Development Assistance Database (DAD), as an advanced aid information management technology, influences aid coordination and information sharing between the donors and the government of Afghanistan. Using a case study methodology, the research also investigates whether or not the DAD adheres to the principles of aid effectiveness. The findings reveal that although technology had a profound impact in the area of aid management in Afghanistan, there are several areas that still face challenges. The present study highlights these challenges and recommends the appropriate solutions...|$|E
40|$|The western {{conservation}} {{concept is}} articulated {{at the global}} level. However in practice conservation is regionally or locally pursued. This thesis examines how the global rhetoric of modern conservation relates to the local reality of conservation in Western Samoa. Three specific conservation <b>area</b> <b>aid</b> projects are analysed to assess this relationship. They are analysed predominantly from the local flaxroots level. A national park approach, motivated by ecological criteria, operates in isolation from its surrounding community. Not only does the strict preservation established at the park boundaries exclude local people, but also the ideologies embodied in the park remain foreign and therefore exclusive. The conservation agenda as pursued {{in the other two}} conservation strategies is a more integrated approach that includes socio-economic and cultural criteria, as well as ecological criteria. The villages surrounding these areas are therefore motivated by a broader spectrum of values, many of which are more tangible than long-term ecological benefits. This integration of 'people criteria' into conservation projects is consequently more inclusive of local communities. However the integrated conservation-development approach to conservation contains fundamental problems in its design. Many of these relate to the merger of environment and development objectives within the one project. Despite these broader problems the reality at the local level in Western Samoa supports the continuance of foreign conservation assistance. A strong development imperative and a rapidly disappearing forest resource are two of the realities of the local context that demand external support. This external assistance must be balanced by the value of the local culture...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Presentation date: 1985 - 05 - 01 The {{dynamics}} of stands In old-growth ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests {{on the eastern}} flank of the central Oregon Cascades are Investigated. Age structure and spatial pattern of ponderosa pine within the Pringle Falls Experimental Forest Research Natural Area coupled with the fire history of the <b>area</b> <b>aid</b> In Interpreting stand development. Two 1. 0 -ha permanent reference stands were established in the Pinus ponderosa/Purshia tridentata-Ceanothus velutinus/Stipa occidentalis comunity type. Age data were taken from 294 Pinus ponderosa and 223 Pinus contorta > 10 cm dbh, and 98 Pinus ponderosa and 57 Pinus contorta < 10 cm dbh. Spatial dispersion of trees within identifiable age cohorts was tested using Morisit&s Index. The historical development of both stands since 1500 is examined using a chronosequence of the location of stems of known ages. Associations using chi-square tests are examined for the identified cohorts of both species. Both reference stands are composed of three identifiable age cohorts. Comparison of the age data with a fire history of the Pringle Falls Experimental Forest indicates that periods of increased fire activity correspond to periods of decreased survivorship in both stands. Regeneration of Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta on both stands {{since the turn of}} the century, in the absence of fire, indicates that successful regeneration within these stands is not as dependent on fire-prepared mineral seedbed as is regeneration in pine stands in the Southwest. Trees on both stands in all three cohorts occur in clumps ranging from 25 - 3500 m 2. Distribution within the clumps is aggregated as well, with small, usually even-aged clusters of trees being a common component of the larger aggregations. Two scales of pattern are identified in both stands. High mortality during periods of increased fire activity produce long-term temporal and coarse-grained spatial patterns of the broad age cohorts. Fine-grained spatial and shorter temporal patterns result from contemporaneous reproduction in small areas. Chi-square associations indicate that the spatial and temporal patterns of the older cohorts have been maintained in the stands for the last 250 years. Fire exclusion has caused a deterioration in both types of patterns. A fire regime that includes frequent (7 - 20 years) low-Intensity burns must be introduced to these stands if the desired goal is to maintain patterns characteristic of the primeval forest. Furthermore, rare fires that are either larger or hotter must be periodically included in the fire regime if coarse-grained spatial and long-term temporal patterns are to be maintained...|$|E
