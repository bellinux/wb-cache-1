In some cases, the author's identity can also be <b>anonymised</b> for the review process, with identifying information is stripped from the document before review. The system is intended to reduce or eliminate bias.|$|E

25|$|On 26 November 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Virgin Media would trial deep packet inspection technology to measure the level of illegal file sharing on its network. The CView system, provided by Detica, will look at traffic and identify the peer-to-peer packets. It will then peer inside those packets and try to determine what is licensed and what is unlicensed, based on data provided by the record industry. The trial – which has no scheduled end date – will cover about 40% of Virgin Media's network but those involved will not be informed. Virgin Media emphasised that it is seeking to measure the overall level of illegal file sharing, not to keep records on individual customers. Data on the level of copyright infringement will be aggregated and <b>anonymised.</b>|$|E

2500|$|For most {{scholarly}} publications, {{the identity}} of the reviewers is kept <b>anonymised</b> (also called [...] "blind peer review).

2500|$|Tor Browser (The Onion Router): Tor Browser {{is a free}} {{software}} that provides access to <b>anonymised</b> network that enables anonymous communication. It directs the internet traffic through multiple relays. This encryption method prevents others from tracking a certain user, thus allowing user's IP address and other personal information to be concealed.|$|E
30|$|To achieve this, in our approach, {{the user}} will assume the {{presence}} of <b>anonymising</b> techniques (e.g. IPv 4 network address translation and dynamic IPs, anonymiser networks such as Tor, and pseudonymous identities; see: [3 – 9]) to de-identify himself/herself from his/her ratings sufficiently such that the complete rating vector for a user cannot be reconstructed. Thus our security guarantees are based upon the security guarantees provided by the underlying <b>anonymising</b> mechanism, and are bounded by it.|$|R
40|$|<b>Anonymising</b> {{services}} have evolved from simple proxies to complex systems. Numerous techniques {{have been developed}} to thwart and confuse attackers, thereby improving the degree of anonymity. These techniques are often presented as additional advantages of specific <b>anonymising</b> services. Comparisons of anonymity services exist, however, {{there is a need for}} a more structured approach towards the understanding of the various techniques employed by these services. This paper takes a meta-level look at connection anonymity, how it has evolved and how and why certain design choices are made. A conceptual framework describing what we consider to be important connection anonymity factors will be proposed. We consider design factors, fundamental connection anonymity functions and objectives. The framework aims to provide for a more structured and formal view of current <b>anonymising</b> strategies and techniques. It should thereby set the stage for further advances in connection anonymity...|$|R

2500|$|In early 2008, it was {{announced}} that the ISP arm of Virgin Media had entered into a contract (along with BT and TalkTalk) with the former spyware company Phorm (responsible under their 121Media guise for the Apropos rootkit) to intercept and analyse their users' click-stream data, and sell the <b>anonymised</b> aggregate information as part of Phorm's OIX advertising service. The practice, which has become known as [...] "data pimping", came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested parties who believe that the interception of data is illegal under UK law (RIPA). At a more fundamental level, many have argued that the ISPs and Phorm have no right to sell a commodity (a user's data) to which they have no claim of ownership.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ballot {{stuffing}} is {{the process}} of illegitimately creating a good reputation and requires a number of colluding fraudsters. With the use of an <b>anonymising</b> network, a single user could pose as many separate users and possibly implement the ballot stuffing scheme without the complexities of managing multiple fraudsters. In this paper we propose a framework that deals with thwarting ballot stuffing within the context of <b>anonymising</b> networks. The framework proposed depends on the ability to look up a single user’s physical location with a fair degree of certainty. With this mechanism in place, the framework is able to compare the locations of all users involved in a transaction. If the coordinates are within close proximity to one another (this is unlikely in a global trading system) then the transaction is tagged accordingly. The framework proposed does not necessarily apply to only thwarting ballot stuffing schemes, we discuss the fundamental problem of using <b>anonymising</b> networks to commit ballot stuffing and analyse another scheme (ticket scalping) that may be thwarted with this framework. ...|$|R

The Ars Technica reviewer did not like that the telephone’s performance is mediocre, noting that using a custom OS means no Google Play {{or any of the}} other benefits of the Google ecosystem, spotty support for sideloaded apps, and reliance on Amazon or other third-party app stores.|$|R

This discussion of the practical and ethical details of <b>anonymising</b> is designed to add to the largely theoretical literature on this topic and to be of illustrative use to other researchers confronting similar dilemmas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Anonymity {{has been}} {{regarded}} mainly as anonymity {{of the person}} who did something. We believe that the anonymity of the subject may not be a primary concern and the more important part would be the fact that the subject did some deed. We focus on the relationship of the subject and the deed. Another argument we raise here is the need of quantitative measures for the anonymity. Anonymity has been dealt only as a quality, but we need to quantise the quality to measure and compare <b>anonymising</b> mechanisms. We provide a metric, we call it anonymity metric, in order to measure the anonymity of mechanisms. As a typical example for <b>anonymising</b> mechanisms, we consider electronic voting schemes. Secret ballot definitely needs not to expose relationship between voter and his ballot. On this basis, most electronic voting schemes have been designed to keep anonymity of voters and nontraceability of ballots. We apply the anonymity metric to anonymous mechanisms in voting schemes and present metric computations. ...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of anonymity in this privacy preserving collaborative filtering technique, {{there is also a}} consensus on identifiability if there is a pressing need. In both the case of NAT and the case of pseudonyms, this identifiability can be obtained through information that the NAT administrator or pseudonymous group membership issuers provide. The process is not straightforward and requires offline intervention by administrators. Hence, the support for identifiability does not nullify the ability to <b>anonymise</b> the data.|$|R
