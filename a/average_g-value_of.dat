40|$|As {{overheating}} {{problems in}} glassy buildings came up more and more, EMPA put {{a focus on}} the determination and modelling of the total solar energy transmittance (TSET) of multiple glazing combined with different shading systems within the framework of IEA Task 27 "Performance, durability and sustainability of solar façade components". Experimental data were produced by a calorimetric outdoor test facility near Zurich (Switzerland). In a first stage, average constant TSET values related to the incident global solar radiation were identified for a various configurations and a measuring period of a few days each. As expected the results strongly depend on the slat tilt angle {{as well as on the}} solar reflectance of the slat surface. Naturally the solar transmittance of an angle-selective component like a Venetian blind also depends on the directional distribution of the incident radiation, in particular on the sun elevation projected into the plane perpendicular to the slat rotation axis. Therefore, results from different measuring periods of the identical shading-glazing configuration are compared, and an extension <b>of</b> the usual <b>average</b> <b>g-value</b> identification is shown. The experimental results are also compared with weighted <b>average</b> <b>g-values</b> from numerical modeling, which is based on a view factor method extended for circular slats in a louver type shading device.

40|$|We {{report the}} kinetic {{analysis}} of free radicals on fungal spores of Penicillium digitatum interacted with atomic oxygen generated plasma electric discharge using real time in situ {{electron spin resonance}} (ESR) measurements. We have obtained information that the ESR signal from the spores was observed and preliminarily assignable to semiquinone radical with a <b>g-value</b> <b>of</b> around 2. 004 and a line width of approximately 5 G. The decay of the signal is possibly linked to the inactivation of the fungal spore. The real-time in situ ESR {{has proven to be}} a useful method to elucidate plasma-induced surface reactions on biological specimens. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
