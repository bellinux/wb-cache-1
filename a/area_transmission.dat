50|$|Wide <b>area</b> <b>transmission</b> can {{be viewed}} as a {{horizontal}} extension of the smart grid. In a paradigm shift, the distinction between transmission and distribution blurs with the integration as energy flow becomes bidirectional. For example, distribution grids in rural areas might generate more energy than they use, turning the local smart grid into a virtual power plant, or a city's fleet of one million electric vehicles could be used to trim peaks in transmission supply by integrating them to the smart grid using vehicle to grid technology.|$|E
50|$|The {{price of}} {{electric}} power station capacity is high, and electric demand is variable, {{so it is}} often cheaper to import some portion of the needed power than to generate it locally.

Because of the economic benefits of load sharing between regions, wide <b>area</b> <b>transmission</b> grids now span countries and even continents.

In the European SuperSmart Grid proposal and the US Unified Smart Grid concept, such super grids have intelligence features in the wide <b>area</b> <b>transmission</b> layer which integrate the local smart grids into a single wide area super grid.

50|$|To some critics, {{such a wide}} <b>area</b> <b>transmission</b> {{layer is}} not novel; {{they point out that}} the {{technology}} has little difference from that used for regional and national power transmission networks. Proponents respond that beyond the qualitative smart grid features that allow instantaneous coordination and balancing of intermittent power sources across international boundaries, the quantitative comprehensiveness has a quality all its own. The claim is made that super grids open up markets.In the same way that freeways revolutionized interstate transport and the internet revolutionized online commerce when comprehensive high capacity networks were built, it is argued that a high capacity super grid must be built in order to provide a distribution network so comprehensive and with such available capacity that energy trading is only limited by how much electricity entrepreneurs can bring to market.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of IPTp in two areas with different malaria transmission intensities. METHODS: Prospective observational study recruiting pregnant women in two health facilities in areas with high and low malaria transmission intensities. A structured questionnaire was used for interview. Maternal clinic cards and medical logs were assessed to determine drug intake. Placental parasitaemia was screened using both light microscopy and real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Of 350 pregnant women were recruited and screened for placental parasitaemia, 175 from each area. Prevalence of placental parasitaemia was 16. 6 % (CI 11. 4 - 22. 9) in the high <b>transmission</b> <b>area</b> and 2. 3 % (CI 0. 6 - 5. 7) in the low <b>transmission</b> <b>area.</b> Being primigravida and residing in a high <b>transmission</b> <b>area</b> were significant risk factors for placental malaria (OR 2. 4; CI 1. 1 - 5. 0; P =  0. 025) and (OR 9. 4; CI 3. 2 - 27. 7; P <  0. 001), respectively. IPTp {{was associated with a}} lower risk of placental malaria (OR 0. 3; CI 0. 1 - 1. 0; P =  0. 044); the effect was more pronounced in the high <b>transmission</b> <b>area</b> (OR 0. 2; CI 0. 06 - 0. 7; P =  0. 015) than in the low <b>transmission</b> <b>area</b> (OR 0. 4; CI 0. 04 - 4. 5; P =  0. 478). IPTp use was not associated with reduced risk of maternal anaemia or low birthweight, regardless of transmission intensity. The number needed to treat (NNT) was four (CI 2 - 6) women in the high <b>transmission</b> <b>area</b> and 33 (20 - 50) in the low <b>transmission</b> <b>area</b> to prevent one case of placental malaria. CONCLUSION: IPTp may have an effect on lowering the risk of placental malaria in <b>areas</b> of high <b>transmission,</b> but this effect did not translate into a benefit on risks of maternal anaemia or low birthweight. The NNT needs to be considered, and weighted against that of other protective measures, eventually targeting areas which are above a certain threshold of malaria transmission to maximise the benefit...|$|R
40|$|Cytophilic {{immunoglobulin}} (IgG) subclass responses (IgG 1 and IgG 3) to Plasmodium falciparum antigens {{have been}} associated with protection from malaria, yet the relative importance of transmission intensity and age in generation of subclass responses to pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage antigens have not been clearly defined. We analyzed IgG subclass responses to the pre-erythrocytic antigens CSP, LSA- 1, and TRAP and the blood-stage antigens AMA- 1, EBA- 175, and MSP- 1 in asymptomatic residents age 2 years or older in stable (n= 116) and unstable (n= 96) <b>transmission</b> <b>areas</b> in Western Kenya. In the area of stable malaria transmission, a high prevalence of cytophilic (IgG 1 and IgG 3) antibodies to each antigen was seen in all age groups. Prevalence and levels of cytophilic antibodies to pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage P. falciparum antigens increased with age in the unstable <b>transmission</b> <b>area,</b> yet IgG 1 and IgG 3 responses to most antigens for all ages in the unstable <b>transmission</b> <b>area</b> were less prevalent and lower in magnitude than even the youngest age group from the stable <b>transmission</b> <b>area.</b> The dominance of cytophilic responses over non-cytophilic (IgG 2 and IgG 4) was more pronounced in the stable <b>transmission</b> <b>area,</b> and the ratio of IgG 3 over IgG 1 generally increased with age. In the unstable <b>transmission</b> <b>area,</b> the ratio of cytophilic to non-cytophilic antibodies did not increase with age, and tended to be IgG 3 -biased for pre-erythrocytic antigens yet IgG 1 -biased for blood-stage antigens. The differences between areas could not be attributed to active parasitemia status, as there were minimal differences in antibody responses between those positive and negative for Plasmodium infection by microscopy in the stable <b>transmission</b> <b>area.</b> Individuals in <b>areas</b> of unstable <b>transmission</b> have low cytophilic to non-cytophilic IgG subclass ratios and low IgG 3 :IgG 1 ratios to P. falciparum antigens.
