Are you still awake?” at 3:00.

500|$|Biko {{developed}} SASO's {{ideology of}} [...] "Black Consciousness" [...] {{in conversation with}} other black student leaders. A SASO policy manifesto produced in July 1971 defined this ideology as [...] "an attitude of mind, a way of life. The basic tenet of Black Consciousness is that the Blackman must reject all value systems that seek {{to make him a}} foreigner in the country of his birth and reduce his basic human dignity." [...] Black Consciousness centred on psychological empowerment, through combating the feelings of inferiority that most black South Africans exhibited. Biko believed that, as part of the struggle against apartheid and white-minority rule, blacks should affirm their own humanity by regarding themselves as worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities. It applied the term [...] "black" [...] not only to Bantu-speaking Africans, but also to Indians and Coloureds. SASO adopted this term over [...] "non-white" [...] because its leadership felt that defining themselves in opposition to white people was not a positive self-description. Biko promoted the slogan [...] "black is beautiful", explaining that this meant [...] "Man, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>okay</b> as <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Begin to look upon yourself as a human being." ...|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes the baiting went both ways. As {{depicted}} in the documentary Giuliani Time, Parkinson's disease patient John Hynes called Giuliani's show in January 2000 to complain about being cut off from Medicaid after paying more than $100,000 of taxes in his life before he was disabled with the disease. Hynes accused the New York City Human Resources Administration of repeatedly opening fraud investigations on him, then dropping the case for lack of evidence, only to re-open it. Hynes told Giuliani, [...] "The biggest thing you could do to reduce crime would be to resign, sir. Crime would drop like a rock if you resigned. You're the biggest criminal in the city." [...] Giuliani responded, [...] "What kind of little hole are you in there, John? It sounds like {{you are in a}} little hole. JOHN! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>okay</b> there? You're breathing funny." [...] Hynes replied: [...] "No, I'm not okay. I'm sick, and you cut me off my food stamps and Medicaid several times; but I suppose you don't give a damn about that either." [...] Giuliani replied, [...] "There's something really wrong with you there, John. I can hear it in your voice.... Now, why don't you stay on the line. We'll take your name and your number and we'll send you psychiatric help, 'cause you seriously need it." [...] After Hynes hung up, Giuliani continued, [...] "Man! Look, it's a big city, and you get some real weirdos who hang out in this city, and that's what I was worried about on, uh, New Year's Eve. I wasn't, you know - I figured, the terrorist groups and all that we could keep under control - worried, but who knows what, what's living in some cave somewhere. So, uh, and John called up. John calls up from Queens, but who knows where he's from." [...] Hynes subsequently said, [...] "Mr. Giuliani showed a total lack of respect for all disabled people when he mocked me after I revealed that I was sick." ...|$|E

In this paper, I explore the relationship between vulnerability and meaningful human connection, via sources such as Brene Brown, Alphonso Lingis, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and John Berger. I also explore the relationship that sensitivity and tenderness, both qualities of and tools for approaching vulnerability, have to connection and touch. I explore other forms of touch - the touch of sight and the touch of words. Then, I illustrate these themes through both the work of other artists, {{as well as my}} own, including my master’s thesis exhibitions, The Better Choice and I Love You <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Okay,</b> 2017...|$|E

[...] DVD Talk's Chris Tribbey [...] "definitely recommended" [...] this [...] "great title from a well-loved franchise," [...] adding: [...] "When ADV gives one of its titles 'Essential Anime' status, they do it for a reason." [...] Adam Arnold from Animefringe rated it a B+, opining that [...] "great characters and fun situations make for an unforgettable viewing experience;" [...] Megan Lavey of Mania.com too gave it a B+. Mania.com's Luis Cruz offered a more moderate praise and a score of B, writing: [...] "Slayers is certainly a franchise worthy of the 'Essential' moniker. The first motion picture provides a good introduction to the main character of the series and to the humor and action you will find in it." [...] The Anime Review too graded it a B. Among some more critical reviews, Marc Marshall of AAW gave it three-and-half stars out of five, stating that [...] "although the mix of weirdness and relatively serious fantasy isn't for everybody, it's quality entertainment if you're in the right mood." ...|$|R
