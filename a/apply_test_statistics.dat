40|$|The most {{frequently}} <b>applied</b> <b>test</b> <b>statistics</b> for a unit root are the Dickey-Fuller tests, which are built into many econometric packages along with MacKinnon's empirical response functions. This article provides empirical response functions for some easy to compute alternative <b>test</b> <b>statistics</b> that are generally {{much more powerful}} than the Dickey-Fuller tests; specifically, these are the Dickey-Fuller tests and the weighted symmetric versions of the and tests. The empirical response functions presented here take into account adjustments for lag length in the maintained regression, and also extend the design of the simulation experiments compared to previous work. A second aspect of this study concerns the widespread practice in applied econometrics of using more than one test for the same feature without an assessment of the implications for the cumulative significance level and probability of test conflict. Tests for a unit root being are a leading example of this practice. Using the extended set of unit root tests considered here, the extent of test dependence is simulated and overall type one error calculated. Two empirical applications illustrate the key principles. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{assessing}} {{a treatment}} {{effect in the}} presence of confounders, we often employ stratified analysis and obtain a summary estimate of the risk difference (RD) under the assumption that the underlying RD is homogeneous across strata. In a randomized clinical trial (RCT), we may commonly come across the data in which there are patients who do not comply with their assigned treatments. Thus, to avoid reaching a misleading conclusion due to overlooking an interaction between treatments and strata, {{it is important that we}} can incorporate noncompliance into examining the homogeneity of the RD. In this paper, we develop four <b>statistics</b> for <b>testing</b> the homogeneity of the RD in a stratified RCT with noncompliance. These include the test statistic derived from the weighted-least-squares (WLS) method, the test statistic using the WLS method and tanh- 1 (x) transformation, the test statistic using the weight similar to the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) estimator, and the test statistic using an optimal weight and the MH point estimator. We apply Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of these <b>test</b> <b>statistics</b> with respect to Type I error and power in a variety of situations.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the asymptotic {{properties of the}} integrated periodogram calculated from a sequence of indicator functions of dependent extremal events. An event in Euclidean space is extreme if it occurs {{far away from the}} origin. We use a regular variation condition on the underlying stationary sequence to make these notions precise. Our main result is a functional central limit theorem for the integrated periodogram of the indicator functions of dependent extremal events. The limiting process is a continuous Gaussian process whose covari- ance structure is in general unfamiliar, but in the iid case a Brownian bridge appears. In the general case, we propose a stationary bootstrap procedure for approximating the distribution of the limiting process. The developed theory can be used to construct classical goodness-of-fit tests such as the Grenander- Rosenblatt and Cramér-von Mises tests which are based only on the extremes in the sample.

We consider linear structural models with possibly non-Gaussian errors, where structural parameters may not be identified and where reduced forms can be incompletely specified (or nonparametric). On level control, we characterize the null distributions of all the <b>test</b> <b>statistics.</b> Through conditioning and invariance arguments, we show that these distributions do not involve nuisance parameters. In particular, this <b>applies</b> to several <b>test</b> <b>statistics</b> for which no finite-sample distributional theory is yet available, such as the standard statistic proposed by Hausman (1978). The distributions of the <b>test</b> <b>statistics</b> may be non-standard [...] so corrections to usual asymptotic critical values are needed [...] but the characterizations are sufficiently explicit to yield finite-sample (Monte-Carlo) tests of the exogeneity hypothesis. The procedures so obtained are robust to weak identification, missing instruments or misspecified reduced forms, and can easily be adapted to allow for parametric non-Gaussian error distributions. We give a general invariance result (block triangular invariance) for exogeneity <b>test</b> <b>statistics.</b> This property yields a convenient exogeneity canonical form and a parsimonious reduction of the parameters on which power depends. In the extreme case where no structural parameter is identified, the distributions under the alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis are identical, so the power function is flat, for all the exogeneity statistics.

40|$|Abstract: Canonical {{correlation}} analysis {{has been widely}} used in the literature to identify the underlying structure of a multivariate linear time series. Most of the studies assume that the innovations to the multivariate system are Gaussian. On the other hand, there are many applications in which the normality assumption is either questionable or clearly inadequate. For example, most empirical time series in business and nance exhibit conditional heteroscedasticity and have high excess kurtosis. In this paper, we establish some asymptotic results for canonical corre-lation analysis of multivariate linear time series when the data possess conditional heteroscedasticity. We show that for correct identication of a multivariate time series model, {{it is essential to}} use a modication, which we prescribe, to a commonly used test statistic for testing zero canonical correlations.
