50|$|Roger Agache (August 16, 1926 - September 17, 2011) was a French archaeologist. He {{was among}} the first to take part in aerial {{archaeology}} in France, and helped to develop a methodology for <b>aerial</b> <b>prospecting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Agache {{was born}} in Amiens, Picardy and died in Abbeville, Picardy. Agache earned PhD in art history and archeology. His {{doctoral}} thesis was Atlas d'Archéologie aérienne de Picardie, 1975; La Somme préromaine et romaine, d'après les prospections aériennes à basse altitude (The Pre-Roman and Roman Somme, Based on Low-Altitude <b>Aerial</b> <b>Prospecting),</b> completed in 1978.|$|E
5000|$|Because of Sgùrr na Càrnach’s central {{position}} of the three Munros which make up the Five Sisters of Kintail it is invariably approached along the ridge from either Sgùrr Fhuraran or Sgùrr na Ciste Duibhe as walkers complete the full Five Sisters ridge walk. A direct ascent is possible, as mentioned, up the north west ridge. The best starting place for this direct ascent is Achnangart Farm (grid reference [...] ) where there is parking space in an old quarry, a direct ascent up the hillside should not be attempted as there are steep crags higher up. The walker should walk 1.5 km north {{to the base of}} the NW ridge and ascend steeply but safely from there. The most common ascent starts further up the Glen (...) and climbs to the Bealach na Lapain before crossing Sgùrr na Ciste Duibhe to reach Sgùrr na Càrnach. The view from the top of the mountain gives a fine end on view of Loch Duich to the north and an <b>aerial</b> <b>prospect</b> down into Coire Domhain to the east.|$|R
50|$|Tavani was {{established}} in the summer of 1928 by Dominion Explorers Limited, a mineral exploration company, who used it as an <b>aerial</b> base for <b>prospecting</b> activity along the Hudson Bay coastline. Guy Blanchet, party leader, overwintered at the base in 1928/1929. Dominion Explorers sold the buildings to the Hudson's Bay Company in the fall of 1929, moving its aerial base to Baker Lake and other areas of the north.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{the same}} {{technique}} {{has been used}} in the same Porrey neighborhood with more precise tools, like theodolites and GPS. In fact, <b>aerial</b> and electromagnetic <b>prospecting</b> is made impossible by the vegetation that reforested the mountain since the end of grazing and the excavations of Joseph Déchelette {{and the nature of the}} subsoil. One costly but faster technique, tested in 2007, is LIDAR, the use of airborne laser scanners, which are unhindered by the vegetation and can recreate in minutes what usually takes weeks to do on the ground. This will be done in order to attempt to make a complete map of the city and to archive the topography of the location.|$|R
50|$|Prospecting for uranium {{had just}} become popular and, because the {{government}} had guaranteed to buyany uranium found, at an attractive price. Vast areas of the U.S. had never been explored for uranium, and a few lucky individuals became rich by finding ores with simply a geiger counter. Cook saw <b>aerial</b> <b>prospecting</b> as a new field of Geophysics, which needed analysis, so this became his thesis topic. How fast must the detector operate? How high and how fast could one fly? How small could a deposit of ore be and still be detected? How badly would the geophysical anomaly be smeared and weakened by overburden and by the air? How serious is the interference from cosmic rays and background radioactivity? Cook was soon able to answer most of these questions with elaborate calculations based on library studies. However {{it was necessary to}} check and verify the calculations by model and full-scale experiments, insofar as this was possible.|$|E
40|$|Especially in archaeology, {{a mission}} of the {{surveyor}} is to acquire and to work on data generated by an experimentation field, i. e. to locate natural elements or human constructions, and to represent them (analogically or digitally). Surveying work has {{always been part of}} field archaeology, because the knowledge and expertise of the surveyor can be as useful for the prospecting stage as for the excavation. However surveying practices carried out in archaeology could change, and the surveyor could be proved helpful for the use of excavated data too. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarize how topographical techniques are used by the archaeologists, and to present the evolution and potential of computer developments, especially regarding data management. Historically, a number of cartographic tasks in archaeology was taking care of by the surveyor, e. g. cartography of excavation fields, absolute positioning of distinct sites, <b>aerial</b> <b>prospecting,</b> study of old maps and archive images, levelling, etc. Today, the archaeologist makes more and more the field surveys himself, however the role of the surveyor could change in the future. He will be able to help the archaeologist in his data exploitation work as well. The new expertises of the surveyor, e. g. Databases and Geographic Information System (GIS), allow him to handle different kinds of data efficiently. These knowledge should be interesting for the archaeologist, both in simplifying data management and in developing novel techniques for presenting the resources. Moreover, to have an overview of all dat...|$|E
40|$|Huinay is a {{territory}} covering about 34, 000 hectares in the Commune of Hualaihué (Xth region of Chile) and {{belonging to the}} San Ignacio del Huinay Foundation (HF). Its location (42 ° 22 ´ S; 72 ° 24 ´ W) corresponds to the bio-geographical Province of Magallanes and specifi cally to an area which is highly representative of the continental Northern Patagonia. Based on an <b>aerial</b> <b>prospecting</b> conducted during 2008, we identifi ed more than 30 water bodies of different size and morphology, occurring at different heights and in different landscapes. Among these, 16 water bodies were selected to be studied {{at the end of}} the summer, in February 2009. In each water body, longitudinal and transversal bathymetric profi les were generated from echo-sound data. Vertical profi les of some physical and chemical variables (temperature, oxygen concentration, pH, conductivity and chlorophyll-a concentration) were measured, from surface to bottom, at the deepest section of the lakes using a multiparameter probe model YSI 6920 V 2. Furthermore, water samples were collected at different depths for further chemical analysis ex situ. Qualitative (bottom-surface) and integrated (40 - 0 m) zooplankton and phytoplankton samples were then collected with appropriate plankton nets. Water transparency was measured as Secchi Depth. The results of this study are considered of bio-geographic importance for the Chilean territory given that both Huinay and the bordering territories completely lack of any limnological information. Eventually, data from the lakes of Huinay, will allow us to contrast various hypotheses about the distribution of plankton assemblages and species richness formerly reported to change according to latitude increases along the Chilean territory and the Patagonian area specifically...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} the recent research conducted at Hierapolis in Phrygia {{for the creation}} of the digital archaeological map of the city and surrounding necropolises, which is linked to a GIS. These activities have focused on updating the map with new data from systematic archaeological and topographical surveys, geophysical <b>prospecting,</b> <b>aerial</b> and satellite remote sensing, and from studies regarding the hydrogeology, geomorphology and seismic and tectonic characteristics of the site. In some cases, 3 D reconstructions and virtual restorations of monuments are based on the data from this inter/multidisciplinary research on the ancient city. In fact, for several years now a project called Virtual Hierapolis has been in progress and has resulted in the production of 3 D models of many monuments in the city, using data from stratigraphic excavations, archaeological and geophysical surveys, and art-historical studies. An example in this regard is the recent reconstructive study of the so-called South Bridge, a monumental viaduct/aqueduct-bridge, probably built in the first century AD, the remains of which are in a deep gorge to the South of the archaeological site. The survey and mapping of the monument, using differential GPS and robotic and motorized total station, have made it possible to obtain a detailed study and the production of 2 D and 3 D reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} the main {{results of the}} geophysical survey of ancient Epomanduodurum, at Mandeure-Mathay, Eastern France. In northeastern Gaul, Epomanduodurum is a site of a major scientific interest for the understanding of past settlements and territorial formation {{at the end of}} the Iron Age and during the Roman period. The site, including a Roman urban centre and two suburbs containing workshops, occupies more than 500 ha inside and beyond a meander of the River Doubs. From the beginning of survey in 2001, several methods (fast electrical imaging automatic resistivity profiling system, ground penetrating radar, magnetic and electromagnetic mapping) have been performed on a large scale in order to precisely identify the vast extent and structure of the Roman town. The interpretation of the geophysical data was carried out using a combination of different data sources, including ancient maps and excavations recently conducted on restricted areas. The overall organization of an artisan quarter of 8 ha was revealed along a main Roman road leading to the left bank of the River Doubs. On the other bank, a river fortification and a vast monumental religious complex were recognized in the southern part of the Roman town. The geophysical imaging shows that the sacred area includes several temples or groups of temples radiating from the theatre. Other new buried structures probably corresponding to annexes, chapels and altars were also detected within this sacred area of 10 ha bound on three sides by a wall enclosure with monumental passages. In a surveyed area of 70 ha, geophysical prospecting techniques provided a clear overall image of the Roman urbanism revealed through a rectangular road network and street system delimiting insulae of variable sizes. The detection along the River Doubs of buildings similar to storehouses attests to fluvial transport and also suggests the likely existence of a port. More generally, the combination on a large scale of geophysical <b>prospecting,</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs and excavations allowed a new plan of the urban structure of the ancient town of Epomanduodurum to be produced for an area of over 300 ha...|$|R
