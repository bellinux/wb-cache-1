5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the Republican {{candidate}} for governor. Willson's opponent had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced the Democrats to hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 senatorial election {{while he was still}} serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence the selection of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he <b>assured</b> <b>the</b> selection of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E

The film was eventually suspended in May 2013 after the announcement that the show would return as a limited series.|$|E

5|$|John and Manuel pursued active {{military}} policies, {{and both}} deployed considerable resources on sieges and on city defences; aggressive fortification policies {{were at the}} heart of their imperial military policies. Despite the defeat at Myriokephalon, the policies of Alexios, John and Manuel resulted in vast territorial gains, increased frontier stability in Asia Minor, and secured the stabilisation of the Empire's European frontiers. From c. 1081 to c. 1180, the Komnenian army <b>assured</b> <b>the</b> Empire's security, enabling Byzantine civilisation to flourish.|$|E

Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{years after}} their defeat, with Roman {{dominance}} of the area looking <b>assured,</b> <b>the</b> Samnites rose again and defeated a Roman army in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War.

5|$|After {{having been}} {{temporarily}} incapacitated by several severe health problems, President Dwight D. Eisenhower attempted to clarify procedures through a signed agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon, drafted by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr.. However, this agreement {{did not have}} legal authority. Eisenhower {{suffered a heart attack}} in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each time until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and <b>assured</b> <b>the</b> public that the situation was under control. However, Nixon never made any effort to formally assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E
5|$|After swiftly {{recovering}} from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their mastery of the whole of Italy {{was by no means}} <b>assured.</b> <b>The</b> Samnites were a people just as martial and as rich as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along the course and {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be <b>assured.</b> <b>The</b> course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E

Too weak to stand, he was held upright by two men while the noose was tied around his neck. At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow while 5,000 spectators watched his execution. It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history. Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial. The two bodies were placed in an embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested. They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in Bloomfield, Kentucky. The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{attempted}} to gain wider {{support for the}} cooperation schemes already in place and extend their scope in Sector West. Fischer also <b>assured</b> <b>the</b> local authorities of the RSK that {{such a move would}} prevent renewed fighting in the area. The result of Fischer's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement. The agreement, signed in Daruvar on 18 February, encompassed the reconstruction of water and electrical power supply networks, the reopening of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway section in Sector West for non-commercial traffic, the facilitation of the Novska–Nova Gradiška railway, the repair of telecommunication lines, the establishment of a joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West, the return of all refugees to their homes, the access to property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line, and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation.|$|E
5|$|In 1274 Pope Gregory X convened the Second Council of Lyon.

Abaqa's Latin secretary Rychaldus delivered {{a report to the}} Council which outlined previous European-Ilkhanid relations under Abaqa's father, Hulagu, affirming that after Hulagu had welcomed Christian ambassadors to his court, he had agreed to exempt Latin Christians from taxes and charges, in exchange for their prayers for the Khan. According to Rychaldus, Hulagu had also prohibited the molestation of Frank establishments, and had committed to return Jerusalem to the Franks. Rychaldus <b>assured</b> <b>the</b> assembly that even after Hulagu's death, his son Abaqa was still determined to drive the Mamluks from Syria.|$|E
