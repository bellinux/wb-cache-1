5000|$|Besides {{the regular}} cash registers, extra has {{launched}} Self scanning terminals in 2007. At four terminals, customers scan their purchases themselves {{and put them}} into a plastic bag. The weight of the commodities is scanned to avoid fraud. A sale assistant controls the operations on a computer. If there is a customer who wants to buy alcohol or cigarettes, the assistant controls the age of the person. An <b>alarm</b> <b>fuse</b> should stop thieves. After the sale of extra, these terminals disappear from the markets and are replaced by [...] "normal" [...] registration casses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Today, {{a variety}} of {{intrusion}} detection systems based on {{a variety of}} techniques and data sources exists. The alarms generated by these sensors need to be managed efficiently to generate an appropriate amount of alerts. This could be accomplished by <b>fusing</b> <b>alarms</b> from multiple sensors to report an attack only once, correlate alarms {{to reduce the number of}} false alarms and aggregate alarms to present attack scenarios. This paper proposes a method for reasoning about intrusion attacks by associating beliefs with each type of alarm and analyzing combinations of alarms by using Subjective logic. The advantage of this approach is that different types of alarms easily can be combined together to enhance the accuracy and trustworthiness of the results and allowing evidence coming from less reliable sources to be discounted accordingly. 1...|$|R
40|$|High Voltage Shunt Capacitor Banks (HV-SCBs) are {{critical}} substation assets that are primarily {{used to improve}} power factor and thus power transmission capability. Over temperature, over voltages, manufacturing defects can cause internal failures of capacitor elements. With todayâ€™s sensitive protection available in numerical relays these failures will be detected and SCBs will {{be taken out of}} service. But determining the phase and section in which capacitor elements have failed is important for utilities to decrease downtime of SCBs. This thesis proposes methods to address the challenges in fault location of SCBs. The proposed methods apply calibrating factors that compensate for pre-existing inherent unbalances, and system voltage unbalances. They can mitigate the gradual capacitance change due to temperature effects or natural aging. The presented fault location methods are further enhanced to detect the number of failed elements. The proposed methods can be integrated into common unbalance protection of the multi-functional numerical SCB relays and put forth solutions to condition monitoring of SCBs. Advance maintenance <b>alarms</b> for <b>fuse</b> saving in externally-fused SCBs, and reducing the search space for the faulty cans with fuseless or internally-fused designs are the significant outcomes of the proposed methods. The proposed methods are simulated in a relay modeled in MATLAB and the voltages/currents are played back from COMTRADE records of PSCAD electromagnetics transient simulations. Detecting consecutive failures, ambiguous failures, and delivering the number of failed elements for each alarm in fault reports are valuable to the utility community and have been verified for the proposed methods...|$|R
