50|$|On 1 October 1992, the {{original}} version of Cartoon Network was launched <b>at</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center,</b> Atlanta, USA. The channel was created in response of Turner Entertainment acquiring MGM's Cartoon and Film library in 1986 and the acquisition of the Hanna-Barbera animation studio and cartoon library in 1991.

At launch in the United States, Cartoon Network had an 8,500 hour cartoon library, and it became the first channel dedicated to cartoons. Six months after the launch, Cartoon Network expanded into foreign markets by launching a Latin American version of the channel dubbed in both Spanish, Portuguese and English. Cartoon Network's large animation library was in high demand in Western Europe and {{as a response to}} consumer demand, Astra 1C, the satellite on which Cartoon Network broadcast on, was launched on 12 May 1993 onboard an Ariane 42L rocket from Kourou, French Guiana.

50|$|The WWF {{version of}} the show {{received}} much lower Nielsen ratings than its NWA-associated forerunner.

Jim Crockett Promotions took over production of the TV show using the same set.. In time, the show was renamed WCW Saturday Night, reflecting an overhauled look and a new home studio-arena <b>at</b> the <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> In 2001, the WWF gained the rights to Crockett's library of GCW/WCW/NWA matches and shows, augmenting the WWE Tape Library through its purchase of assets and trademarks belonging to the now-defunct WCW (now a legal entity called WCW, Inc.).|$|R
