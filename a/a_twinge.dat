5|$|His {{first and}} only major league {{appearance}} came against the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 September 1982. The first two batters he faced were Paul Molitor and Robin Yount, both future Hall of Famers, {{one of only a}} few players in history to do so. Partway through the first inning, he felt <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> in his shoulder; not wanting to leave his first game early, he pitched through it, and allowed five runs in the first. Partway through the third, after three more runs allowed, Wever was taken out of the game. He pitched for 2⅔ innings and had eight earned runs, two strikeouts, and three wild pitches. Entering the 1983 season, Wever was projected to be the fifth starter in the Yankees' starting rotation. Because of continued pain in his shoulder, he instead spent the season with the AAA Columbus Clippers, where he went 14 with a 9.78 ERA in seven appearances.|$|E
500|$|Before the film's release, reporters {{speculated that}} it would have a {{difficult}} run due to competition from DreamWorks' Shrek (a wholly CGI feature) and [...] (an action-adventure film from Paramount Pictures). Regarding the market's shift from traditional animation and competition with CGI films, Kirk Wise said, [...] "Any traditional animator, including myself, can't help but feel <b>a</b> <b>twinge.</b> I think it always comes down to story and character, and one form won't replace the other. Just like photography didn't replace painting. But maybe I'm blind to it." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly noted that CGI films (such as Shrek) were more likely to attract the teenage demographic typically not interested in animation, and called Atlantis a [...] "marketing and creative gamble".|$|E
500|$|Sepinwall {{noted that}} he could see [...] "the obvious {{parallels}} to Michael's personal situation" [...] in this installment, while The A.V. Club editor Zack Handlen said that Awake [...] "continues to connect routine procedural storylines and find new ways to give them deeper meaning". Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman said that this episode was about [...] "bringing two people who have drifted apart back together" [...] and that [...] "Nightswimming" [...] has [...] "balanced the series' larger mystery with grief and <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of optimism" [...] on a [...] "smaller scale" [...] compared to other entries of the program. He claimed that the installment was designed to [...] "introduce us to what makes Hannah and Michael so special", adding that [...] "For most of the series, there hasn't been much chemistry between the two".|$|E

500|$|Hartman first {{performed}} his Clinton {{impression on}} {{an episode of}} The Tonight Show. When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess I owe you a few apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes [...] <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of guilt about [...] ". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in his voice, {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant Magazine, Alexa Camp {{said the}} music video {{faithfully}} mirrored the song's lyrics and was understated by Del Rey's usual standards. Darwin who opined that the clip recalled Del Rey's short film Tropico (2013), deemed it [...] "a total cinematic gem," [...] and [...] "a gorgeous mashup of retro glamour and modern independence". The visual was also lauded by Complex writer Lauren Nostro who {{called it a}} [...] "stunning, cinematic" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] video, and Anna Moslein of Glamour who deemed it [...] "summer-perfect". Zumic's Bradley Bershad described the clip as [...] "a slightly bizarre, very dramatic trip through time and space" [...] and said its noir influences matched the track well, adding that its [...] "old school meets new school" [...] feel continued the musical persona Del Rey had crafted for herself. Bershad's view was shared by Smith who wrote, [...] "It pretty well marries together her continuing play with female sexuality, Hollywood stereotypes and insistence that she is her own creation". While DeGroot commended the video's black-and-white photography and flame imagery which he opined were less pretentious than that of [...] "Jeremy", which [...] "West Coast" [...] was compared to. Matthew Bramlett of TheWrap opined that Del Rey [...] "perfectly encapsulates her 'vintage California rich kid' look" [...] in the video and described the clip as [...] "very chic, with just <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of the old Hollywood flair" [...] the singer had embraced in her previous visuals. In a mixed review, Patrick D. McDermott of The Fader called the visual [...] "classic, kind of sad [...] in romantic black and white", but felt it was confusing and [...] "on-brand...a meticulous homage to nothing in particular". While Nelson wrote that the clip failed to enhance the song, but was understated enough not to detract from the music.|$|E

2500|$|Scyphozoan {{jellyfish}} stings {{range from}} <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> to tingling to agony. Most jellyfish stings are not deadly, but stings of some {{species of the}} class Cubozoa [...] (box jellyfish), such as the famous and especially toxic Irukandji jellyfish, can be deadly. Stings may cause anaphylaxis, which can be fatal. Medical care may include administration of an antivenom.|$|E
2500|$|Like Schaffner, Beatles author Robert Rodriguez notes A's folly in {{missing out}} on Harrison's [...] "strongest {{collection}} in years and possibly most commercial ever". Rodriguez describes [...] "Learning How to Love You" [...] as [...] "perhaps Harrison's finest pure love song since 'Something'" [...] and ranks his acoustic-guitar solo among [...] "this ex-Fab's Top 5 all-time instrumental interludes". Simon Leng views the composition as one of Harrison's best love songs from the whole of his career and admires the recording as [...] "usically, lyrically, and vocally polished" [...] with a [...] "beautifully flowing" [...] mid-song solo. Leng suggests that Harrison's former bandmate Paul McCartney [...] "might have experienced <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of envy" [...] when listening to the song. Having interviewed Harrison for Guitar World magazine in 1987, Rip Rense has since praised the guitar solo, along with those on tracks such as [...] "The Light That Has Lighted the World" [...] and the Beatles' [...] "Fixing a Hole", as examples of how Harrison's playing displays [...] "structure, syntax, and development" [...] over [...] "pyrotechnic flourishes". Rense adds: [...] "These [...] are thoughtful and original, deceptively simple sounding, invested with feeling." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{some time}} the Duke {{and his colleagues}} {{had been looking for}} a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid {{responsibility}} before history. Bazaine stated in his defence [...] "I have graven on my chest two words - Honneur et Patrie. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ". Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. [...] "I have read every word of the evidence [...] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry" [...] (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless. [...] Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was [...] "It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves felt <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.|$|E
