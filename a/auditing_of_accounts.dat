5000|$|The Court is {{the heir}} of {{institutions}} which monitored public finances before the Unification of Italy, {{such as the}} Chamber of Audit (Camera dei conti) of the Duchy of Savoy and then the kingdom of Sardinia, established in 1351 and replaced in 1859 by the Court of Audit (Corte dei conti) on which the Italian institution of 1862 was closely modelled. Other precursors include the Chamber of Audit (Camera dei conti) of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, established in 1771; the [...] of the Kingdom of Naples, founded in 1444 and replaced by the Royal Court of Audit (Regia Corte dei Conti) in 1807. <b>Auditing</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> is also attested in Apostolic Camera of the Papal States {{as far back as}} the thirteenth century. In 1828 the Papal States instituted the Congregation for the Revision of Accounts and Affairs of Public Administration (Congregazione di revisione dei conti e degli affari di pubblica amministrazione) within the Apostolic Camera (which was subsequently replaced by the Council of State for Finance (Consulta di Stato per le Finanze) from 1850 until 1870), with the role of examining and reviewing the prospective and actual budgets of the state and providing opinions on financial matters.|$|E

30|$|Here, {{based on}} the result of both {{regression}} analyses, which are greater than the critical value of 0.05 (p =  0.768 and p = . 057 for primary and secondary data respectively), the null hypothesis was accepted which supports the assertion by Isaksson and Lantz (2015) that outsourcing strategies and outsourcing of primary activities to be specific has no significant effect on financial performance of SMEs as shown by their research in Sweden. The result here means that, Outsourcing Accounting Activities has no {{significant effect on the}} profitability of Small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria. The respondents views show clearly the fact that most SMEs do not outsource their accounting activities. They do carry out their recording and reporting internally. A fact still stands that, most SMEs do not have an established record keeping habit. This has being identified over the years as one of the major weaknesses of SMEs business operations (Onugu, 2005). The result here too may not be unconnected with the fact that SMEs do not appreciate the importance of record keeping. However, from the questionnaire responses, few SMEs who outsourced their accounting services said they benefit from the exercise. The independence nature of the exogenous accountants who are experts and specialists in computing and <b>auditing</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> for firms may be a reason for the efficacy of their services.|$|E
40|$|The project survey {{underlined}} {{the importance}} of service cooperatives in providing essential commodities in rural areas and in purchasing crops in grain- surplus areas {{on behalf of the}} Agriculture Marketing Corporation. It noted that some cooperat ives had successfully broadened their activities, and revealed {{the extent to which they}} m obilize local resources to provide credit to the community and individualsOf the management constraints facing service cooperatives, the surve y highlighted in particular the inadequate training of accountants and other staff, a situation exacerbated by insufficient <b>auditing</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> and a lack of financial inspect ion by the executive committees. The survey team evaluated some investments by the service cooperatives, and found that most were only marginally viable or were loss-makin g, and that the cooperatives experienced severe managerial problems. Accordingly, it was re commended that bookkeeping systems at the cooperatives be improved and standardized, that accounts be audited regularly by Government auditors, and that training programmes in manage ment skills be organized at all levels. To ensure continued responsiveness of the executive to the needs of the membership, elections for the executive committee should be held regularl ySome 40 project investment ideas were identified by the survey. In particular, there was a strong demand for flour mills in rural areas, and great importance w as attached to improved road communications by small-scale farmers in isolated areas.
