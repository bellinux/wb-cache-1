5|$|Some <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> more {{specific}} {{to a certain}} species. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. It {{is believed to be}} introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available. It is not transmissible to humans.|$|E
5|$|The substem {{preceding}} {{the source of}} the antibody refers to the medicine's target. Examples of targets are tumors, organ systems like the circulatory system, or infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The term target does not imply what sort of action the antibody exerts. Therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> not distinguished by this nomenclature.|$|E
50|$|In Major League Baseball, free <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> {{previously}} {{classified as}} either Type A, Type B, or unclassified. Type A free <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> those {{determined by the}} Collective Bargaining Agreement {{to be in the}} top 20% of all players based on the previous two seasons. Type B free <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> those in the next 20%. Unclassified free <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> those remaining in the bottom 60% of players.|$|R
50|$|The {{trick is}} in step 3. The <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> paid {{the total value}} of the other agents; hence, {{together}} with its own value, the total welfare of the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> exactly equal to the total welfare of society. Hence, the incentives of the <b>agent</b> <b>are</b> aligned with those of the society and the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> incentivized to be truthful in order to help the mechanism achieve its goal.|$|R
50|$|The Government of Madras was {{represented}} by a political agent. From 1800, when the first Political <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> appointed, till 1840, the Political <b>Agent</b> <b>was</b> usually the District Collector of Tanjore, from 1840 to 1865, the <b>Agent</b> <b>was</b> the Collector of Madurai and from 1865 to 1947 the <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> the Collector of Trichinopoly. All the decisions made by the Diwan are passed to the Madras Government for approval before they become the law.|$|R
5|$|All of the {{currently}} used volatile anesthetic <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> organofluorine compounds. Aside from {{the synthesis of}} Freon (Thomas Midgley, Jr. and Charles F. Kettering, 1928) and the discovery of Teflon (Roy J. Plunkett, 1938), the field of organofluorine chemistry had not attracted {{a great deal of}} attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of elemental fluorine, which had to be produced in situ for use in chemical reactions. The development of organofluorine chemistry was a spin-off from the Manhattan Project, during which elemental fluorine was produced on an industrial scale for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Antiparasitic {{treatment}} {{is most effective}} early {{in the course of}} infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox. Both <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> limited in their capacity to completely eliminate T. cruzi from the body (parasitologic cure), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.|$|E
5|$|Back in London, at an MI6 conference, {{all of the}} 00 <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> {{informed}} that SPECTRE demands £100 million from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs and threatens to destroy a major city in the United States or the United Kingdom. At the meeting, Bond recognises Derval from a photograph. Bond requests M {{to be sent to}} Nassau, Bahamas, where Derval's sister, Domino, is staying.|$|E
25|$|In Dyirbal, pronouns are morphologically nominative–accusative {{when the}} <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> {{first or second}} person, but ergative when the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a third person.|$|R
5000|$|Ablative of <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a more {{generalized}} {{version of}} the ablative of personal agent, used when the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> an inanimate object. When the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a person, the preposition ā/ab is used, for example rēx ā mīlitibus interfectus est [...] "The king was killed by the soldiers"; but when the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a thing, the preposition is omitted and the ablative case is sufficient, for example: rēx armīs mīlitum interfectus est [...] "the king was killed by the weapons of the soldiers".|$|R
50|$|One {{facet of}} the efforts to control a double <b>agent</b> {{operation}} <b>is</b> {{to ensure that the}} double <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> protected from discovery by the parent intelligence service; {{this is especially true in}} circumstances where the double <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a defector-in-place.|$|R
5|$|Ethiopian Airlines {{passengers}} are offered two lounges at Bole International Airport. Cloud Nine passengers can {{wait for the}} departure of flights at the Cloud Nine Lounge, where they are provided {{with a wide variety}} of amenities, as well as personal computers or wireless connection. Likewise, ShebaMiles cardholders with Gold or Silver status can make use of the Sheba Miles Lounge facilities. Customer Service <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> available at both lounges in order to assist passengers with any query regarding their flights.|$|E
5|$|Even in finite dimensions, the {{concepts}} of functional analysis have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying the role of prices as normal vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities. However, problems of describing optimization over time or under uncertainty {{require the use of}} infinite–dimensional function spaces, because <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> choosing among functions or stochastic processes.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{lead to a}} {{friendly}} missile base in Bangalore, they find the Indian inhabitants dead and Voron agents stealing the warhead from a missile. Securing the missile and learning that the <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> led {{by a man named}} Cherski, Fisher and Briggs escape as the building is destroyed and Indian authorities arrive. Unaware of Cherski's identity, Fisher and Briggs track him to a Voron base in Chittagong and find him living in a nearby apartment. They breach Cherski's panic room and find two people; uncertain which one is Cherski, they begin interrogating both and learn about a secret base in Russia.|$|E
5000|$|Electron acceptors {{participate}} in electron-transfer reactions. In this context, the oxidizing <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> called an electron acceptor and the reducing <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> called an electron donor. A classic oxidizing <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> the ferrocenium ion , which accepts an electron to form Fe(C5H5)2. One {{of the strongest}} acceptors commercially available is [...] "Magic blue", the radical cation derived from N(C6H4-4-Br)3.|$|R

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{visit the}} Area 51 {{installation}} in Nevada {{after receiving a}} tip from an inside source concerning alien spacecraft. As they drive on the highway, the <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> surrounded by Jeeps carrying soldiers led by a Man in Black named Morris Fletcher (Michael McKean). A rumbling noise is heard as a mysterious craft flies overhead and a bright light from the object passes over them. Mulder and Fletcher find that their minds have been swapped into each other's bodies, but nobody else present is aware of this. Fletcher and Scully depart, watched by the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{visit the}} {{headquarters}} of First Person Shooterss developers in Inland Empire, California, where they meet the Lone Gunmen, who work as consultants for the game. They look at {{the body of the}} player, which clearly displays a gunshot wound. Ivan claims there is no way a real gun could have been brought into the highly-secured building. The <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> shown a video from the game, featuring the female character who killed the player. Mulder takes the printout of the character and shows it to a detective, as he believes she is the killer.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E
50|$|A Retention <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> {{added to}} bind fillers to the paper. Fillers, such as calcium carbonate, {{usually have a}} weak surface charge. The {{retention}} <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a polymer with high cationic, positively charged groups. An additional feature of a retention <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> to accelerate the dewatering in the wire section of the paper machine. Polyethyleneimine and polyacrylamide are examples of chemicals used in this process.|$|R
50|$|Sleeper agent: A sleeper <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> {{a person}} who is {{recruited}} to an intelligence service to wake up and perform a specific set of tasks or functions while living under cover in an area of interest. This type of <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> not the same as a deep cover operative, who continually contacts a case officer to file intelligence reports. A sleeper <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> not in contact with anyone until activated.|$|R

5|$|In Charlottesville, Virginia, the Smoking Man is admonished by the Well-Manicured Man (John Neville) {{when the}} latter learns about Mulder's travels. Skinner and the <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> subpoenaed {{to appear before}} Senator Sorenson's panel over the missing pouch; when Skinner {{questions}} Scully about Mulder's whereabouts, she is not forthcoming. Meanwhile, as Mulder and Krycek hike through the forests of Krasnoyarsk, the former theorizes that the fragment may be tied to the Tunguska event, a mysterious cosmic impact {{that occurred in the}} area in 1908. The two men come across a slave labor camp, but are captured by the taskmasters and thrown into a gulag.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} NASA and meet Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's. Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states {{that nothing can}} possibly go wrong with the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E
5|$|Polyketides are {{synthesized}} by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes {{as well as}} iterative and multimodular {{enzymes that}} share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise {{a large number of}} secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.|$|E
40|$|A Bayesian network {{approach}} to self-organization and learning is introduced {{for use with}} intelligent agents. Bayesian networks, {{with the help of}} influence diagrams, are employed to create a decision-theoretic intelligent agent. Influence diagrams combine both Bayesian networks and utility theory. In this research, an intelligent <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> modeled by its belief, preference, and capabilities attributes. Each <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> assumed to have its own belief about its environment. The belief aspect of the intelligent <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> accomplished by a Bayesian network. The goal of an intelligent <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> said to be the preference of the <b>agent</b> and <b>is</b> represented with a utility function in the decision theoretic intelligent <b>agent.</b> Capabilities <b>are</b> represented with a set of possible actions of the decision-theoretic intelligent agent. Influence diagrams have utility nodes and decision nodes to handle the preference and capabilities of the decision-theoretic intelligent agent, respectively...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} facial similarity between users and embodied agents under different experimental conditions. Sixty-four undergraduates interacted with two different embodied agents: in one case the <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> designed to look somewhat similar to the user, {{and in the other}} case the <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> designed to look dissimilar. We varied between subjects how helpful the <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> for a given task. Results showed that the facial similarity manipulation sometimes affected participants' responses, even though they did not consciously detect the similarity. Specifically, when the <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> helpful, facial similarity increased participantsi ratings of involvement. However, when exposed to unhelpful agents, male participants had negative responses to the similar-looking agent compared to the dissimilar one. These results suggest that using facially similar embodied agents has a potential large downside if that embodied <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> perceived to be unhelpful. © 2010 ACM...|$|R
50|$|As vote {{counting}} occurred, {{both the}} SLPP and the APC {{claimed to be}} ahead and both {{said that they would}} reject results from areas where their <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> allegedly not allowed access to polling stations. The SLPP's Reider said that in three districts in the north the party's <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> kept away from the polling stations, and that there were 50 polling stations where SLPP <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> not present; he alleged that SLPP <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> arrested for two hours and that people from the APC took advantage of this to stuff the ballot boxes. APC spokesman Alpha Kanu said that his party's <b>agents</b> had <b>been</b> unable to access polling stations in parts of Kailahun, Kenema, and Pujehun districts in the south.|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully eagerly hunt for a deadly creature in the Arizona desert. What they find seems to support Mulder’s revived belief in aliens, but is discredited when the <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> not reassigned to the now re-opened X-Files, with Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) taking over instead.|$|E
5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of fairness {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular paralysis as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
