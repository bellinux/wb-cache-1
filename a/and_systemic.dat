5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, <b>and</b> <b>systemic</b> therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E
5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity <b>and</b> <b>systemic</b> inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E

5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) {{and mammals}} show {{complete}} {{separation of the}} heart into two pumps {{for a total of}} four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary <b>and</b> <b>systemic</b> circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, <b>and</b> <b>systemic</b> lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local <b>and</b> <b>systemic</b> symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two {{symptomatic}} categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I <b>and</b> <b>systemic</b> lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of people with aphthous stomatitis have minor symptoms and do not require any specific therapy. The pain is often tolerable with simple dietary modification during an episode of ulceration such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods and beverages. Many different topical <b>and</b> <b>systemic</b> medications have been proposed (see table), sometimes showing little or no evidence of usefulness when formally investigated. Some of the results of interventions for RAS may in truth represent a placebo effect. No therapy is curative, with treatment aiming to relieve pain, promote healing and reduce the frequency of episodes of ulceration.|$|E
