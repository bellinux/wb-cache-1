5|$|Following {{the fight}} at UFC 92, Jackson drew {{criticism}} from Todd Martin of CBS Sports for ignoring referee Yves Lavigne's attempt {{to stop the}} contest. Martin compared Jackson's actions to Renato Sobral's continued choke of David Heath following <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> out, which led to Sobral's dismissal from the UFC. Martin called for punishment against Jackson, but no action was taken against Jackson for this allegedly unsportsmanlike behavior.|$|E

The former Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Freight House, now known as The Freight House, is home to several small businesses featuring locally grown items, such as a deli, a grocery hub, and <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> room for a local brewery.|$|E

5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock them down with <b>a</b> <b>tap.</b>|$|E
5|$|The debtors' section {{consisted}} of a brick barracks, a yard measuring , a kitchen, a public room, and <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> room or snuggery, where debtors could drink as much beer as they wanted, at fivepence a pot in 1815. Philpotts reports that, by the early 19th century, most debtors spent only months in the prison; on 19 April 1826 it held 105 debtors, 99 {{of whom had been}} there for less than six months and the other six for less than a year.|$|E
5|$|Bennett grew up {{listening}} to Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Judy Garland, and Bing Crosby as well as jazz artists such as Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, and Joe Venuti. His Uncle Dick was <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> dancer in vaudeville, giving him an early window into show business, and his Uncle Frank was the Queens borough library commissioner. By age 10 he was already singing, and performed {{at the opening of the}} Triborough Bridge, standing next to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia who patted him on the head. Drawing was another early passion of his; he became known as the class caricaturist at P.S. 141 and anticipated a career in commercial art. He began singing for money at age 13, performing as a singing waiter in several Italian restaurants around his native Queens.|$|E

5|$|The evening draw also {{consisted}} of skins play. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott {{played in the}} women's skins game, in which Jones dominated, scoring four skins and winning four points for Team North America. Glenn Howard and Thomas Ulsrud played in the men's skins game. Ulsrud played a fairly open game, forcing carryovers for five ends until a misfire from Ulsrud led to Howard making the cup-winning shot, scoring three points with <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> for two points. Ulsrud won the remaining points in the game on a draw to the button. A mixed team of Kevin Martin, Heather Nedohin, Marc Kennedy, and Laine Peters played Eve Muirhead, Greg Drummond, Vicki Adams, and Michael Goodfellow in the mixed skins game. Martin skipped against Muirhead and controlled most of the game, securing four points on four skins before Muirhead took the last skin. Team North America took a 10½–4½ point edge {{in the second round}} of skins play, giving them a CAD$13,000 bonus for winning the skins rounds.|$|E

5000|$|Single coil {{magnetic}} pickups {{found in}} electric guitars can be coil tapped {{to reduce the}} number of windings around the magnet. <b>A</b> <b>tapped</b> single coil pickup typically contains three wires: a ground, an output, and <b>a</b> <b>tapped</b> output - with the two outputs generally wired to a switch on the guitar. The guitarist can then choose between the loud, punchy, midrange-heavy sound of the entire coil, or 'tap' into the inner coil for a quieter, yet bright vintage tone with a more clear and detailed high end.|$|R
50|$|Forming tap: A quite {{different}} kind of <b>tap</b> is <b>a</b> Forming <b>Tap.</b> <b>A</b> forming <b>tap,</b> aka <b>a</b> fluteless <b>tap</b> or roll tap, simply forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal {{from the sides of}} the hole as cutting <b>taps</b> do. <b>A</b> forming <b>tap</b> closely resembles <b>a</b> cutting <b>tap</b> without the flutes, or very nearly just like a plain thread. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. The threads behind the lobes are slightly recessed to reduce contact friction. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need to}} periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in <b>a</b> cutting <b>tap,</b> can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to <b>tap</b> with <b>a</b> cutting <b>tap</b> due to the chip build-up in the hole. Forming taps only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for <b>a</b> cutting <b>tap</b> as shown in most tap drill tables, and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|R
