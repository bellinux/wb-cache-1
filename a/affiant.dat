Your Petitioner further states that the reasons of his not being present at said trial, as he was not, and of its not being in his power to take an appeal in the ordinary way, as it was not, were that your Petitioner then resided in Edgar County about one hundred and twenty miles from where defendants resided; that a very short time before the suit was commenced your Petitioner was in Sangamon County for the purpose of collecting debts due him, and with the rest, the note in question, which note had then been given more than a year, that your Petitioner then saw the defendant J. L. Gerard who is the principal in said note, and solicited payment of the same; that said defendant then made no pretense that he did not owe the same, but on the contrary expressly promised that he would come into Springfield, in a very few days and either pay the money, or give a new note, payable by the then next Christmas; that your Petitioner accordingly left said note with said J. C.

50|$|Aguilar v. Texas, , was a {{decision}} by the United States Supreme Court, which held that “although an affidavit supporting a search warrant may be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the <b>affiant,</b> the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances relied on by the person providing the information and some of the underlying circumstances from which the <b>affiant</b> concluded that the informant, whose identity was not disclosed, was credible or his information reliable.” Along with Spinelli v. United States (1969), Aguilar established the Aguilar-Spinelli test, a judicial guideline for evaluating the validity of a search warrant based on information provided by a confidential informant or an anonymous tip.

50|$|In American jurisprudence, {{under the}} rules for hearsay, {{admission}} of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual (especially if the <b>affiant</b> is not available for cross-examination) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar. Affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear, may {{be accepted by the}} court, but usually only in the presence of corroborating evidence. An affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witness's recollection. Materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence. If the <b>affiant</b> is a party in the case, the affiant's opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence, as statements by a party-opponent are admissible through an exception to the hearsay rule.|$|E

50|$|One {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of a sworn statement instead of an affidavit is that, while the protection of liability for perjury is retained, the protection of having an independent official witness the signing, check the <b>affiant's</b> identification, etc., is lost. This function is essentially taken over by the attorney for the party in whose favor the affidavit is given; the court relies upon the honesty of the attorney, or, perhaps more realistically, upon the attorney's fear of being disbarred, to guarantee that the declarant is competent to testify, is who he says he is, and has actually sworn to the truth of the facts stated. Another incentive for attorneys {{to make sure that the}} text of a declaration precisely matches the declarant's recollection is that the witness may be subject to impeachment at trial if the discrepancies between the declaration and any later testimony turn out to be significant.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] “In a {{previous}} article, I examined judicial opinions in {{cases in which}} law clerks have gone wild, principally by doing things that law clerks just aren‘t supposed to do, such as convening court, conducting independent factual investigations into matters before their judges, or leaking drafts of opinions to the press. Here, I focus on opinions in federal cases that discuss two other categories of unusual law-clerk activity, serving {{as a source of}} evidence, and going to court, as a litigant. The article is informed by my ten years of experience as a trial court law clerk in the state and federal courts of New Hampshire. Things that caught my eye, and made it into the article, are incidents I read about in judicial opinions that struck me as very different from anything I had ever seen or heard about through the law-clerk grapevine. My purpose is two-fold. First, many of the opinions I discuss are downright entertaining. But beyond that, the unusual fact patterns that make those opinions entertaining also serve to point out things that might happen to a law clerk that are not covered in law school or the typical law-clerk training program. Accordingly, I intend for the article to have a practical dimension that underpins its entertainment value. In Part II, I explore opinions in which law clerks have become sources of evidence in cases they were working on, as producers of exhibits, as <b>affiants,</b> or as witnesses. In discussing those opinions, I focus on both the process by which law clerks have become sources of evidence and the topics on which they have been asked to give evidence. Part III is devoted to cases in which law clerks have been litigants, and it serves as a guide to situations in which litigation is, and is not, a productive option for a law clerk who believes that he or she has been wronged. ...|$|R

These were: Penaeus penicillatus, P. merguiensis, P. indicus, P. semisulcatus, Metapenaeus affinis, M. monoceros, M. brevicornis, M. stebbingi, Parapenaeopsis stylifera, P. hardwickii, P. sculptilis, Parapenaeus longipes and Metapenaeopsis stridulans. These shrmps are sorted by fishermen on board, subsequently marketing them as Jaira (Penaeus species), Kalri (Metapenaeus species) and Kiddi (Parapenaeopsis species) group of shrimps at the Karachi fish Harbour. The The jaira group of shrimps {{were found to}} be mostly comprised of P. penicillatus and P. merguiensis. The principal species comprising the Kalri and Kiddi shrimps were respectively, M. <b>affiants</b> and P. stylifera. The study of the minimum and maximum sizes of important Jaira, Kalri and Kiddi shrimp species and their size frequencies revealed the fact that shrimp size in the present day penaeid stocks of Pakistan is smaller than it was more than twenty years ago, providing unequivocal evidence of much continuous over fishing of these stocks. The females of the four main commercially important penaeid shrimps, P. penicillatus, P. merguiensis, M. affinis and P. stylifera were found to attain a size larger than their males. This suggests the possibility that males die off earlier than females or that females grow faster in the later part of their life and live longer than males. The possibility that in these species sex-reversal occurs from males to females cannot be ruled out also. The overall sex-rations in P. penicillatus, P. merguiensis and M. affinis did not deviate from the expected 1 : 1 or normal Medelian distribution. However, in P. stylifera the overall sex-ratio deviated significantly from the expected 1 : 1 distributions in favour of females, being 3 : 1. In this study, six maturation stages were recognized on the basis of overian histology. These were undeveloped, developing, nearly-ripe, fully-ripe, resorbing and resorbing/developing. The spewning seasons of local penaeid shrimps, P. penicillatus, P. merguiensis, M. affinis, and P. stylifera based on the maturation stages of the overies revealed that all the four species had nearly-ripe or fully-ripe overies throughout the year suggesting the potential for spewning throughout the year. Penaeus penicillatus, P. merguiensis and M. affinis showed two peaks of spewning-the major peak in winter-spring and the minor peak in September/October. In P. stylifera the spewning is winter orented (Novermber to February). The recruits of both P. penicillatus and P. merguiensis belonged to the 101 - 120 mm size-class, of M. afinis to 81 - 100 mm size-class and of P. stylifera to 61 - 70 mm size-class. In P. penicillatus the recruitment occurred during the period September to December and in January to February, in M. affinis during September to December and May to June, while in P. stylifera the recruitment occurred almost throughout the year...|$|R
