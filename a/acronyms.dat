5|$|Whereas some <b>acronyms</b> are logical, such as N3 (N for natural, i.e. {{observed}} in natural diamond) or H3 (H for heated, i.e. observed after irradiation and heating), many are not. In particular, {{there is no}} clear distinction between the meaning of labels GR (general radiation), R (radiation) and TR (type-II radiation).|$|E
5|$|The initialism, LGBT, is {{intended}} to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It {{may be used to}} refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996. Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI. Some people combine the two <b>acronyms</b> and use the term LGBTIQ or LGBTQI. Others use LGBT+ to encompass a spectrum of gender and sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Proper nouns are not {{included}} in the list. There are, in addition, many place names and personal names, mostly originating from Arabic-speaking countries, Albania, or China, that have a Q without a U. The most familiar of these are the countries of Iraq and Qatar, along with the derived words Iraqi and Qatari. Iqaluit, the capital of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, also has a Q which is not directly followed by a U. Qaqortoq, in Greenland, is notable for having three such Qs. Other proper names and <b>acronyms</b> that have attained the status of English words include: Compaq (a computer company), Nasdaq (a US electronic stock market), Qantas (an Australian airline), and QinetiQ (a British technology company). Zaqqum (a tree mentioned in the Qur'an) and Saqqara (an ancient burial ground in Egypt) are proper nouns notable for their use of a double Q.|$|E

25|$|A clearer {{distinction}} {{has also}} been drawn, by Pyles & Algeo (1970), who divided <b>acronyms</b> as a general category into word <b>acronyms</b> pronounced as words, and initialisms sounded out as letters.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{standards}} using different <b>acronyms.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Acronyms</b> {{are often}} taught as {{mnemonic}} devices, {{for example in}} physics {{the colors of the}} visible spectrum are ROY G. BIV (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet). They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: GUMPS, which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic <b>acronyms</b> include CAN SLIM, and PAVPANIC as well as PEMDAS.|$|E
50|$|The term XAMPP is an {{apparent}} <b>acronym.</b> However, {{there is no}} official <b>acronym</b> expansion specified on the Apache Friends website. Their homepage header reads “XAMPP Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl”, indicating that this abbreviation is a recursive <b>acronym.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{recursive}} <b>acronym</b> is an <b>acronym</b> that {{refers to}} itself. The term was first used in print in 1979 in Douglas Hofstadter's book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, in which Hofstadter invents the <b>acronym</b> GOD, meaning [...] "GOD Over Djinn", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive <b>acronym.</b> Other references followed, however the concept was used as early as 1968 in John Brunner's science fiction novel Stand On Zanzibar. In the story, the <b>acronym</b> EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into [...] "Eptification for Particular Task".|$|R
5000|$|The name is an <b>acronym</b> of an <b>acronym</b> of an <b>acronym</b> as the P in PL {{stands for}} [...] "POS-PHY" [...] and the S in POS-PHY stands for [...] "SONET" [...] (Synchronous Optical Network). The L in PL stands for [...] "Layer".|$|R
25|$|The seven academies {{are often}} {{referred}} to by their single-word nicknames or <b>acronyms.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first group}} is divided again by whether they denote proper names (written in uppercase, e.g. ENSZ < Egyesült Nemzetek Szövetsége ‘United Nations Organization’, note that both {{letters of the}} digraphs SZ are capitalized) or common names (written in lowercase, e.g. vb < végrehajtó bizottság ‘executive committee’, note that it is written as one word despite the two elements). Some <b>acronyms</b> created from common names are still written in uppercase, though, {{especially}} in sciences (URH < ultrarövidhullám ‘ultra-high-frequency’) but other capitalized <b>acronyms</b> may be accepted too (TDK < tudományos diákkör ‘students’ scholarly circle’). In some cases, full-fledged words are created from the pronounced form of <b>acronyms</b> standing for common names (e.g. tévé < tv < televízió).|$|E
25|$|<b>Acronyms</b> of {{the second}} group are created from longer parts of the {{original}} words (in fact, at least one word of the original should keep at least two letters, not including digraphs). Their letters are not all capitalized, only the initial of <b>acronyms</b> that derive from proper names (e.g. Kermi < Kereskedelmi Minőség-ellenőrző Intézet, ‘Commercial Quality Control Institute’ cf. gyes < gyermekgondozási segély ‘maternity benefit’).|$|E
5000|$|... anacronym: an <b>acronym</b> {{that is so}} {{well-established}} {{that its}} origin as an abbreviation is no longer widely known (a portmanteau of anachronism + <b>acronym),</b> for example scuba and laser; historically an <b>acronym</b> whose component initials {{are in danger of}} no longer being recognized ...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{automatic}} method for disambiguating an <b>acronym</b> with mul-tiple definitions, considering the context surrounding the <b>acronym.</b> First, the method obtains the Web pages that in-clude both the <b>acronym</b> and its definitions. Second, the method feeds {{them to the}} ma-chine learner. Cross-validation tests re-sults indicate that the current accuracy of obtaining the appropriate definition for an <b>acronym</b> is around 92 % for two ambigu-ous definitions and around 86 % for five ambiguous definitions. ...|$|R
50|$|The GAA logo {{uses the}} script to {{incorporate}} both the English language GAA <b>acronym</b> and the Irish language CLG <b>acronym.</b> The logo more strongly shows the more widely used <b>acronym</b> GAA but taking {{a closer look}} a C joins with an L {{and then to a}} G lying down.|$|R
25|$|The Japanese {{language}} makes {{extensive use}} of abbreviations, but only {{some of these are}} <b>acronyms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neither type of <b>acronyms</b> need a {{full stop}} between their {{elements}} or at their end.|$|E
25|$|The Real Academia Española {{indicates}} that accents are required on capitals (but {{not when the}} capitals are used in <b>acronyms).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Comprehensive Advanced Life Support (CALS) Program uses a {{slightly}} different <b>acronym</b> called [...] "SHRIMPCAN." [...] This <b>acronym</b> adds the letter [...] "I", which stands for [...] "Ingestions" [...] (drug overdoses). The remainder of the letters in the <b>acronym</b> stand for the same components as the RNCHAMPS mnemonic.|$|R
25|$|Words {{derived from}} an <b>acronym</b> by {{affixing}} are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root <b>acronym</b> is clear. For example, pre-WWII politics, post-NATO world, DNAase. In some cases a derived <b>acronym</b> {{may also be}} expressed in mixed case. For example, messenger RNA and transfer RNA become mRNA and tRNA.|$|R
50|$|SEED is an <b>acronym</b> for Self Evaluation for Effective Decision-making. SCALE is an <b>acronym</b> for Systems for Communities to Adapt Learning and Expand.|$|R
25|$|DoD Acronym database—contains nearly 30,000 <b>acronyms</b> {{that relate}} to {{software}} technology and programs {{of interest to the}} DoD. This database is continuously updated.|$|E

25|$|<b>Acronyms</b> are {{classified}} into two groups: those consisting only of initials (betűszók lit. ‘letter-words’), and those consisting {{parts of the}} original word (szóösszevonások ‘word contractions’).|$|E
50|$|BOGO {{which was}} {{originally}} just a marketing <b>acronym</b> for 'Buy One Get One' {{has become a}} new <b>acronym</b> also for 'Buy One Give One'.|$|R

The <b>acronym</b> {{was seen}} on {{packaging}} without the periods between {{the letters of}} the <b>acronym,</b> but on some of the vehicle bases with the punctuation. J.M.K. was a further <b>acronym</b> that stood for the three founding members of the company: M. Jarry, Henri Malartre and M. Koch. Though the models were often known simply as RAMI, the full name of the company was RAMI by J.M.K.|$|R
25|$|The process {{above is}} similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to <b>acronyms,</b> thus pre-NATO policy (rather than preNATO).|$|E
25|$|In some languages, {{especially}} those that use certain alphabets, many <b>acronyms</b> come from the governmental use, particularly {{in the military and}} law enforcement services. The Indonesian military (TNI—Tentara Nasional Indonesia) and Indonesian police (POLRI—Kepolisian Republik Indonesia) are infamous for heavy <b>acronyms</b> use. Examples include the Kopassus (Komando Pasukan Khusus; Special Forces Command), Kopaska (Komando Pasukan Katak; Frogmen Command), Kodim (Komando Distrik Militer; Military District Command—one of the Indonesian army's administrative divisions), Serka (Sersan Kepala; Head Sergeant), Akmil (Akademi Militer; Military Academy—in Magelang) and many other terms regarding ranks, units, divisions, procedures, etc.|$|E
25|$|For abbreviations, <b>acronyms,</b> etc., use of s {{without an}} {{apostrophe}} {{is now more}} common than its use with an apostrophe, but for single lowercase letters, pluralization with -'s is usual.|$|E
