40|$|Prostate cancer (CaP) {{metastasis}} to bone {{results in}} mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions {{associated with high}} morbidity and there is mounting evidence that the urokinase-type plasminogen (uPA) system is causatively involved in the progression of CaP. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising tools for cell-mediated gene therapy with the advantage of osteogenic potential, a critical issue {{in the case of}} osteolytic metastases. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic use of engineered murine MSCs for in vivo delivery of the uPA antagonist amino-terminal fragment (hATF) in order to impair osteolytic CaP cells progression in bone and to repair bone lesions. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) revealed that both primary MSCs (pMSCs) and MSC line C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 (C 3) expressing hATF (MSC-hATF) inhibited significantly intra-tibial PC- 3 -Luc growth following co-injection in SCID mice. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging of vascular network clearly demonstrated a significant decrease of tumor-associated angiogenesis and a protection from tumor-induced osteolysis in MSC-hATF treated mice. Importantly, the osteogenic potential of MSC-hATF cells was unaffected and area of new bone formation was evidenced in 60 % of animals. Altogether, these data support the concept of MSC-based therapy of tumor osteolysis disease, indicating that MSCs may combine properties of vehicle for angiostatic agent with osteogenic potential. ______________________________________________________________________________ Author contributions: V.

40|$|This {{research}} uses syntax {{theories to}} analyze the Transformational Processes. It is {{used to examine the}} use of Transformational Processes on Deletion by describing the types of Transformational Processes <b>of</b> <b>Deletion</b> used in the Headlines of Time Magazines. The theories that are used in this research are the Jacobs and Rosenbaum?s, Elgin?s, and Akmajian and Henry?s theories. The writer chooses {{to analyze the}} Transformational Processes <b>of</b> <b>Deletion</b> in the Headline as her study since headlines should be made as simple as possible. Therefore, the Transformational Processes <b>of</b> <b>Deletion</b> often occurs in the headline. Beside that, the writer describes the frequency of the occurrences each kind <b>of</b> <b>deletion.</b> The writer selects Headlines of Time Magazines of March 6 th 2006, April 10 th 2006, and May 8 th 2006 editions as her sources of data to find out the Transformational Processes <b>of</b> <b>Deletion.</b> To collect the data, the writer uses a descriptive qualitative approach. In collecting the data, the writer selects the Headlines from 4 editions of Time Magazines. The Headlines are used as the sources of the data are the Headlines that contain Transformational Processes <b>of</b> <b>Deletion.</b> Furthermore, the data are classified according to Jacobs and Rosenbaum?s theories by examining the deep structure and surface structure. In analyzing the data, the writer describes each type <b>of</b> <b>deletion</b> and counts the frequencies. From the analysis, there are 5 kinds Transformational Processes <b>of</b> <b>Deletion.</b> The Transformational Processes of Noun Phrase and Linking Verb Deletion occur seven times. The Transformational Processes <b>of</b> Noun Phrase <b>Deletion</b> occurs five times. The Transformational Processes <b>of</b> Imperative <b>Deletion</b> occurs four times. In addition, the Transformational Processes <b>of</b> Verb Phrase <b>Deletion</b> and Deletion under Identity occur twice. In all transformational Processes, the <b>Deletion</b> <b>of</b> Noun Phrase and Linking Verb Deletion is mostly used in the Headlines of Time Magazine...|$|R

In this paper, we study the harder model <b>of</b> worst-case <b>deletions,</b> {{with a focus}} on constructing efficiently decodable codes for the two extreme regimes of high-noise and high-rate. Specifically, we construct polynomial-time decodable codes with the following trade-offs (for any eps > 0) : (1) Codes that can correct a fraction 1 -eps <b>of</b> <b>deletions</b> with rate poly(eps) over an alphabet of size poly(1 /eps); (2) Binary codes of rate 1 -O~(sqrt(eps)) that can correct a fraction eps of deletions; and (3) Binary codes that can be list decoded from a fraction (1 / 2 -eps) <b>of</b> <b>deletions</b> with rate poly(eps) Our work is the first to achieve the qualitative goals <b>of</b> correcting a <b>deletion</b> fraction approaching 1 over bounded alphabets, and correcting a constant fraction <b>of</b> bit <b>deletions</b> with rate aproaching 1. The above results bring our understanding <b>of</b> <b>deletion</b> code constructions in these regimes to a similar level as worst-case errors...|$|R
