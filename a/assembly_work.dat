5|$|The AgustaWestland AW101 is a medium-lift {{helicopter}} {{used in both}} {{military and}} civil applications. It was developed by {{a joint venture between}} Westland Helicopters in the United Kingdom and Agusta in Italy in response to national requirements for a modern naval utility helicopter. Several operators, including the armed forces of Britain, Denmark, Norway and Portugal, use the name Merlin for their AW101 aircraft.

5|$|The Sunbeam Tiger is a {{high-performance}} V8 {{version of the}} British Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine roadster, designed in part by American car designer and racing driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra, and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the <b>assembly</b> <b>work</b> to Jensen at West Bromwich in England, and pay Shelby a royalty on every car produced.|$|E
5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} {{because the two}} companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some <b>assembly</b> <b>work</b> was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis. Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Lafayette was a {{firm believer}} in a {{constitutional}} monarchy. He believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic National <b>Assembly</b> <b>work</b> with a monarch, as France had always had. His close relationships to Americans such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who both happened to be Founding Fathers of the United States, gave Lafayette the ability to witness the implementation of a democratic system in a country. His views on potential government structures for France were directly influenced by the American form of government, which was in turn influenced by the British form of government. For example, Lafayette believed in a bicameral legislature, as the United States had. The Jacobins, however, detested the idea of a monarchy in France; this led to it ultimately being voted against by the National Assembly. This idea only helped lead to his fall from favor, especially when Maximilien Robespierre took power.|$|E

25|$|The Hampden used a flush-rivetted {{stressed}} skin design, which was reinforced {{with a mixture}} of bent and extruded sections. The structure employed an all-metal monocoque design. A split-assembly construction technique was employed, sections were prefabricated and then joined together, to enable rapid and economic manufacturing to be performed. The fuselage was in three major sections – front, centre and rear – that were built using jigs. The centre and rear sections were themselves made of two halves, which meant that the sections could be fitted out in part under better working conditions prior to assembly. All possible <b>assembly</b> <b>work</b> was performed at the benches prior to installation upon each aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 1973, the Belgian defence {{minister}} announced that 33 Alpha Jets {{had been ordered}} in two batches of 16 and 17 aircraft. These aircraft were given the designation Alpha Jet 1B, the <b>assembly</b> <b>work</b> being performed by Belgian aircraft manufacturer SABCA. Deliveries took place between 1978 and 1980. By April 1981, the Belgian Air Force had reportedly accumulated 10,000 flight hours on their 33 Alpha Jets during training operations. The introduction of the Alpha Jet led to the retirement of Belgium's Fouga CM.170 Magister fleet; changes to the training syllabus included {{the adoption of a}} new discipline, combined flight, as well as a greater use of flight simulators.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{agreement}} {{included the}} involvement of British Aerospace (BAe) as a major subcontractor, manufacturing sections such as the rear fuselage for all customers of the AV-8B. The Harrier II was an Anglicised version of the AV-8B, British Aerospace producing the aircraft as the prime contractor, with McDonnell Douglas serving as a sub-contractor; final <b>assembly</b> <b>work</b> was performed at Dunsfold, England. The first prototype flew in 1981, first BAe-built development GR5 flew {{for the first time}} on 30 April 1985 and the aircraft entered service in July 1987. The GR5 had many differences from the USMC AV-8B Harriers, such as avionics fit, armaments and equipment; the wing of the GR5 featured a stainless steel leading edge, giving it different flex characteristics from the AV-8B. In December 1989, the first RAF squadron to be equipped with the Harrier II was declared operational.|$|E

25|$|In May 1937, series {{production}} of the Potez 630 commenced. Manufacturing work on the aircraft's various sections and components was shared out across various SNCAN facilities; the fuselage and tailplanes were produced in Caudebec-en-Caux, Normandy, the wings were made at Le Havre, Normandy, and final assembly was initially performed at Méaulte; the <b>assembly</b> <b>work</b> was later transferred to Les Mureaux. In February 1938, the first production Potez 630 conducted its maiden flight; on 23 February, the French Air Force accepted their first production 630 aircraft. Early on, {{production of the}} Potez 630 was hit by considerable delays, caused by a shortage of engines, propellers, and cannons; the first batch of Potez 630s were armed with four machine guns instead of the two 20mm Hispano-Suiza cannons. On 2 August 1938, the first Potez 631 was officially accepted.|$|E
25|$|Both Belgium and Egypt, {{who were}} early export {{customers}} for the Alpha Jet, domestically performed the final assembly of their French-configuration Alpha Jet E aircraft. On 17 September 1978, Dassault and the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI) signed a license manufacturing agreement for the Alpha Jet; Egypian <b>assembly</b> <b>work</b> {{was carried out}} in a facility in Helwan, Egypt. In July 1978, Dassault signed an agreement with American aircraft manufacture Lockheed to market the Alpha Jet in the US market, the arrangement included provisions for Lockheed to manufacture the Alpha Jet under license. It was considered as a candidate for the US Navy's VTXTS advanced trainer program (eventually won by the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, {{a modified version of the}} Hawker Siddeley Hawk); proposed modifications included undercarriage changes for nose-tow catapults and a stronger arrestor hook, as well as various US-sourced avionics and other equipment.|$|E
25|$|Belfast's skyline {{is still}} {{dominated}} today by Harland & Wolff's famous twin gantry cranes, Samson and Goliath, built in 1974 and 1969 respectively. There is also speculation about a resurgence in {{the prosperity of}} the shipyard thanks to the company's diversification into emerging technologies, particularly in renewable energy development, such as offshore wind turbine and tidal power construction, which may {{provide an opportunity to}} further improve the company's fortunes in the long term. For example, the United Kingdom planned to build 7,500 new offshore wind turbines between 2008 and 2020, creating great demand for heavy <b>assembly</b> <b>work.</b> Unlike land-based wind turbines, where assembly occurs on site, offshore wind turbines have part of their assembly done in a shipyard, and then construction barges transport the tower sections, rotors, and nacelles to the site for final erection and assembly. As a result of this, in late 2007, the 'Goliath' gantry crane was re-commissioned, having been moth-balled in 2003 {{due to the lack of}} heavy-lifting work at the yard.|$|E

2500|$|On December 16, 2003, Boeing {{announced}} that the 787 would be assembled in its factory in Everett, Washington. Instead of conventionally building the aircraft from the ground up, final assembly employed 800 to 1,200 people to join completed subassemblies and to integrate systems. Boeing assigned global subcontractors to do more <b>assembly</b> <b>work,</b> delivering completed subassemblies to Boeing for final assembly.
