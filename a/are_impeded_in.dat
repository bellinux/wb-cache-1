50|$|Serious {{concerns}} remain regarding {{government officials}} who punish victims of trafficking for acts they may have committed {{as a direct result}} of being trafficked. In some cases, trafficking victims were jailed pending resolution of their legal cases, despite their recognized victim status. Female trafficking victims continued to be arrested and imprisoned or otherwise punished for prostitution and fleeing forced marriages for trafficking purposes. In some cases, women who fled their homes to escape these types of forced marriages reported being raped by police or treated by police as criminals simply for not being chaperoned. Victimized women who could not find place in a shelter often ended up in prison; some women chose to go to prison for protection from male family members. There is no evidence that the government encouraged victims to assist in investigations of their traffickers during the reporting period. Attempts to seek redress <b>are</b> <b>impeded</b> <b>in</b> part because an Afghan victim would be in grave danger for simply identifying his or her assailant.|$|E

40|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the uterus (myometrium) {{undergoes}} profound changes in global excitability prior to parturition. Here, a mathematical model of the myocyte network is developed to investigate the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity {{is essential to the}} transition from local to global excitation which the myometrium undergoes just prior to birth. Each myometrial smooth muscle cell is represented by an element with FitzHughâ€“Nagumo dynamics. The cells are coupled through resistors that represent gap junctions. Spatial heterogeneity is introduced by means of stochastic variation in coupling strengths, with parameters derived from physiological data. Numerical simulations indicate that even modest increases in the heterogeneity of the system can amplify the ability of locally applied stimuli to elicit global excitation. Moreover, in networks driven by a pacemaker cell, global oscillations of excitation <b>are</b> <b>impeded</b> <b>in</b> fully connected and strongly coupled networks. The ability of a locally stimulated cell or pacemaker cell to excite the network is shown to be strongly dependent on the local spatial correlation structure of the couplings.

40|$|Abstract Background The forces {{developed}} during inspiration {{play a key}} role in determining upper airway stability and the occurrence of nocturnal breathing disorders. Phrenic nerve stimulation applied during wakefulness is a unique tool to assess Upper airway dynamic properties and to measure the overall mechanical effects of the inspiratory process on UA stability. Objectives To compare the flow/pressure responses to inspiratory and expiratory twitches between sleep apnea subjects and normal subjects. Methods Inspiratory and expiratory twitches using magnetic nerve stimulation completed in eleven untreated sleep apnea subjects and ten normal subjects. Results In both groups, higher flow and pressure were reached during inspiratory twitches. The two groups showed no differences in expiratory twitch parameters. During inspiration, the pressure at which flow-limitation occurred was more negative in normals than in apneic subjects, but not reaching significance (p = 0. 07). The relationship between pharyngeal pressure and flow adequately fitted with a polynomial regression model providing a measurement of upper airway critical pressure during twitch. This pressure significantly decreased in normals from expiratory to inspiratory twitches (- 11. 1 Â± 1. 6 and - 15. 7 Â± 1. 0 cm H 2 O respectively, 95 % CI 1. 6 â€“ 7. 6, p Conclusion Inspiratory-related upper airway dilating forces <b>are</b> <b>impeded</b> <b>in</b> sleep apnea patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFtsZ {{is a key}} protein {{involved}} in bacterial and organellar division. Bacteria have only one ftsZ gene, while chlorophytes (higher plants and green alga) have two distinct FtsZ gene families, named FtsZ 1 and FtsZ 2. This {{raises the question of}} why chloroplasts in these organisms need distinct FtsZ proteins to divide. In order to unravel new functions associated with FtsZ proteins, we have identified and characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana FtsZ 1 loss-of-function mutant. ftsZ 1 -knockout mutants <b>are</b> <b>impeded</b> <b>in</b> chloroplast division, and division is restored when FtsZ 1 is expressed at a low level. FtsZ 1 -overexpressing plants show a drastic inhibition of chloroplast division. Chloroplast morphology is altered in ftsZ 1, with chloroplasts having abnormalities in the thylakoid membrane network. Overexpression of FtsZ 1 also induced defects in thylakoid organization with an increased network of twisting thylakoids and larger grana. We show that FtsZ 1, in addition to being present in the stroma, is tightly associated with the thylakoid fraction. This association is developmentally regulated since FtsZ 1 is found in the thylakoid fraction of young developing plant leaves but not in mature and old plant leaves. Our results suggest that plastid division protein FtsZ 1 may have a function during leaf development in thylakoid organization, thus highlighting new functions for green plastid FtsZ...|$|E
40|$|GATA- 1, a {{transcription}} factor of the 'zinc-finger' family, {{is required for}} the development of mature erythroid cells and is also highly expressed in the megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages. The helix-loop-helix gene SCL (or TAL) is expressed in the same three hematopoietic lineages as GATA- 1. To explore the role of GATA- 1 and SCL in hematopoietic differentiation, we introduced a new expression vector bearing each gene into the early myeloid cell line 416 B, which could originally differentiate in vivo along the megakaryocytic and granulocytic lineages. Enforced expression of SCL at high levels did not provoke differentiation, but GATA- 1 induced the appearance of megakaryocytes as assessed by morphology, the presence of acetylcholinesterase and a polyploid DNA content. Although GATA- 1 is thought to stimulate its own transcription in erythrocytes, expression of the endogenous gene was not increased in the megakaryocytic lines; hence GATA- 1 may not be autoregulatory in this lineage. Megakaryocytic differentiation was accompanied by a marked decrease in the myeloid surface marker Mac- 1. The absence of mast cell or erythroid differentiation suggests that GATA- 1 may not be sufficient to provoke maturation along these lineages or that these pathways <b>are</b> <b>impeded</b> <b>in</b> 416 B cells.

40|$|Due to {{a growing}} demand of food {{production}} worldwide, new strategies are suggested to allow for sustainable production of food with minimal effects on natural resources. A promising alternative to the application of chemical pesticides is the implementation of crops resistant to insect pests. Plants produce compounds that are harmful {{to a wide range}} of attackers, including insect pests; thus, exploitation of their natural defense system can be the key for the development of pest-resistant crops. Interestingly, some plants possess a unique first line of defense that eliminates the enemy before it becomes destructive: egg-killing. Insect eggs can trigger (1) direct defenses, mostly including plant cell tissue growth or cell death that lead to eggs desiccating, being crushed or falling off the plant or (2) indirect defenses, plant chemical cues recruiting natural enemies that kill the egg or hatching larvae (parasitoids). The consequences of plant responses to eggs are that insect larvae do not hatch or that they <b>are</b> <b>impeded</b> <b>in</b> development, and damage to the plant is reduced. Here, we provide an overview on the ubiquity and evolutionary history of egg-killing traits within the plant kingdom including crops. Up to now, little is known on the mechanisms and on the genetic basis of egg-killing traits. Making use of egg-killing defense traits in crops is a promising new way to sustainably reduce losses of crop yield. We provide suggestions for new breeding strategies to grow egg-killing crops and improve biological control. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{understand}} the psychotherapeutic model that describes the functioning of the human psyche and then apply the model in the critical analysis of Stanley Kubrickâ€™s films. The social behaviour of human beings is often guided by the unconscious. The process of human development includes the denial of innate animalistic desires of sex and violence and repressing them as a means of becoming viable for social interaction in the civilized society. But, these repressed sexual desires later take the form of grotesque if they <b>are</b> <b>impeded</b> <b>in</b> any way. This rage gets articulated in subversion and gets projected onto innocent individuals. According to Freudian psychoanalysis, this repression in not so well balanced, individuals may take the form of perversion and neurosis. Also, if the process of individualization is thwarted, the individual may manifest signs of personality disorder. The process of individualization also defines the sexuality of the individual. By the application of Freudian psychoanalysis, the attempt is to understand how this auteur seta his own examples of iconic human nature. The characters are not bland and simple, but they show layers of personality. The main objective is to understand how in the films of Stanley Kubrick the characters articulate their repressions. The director gives licence to his characters to break free of the shackles. In the process of exercising his artistic freedom, he goes on to create immortal works of artistic excellence that have received accolades from every nook and corner of the world...|$|E

The article underscores the importance of distinguishing between general and specific language abilities when determining the effective-ness of a language training program. - D. D. D.
