500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blow" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. The video was released on February 25, 2011. Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random".

I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward <b>about</b> <b>stuff</b> or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E
500|$|Austin in turn penned [...] "Creep" [...] {{and thought}} she would be its perfect lead. He wrote the song while {{cruising}} in a Chevrolet Blazer and {{wanted it to be}} written from a female perspective. This experience was said to create [...] "a new mold" [...] of songwriting for him, as he was [...] "talking <b>about</b> <b>stuff</b> guys didn't know girls did." [...] The [...] "female point-of-view" [...] on the track was something the trio appreciated because as a group they have always portrayed themselves as feminists, the song goes along with that mentality. But still, on the 2013 VH1 biopic , the track also appeared to have been also inspired by Austin's infidelity to then-girlfriend, member Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas. Latoya Peterson of Spin observed that feminism was being loudly maligned in music {{at the time of the}} song's release, as a result, more female artists like TLC, Salt-N-Pepa and Tori Amos began to [...] "overtly defend themselves." [...] When asked if they were getting inspired from Radiohead's 1992 track with the same name, the group denied this. Andy Greene from Rolling Stone had pointed out that the group took the term [...] "" [...] in a different direction compared to Radiohead's or Stone Temple Pilots' 1993 single's, in which the trio's song is about getting revenge on a cheating guy by having an affair. The idea, however, was considered to be quite [...] "controversial." [...] According to Thomas, the theme didn't come as much of a shock for them, she stated: [...] "I think when we first came out, it was very bold of us to have a song called 'Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg' with [...] 'Two inches or a yard, rock hard or if it's sagging'. People totally understood what type of group we were. To sing a song like 'Creep' wouldn't be surprising from us." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of Revolutions per Minute in 2003, {{a number of major}} record labels became {{interested}} in Rise Against, including Dreamworks Records.

There's no streets up there called Yazoo!' It was like, 'Jesus, let me make up a little story here <b>about</b> <b>stuff</b> going on in this kind of almost red light district.' Everything was lit in red in that song for me." [...] Initially, Robertson recorded the lead vocal for the first version of this song, but because it was set in the South, the Hawks decided that Levon Helm would be a more appropriate singer, employing what Hoskyns describes as his [...] "best redneck-wildcat yelp".|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussing}} the conception for her second studio album with L.A. Reid—Chairman and CEO of The Island Def Jam Music Group—Rihanna talked about experimenting with different music by incorporating some rock on the album. In February 2006, Rihanna {{announced that she}} was going to release her second studio album in April 2006 under the name A Girl like Me. When asked about the album in an interview with MTV News, Rihanna stated: [...] "Vocally I've matured so much, and lyrically I'm speaking <b>about</b> <b>stuff</b> I would never sing about [...] Now I'm singing about experiences that I've gone through and stuff that other 18-year-old girls go through, so it's all about progression." [...] In regards to the title of the album, Rihanna explained: [...] "It's called A Girl like Me because it's a very personal album, it's my baby. It's all about what it's like to be a girl like me, speaking of personal experiences as well as things that girls like me have gone through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write <b>about</b> <b>stuff</b> that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E

Adewunmi remarked that [...] "it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: {{you may be a}} racist—congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!" [...] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, [...] "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight." [...] Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: [...] "As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I {{want to thank all of}} my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty."

[...] Goulding added, [...] "This album for me is a journey from dark into light from confusion to understanding [...] I didn't set out to write a break-up record but I think it became one." [...] In an interview with MTV News on 29 August 2012, Goulding elaborated on the sound of the album, saying, [...] "I've moved on quite a bit since the first album, because I've discovered so much; I've learned a lot more and I've grown up a lot more. I've gained more influences and different influences and people have influenced it; I suppose just circumstances. It's a bit more tribal and anthemic; a bit more piano and vocal than anything. The last album was very electronic, but it was tied in with my voice; this one, to me, is way more of a pop record." [...] Goulding revealed to The Sun that her former relationship with BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James provided inspiration for the album, stating, [...] "The last record I felt like I was singing <b>about</b> <b>stuff</b> like that and I thought it was really sincere but I listen back and I think, God that was really naive, that was nothing. This time it's the real deal. There's stuff about Greg. I played it to him because I felt that was better than him hearing it randomly somewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder <b>about</b> <b>stuff,</b> where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But every now and then I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E

60|$|The 'Boards' {{were always}} {{commenced}} by {{the reading of}} a certain record of the last meeting out of a book. This was always done by Miles Grendall; and the record {{was supposed to have}} been written by him. But Montague had discovered that this statement in the book was always prepared and written by a satellite of Melmotte's from Abchurch Lane who was never present at the meeting. The adverse director had spoken to the secretary,--it will be remembered that they were both members of the Beargarden,--and Miles had given a somewhat evasive reply. 'A cussed deal of trouble and all that, you know! He's used to it, and it's what he's meant for. I'm not going to flurry myself <b>about</b> <b>stuff</b> of that kind.' Montague after this had spoken on the subject both to Nidderdale and Felix Carbury. 'He couldn't do it, if it was ever so,' Nidderdale had said. 'I don't think I'd bully him if I were you. He gets £500 a-year, and if you knew all he owes, and all he hasn't got, you wouldn't try to rob him of it.' With Felix Carbury, Montague had as little success. Sir Felix hated the secretary, had detected him cheating at cards, had resolved to expose him,--and had then been afraid to do so. He had told Dolly Longestaffe, and the reader will perhaps remember with what effect. He had not mentioned the affair again, and had gradually fallen back into the habit of playing at the club. Loo, however, had given way to whist, and Sir Felix had satisfied himself with the change. He still meditated some dreadful punishment for Miles Grendall, but, in the meantime, felt himself unable to oppose him at the Board. Since the day at which the aces had been manipulated at the club he had not spoken to Miles Grendall except in reference to the affairs of the whist table. The 'Board' was now commenced as usual. Miles read the short record out of the book,--stumbling over every other word, and going through the performance so badly that had there been anything to understand no one could have understood it. 'Gentlemen,' said Mr Melmotte, in his usual hurried way, 'is it your pleasure that I shall sign the record?' Paul Montague rose to say that it was not his pleasure that the record should be signed. But Melmotte had made his scrawl, and was deep in conversation with Mr Cohenlupe before Paul could get upon his legs.|$|E
