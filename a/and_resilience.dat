However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change <b>and</b> <b>resilience</b> {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the {{excellent}} {{performance of the}} infantry, both comitatenses and limitanei, is a recurrent feature of Ammianus' history. At the Persian siege of Amida, Ammianus' eye-witness account describes the city's defence by limitanei units as skilful and tenacious, if ultimately unsuccessful. At Strasbourg (357), the infantry showed remarkable skill, discipline <b>and</b> <b>resilience</b> throughout, saving the day at two critical moments.(see Battle of Strasbourg for a detailed account). Even at the disaster of Adrianople, the Roman infantry fought on, despite being abandoned by their cavalry and surrounded on three sides by overwhelmingly superior numbers of Goths.|$|E

40|$|From an {{ecological}} perspective, this study aimed {{to examine the}} relationship between a sense of community and life satisfaction as moderated by personal <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> partner <b>resilience</b> among Chinese older adults. Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 258 Chinese couples (age range 60 - 97 years) completed measures related to sense of community, <b>resilience,</b> <b>and</b> life satisfaction. The results showed that (a) sense of community was positively associated with life satisfaction after controlling for personal <b>resilience,</b> partner <b>resilience,</b> <b>and</b> other covariates, and (b) a three-way interaction between sense of community, personal <b>resilience,</b> <b>and</b> partner <b>resilience</b> emerged to predict life satisfaction. Specifically, the effect of sense of community on life satisfaction under the condition of low personal resilience-low partner resilience was weaker than it was under other conditions. Tailored interventions to enhance community resources, individual <b>resilience,</b> <b>and</b> couples&# 39; strengths are recommended to promote the life satisfaction of Chinese older adults. </p...|$|R

5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence <b>and</b> <b>resilience</b> of ecosystems.|$|E

30|$|This article {{addresses}} <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> vulnerability as {{two prominent}} concepts within disaster risk science. The authors provide {{an overview of}} current uses and benefits of <b>and</b> challenges to <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> vulnerability concepts for disaster risk management (DRM). The article summarizes the evolution of these concepts and of attempts to define them precisely, and addresses the potential benefits of conceptual vagueness. The usage <b>and</b> conception of <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> vulnerability within a selection of strategies and legislations in DRM are compared. Complementing this analysis of disaster risk research and management practice, a survey identifies some of the benefits of and challenges to the concepts of <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> vulnerability as seen by a peer-community. Synthesizing the three approaches, we conclude that a certain conceptual and methodological “haze” prevails, which hampers the transfer of information and findings within disaster risk science, from science to practice, and vice versa. But this vagueness offers opportunities for communication between disaster risk science, policy, and practice. Overall, evaluations of the <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> vulnerability concepts are lacking, which demands the development of criteria to identify and assess the challenges to <b>and</b> benefits of <b>resilience</b> <b>and</b> vulnerability for DRM.|$|R

25|$|Kevlar {{maintains}} its strength <b>and</b> <b>resilience</b> down to cryogenic temperatures (−196°C); in fact, it is slightly stronger at low temperatures. At higher temperatures the tensile strength is immediately reduced by about 10–20%, and after some hours the strength progressively reduces further. For example, at 160°C (320°F) about 10% reduction in strength occurs after 500 hours. At 260°C (500°F) 50% strength reduction occurs after 70 hours.|$|E
40|$|Law {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in shaping natural resource and environmental policy, but unfortunately, many environmental laws were developed around the prevailing scientific understanding that there was a "balance of nature" that could be managed and sustained. This view assumes that natural resource managers have the capacity to predict the behavior of ecological systems, know what its important functional components are, and successfully predict the outcome of management interventions. This paper takes on this problem by summarizing and synthesizing the contributions to this Special Feature (Law <b>and</b> Social-Ecological <b>Resilience,</b> Part I: Contributions from Resilience 2011), focusing on the interaction of law <b>and</b> social-ecological <b>resilience,</b> <b>and</b> then offering recommendations for the integration of law <b>and</b> social-ecological <b>resilience...</b>|$|R

25|$|There is {{significant}} research found in scientific {{literature on the}} relationship between positive emotions <b>and</b> <b>resilience.</b> Studies show that maintaining positive emotions whilst facing adversity promote flexibility in thinking and problem solving. Positive emotions serve an important function in their ability to help an individual recover from stressful experiences and encounters. That being said, maintaining a positive emotionality aids in counteracting the physiological effects of negative emotions. It also facilitates adaptive coping, builds enduring social resources, and increases personal well-being.|$|E
