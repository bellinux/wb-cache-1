5|$|King Andrew died on 21 September 1235. Béla, {{who succeeded}} his father without opposition, was crowned king in Székesfehérvár on 14 October. He {{dismissed}} and punished {{many of his}} father's closest advisors. For instance, he had Palatine Denis blinded and Julius Kán imprisoned. The former was accused of having, in King Andrew's life, an adulterous liaison with Queen Beatrix, the King's young widow. Béla ordered her imprisonment, but she managed to escape to the Holy Roman Empire, where {{she gave birth to}} a posthumous son, Stephen. Béla and his brother Coloman considered her son <b>a</b> <b>bastard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lichton's death {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. It fell between 11 November (Martinmas) 1440, and 11 January 1441; {{it is probable}} that he died on either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given to him in the 15th century and the 16th century respectively. He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist. As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father <b>a</b> <b>bastard,</b> a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving papal dispensation to marry in 1432.|$|E

Henry soothed his wife's fears by separating Mary from her many servants and sending her to Hatfield House, where Princess Elizabeth would be living with her own sizeable staff of servants, and where the country air was thought better for the baby's health. Anne frequently visited her daughter at Hatfield and other residences.|$|E

Andrew's third wife, Beatrice D'Este, was about twenty-three when they married in 1234. She {{gave birth to a}} son, Stephen, after Andrew's death. However, Andrew's two older sons, Béla and Coloman, accused her of {{adultery}} and considered her child to be <b>a</b> <b>bastard.</b> Her grandson, Andrew, became the last monarch of the House of Árpád.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the chronicle}} {{indirectly}} implies that Rögnvaldr {{was also a}} son of Finnguala, {{there is evidence that}} strongly suggests that he had a different mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as <b>a</b> <b>bastard.</b> Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was a son of Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been an unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. The chronicle records that because Óláfr was only a child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E

5|$|Jemima {{tells her}} life story to Maria and Darnford, {{explaining}} {{that she was}} born <b>a</b> <b>bastard.</b> Jemima's mother died {{while she was still}} an infant, making her already precarious social position worse. She was therefore forced to become a servant in her father's house and later bound out as an apprentice to a master who beat her, starved her, and raped her. When the man's wife discovers that Jemima is pregnant with his child, she is thrown out of the house. Unable to support herself, she aborts her child and becomes a prostitute. She becomes the kept woman of a man of some wealth who seems obsessed with pleasure of every kind: food, love, etc. After the death of the gentleman keeping her, she becomes an attendant at the asylum where Maria is imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Magnús, {{the last}} reigning king of his dynasty, died at Castle Rushen in 1265, and was buried at the Abbey of St Mary of Rushen. At {{the time of}} his death, he was married to Eóghan's {{daughter}} Máire. In the year after his death, the Hebrides and Mann were formally ceded by King of Norway to the King of Scots. Ten years after Magnús' death, Guðrøðr, <b>a</b> <b>bastard</b> son of his attempted to establish himself as king on Mann. Guðrøðr's revolt was quickly and brutally crushed by Scottish forces, and the island remained part of the Kingdom of Scotland. By the 1290s, the Hebridean portion of Magnús' former island-kingdom had been incorporated into a newly created Scottish sheriffdom.|$|E
5|$|Roger of Hoveden {{described}} Uhtred of Galloway as a consanguinus ("cousin") of King Henry II of England, {{an assertion}} {{that has given}} rise to the theory that, since Gille-Brighde is never described as such, they must have been from different mothers. Fergus must therefore, according to the theory, have had two wives, one of whom was <b>a</b> <b>bastard</b> daughter of Henry I; that is, Uhtred and his descendants were related to the English royal family, while Gille-Brighde and his descendants were not. According to historian G.W.S. Barrow, the theory is disproved by one English royal document, written in the name of King John of England, which likewise asserts that Donnchadh was John's cousin.|$|E

5|$|Charles was {{the only}} son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno, and his wife, Clemence of Austria. He was born in 1288; the place of his birth is unknown. Charles Martel was the firstborn son of Charles II of Naples and Charles II's wife, Mary, who was a {{daughter}} of Stephen V of Hungary. After {{the death of her}} brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, in 1290, Queen Mary announced her claim to Hungary, stating that the House of Árpád (the royal family of Hungary) had become extinct with Ladislaus's death. However, her father's cousin, Andrew also laid claim to the throne, although his father, Stephen the Posthumous, had been regarded <b>a</b> <b>bastard</b> by all other members of the royal family. For all that, the Hungarian lords and prelates preferred Andrew against Mary and he was crowned king of Hungary on 23July 1290. She transferred her claim to Hungary to Charles Martel in January 1292. The Babonići, Frankopans, Šubići and other Croatian and Slavonian noble families seemingly acknowledged Charles Martel's claim, but in fact their loyalty vacillated between Charles Martel and AndrewIII.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow {{is first}} {{introduced}} in A Game of Thrones (1996), {{as he and}} his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed {{from the rest of the}} Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as <b>a</b> <b>bastard</b> prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a good family. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat.|$|E
5|$|Mac Scelling (fl. 11541173/1174), {{also known}} as Mac Scilling, was a {{prominent}} twelfth-century military commander engaged in conflicts throughout Ireland. He is first recorded in 1154 commanding the maritime forces of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain in a bloody encounter against Toirrdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. Muirchertach's naval forces were drawn from the western peripheries of Scotland and the Isles. He next appears on record in 1173/1174, supporting the cause of Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht against the English colonisation of Mide. An early modern Scottish source claims that {{a man of the}} same name was <b>a</b> <b>bastard</b> son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles. If Mac Scelling was indeed related to Somairle, this relationship could cast light on the latter's conflict with Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles, a man who appears to have opposed Muirchertach at some point in his career. Although not termed so in contemporary sources, Mac Scelling may be regarded as an early archetype of later gallowglasses, heavily-armed Scottish mercenaries recruited by Irish rulers in centuries that followed.|$|E
