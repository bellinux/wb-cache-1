Conductive coatings are used to protect the aperture from electromagnetic Interference, while dissipative coatings are used to prevent the build-up of static electricity. Transparent conductive coatings are also used extensively to provide electrodes in situations where light is required to pass, for example in flat panel display technologies and in many photoelectrochemical experiments. A common substance used in transparent conductive coatings is indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is not very optically transparent, however. The layers must be thin to provide substantial transparency, particularly at the blue end of the spectrum. Using ITO, sheet resistances of 20 to 10,000 ohms per square can be achieved. An ITO coating may be combined with an <b>antireflective</b> <b>coating</b> to further improve transmittance. Other TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) include AZO (Aluminium doped Zinc Oxide), which offers much better UV transmission than ITO.A special class of transparent conductive coatings applies to infrared films for theater-air military optics where IR transparent windows need to have (Radar) stealth (Stealth technology) properties.

The mirrors are to reflect at 22. 5 deg from grazing angle at 1. 50 nm wavelength and {{the width of the}} reflectivity peak should be at least 1. 3 %. Also, the mirrors should be non-reflective elsewhere. Our multilayer design was optimized to satisfy these requirements. The coating is very challenging since the individual layer thicknesses need to be less than 1 nm thick and reproducibility from layer to layer is crucial. To minimize the second harmonic peak we designed a multilayer with {Gamma} = 0. 5 (W and SiC layer thicknesses are the same). This way we end up with a mirror that has only the 1 st and 3 rd harmonic peak as shown in Figure 1. To suppress reflectivity outside the first peak we used our novel approach, an <b>antireflective</b> <b>coating.</b> Modeling predicted substantial reduction in reflectivity, especially for lower energies as shown in Figure 1. The experimental results of the soft x-ray imager mirror as measured at the ALS are shown in Figure 2 (log and linear scale).

40|$|For the {{broadband}} <b>antireflective</b> (AR) <b>coating</b> {{working in}} specific wavelengths, the precise control over refractive index and film thickness of each layer {{is critical to}} guarantee the peak position locating at the targeted wavelengths. In this paper, a simple sol-gel procedure without post-treatment is used to prepare MgF 2 -SiO 2 hybrid coating with tunable refractive index for the fabrication of tri-layer tri-wavelength broadband AR coating. The MgF 2 -SiO 2 coating with ultralow refractive index of 1. 12 is realized through in situ surface assembly of negatively charged silanol groups on vesicle-like MgF 2 particles to obtain porous crosslinking structure. The electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged silanol groups and positively charged MgF 2 colloidal particles plays a key role. Furthermore, the MgF 2 -SiO 2 coating {{with a wide range}} of refractive index between 1. 20 and 1. 44 is achieved by adjusting the addition amount of acid-catalyzed silica sol into the vesicle-like MgF 2 sol. According to the theoretical design, a tri-layer broadband AR coating with refractive index model of 1. 12 / 1. 26 / 1. 36 is prepared, which can enhance the transmittance of quartz substrate to near 100 % simultaneously at 351, 527, and 1053 nm...|$|R
