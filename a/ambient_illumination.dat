40|$|Background: Visual acuity is an {{essential}} estimate to assess ability of the visual system and is used {{as an indicator of}} ocular health status. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the consistency of acuity estimates from three different clinical visual acuity charts under two levels of <b>ambient</b> room <b>illumination.</b> Materials and Methods: This study involved thirty Malay university students aged between 19 and 23 years old (7 males, 23 females), with their spherical refractive error ranging between plano and − 7. 75 D, astigmatism ranging from plano to − 1. 75 D, anisometropia less than 1. 00 D and with no history of ocular injury or pathology. Right eye visual acuity (recorded in logMAR unit) was measured with Snellen letter chart (Snellen), wall mounted letter chart (WM) and projected letter chart (PC) under two <b>ambient</b> room <b>illuminations,</b> room light on and room light off. Results: Visual acuity estimates showed no statistically significant difference when measured with the room light on and with the room light off (F 1, 372 = 0. 26, P = 0. 61). Post-hoc analysis with Tukey showed that visual acuity estimates were significantly different between the Snellen and PC (P = 0. 009) and between Snellen and WM (P = 0. 002). Conclusions: Different levels of <b>ambient</b> room <b>illumination</b> had no significant effect on visual acuity estimates.

40|$|Abstract — A concentrating {{photovoltaic}} (CPV) {{system with}} a steady electric output adopting an electrically tunable concentra-tion ratio of the liquid crystals (LC) lens is demonstrated. The distribution of the LC directors of the LC lens can be controlled by an applied voltage in order to adjust the number of incident photons in an area. As a result, the CPV system adopting an LC lens can be operated with a static and maximum output power density under different <b>ambient</b> <b>illuminations</b> because the LC lens with an electrically tunable concentration ratio helps to increase the photocurrent at a low illumination and prevent {{the effect of the}} series resistance at a high illumination. The detailed operating principles are discussed, and the experimental results are performed. We believe this letter can help enhance the output power density of CPV systems by using active optical elements whose concentration ratio is tunable.

Given this lack of an <b>ambient</b> <b>illumination</b> effect, the shift between older and younger participants can be considered constant, regardless of <b>ambient</b> <b>illumination.</b> However, while we find a significant effect of age in the blur condition, in both the low and high <b>ambient</b> <b>illumination,</b> we fail to replicate the effect in the noise condition in both the low and high <b>ambient</b> <b>illumination</b> conditions. While we only partially replicate our results in Experiment 1, we believe that this can be attributed to two differences between our experiments. We found that participants in Experiment 2 failed to achieve the necessary level of performance more frequently than in Experiment 1 (as shown by our increased exclusion rate); this may be attributable to the 50 % increase in total trials in Experiment 2. In addition, our failure to replicate our age effect in Experiment 1 ’s noise condition may be a result of a 25 % {{reduction in the number of}} trials per condition, as well as increased participant fatigue as a result of the increased experiment duration.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} voxel-based {{rendering}} pipeline for large 3 D line sets that employs GPU ray-casting to achieve scalable rendering including transparency and global illumination effects that cannot {{be achieved with}} GPU rasterization. Even for opaque lines we demonstrate superior rendering performance compared to GPU rasterization of lines, and when transparency is used we can interactively render large amounts of lines that are infeasible to be rendered via rasterization. To achieve this, we propose a direction-preserving encoding of lines into a regular voxel grid, along with the quantization of directions using face-to-face connectivity in this grid. On the regular grid structure, parallel GPU ray-casting is used to determine visible fragments in correct visibility order. To enable interactive rendering of global illumination effects like low-frequency shadows and <b>ambient</b> occlusions, <b>illumination</b> simulation is performed during ray-casting on a level-of-detail (LoD) line representation that considers the number of lines and their lengths per voxel. In this way we can render effects which {{are very difficult to}} render via GPU rasterization.

40|$|Undoubtedly, the {{detection}} of peripheral objects and pedestrians while driving is an important visual task. However, there are few data that describe the impact of parameters such as headlamp illumination, peripheral angle and target reflectance upon the speed and accuracy with which one can detect peripheral targets.
