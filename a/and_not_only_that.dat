Cole, but hey, anyone can sound good over this beat. <b>And</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>that,</b> but Cole's vocals, however brief, are a welcome complement." [...] Making reference to its music video, Entertainment Weeklys Erin Strecker commented: [...] "I'm assuming it was shot mid-summer, {{which is when}} this really should have been put out. Releasing this track {{at the end of}} October seems like an odd choice, as the video involves a grillout and trailer-park pool party that would have sparkled mid-July." [...] The remix was nominated in the category for Best Collaboration at the 2012 BET Awards. For the week ending November 5, 2011, [...] "Party" [...] debuted at number two on the South Korean International Singles Chart, selling 85,143 digital downloads.

500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that [...] "Side one is pure up, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>that,</b> it {{sticks to the}} ears" [...] and that [...] "Van Halen's pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops." [...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1607, while seeking food {{along the}} Chickahominy River, Smith was {{captured}} {{and taken to}} meet {{the chief of the}} Powhatans at Werowocomoco, the main village of the Powhatan Confederacy. The village was on the north shore of the York River about 15 miles due north of Jamestown and 25 miles downstream from where the river forms from the Pamunkey River and the Mattaponi River at West Point, Virginia. Smith feared for his life, but he was eventually released without harm and later attributed this in part to the chief's daughter Pocahontas who, according to Smith, threw herself across his body: [...] "at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>that,</b> but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown".|$|E

2500|$|The admonition of [...] {{provoked}} the Rabbis to debate whether one should perform a worldly occupation {{in addition to}} studying Torah.

Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see."
