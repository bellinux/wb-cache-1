40|$|In this {{experimental}} study {{the effects of}} unheated <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plate</b> positions along the centerline of a vertical channel on combined natural convective in air and radiative heat transfer are investigated. The vertical channel is symmetrically heated and a uniform heat flux along the principal walls of the channel is assumed. Comparisons between experimental data carried out from different positions of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plate</b> and two surfaces emissivity values are given in terms of heated wall temperatures and radiative heat transfer. Average Nusselt numbers by means of experimental data are evaluated. Results are given for different thermal and geometrical dimensionless parameters. Results show that the lowest maximum channel wall temperatures are attained for the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plate</b> placed at the channel exit for high channel Rayleigh numbers and heat flux values. Correlations for average Nusselt numbers, global average Nusselt numbers and dimensionless maximum wall temperatures in terms of channel Rayleigh numbers and auxiliary plate-to-channel height ratio, h/L, are evaluated in the ranges: 20 < Ra′ < 1. 5 × 105, 22 < Ra′∗ < 1. 7 × 105 and 0 ≤ h/L ≤ 0. 5 for inlet and outlet positions and walls emissivity equal to 0. 9. The proposed correlations are in good agreement with correlation for simple channe...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} etching {{the surface of}} a Pyrex glass {{substrate}} using the Reactive Ion Etching process without the use of masks is reported. Variations in the machined surface on an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plate,</b> manufactured in aluminum and placed below a Pyrex glass slide, were transferred to the upper surface of the substrate. SF 6 as etching gas and low pressure chamber to promote the increase of mean free path of ions were used. Two etching ratios were found, general, that affects the entire surface of the substrate, and differential, which generates the relief {{on the surface of the}} glass. Differential etching depth showed a linear behavior with respect to time; the mean differential etching rate obtained was 43 nm/min. The same phase between the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plate</b> machining and the etched pattern on the substrate is preserved. With this technique it was possible to manufac-ture convex and concave surfaces; some examples are given. The arithmetic mean roughness achieved with the proposed method was found to be N 1 class, ideal for the development of optical corrector plates...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of transverse vibration of a clamped rectangular plate with cutout using vibratory flap subjected to harmonic excitation. Vibratory flap is an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plate,</b> which can vibrate independently when it is attached on the main plate as a cantilever plate. The vibratory flap acts as a dynamic vibration absorber which reduces the vibration of the plate at tuning and higher frequencies. This study attempts to discover the effect of flap position on transverse vibration of rectangular plate with cut-out. Analysis {{has been carried out}} for different combinations of flap position and cutout locations through finite element analysis using ANSYS software. From the analysis {{it was found that the}} flap position plays a significant role in vibration control of plate. The vibration of the plate was reduced by 83...|$|E

40|$|Summary. An {{alternative}} vector derivation of {{the expression}} for {{the rates of}} plate creation and consumption is given, from which {{it can be seen}} that the rates are proportional to the scalar product of the edges of the geohedron and plate polyhedron corresponding to the same boundary. The plate polyhedron is defined by the set of triple junction vectors.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} in three parts. The {{first is a}} {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation of squeeze-film damping on plates separated by gas, for example. air. For this study a thick excited plate was attached to an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plate</b> parallel to the surface, thereby trapping {{a thin layer of}} air. Relative vibration of these two plates pumps this air at high velocities, resulting in energy loss due to air viscosity. The theory employs an impedance approach to predict the loss factor of the coupled plates. Below the excited plate critical frequency the damping is controlled by gas pumping, while above the critical frequency the plate couplings are the controlling factor. Theoretical predictions were compared with experimental measurements. A brief examination of the bolting effect on the loss factor was also conducted. The second part is a theoretical and experimental investigation of squeeze-film damping on plates separated by heavy fluid, for example, oil. The attached plate can be either perforated or unperforated. The ratio of fluid dynamic viscosity to density controls the losses. Viscosity was artificially increased by inserting porous materials into the oil layer. The properties of the porous materials were obtained from macroscopic flow resistance measurements. Theoretical modelling of the loss factor of these layered configurations with oil alone and with oil impregnated porous material were conducted using the impedance approach and compared with experimental measurements. The third part is a theoretical and experimental investigation of granular infill damping treatments on plates. Sand was used in the experiments and the bulk and shear elastic constants were measured when the sand was subjected to varying hydrostatic pressures. Both the dilatational and rotational motions in the granular layer were considered and the loss factor predictions were compared with measured results...|$|E
5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a maintenance road number (also {{known as a}} reference number). The maintenance road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed maintenance road numbers exist near their parent roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland Ferry Road in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road branching off from it near Laurel, is designated as Road 78A. The maintenance road numbers are signed with little white markers at intersections showing the two roads that intersect each other and on <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plates</b> below warning signs approaching intersections.|$|R
50|$|The Panzerschreck could {{penetrate}} 100 mm {{of armor}} using early war rockets, and 160 mm of armor with rockets developed {{later in the}} war, for which the blast shield of the RPzB 54 was necessary. Late war German tactical doctrine called for Panzerschreck and/or Panzerfaust teams to set up in staggered trenches no further than 115 metres apart. In this way, attacking armor would face anti-tank fire from multiple directions {{at a distance of}} no more than 69 metres. Anti-tank teams were instructed to aim for the thinner side or rear armor whenever possible. Allied armored units frequently attempted to add improvised protection to their tanks, e.g., sandbags, spare track units, logs and so on to protect against HEAT rounds. Most of this makeshift protection had little protective effect, and overtaxed the vehicle's engine, transmission, and suspension systems. Another defense was to rig metal mesh and netting around the tank, resembling the German Schürzen <b>auxiliary</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R

Some large bridges in the state are maintained by other agencies including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Roads in the system include multilane freeways, multilane surface divided highways, and two-lane undivided roads serving urban, suburban, and rural areas.

40|$|The Horizontal Air Bearing Experiment No. 1 is {{a series}} of tests {{intended}} to further the understanding of rotational dynamics. A simple experimental assembly is rotated using the Horizontal Air Bearing and allowed to spin freely as the internal rotational damping is measured.

The experimental assembly is composed of an aluminum ball within a spherical cavity. A flanged pipe section and an <b>auxiliary</b> adapter <b>plate</b> secure the assembly to the Air Bearing interface plate. Three aluminum balls are interchanged to vary test parameters. The aluminum balls are free to move independently as the entire assembly rotates. The aluminum balls vary in diameter and/or surface finish.
