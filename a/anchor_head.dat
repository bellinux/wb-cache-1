The complex structure and contact force between wires aggravates the dispersion and attenuation of guided waves in steel wires. In {{order to reduce}} the attenuation of acoustical energy, below 80 kHz low-frequency longitudinal guided waves is usually adopted. Low-frequency guided waves attenuate more slowly than high-frequency waves, but the received signal packets are wider and less recognizable.

40|$|Ground anchors are a form {{of ground}} {{improvement}} technique that strengthens and stabilises structures to the surrounding ground, whether it be in soil or rock. Steel strand ground anchors have many advantages when transferring applied loads into the surrounding sub-base; however the environments {{in which they can}} be constructed in are aggressive and can cause corrosion and premature failure of the anchor should they not be adequately protected. Current ground anchor best practices require a complex double protection boundary layer system to encase the bond length, free length and the <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> and may not guarantee complete protection against corrosion. Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials in the construction and infrastructure industry has seen significant interest and development in recent years. Unfortunately these developments have not extended to the ground anchor industry. As such, little is known about material performance under adverse ground anchoring conditions, where exposure to extreme alkaline, acidic or briny environments is not uncommon. This thesis investigated two different types of Carbon Fibre CFRP strands to assess if they are suitable for ground anchor applications and what environments they a can perform safely and successfully unprotected. Absorption, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), spectroscopy and tensile performance tests were conducted in aggressive alkaline and acidic groundwater environments and neutral solution for a period up to six months at elevated temperatures of 30 degrees Celcius and 60 degrees Celcius. These tests were conducted unstressed and stressed. Results showed that although absorption of aggressive environments were observed and localised penetration of the aggressive solution had occurred (without damage or deterioration of the composite structure) the tensile performance of the CFCC product was unaffected by the aggressive ground environments in both a stress-cured or unstressed-cured state. Absorption levels and penetration of aggressive solutions were higher for the HS 25 x 2 material. This penetration showed signs of composite and fibre breakdown over the six months curing. Tensile performance was still efficient, with most results performing better than control results; however, inconsistencies in the tensile results were reported as a result of gripping issues developed during material curing. Ground anchor bond assessment was conducted under confined conditions on a single CFRP strand over various bond lengths, bonded using a standard ground anchor cementitious based grout mixture with no additives. Pull-out tests were conducted on both CFCC and HS 25 x 2 materials. Results identified the minimum bond length required to induce strand rupture for the CFCC specimens was calculated to be 775 mm. No minimum bond length was established for the HS 25 x 2 due to a large scatter and variance in results over the numerous bond lengths tested. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted on the CFCC strand to develop greater understanding of the progressive debonding during axial loading and bond stress distribution along the bonded length of strand. FEA model was able to predict ultimate loads capacity and bond slip prior to failure accurately. FEA model was compared to full scale test results and strong linearity between bond stresses and progressive debonding distribution were identified. No FEA modelling was developed for the HS 25 x 2 product {{as a result of the}} inconsistent bond pull-out results. CFRP anchors are restricted with the methods available to lock the anchor off and the head. Bond type anchor heads are good reliable method for anchorage, but minimum bond length requirements are long and restrictive for ground anchor applications. This project identified the issues with current bond type anchor heads and developed a reliable and compact “modified bond type” <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> system suitable to CFRP material similar to the profile of CFCC strand. The <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> was successfully tested on CFCC strand where a four and 10 strand <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> assessment was conducted. Results from the test identified specimen failure occurred as a result of strand rupture in the bond length and no movement or cracking at the distal end of the <b>anchor</b> <b>head.</b> The success of this <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> enabled the development of a full scale gun barrel test to be conducted. Using the <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> technology developed a four strand CFCC gun barrel test was conducted with a 3. 0 meter bond length and 2. 0 m free length. Testing was conducted as per an acceptance test program for steel strand ground anchors with cyclic loading over 10 equal load increments up to proof load of 800 kN. Results showed a linear elastic extension over each load increment. Creep was observed at each cycles peak load (held for 50 minutes). The net anchor extension was a direct result of the creep. There were no signs of strand deformation from the data collected. No strand movement was observed at the anchors distal end, nor any movement, cracking or pull-out of the wires within the <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> system. Strain gauges mounted along the strands free and bond lengths plotted load and bond stress distribution along the strand throughout the loading process. Bond stress distribution results replicated FEA model results obtained from the single strand bond model. An apparent free length of 3. 5 meters was calculated. Progressive debonding of each strand throughout the test was established. Strain results verified the calculated apparent free length of 3. 5 meters. The research conducted of CFRP strand identified that there are limitations for exposure to aggressive ground environments and bond strengths for selected FRP material. CFRP strand which can be securely anchored (using bond or other methods) and resist aggressive ground environments, such as CFCC, could perform as a permanent ground anchor in an unprotected state for the duration of the anchors design life. Guidelines and standards needs to be urgently developed to assist in designers utilising the knowledge developed in research the superior performance of CFRP strand in aggressive environment compared to steel strand ground anchors...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} three-dimensional (3 D) -constitutive models for concrete formulated {{in the framework of}} plasticity theory to structural analyses of anchor devices. For this purpose, two commonly employed concrete material models are considered. The first model, the extended Leon model, is based on one yield surface for the description of compressive and tensile failure of concrete. The second material model is a multisurface plasticity model consisting of three Rankine yield surfaces and a Drucker-Prager yield surface. The predictive capability of the models is demonstrated by means of anchor devices, commonly employed in structural engineering for the connection of steel and concrete members. Such devices induce strongly nonuniform triaxial stress states in the surrounding concrete, ranging from tensile, overcompressive, to confined compressive stress states. In the vicinity of the <b>anchor</b> <b>head,</b> even nearly hydrostatic stress states may occur. The numerical simulations {{on the basis of the}} employed 3 D material models for concrete give insight into the load-carrying behavior of the investigated anchor devices. Two headed studs characterized by different shapes of the <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> and an undercut anchor are considered. Comparison of the peak loads and failure modes of the respective anchor device predicted by the numerical models with experimental data highlight the strength and weakness of the employed material models. It is shown that some load cases may lead to rather large differences in peak load depending on the choice of material model. These differences are based on the individual properties of the constitutive models for concrete and, hence, detailed knowledge of the model under consideration is essential for giving accurate estimates of the peak load of the anchor device and the failure mode of concrete...|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the behaviour of beams shearstrengthened with FRP sheets. The studies show that FRP materials can produce good performance when used to carry some portion of shear force in the shear-strengthened beam. However, the performance of FRP sheets is found limited by bond capacity between FRP sheets and concrete surface. In certain case, anchorage system can be introduced to the FRP strengthening scheme to improve the bond performance. This paper presents experimental and analytical studies conducted to evaluate the contribution and behaviour of FRP sheets with anchored ends in strengthening the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete beams. In the study, nine reinforced concrete beam specimens were fabricated and tested. Test parameters of the study include thickness of FRP sheet used, types of wrap applied, type of anchors and diameter of <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> used. Two types of anchorage system were proposed in the study, i. e. insert anchor system and C-embedded anchor system. The results from this study show that the proposed anchorage system can improve the contribution of FRP in carrying the shear force in beams. In addition, the Cembedded anchor system exhibits better performance than the insert anchor system. Lastly, the behaviour of beams strengthened using FRP stirrups with anchored end can be better predicted by the ACI 440 design equations for full-wrap scheme...|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} developed smart strand {{can be used}} to measure the prestress force in the prestressed concrete (PSC) structure from the construction stage to the in-service stage. The higher cost of the smart strand compared to the conventional strand renders it unaffordable to replace all the strands by smart strands, and results in the application of {{only a limited number of}} smart strands in the PSC structure. However, the prestress forces developed in the strands of the multi-strand system frequently adopted in PSC structures differ from each other, which means that the prestress force in the multi-strand system cannot be obtained by simple proportional scaling using the measurement of the smart strand. Therefore, this study examines the prestress force distribution in the multi-strand system to find the correlation between the prestress force measured by the smart strand and the prestress force distribution in the multi-strand system. To that goal, the prestress force distribution was measured using electromagnetic sensors for various factors of the multi-strand system adopted on site in the fabrication of actual PSC girders. The results verified the possibility to assume normal distribution for the prestress force distribution per <b>anchor</b> <b>head,</b> and a method computing the mean and standard deviation defining the normal distribution is proposed.

40|$|Various {{anchorage}} systems {{including both}} cast-in-place and post-installed anchors {{have been developed}} for fastening both non-structural and structural components to concrete structures. The need for increased flexibility in the design of new structures and strengthening of existing concrete structures has led to increased use of various metallic anchors in practice. Although millions of fasteners are used each year in the construction industry around the world, knowledge of the fastening technology remains poor. In a sustainable society, buildings and structures must, from time to time, be adjusted to meet new demands. Loads on structures must, in general, be increased to comply with new demands, and the structural components and the structural connections must also be upgraded. From the structural connection point of view, the adequacy of the current fastenings for the intended increased load must be determined, and inadequate fastenings must either be replaced or upgraded. The current design models are generally believed to be conservative, although the extent of this behavior is not very clear. To address these issues, the current models must be refined to allow the design of new fastenings and also the assessment of current anchorage systems in practice. The research presented in this thesis consists of numerical and experimental studies of the load-carrying capacity of anchors in concrete structures. Two different types of anchors were studied: (I) cast-in-place headed anchors, and (II) post-installed adhesive anchors. This research focused particularly on the tensile load-carrying capacity of cast-in-place headed anchors and also on the sustained tension loading performance of post-installed adhesive anchors. The overall objective of this research was to provide knowledge for the development of improved methods of designing new fastening systems and assessing the current anchorage systems in practice. For the cast-in-place headed anchors (I), the influence of various parameters including the size of <b>anchor</b> <b>head,</b> thickness of concrete member, amount of orthogonal surface reinforcement, presence of concrete cracks, concrete compressive strength, and addition of steel fibers to concrete were studied. Among these parameters, the influence of the <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> size, member thickness, surface reinforcement, and cracked concrete was initially evaluated via numerical analysis of headed anchors at various embedment depths. Although these parameters have considerable influence on the anchorage capacity and performance, this influence is not explicitly considered by the current design models. The numerical results showed that the tensile breakout capacity of headed anchors increases with increasing member thickness and/or increasing size of the <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> or the use of orthogonal surface reinforcement. However, their capacity decreased considerably in cracked concrete. Based on the numerical results, the current theoretical model for the tensile breakout capacity of headed anchors was extended by incorporating several modification factors that take the influence of the investigated parameters into account. In addition, a supplementary experimental study was performed to verify the numerically obtained findings and the proposed refined model. The experimental results corresponded closely to the numerical results, both in terms of failure load and failure pattern, thereby confirming the validity of the proposed model. The validity of the model was further confirmed through experimental results reported in the literature. Additional experiments were performed to determine the influence of the concrete compressive strength and the addition of steel fiber to concrete on the anchorage capacity and performance. These experiments showed that the anchorage capacity and stiffness increase considerably with increasing concrete compressive strength, but the ductility of the anchor decreases. However, the anchorage capacity and ductility increased significantly with the addition of steel fibers to the concrete mixture. The test results also revealed that the tensile breakout capacity of headed anchors in steel fiber-reinforced concrete is significantly underestimated by the current design model. The long-term performance and creep behavior of the post-installed headed anchors (II) was evaluated from the results of long-time tests on adhesive anchors under sustained loads. In this experimental study, adhesive anchors of various sizes were subjected to various sustained load levels for up to 28 years. The anchors were also exposed to several in-service conditions including indoor temperature, variations in the outdoor temperature and humidity, wetness (i. e., water on the surface of concrete), and the presence of salt (setting accelerant) additives in the concrete. Among the tested in-service conditions, variations in the outdoor temperature and humidity had the most adverse effect on the long-term sustained loading performance of the anchors. Based on the test results, recommendations were proposed for maximum sustained load levels under various conditions. The anchors tested under indoor conditions could carry sustained loads of up to 47 % of their mean ultimate short-term capacities. However, compared with these anchors, the anchors tested under outdoor conditions exhibited larger creep deformation and failure occurred at sustained loads higher than 23 % of their mean ultimate short-term capacities. Salt additives in concrete and wet conditions had negligible influence on the long-term performance of the anchors, although the wet condition resulted in progressive corrosion of the steel. Based on the experimental results, the suitability of the current testing and approval provisions for qualifying adhesive anchors subjected to long-term sustained tensile loads was evaluated. The evaluations revealed that the current approval provisions are not necessarily reliable for qualifying adhesive anchors for long-term sustained loading applications. Recommendations were given for modifying the current provisions to ensure safe long-term performance of adhesive anchors under sustained loads...|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composite rods appear {{very promising}} {{to be used}} as an alternative to steel in prestressed concrete structures and ground anchors, especially for applications exposed to corrosive environments. The objectives of this study are to investigate the bond behavior of FRP rods to grout filled in steel tubes and hence to develop a competent bond-type anchorage system for post-tensioning applications with FRP multirod tendons. The research program includes pullout tests of grouted FRP rods and proving tests of the developed anchorage system for post-tensioning applications. Modeling the bond behavior and predicting the load bearing capacity of bond-type anchorage systems are also involved. Numerous (over 50) pullout tests were conducted and discussed to better understand bond mechanisms and the influence of type of fiber, outer surface, and other significant parameters (i. e., confining stiffness, grout type and curing condition) on bond performance. Modeling of bond-slip behavior of grouted FRP rods is examined to assess its adequacy to reproduce the experimental bond behavior. Based on the monitoring results of strain distribution along the bonded length, the working mechanism of bond-type anchorages for FRP tendons is discussed. A conceptual model for calculating the bond stress at the tendon-grout interface and the tensile capacity of bond-type anchorages for FRP tendons is established. A new bond-type anchorage system has been developed for post-tensioning applications with FRP tendons. Evaluations of the developed anchorage system have been conducted in anchorage models with CFRP mono- and 9 - rod tendons under tensile and sustained loading conditions. Furthermore, the developed anchorage system has also been used as an <b>anchor</b> <b>head</b> for post-tensioning of a full-scale FRP anchor model. Primary test results have indicated that the developed bond-type anchorage performs well for post-tensioning applications with FRP tendons. Conclusions and recommendations are made on the design of bond-type anchorages and post-tensioning applications of FRP tendons. Six related papers have been published in referred journals or international conferences, including two papers in the ASCE Journal of Composites for Construction, one in Construction and Building Materials (UK), one in the Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, and two in the international conferences...|$|E
