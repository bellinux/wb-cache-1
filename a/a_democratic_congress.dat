500|$|Republicans felt Wilson {{was making}} a {{political}} issue of the peace, especially when the president urged <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress</b> prior to the 1918 election, and attended the Paris Peace Conference in person, taking no Republicans on his delegation. Wilson had felt his statement was the only chance of getting a Senate that might ratify a treaty for a postwar organization to keep the peace, and deemed conciliation pointless. [...] In Paris, Wilson and other leaders negotiated {{what would become the}} League of Nations, an international organization that world leaders hoped that through diplomacy, and if necessary, force, would assure peace. [...] Republican senatorial opinion ranged from the Irreconcilables like Borah, who would not support any organization, to those who strongly favored one; none wanted Wilson to go into the 1920 presidential election with credit for having sorted out Europe. Once the general terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which included the Charter of the League of Nations, were presented by Wilson in February 1919, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, the incoming Senate Majority Leader, decided on a strategy: rather than outright opposition, Republicans would offer reservations to the treaty that Wilson could not accept.|$|E

50|$|Nixon, who {{replaced}} Johnson in 1969, {{referred to his}} foreign policy as détente, or a relaxation of tension. Although it continued to aim at restraining the Soviet Union, {{it was based on}} political realism, or thinking in terms of national interest, as opposed to crusades against communism or for democracy. Emphasis was placed on talks with the Soviet Union concerning nuclear weapons called the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Nixon reduced U.S. military presence in Vietnam to the minimum required to contain communist advances, a policy called Vietnamization. As the war continued, it grew less popular. <b>A</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress</b> forced Nixon, a Republican, to abandon this policy in 1973 by enacting the Case-Church Amendment.

50|$|Campbell's Democratic {{colleague}} Robert L. F. Sikes of Crestview, Florida, depicted Campbell as:hard-working, dedicated, {{and capable}} but ineffective in public speaking.

I attempted to help him and even wrote out some short messages which I thought would be effective in getting his story across to his constituents. I was dismayed when I heard him deliver them. He sounded like a third grader struggling through a reading assignment. Cramer was articulate, a successful lawyer, and he already enjoyed some recognition in public life.

50|$|When Democrat Woodrow Wilson {{was elected}} President with <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1912 he {{implemented}} {{a series of}} Progressive policies in economics. In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified, and a small income tax was imposed on high incomes. The Democrats lowered tariffs with the Underwood Tariff in 1913, though its effects were overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by the World War that broke out in 1914. Wilson proved especially effective in mobilizing public opinion behind tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists, addressing Congress in person in highly dramatic fashion, and staging an elaborate ceremony when he signed the bill into law. Wilson helped end the long battles over the trusts with the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. He managed to convince lawmakers {{on the issues of}} money and banking by the creation in 1913 of the Federal Reserve System, a complex business-government partnership that to this day dominates the financial world.|$|E

5000|$|Overall, {{enforcement}} was Cox's stated priority {{beginning in}} 2005 and throughout his chairmanship.

[...] Within the SEC budget, as of 2008, he had increased the share devoted to enforcement to its highest level in 20 years. [...] Nonetheless, the SEC's overall appropriation was held steady during two of his budget years, first by a Republican and then <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congress,</b> and it was increased by only 2% in a third year. [...] These sub-inflation agency budgets, combined with merit pay increases for staff, caused the total enforcement personnel to decline. [...] Critics attacked the underfunding of the SEC and blamed Cox, though Congress and the administration clearly shared the responsibility. When the agency budget was finally increased in fiscal 2008, he increased enforcement personnel by 4%.|$|E
