Hence, we try to disentangle random and fixed scheme cost effects by applying a bootstrapped mixed-effects regression approach using the empirical case of the Environmental Stewardship Scheme in the UK.

Equivalence {{of these conditions}} boundary condition is substantiated classical, in the case if {{the solution of the}} problem in the izotropic S. L. Sobolev's space is found. The considered equation as a pseudo-parabolic equation generalizes not only classic equations of mathematical physics (heat-conductivity equations, string vibration equation) and also many models differential equations (Aller's equation, Manjeron equation, telegraph equation, moisture transfer generalized equation, Boussinesq- Love equation and etc.). It is grounded that the contact-boundary conditions in the classic and non-classic treatment are equivalent to each other, and such boundary conditions are demonstrated in geometric form. Even from geometric interpretation can see that the grounded non-classic treatment doesn't require any additional conditions of <b>agreement</b> <b>type.</b> Thus, namely in this paper, the non-classic problem with contact-boundary conditions is grounded for a pseudo-parabolic equation.

40|$|A {{reflection}} on ergativity in Modern and Middle Indo-Aryan languages It is generally accepted in linguistic circles that several Modern Indo-Aryan languages display traces of ergativity (cf. Masica 1991 : 341). Ergativity {{has been defined}} as a grammatical pattern “in which the subject of an intransitive clause is treated {{in the same way as}} the object of a transitive clause, and differently from transitive subject ” (Dixon 1994 : 1). These languages (including Hindi, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Marathi, Marwari, Nepali etc) are sometimes called ‘ergative languages’, in analogy with other non Indo-Aryan languages which also display the same kind of alignment features (eg. Georgian, Dyirbal). However, to call these languages fully ergative is an exaggeration, as they only display certain features which are considered ergative. The way the ergative features are distributed differs for each Modern Indo-Aryan language, and is reflected either in the agreement patterning or in the case marking. It has been conjectured in previous literature that Middle Indo-Aryan languages also display ergative features (cf. Bubenik 1998). In examples taken from Apabhramsha the verb agrees with its logical object and thus forms an <b>agreement</b> <b>type</b> which is ergative. The subject-agen...|$|E

In addition to word-choice for example, {{whether or not a}} product of translation is good can be identified by its grammatical structure of sentences. Wrong or incomplete grammar in writing may sometimes cause readers to get confused in understanding the message. This study aims at investigating grammatical errors made by the students of English Study Program Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sriwijaya University in translating first language into the target language, English. The major types of errors made by the students were related to incomplete clauses having no either subjects, verbs, or neither both, subject verb agreement and the absence of subordinators and plural nouns. Out of the six types of identified grammatical errors, incomplete plural nouns ranked number one followed by the absence of verb, and subject-verb agreement. The highest number of students making mistakes on using plural nouns was 22 (73 %), and the lowest one on the absence of subject and verb was 5 (17 %).

40|$|Some {{languages}} {{allow for}} phonetically null arguments in certain environments. Others do not. This phenomenon, known as pro-drop, arose {{particular interest in}} the 80 s with the theory of Government and Binding (Chomsky l 981) {{and the advent of}} a principles and parameters approach to the theory of grammar. One particularly well-studied phenomenon was subject drop in rich agreement, Italian-type languages, where the occurrence of null subjects correlates with a set of other syntactic properties, thus suggesting that the same abstract property is responsible for apparently unrelated syntactic phenomena. This article starts by reviewing the classic Government and Binding (Chomsky l 981) approach to pro-drop, according to which a phonetically null pronominal argument (pro) is an inherently unspecified nominal projection whose features are supplied contextually. In the case of the rich agreement null subject languages, it was assumed that pro’s φ-features are identified by Agr. This view is incompatible with the approach to feature theory developed in the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995, 2000, 2001) given that, in this theory, the φ-features in T (=Agr) are uninterpretable and thus not specified for a particular value. In Part 1 of this article we concentrate on the family of analyses that propose that what characterizes the NSLs of the rich <b>agreement</b> <b>type</b> is that the head bearing subject agreement has a nominal specification and valued phi-features; i. e., Agr behaves like a pronoun spelled out as an affix.

Yet, little is known about whether and how the way in which agreement is reached affects epistemic outcomes. In a lab experiment with a 3 x 2 design, undergraduate participants stated their opinion about a target person to a partner who ostensibly (a) either agreed before and after the communication (fortuitous agreement), shifted from disagreement to agreement (persuaded agreement), or consistently disagreed (no agreement); and (b) either praised their argument quality (substance evaluation) or presentational style (style evaluation). I hypothesized that the fortuitous and persuaded agreement conditions would yield a greater experience of shared reality (H 1) and thus, greater epistemic outcomes than the no agreement condition (H 2 A), and that the relationship between agreement and epistemic outcomes would be mediated by the experience of shared reality (H 2 B). I also hypothesized that a substance evaluation would lead to greater shared reality and epistemic outcomes than a style evaluation, but only in the persuaded agreement condition (H 3). Results supported H 1 and H 2 A, partially supported H 2 B, but did not support H 3. The fortuitous and persuaded agreement conditions yielded greater shared reality, higher belief certainty, and greater epistemic trust than the no agreement condition. Agreement type’s effect on epistemic trust was mediated by the experience of shared reality but shared reality did not mediate the relationship between <b>agreement</b> <b>type</b> and belief certainty.

A nominalization may be taken to be a concrete interpretation of the event itself or one of its participants. The verbal derivational morpheme {ip} signals medio-passive voice, in which the executor of the event is not the agent of the event. The verbal derivational morpheme {ec} signals increased transitivity, by which transitive verbs are derived from intransitive, transitive verbs are made more transitive through an increase of some parameter of transitivity, and causatives are created {{with the help of}} the medio-passive morpheme. The middle-voice {k} morpheme signals that the executor of the event is affected by the action of the event, as in statives, intransitives, and reflexives. Participant <b>agreement</b> <b>type</b> is lexically marked for verbs, but paradigmatic contrast shows the markers to be semantically motivated. Types I and II marking vary with respect to control of the event, and Types II and III marking vary with respect to envelopment by the event.

40|$|The first topic {{this thesis}} {{examines}} {{is that of}} firms which enter and leave cartels without affecting {{the existence of the}} cartel. The first chapter predicts which firms in markets will choose to join and leave cartels. The findings align with a group of theoretical models identified in the literature review, indicating that cartel membership is explained by�firms' individual preferences for collusion, which are consistent over time. The firms most likely to join and leave cartels are small firms in large cartels. The second chapter questions what effect this behaviour by firms has on the survivability of cartels. Theory is ambiguous on this, since entry and exit by firms could signal poor discipline among cartelists which prevents the cartel from raising prices substantially due to undercutting by outsiders or it could signal a structurally stable cartel which marginal firms take advantage of in their membership decisions. Cartels which experienced more entry and exit by firms had a lower risk of breakdown in each period than cartels with more static membership, indicating that member firms recognise when cartels are strong and take advantage of this by constantly re-evaluating their membership decisions. The�final chapter discusses a different topic: the <b>types</b> of <b>agreement</b> formed by cartels. All cartels must agree to either �x prices, restrict the output of its members, allocate exclusive territories, allocation customers, or rig bids in order to fulfil their objective of raising member profits. Many cartels engage in more than one of these practices simultaneously. Structural variables are poor at predicting the presence of <b>agreement</b> <b>types</b> in the cartels studied, but distinct strategy pro�les where certain <b>agreement</b> <b>types</b> substitute for each other or complement each other are present.

Cooper's Test {{is one example of}} an indirect method considered reliable in estimating V̇O 2 max, with reliability coefficients ranging between 0. 897 - 0. 960. Cooper's Test is thus a test that is often used when estimating V̇O 2 max. However, {{there is a lack of}} test-retest research done utilising Cooper's Test on a younger population, which is the reasoning behind this study focusing on adolescents. Aim: The aim of the study was to study the test-retest reliability of Cooper's Test, in adolescents aged 16 - 19 years. Methods: Twelve healthy adolescents, aged 16 - 19 years, attending a sports high school participated in a test-retest study (test 1 and test 2) of Cooper's Test. The tests were performed on the short sides of a synthetic grass field, with 66 metres between the two sides, were the participants were instructed to cover as much distance as possible, with high motivation and intensity, for the whole 12 minutes of the Cooper's Test. Each individual participant's data was measured, recorded and later analysed. The total distance covered was then translated into miles and compared to Cooper's original estimated maximal oxygen consumption table for an estimation of each participant's V̇O 2 max value in ml*kg- 1 *min- 1 from test 1 and test 2. The data from the test-retest and its variance was then analysed by a two-way mixed model of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with an absolute <b>agreement</b> <b>type.</b> Results: The analysed data from test 1 and test 2 of Cooper's Test showed the results of an ICC (95 % CI) of 0. 06 (- 0. 353 to 0. 544), indicating a substantial error variance between the two separate Cooper's Tests. Conclusion: The data and analysis from this study implied that Cooper's Test was not reliable in the study population, consisting of adolescents. Possible factors influencing the result however were lack of participant motivation and the level of intensity variance during the test-retest of Cooper's Test. Further researchers and amateur and professional users should keep these factors in mind when utilising Cooper's Test to predict V̇O 2 max. More research is needed within this study's age population to draw any definite conclusions on the reliability of Cooper's test on adolescents...|$|E

Purpose {{of this study}} is to find out significant mean differences between teachers’ competency in classroom assessment based on academic qualification, professional qualification, experience in teaching, experience in constructing classroom assessment and experience in attending assessment related courses. A total 367 teachers were drawn from Johor Bahru District secondary schools using sampling frame provided by Johor Bahru district education Office to be the respondents of the study. Sample size of this study was selected using formula to determine sample size as suggested by Israel. Reseacher has used random sampling to select respondents for the study. The study used a questionnaire which has Alpha Cronbach value 0. 95 to establish teachers’ perceptions about classroom assessment and Alpha Cronbach value 0. 85 for self-evaluation of teachers’competency in constructing classroom assessment. Part A of the questionnaire contained 8 items related to demography of the respondents. Part B(i) consists of 15 items related to teachers’perception about classroom assessment answered by respondents using <b>agreement</b> <b>type</b> Likert Scale and Part B (ii), consists 40 items about self-evaluation of teachers’competency in constructing classroom assessment answered by the respondents using frequency type Likert scale. Research question 1 and 2 were answered using descriptive analysis using statistical test frequency, mean and percentage whereby research questions 3 to 7 were answered using inferential analysis using statistical test one-way ANOVA. Hypotheses null 1 to 5 were analysed using One Way ANOVA and Post Hoc Test. Findings research question 1 indicated that teachers have positive perception about classroom assessment with mean = 4. 01 which was high. Findings on research question 2 about teachers’ competency in constructing classroom assessment based on six constructs namely planning classroom assessment (mean = 3. 77); constructing classroom assessment 9 (mean = 3. 69); assembling classroom assessment (mean score: 3. 81); administering classroom assessment (mean = 3. 8); scoring classroom assessment (mean = 3. 77) and appraising classroom assessment (mean = 3. 72) indicated that teachers in Johor Bahru District Secondary schools have high competency in administering and assembling classroom assessment, whereby they have least competency in constructing and appraising classroom assessment.
