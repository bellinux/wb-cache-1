25|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 20th century, there has been ongoing debate within Adventism {{concerning}} the nature of Jesus Christ, specifically whether Jesus Christ took on a fallen or an unfallen nature in the Incarnation. This was precipitated by the publication of Questions on Doctrine in 1957 which some Adventists felt did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the church held.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{anthropologist}} Margaret Murray and occultist Aleister Crowley {{are among those}} who questioned {{the involvement of the}} ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case. Murray, who propagated the witch-cult hypothesis, speculated in her book The Witch-Cult in Western Europe that Gilles de Rais was really a witch and adherent of a fertility cult centered on the pagan goddess, Diana. However, most historians reject Murray's theory. Norman Cohn argues that her theory does not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> is known of Gilles' crimes and trial. Historians do not regard Gilles as a martyr to a pre-Christian religion; other scholars tend to view him as a lapsed Catholic who descended into crime and depravity, whose real crimes caused the land forfeitures.|$|E

50|$|Extrapolation {{arguments}} are informal and unquantified arguments which assert {{that something is}} true beyond the range of values {{for which it is}} known to be true. For example, we believe in the reality of what we see through magnifying glasses because it <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> we see <b>with</b> the naked eye but extends beyond it; we believe in what we see through light microscopes because it <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> we see through magnifying glasses but extends beyond it; and similarly for electron microscopes.|$|R
500|$|As well as {{providing}} social commentary, Odyssey Number Five also discussed love, a recurring motif in Fanning's songwriting. Fanning noted {{that one of}} the causes of this was his passion for soul and gospel music, stating that he [...] "listen to a lot of soul music that's unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel". Lead guitarist Ian Haug agreed, and also noted that the band as a whole were fully committed to Fanning's lyrics, stating [...] "It's really important for us to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> Bernard is singing." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Frederick {{demonstrated}} good {{leadership by}} rallying his troops against the surprise attack, Hochkirch {{is considered one}} of his worst losses, and it badly shook his equanimity. [...] Andrew Mitchell, the British envoy who was with them, and normally wrote positively about Frederick, attributed Frederick's loss to the contempt he had for Daun's supposedly cautious nature and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> he imagined was true: according to Mitchell, {{there was no one to}} blame but himself. That winter, Mitchell described the 46-year-old Frederick as [...] "an old man lacking half of his teeth, with greying hair, without gaiety or spark or imagination." [...] Frederick suffered from gout and influenza, and refused to change his uniform, which was moth-eaten and covered in food and snuff stains.|$|E
500|$|Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci {{may have}} seen this animal on his fourth voyage, which took him to Brazil; the Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle Isole Nuovamente in Quattro Suoi Viaggi recorded that he visited an island {{just south of the}} equator on August 10, 1503. On this island, identified as Fernando de Noronha, he saw [...] "very big rats and lizards with two tails, and some snakes". The Lettera purports to be an account of Vespucci's voyages, but it is unlikely that he produced it himself and, additionally, his fourth voyage may never have actually taken place. The biological details given in the Letteras account of Fernando de Noronha <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> is known of the natural history of the island, lending weight to the view that it derives from an actual visit, whether by Vespucci himself or by another explorer. The lizard is probably Trachylepis atlantica and the record of snakes most likely refers to Amphisbaena ridleyi, which is actually an amphisbaenian instead of a snake.|$|E

500|$|Due to its {{tone and}} subject matter, it is {{considered}} one of the band's darker songs, alongside [...] "Adam's Song", their 2000 single revolving around suicide. Hoppus told an interviewer at the time of the album's release that [...] "There's always a song or two where we really try to really push ourselves [...] On this new record I think we've done a lot of different stuff that people wouldn't ever expect from us. [...] On the new one, it's 'Stay Together for the Kids.'" [...] DeLonge later confirmed he had received emails from fans thanking him for the song's message. [...] "With [...] "Stay Together", we get emails—just kid after kid after kid—saying, 'I know exactly what you're talking about! That song is about my life!'" [...] In 2002, divorce statistics were four times higher than their average just over thirty years prior, with over 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce. [...] "You look at statistics that 50 percent of parents get divorced, and you’re going to get a pretty large group of kids who are pissed off and who don’t <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> their parents have done," [...] said DeLonge. [...] "Stay Together" [...] was the final song completed during the recording sessions; it was created one day before the album was handed off to the mixing engineer.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Hayes {{quit the}} serial and her exit storyline played {{out the same}} year. It was {{initially}} left unclear what impact her departure would have on Miles'. Their relationship deteriorates after Kirsty miscarries their unborn baby. Kirsty is left distraught and feels she has to move with her life without Miles. However, Kirsty does not tell Miles she is leaving and leaves him a goodbye letter. Speaking of the scenes, Hayes said [...] "I don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> she did or how she did it but Kirsty in her warped, grieving mind thinks it's best for everybody." [...] She felt that Kirsty's actions were [...] "horrible and selfish." [...] She also described her as [...] "emotionally detached" [...] and Miles {{would have tried to}} talk her out of leaving if he had been made aware of her departure. Viewers were not shown the full content of the goodbye letter. Hayes said it was good because she wrote a private goodbye letter to Quong Tart, and noted the personal element was best left between the two. After Miles chances of a family are again ruined, Miles loses control. He starts drinking and on one occasion he tries to kiss Leah. Producers decided to introduce a character named Rabbit (Mitzi Ruhlmann), who [...] "brings a little fun back into Miles' life." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the lead}} up to the {{publication}} date, at a panel event at the New York Comic Con, Jensen was asked by a fan holding a [...] "plush Anarky doll" [...] what the character's role {{would be in the}} story. Jensen explained that Anarky [...] "would have a very big hand" [...] in the story, and further explained, [...] "you can understand what he's doing even if you don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> he's doing." [...] Jensen had also indicated that his version of Anarky would be a [...] "fresh take that also honors his legacy." [...] The story featured a character study of John Stewart, narrating Stewart's final mission as a young Marine {{in the midst of a}} Gotham City power blackout and citywide evacuation, mere days before a major storm is to hit the city. Anarky is depicted as rallying a group of followers and evacuees to occupy a sports stadium, on the basis that the area the stadium was built upon was gentrified at the expense of the local community and should be returned to them. The storyline brought two particular additions to the revamped version of Anarky; the first being that this new version of Anarky is portrayed as an African American; the second being to preserve the character's anonymity, as Anarky escapes custody at the end of the story without an identity behind the mask being revealed.|$|E

It's out of my control, just like the fact that cricket balls are made of leather".|$|E
2500|$|On 9 February 1886 Parnell {{declared}} {{to the voters}} of Galway that [...] "If my candidate is defeated, the news will spread round the universe that a disaster has overwhelmed Ireland.

50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{consequence of}} Birkhoff's theorem {{is that for}} a spherically symmetric thin shell, the interior solution must be given by the Minkowski metric; in other words, the gravitational field must vanish inside a spherically symmetric shell.
