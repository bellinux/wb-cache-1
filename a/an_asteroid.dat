50|$|In July 2015, NASA {{announced}} plans to redirect <b>a</b> small <b>asteroid</b> {{as part of the}} DART project in 2022, attempting to redirect <b>a</b> small <b>asteroid</b> named Didymos B, part of <b>a</b> binary <b>asteroid</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|... is <b>a</b> small <b>asteroid</b> that is <b>a</b> Near-Earth {{object and}} <b>an</b> Apollo <b>asteroid.</b>|$|R
5|$|When {{the mean}} orbital period of <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> is an integer {{fraction}} of the orbital period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> to new orbital elements. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit, or due to prior perturbations or collisions) are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller semi-major axis.|$|E
5|$|A vulcanoid is <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> in {{a stable}} orbit with a semi-major axis {{less than that of}} Mercury (i.e. 0.387AU). This does not include objects like sungrazing comets, which, {{although}} they have perihelia inside the orbit of Mercury, have far greater semi-major axes.|$|E
5|$|Clay-like {{minerals}} (specifically, phyllosilicates), {{often associated}} with organic matter on Earth, have been detected on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals {{may have been the}} result of a collision with <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> or comet.|$|E
5000|$|... is <b>a</b> small <b>asteroid</b> that is <b>a</b> near-Earth object, an Earth coorbital, and <b>an</b> Apollo <b>asteroid.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... (provisional {{designation}} [...] ) is <b>an</b> Apollo <b>asteroid.</b> It {{is planned}} that the Japanese space probe Hayabusa 2 returns samples from this asteroid by December 2020. It is the rare spectral type Cg, having qualities of both <b>a</b> C-type <b>asteroid</b> and <b>a</b> G-type <b>asteroid.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the SMASS classification, Dersu-Uzala is <b>a</b> A-type <b>asteroid.</b> It {{has also}} been {{characterized}} as <b>a</b> E-type <b>asteroid.</b>|$|R
5|$|Concern for {{the future}} of {{civilisation}} prompted him to install fivekilowatts of photovoltaic cells (for solar energy) at his house. Having been interested in astronomy since childhood, he had an observatory built in his garden. <b>An</b> <b>asteroid</b> (127005 Pratchett) is named after him.|$|E
5|$|Its {{rotation}} {{is relatively}} fast for <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> (5.342h) and prograde, {{with the north}} pole pointing {{in the direction of}} right ascension 20h32min, declination +48° (in the constellation Cygnus) with an uncertainty of about 10°. This gives an axial tilt of 29°.|$|E
5|$|Juno was {{discovered}} on 1 September 1804, by Karl Ludwig Harding. It {{was the third}} asteroid found, but was initially {{considered to be a}} planet; it was reclassified as <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> and minor planet during the 1850s.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} {{needed to}} move <b>a</b> large <b>asteroid</b> into <b>an</b> arbitrary orbit does not yet exist; altering <b>an</b> <b>asteroid's</b> orbit around the Sun would require a large delta-v to be imparted to an object with a mass several orders of magnitude greater than existing spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|It is {{classified}} as <b>an</b> Apollo <b>asteroid</b> because it is <b>a</b> near-Earth <b>asteroid</b> with <b>a</b> semi-major axis larger than Earth's.|$|R
5000|$|... 1852 Carpenter, {{provisional}} designation , is <b>a</b> <b>asteroid</b> {{from the}} outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 20 kilometers in diameter.|$|R
5|$|Most paleontologists now {{agree that}} <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> did hit the Earth at {{approximately}} {{the end of}} the Cretaceous, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the extinctions.|$|E
5|$|The Himalia {{group is}} spread over barely 1.4Gm in semi-major axes, 1.6° in {{inclination}} (27.5±0.8°), and eccentricities between 0.11 and 0.25. It {{has been suggested}} that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> from the asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|According to the UNESCO's Index Translationum, Hergé is the ninth-most-often-translated French-language author, the second-most-often-translated Belgian author after Georges Simenon, and the second-most-often-translated French-language comics author behind René Goscinny. He {{also had}} <b>an</b> <b>asteroid,</b> 1652 Hergé, within the main belt, {{named after him}} in 1953.|$|E
5000|$|... 6349 Acapulco, {{provisional}} designation , is <b>a</b> <b>asteroid</b> {{from the}} middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 22 kilometers in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{challenge}} is to find <b>a</b> suitable <b>asteroid</b> to retrieve - objects of the desired size are very dim and difficult to find. <b>As</b> many larger <b>asteroids</b> are known, <b>an</b> alternative for the retrieval of <b>a</b> small <b>asteroid</b> is to [...] "pick up" [...] a suitable sized rock from <b>a</b> larger <b>asteroid,</b> and move only that rock to a lunar or EML2 orbit.|$|R
5000|$|It will be <b>an</b> outer Mars-crossing <b>asteroid</b> with {{perihelion}} (q) {{less than}} 1.666 AU until July 2017. For comparison, asteroid 4222 Nancita will become <b>a</b> Mars-crossing <b>asteroid</b> in June 2019. [...] was <b>a</b> Mars-crossing <b>asteroid</b> until January 2016.|$|R
5|$|Alien Rage {{takes place}} on <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> which humans and an alien species known as Vorus were jointly mining for Promethium, a highly {{efficient}} source of energy. After the Vorus turn on the humans and wipe the miners out, Jack, the player character, {{is sent to the}} mining facility to kill the aliens and destroy the facility.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Slotin's {{colleagues at}} Los Alamos and the University of Chicago {{initiated}} the Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Nobel laureates Luis Walter Alvarez and Hans Bethe. The memorial fund lasted until 1962. In 2002, <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> discovered in 1995 was named 12423 Slotin in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Juno, minor-planet {{designation}} 3 Juno in the Minor Planet Center catalogue system, is <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> in {{the asteroid}} belt. Juno {{was the third}} asteroid discovered, in 1804, by German astronomer Karl Harding. It is the 11th-largest asteroid, {{and one of the}} two largest stony (S-type) asteroids, along with 15 Eunomia. It is estimated to contain 1% of the total mass of the asteroid belt.|$|E
50|$|Lyyli is <b>a</b> X-type <b>asteroid</b> in the SMASS classification. It {{has also}} been {{characterized}} as <b>a</b> P-type <b>asteroid</b> by NASA's NEOWISE mission.|$|R

5000|$|... 7088 Ishtar (1992 AA) is <b>an</b> Amor <b>asteroid</b> {{discovered}} on January 1, 1992, by Shoemaker, C. S. at Palomar. It is <b>a</b> binary <b>asteroid.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Sun {{has eight}} known planets. This {{includes}} four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also {{has at least}} five dwarf planets, <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt, numerous comets, {{and a large number}} of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The data {{returned}} from the Galileo flybys of Gaspra and Ida, and the later NEAR Shoemaker asteroid mission, permitted the first study of asteroid geology. Ida's relatively large surface exhibited a diverse range of geological features. The discovery of Ida's moon Dactyl, the first confirmed satellite of <b>an</b> <b>asteroid,</b> provided additional insights into Ida's composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of the asteroid belt varies with {{the distance from the}} Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200K (−73°C) at 2.2AU down to 165K (−108°C) at 3.2AU However, due to rotation, the surface {{temperature of}} <b>an</b> <b>asteroid</b> can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.|$|E
5000|$|... 2102 Tantalus (1975 YA) is <b>an</b> Apollo <b>asteroid</b> {{discovered}} on December 27, 1975, by C. Kowal at Palomar Observatory. It is <b>a</b> Q-type <b>asteroid.</b>|$|R
