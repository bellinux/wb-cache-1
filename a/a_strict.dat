5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} <b>a</b> <b>strict</b> hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level.

A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the industrialists' claim that stricter {{environmental}} standards reduce the industry output, competition, and hence social welfare rests solely on the "cost" effect of <b>a</b> <b>stricter</b> standard and ignores its "demand" effect. It considers situations where firms' pollution abatement increases the industry demand, but, because of inability to coordinate their emissions reductions, and thus free-riding problem, they can not act in their own collective interest. The paper examines the effects of <b>a</b> <b>stricter</b> standard in such situations both at the individual firm and industry levels and when entry/exit is free as well as {{when the number of}} firms is fixed. It identifies conditions under which <b>a</b> <b>stricter</b> standard leads to a larger number of firms in the industry, a greater industry output, and a lower total pollution in the long-run; and to higher levels of firms' profits and output in the short-run. It also shows that for the industry to survive, a minimum pollution standard may be necessary. Further, it analyzes the welfare effects of <b>a</b> <b>stricter</b> standard and indicates situations in which the regulator may prefer no standards to weak ones. ...|$|R
