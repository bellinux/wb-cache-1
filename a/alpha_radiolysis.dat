The continuous counter current process, in which actinides(III) were separated from lanthanides(III), {{was carried out in}} laboratory centrifugal contactors using an optimised flow-sheet involving a total of 16 stages. The process was divided into 9 stages for extraction from a 2 M nitric acid feed solution, 3 stages for lanthanide scrubbing and 4 stages for actinide back-extraction. Excellent feed decontamination factors for Am (7000) and Cm (1000) were obtained and the recoveries of these elements were higher than 99. 9 %. More than 99. 9 % of the lanthanides were directed to the raffinate except Gd for which 0. 32 % was recovered in the product. In addition the the radiolytic degradation of the CyMe 4 -BTBP based SANEX solvent has been investigated. As the solvent used in the extraction process is designed to separate trivalent actinides from lanthanides, the radiolytic degradation is mainly due to alpha decay of extracted minor actinide isotopes. A calculation of dose-rates was done by estimating the concentration of minor actinides in the solvent by fuel burn-up calculations and assumptions on dilutions in the subsequent reprocessing steps. Several radiolysis experiments were carried out in order to compare the effect of low LET external gamma radiation (0. 2 kGy/h) and internal alpha radiation with different dose-rates (0. 05, 0. 2 and 1. 0 kGy/h).

A simplified chemical composition was considered for the nuclear glass under study, wherein the dose rate is about 140 Gy/h. The MCNPX calculation code was used to calculate alpha dose rate and alpha particle flux profiles at the glass/water interface in different systems: a single glass grain in water, a glass powder in water and a water-filled ideal crack in a glass package.

A general model has been proposed to fit a dose rate profile in water and in glass from values for dose rate in glass bulk, alpha range in water and linear energy transfer considerations. The glass powder simulation showed that there was systematic overlapping of radiation fields for neighboring glass grains, but the water dose rate always remained lower than the bulk value.

25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by <b>alpha</b> and gamma <b>radiolysis.</b> A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|R
40|$|The {{radiolysis}} of sorbed {{water and}} other impurities contained in actinide oxides {{has been the}} focus of a number of studies related to the establishment of criteria for the safe storage and transport of these materials. Gamma radiolysis studies have previously been performed on uranium oxides and oxyfluorides (UO{sub 3 }, U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }, and UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 }) to evaluate the long-term storage characteristics of {sup 233 }U. This report describes a similar study for <b>alpha</b> <b>radiolysis.</b> Uranium oxides and oxyfluorides (with {sup 238 }U as the surrogate for {sup 233 }U) were subjected to relatively high alpha radiation doses (235 to 634 MGy) by doping with {sup 244 }Cm. The typical irradiation time for these samples was about 1. 5 years, which would be equivalent to more than 50 years irradiation by a {sup 233 }U sample. Both dry and wet (up to 10 wt % water) samples were examined in an effort to identify the gas pressure and composition changes that occurred as a result of radiolysis. This study shows that several competing reactions occur during radiolysis, with the net effect that only very low pressures of hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide are generated from the water, nitrate, and carbon impurities, respectively, associated with the oxides. In the absence of nitrate impurities, no pressures greater than 1000 torr are generated. Usually, however, the oxygen in the air atmosphere over the oxides is consumed with the corresponding oxidation of the uranium oxide. In the presence of up to 10 wt % water, the oxides first show a small pressure rise followed by a net decrease due to the oxygen consumption and the attainment of a steady-state pressure where the rate of generation of gaseous components is balanced by their recombination and/or consumption in the oxide phase. These results clearly demonstrate that <b>alpha</b> <b>radiolysis</b> of either wet or dry {sup 233 }U oxides will not produce deleterious pressures or gaseous components that could compromise the long-term storage of these materials...|$|E

As the solvent used in the extraction process is designed to separate trivalent actinides from lanthanides, the radiolytic degradation is mainly due to alpha decay of extracted minor actinide isotopes. A calculation of dose-rates was done by estimating the concentration of minor actinides in the solvent by fuel burn-up calculations and assumptions on dilutions in the subsequent reprocessing steps. The calculations showed that the main isotopes responsible for the dose-rate are 242 Cm, 244 Cm and 241 Am. 242 Cm is short-lived and has an impact only at short cooling times before reprocessing of the spent fuel. The dose-rates to a SANEX solvent in the reprocessing of standard spent LWR fuels are burn-up dependent and range from at least 0. 03 ¿ 0. 2 kGy/h for UO 2 fuels and from 0. 4 to 0. 8 kGy/h for MOX fuels. Fast reactor fuels yield dose-rates over 1 kGy/h. Based on these results, several radiolysis experiments were carried out in order to compare the effect of low LET external gamma radiation (0. 2 kGy/h) and internal alpha radiation with different dose-rates (0. 05, 0. 2 and 1. 0 kGy/h).

40|$|The {{option of}} direct {{disposal}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} in a deep geological formation raises the need to investigate the long-term behavior of the UO 2 matrix in aqueous media subjected to alpha-beta-gamma radiation. The beta-gamma emitters account {{for most of the}} activity of spent fuel at the moment it is removed from the reactor, but diminish within a millennial time frame by over three orders of magnitude to less than the long-term activity. The latter persists over much longer time periods and must therefore be taken into account over a geological disposal time scale. Leaching experiments with solution renewal were carried out on UO 2 pellets doped with alpha emitters (Pu- 238 and Pu- 239) to quantify the impact of alpha irradiation on UO 2 matrix alteration. Three batches of doped UO 2 pellets with different alpha flux levels (3. 30 x 10 (4), 3. 30 x 10 (5), and 3. 2 x 10 (6) alphacm(- 2) s(- 1)) were studied. The results obtained in aerated and deaerated media immediately after sample annealing or interim storage in air provide {{a better understanding of the}} UO 2 matrix alteration mechanisms under alpha irradiation. Interim storage in air Of UO 2 pellets doped with alpha emitters results in variations of the UO 2 surface reactivity, which depends on the alpha particle flux at the interface and on the interim storage duration. The variation in the surface reactivity and the greater uranium release following interim storage cannot be attributed to the effect of <b>alpha</b> <b>radiolysis</b> in aerated media since the uranium release tends toward the same value after several leaching cycles for the doped UO 2 pellet batches and spent fuel. Oxygen diffusion enhanced by alpha irradiation of the extreme surface layer and/or radiolysis of the air could account for the oxidation of the surface UO 2 to UO 2 +x.

Given the very high reactivity of these samples in the presence of air and in order to minimize any prior surface oxidation, a strict experimental protocol was developed based on high-temperature annealing in Ar + 4 % H 2 with preleaching cycles. Failure to follow this protocol prevents absolute quantification of oxidation of the UO 2 surface by water radiolysis in solutions. Preoxidation of the pellet surface can lead to uranium release in solution that is dependent on the alpha particle flux, revealing initial oxidation by radiolysis in air including potential traces of water. This makes difficult the accurate quantification of the radiolytic oxidation in water solutions.

The development of a storage standard for 233 U (ref. 1) resulted in the identification of several needed radiolysis studies.

These factors are critical to the long-term performance of actual waste forms [1]. Lanthanide orthophosphates, including LuPO{sub 4 } and YPO{sub 4 }, have been suggested as waste forms for high level nuclear waste [2] and potential hosts for excess weapons plutonium [3, 4].

The uranium in solution was assayed using a kinetic phosphorescence analyzer (KPA), plutonium and americium were analyzed by a radiochemical route, and H 2 O 2 generated by the water radiolysis was quantified by chemiluminescence. Surface characterizations were performed before and after leaching using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Probe Microanalyzer (EPMA) and Raman spectroscopy. Solubility diagrams were calculated to support data discussion. The uranium releases from MOX pellets under both oxic and anoxic conditions were similar, demonstrating the predominant effect of <b>alpha</b> <b>radiolysis</b> on the oxidative dissolution of the pellets.

At repository temperatures, hydrogen is quite inert and is not expected to contribute to the redox capacity of the deep groundwaters. In several recent works, a large impact of dissolved hydrogen on the dissolution of the LWR or MOX fuel and UO 2 (s) doped with 233 U or 238 Pu has been observed. For hydrogen concentrations above a certain limit, the dissolution rates of these highly radioactive materials drop to very low values. A discussion of the results obtained with spent fuel or ?-doped UO 2 {{in the presence of a}} range of hydrogen concentrations is presented. Typical for all measurements under such conditions are the very low long term concentrations of uranium and other redox-sensitive radionuclides, such as Tc and the minor actinides. The concentrations of U are systematically lower than the values measured during UO 2 (s) solubility measurements carried out in the presence of strong reducing agents. Measurements of the radiolytic oxygen after long leaching periods result in values below detection limit. The investigation of the surface of spent fuel or UO 2 (s) pellets doped with 233 U by XPS after long periods of testing shows absence of oxidation. The kinetics of the release of non-redox sensitive elements such as Sr and Cs, used to estimate fuel matrix dissolution rates, is also discussed. An attempt is made to propose potential mechanisms responsible for the observed behaviour, based mainly on data from studies on the interaction of water adsorbed on the surfaces of metal oxides or actinide oxides with radiation.

In the presence of oxygen, the precious metal may also eliminate hydrogen by catalyzing the formation of water. This reaction is called catalytic recombination. DEB has the needed binding rate and capacity for hydrogen that potentially could be generated in the TRUPACT II. Phases 1 and 2 of this project showed that uncoated DEB performed satisfactorily in lab scale tests. Based upon these results, Phase 3, the final project phase, included larger scale testing. Test vessels were scaled to replicate the ratio between void space in the inner containment vessel of a TRUPACT-II container and a payload of seven 55 -gallon drums.

In all of the experiments, {sup 238 }U was used as a surrogate for the {sup 233 }U. For the water sorption experiments, uranium oxide samples were prepared and exposed to known levels of humidity to establish the water uptake rate. Subsequently, the amount of water removed was studied by heating samples in a oven at fixed temperatures and by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) /differential thermal analysis (DTA). It was demonstrated that heating at 650 C adequately removes all moisture from the samples. Uranium- 238 oxides were irradiated in a {sup 60 }Co source and in the high-gamma-radiation fields provided by spent nuclear fuel elements of the High Flux Isotope Reactor. For hydrated samples of UO{sub 3 }, H{sub 2 } was the primary gas produced; but the total gas pressure increase reached steady value of about 10 psi. This production appears to be a function of the dose and the amount of water present. Oxygen in the hydrated UO{sub 3 } sample atmosphere was typically depleted, and no significant pressure rise was observed. Heat treatment of the UO{sub 3 } {center_dot} xH{sub 2 }O at 650 C would result in conversion to U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } and eliminate the H{sub 2 } production.

The determination of trace amounts of aluminum in beryilium can be carried out despite this quenching effect by the method of standard addition. Samples of plutonium sulfate tetrahydrate prepared 9 to 12 months earlier were under investigation to determine the suitability of this compound as a primary analytical standard of plutonium. The compound was determined experimentally to contain four molecules of water of crystallization. Plutonium sulfate tetrahydrate was found to lose a major portion of its water of crystallization when heated at 115 ts C. Indications, but no conclusive evidence, of the existence of another intermediate hydrate of plutonium(IV) sulfate, were found. Microscopic examination of 1 -year-old crystals of Pu(S 0 /sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. 4 H/sub 2 / 0 shows no evidence of the effect of any <b>alpha</b> <b>radiolysis</b> on the water of crystallization. Continued exposure to a fluctuating atmosphere caused no apparent changes in crystal structure or weight. Heating Pu(SO/sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. 4 H/sub 2 / 0 to 325 ts C produced a dehydrated salt of weight equivalent to the formula, Pu(S 0 /sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. This material, although slightly hygroscopic, can be readily dried at 120 ts C and appears to be satisfactory for further investigation of its suitability as an alternate primary stand ard of plutonium. A method is presented for the rapid determination of milligram quantities of sulfateiIn pure plutonium sulfates. Plutonium is adsorbed on a cation resin and an acidimetric titration is made of the displaced hydrogen ion which is equivalent to the sulfate content of the sample. A technique used for the prevention of plutonium hydrolysis in neutral solution is described. The method may be applied to the determination of sulfate in any pure plutonium sulfate. A method is described for sampling and analyzing uranium in graphite waste. Sampling data indicate that representative sampling is obtained if the material is pulverized to less than 30 -mesh size before reducing to 20 to 50 -g portions for analysis. A HN 0 /sub 3 / (l - 3) digestion is sufficient for extracting the total uranium in the waste material. Details for the preparation of synthetic scrap solutions of uraniumaluminum, uranium- stainless steel, and uranium-Zircaloy- 2 are presented. Methods of analysis are described and precision data given for the determination of uranium in these solutions. Further evaluation of the isotopic abundance of uranium by mass spectrometric determination was made, and comparisons are shown for National Bureau of Standards and New Brunswick Laboratory values of standard sample NBS-U- 200.

The dissolution rate of the UO 2 matrix, which depends on the redox conditions on the fuel surface, will {{have a major impact}} on the release of radionuclides into the environment. The reducing conditions expected for a geological disposal situation would appear to be favorable as regards the solubility and stability of the UO 2 matrix, but may be disturbed on the surface of irradiated fuel. In particular, the local redox conditions will result from a competition between the radiolysis effects of water under alpha irradiation (simultaneously producing oxidizing species like H 2 O 2, hydrogen peroxide, and reducing species like H 2, hydrogen) and those of redox active species from the environment. In particular, Fe 2 +, a strongly reducing aqueous species coming from the corrosion of the iron canister or from the host rock, could influence the dissolution of the fuel matrix. The effect of iron on the oxidative dissolution of UO 2 was thus investigated under the conditions of the French disposal site, a Callovian-Oxfordian clay formation chosen by the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra), here tested under alpha irradiation. For this study, UO 2 fuel pellets doped with a radioactive alpha emitter (238 / 239 Pu) were leached in synthetic Callovian-Oxfordian groundwater (representative of the French waste disposal site groundwater) in the presence of a metallic iron foil to simulate the steel canister. The pellets had varying levels of alpha activity, in order to modulate the concentrations of species produced by water radiolysis on the surface and to simulate the activity of aged spent fuel after 50 and 10, 000 years of alpha radioactivity decay. The experimental data showed that whatever the sample alpha radioactivity, the presence of iron inhibits the oxidizing dissolution of UO 2 and leads to low uranium concentrations (between 4 × 10 − 10 and 4 × 10 − 9 M), through a reactional mechanism located in the very first microns of the UO 2 /water reactional interface. The mechanism involves consumption of oxidizing species, in particular of H 2 O 2 by Fe 2 + at the precise place where these species are produced, and is accompanied by the precipitation of an akaganeite-type Fe 3 + hydroxide on the surface. The higher the radioactivity of the samples, the greater the precipitation induced. Modeling has been developed, coupling chemistry with transport and based on the main reactional mechanisms identified, which enables accurate reproduction of the mineralogy of the system under study, giving the nature of the phases under observation as well as the location of their precipitation. Obviously without excluding a potential contribution from the hydrogen produced by the anoxic corrosion of the iron foil, this study has shown that iron plays a major role in this oxidizing dissolution inhibition process for the system investigated (localized <b>alpha</b> <b>radiolysis).</b> This inhibitor effect associated with iron is therefore strongly dependent on the location of the redox front, which is found on the surface in the case of alpha irradiation UO 2 /water reactional interface...|$|E
