25|$|What, by contrast, can be {{established}} is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined {{as it was to}} the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the Indépendants, during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born {{in the same way as}} the word 'Impressionism' in 1872.|$|E

Eric Idle commented: [...] "He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that you'll never, ever hear of." [...] The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter, whose album Harrison produced, which provided Dark Horse with their first hit, [...] "Costafine Town". Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva, and Stairsteps.|$|E

A deputy sheriff aimed his gun at Berkman, but Frick said, [...] "Don't shoot. Leave him to the law." [...] As the police led Berkman to the jail, an angry crowd gathered and shouted at Berkman. When he was questioned by police, Berkman said he had arrived in Pittsburgh on July21 and that he had acted alone. A dynamite capsule was discovered in his mouth after a policeman noticed that he was chewing on something.|$|E

In April 2015, Warren confirmed that the song would have an official release and was waiting for a final audio mixing by Gaga. It was later released as a digital download single on September 18, 2015.|$|E
