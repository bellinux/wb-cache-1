[...] In August 2016, the FAA revised SAIB HQ-16-05 to include similar verbiage regarding the acceptability of using UL94 in aircraft and engines that are <b>approved</b> to <b>operate</b> with avgas that has a minimum Motor octane rating of 80 or lower, including Grade 80/87.|$|R

The later IAI 1124 model, acquired in the 1980s, had enhanced performance due to more powerful and fuel efficient engines.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines the}} {{probable}} cause(s) of this accident as follows: The pilots’ failure {{to adhere to}} the airplane’s <b>operating</b> <b>limitations,</b> which resulted in overload failure of the right wing. Findings of the investigation were the adverse effects of multiple supplemental type certificates (STC) to the airframe wing structure that were not evaluated at the time the STCs were installed and the lack of guidance by the Federal Aviation Administration for multiple STC interaction evaluation.|$|R
