5|$|Although {{there were}} no deaths, the fire caused $1.8million of damage, and {{officers}} were injured. In {{the aftermath of the}} riot, there was extensive media <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Fremantle Prison, and investigative journalists uncovered prior warnings to the prison authorities of the risk of such an event. The government hastily initiated an enquiry into the incident, and a report was completed within six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore Sun {{reporter}} Scott Templeton {{claims to}} have been contacted by McNulty's fake serial killer. City Editor Gus Haynes becomes suspicious, but his superiors are enamored of Templeton.

5|$|Cameron's {{recognition}} {{as an artist}} increased after her death, when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the U.S. As a result of increased <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater coverage in the early 2000s. In 2006, the Cameron–Parsons Foundation was created to preserve and promote her work, and in 2011 a biography of Cameron written by Spencer Kansa was published.|$|E

5|$|Forman {{based his}} story on a {{real-world}} incident {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of their <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> {{trying to create a}} real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|From that point, Manne refocused his <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> his own drumming. It {{might be}} argued that he never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he {{recorded}} numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.|$|E

6000|$|Donna Maria (now {{thoroughly}} {{convinced that}} Mr. Hamlin's <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> that eventful occasion were intended for herself, and even delightfully suspicious of some pre-arranged plan in his present situation): [...] "Poor Donna Dolores! You {{know we have}} lost her for ever." ...|$|R

5|$|Independently, Leonid Kantorovich's {{functional}} analytic work on mathematical economics also focused <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> optimization theory, non-differentiability, and vector lattices.

5000|$|Furthermore, the new title—carrying with it {{the risk}} that the new emperor would [...] "make drastic changes to the {{traditional}} styles and procedures of government" [...] or [...] "concentrate his <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally"—risked alienating the Frankish leadership.|$|R
5|$|Media <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> {{the trial}} spread beyond the provincial and {{national}} borders: Time magazine published {{at least two}} articles on the trial in the United States, and the Daily Mail and Paris Midi covered it from across the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Sanger's goal of {{challenging}} {{the law was}} fulfilled when she was indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused their <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> articles Sanger had written on assassination and marriage, rather than contraception. Afraid {{that she might be}} sent to prison without an opportunity to argue for birth control in court, she fled to England to escape arrest.|$|E
5|$|The Justice Department and the FBI {{began by}} {{investigating}} possible criminal actions by Keating and John Granger, but then expanded its inquiries {{to include the}} five senators.

50|$|At this time, Mere Marie Alvequin, {{superior}} of the Dames Augustines de St. Magloire, petitioned Olier directly, {{and through}} others {{to undertake the}} responsibility of spiritual director of the monastery, but Olier preferred to focus his <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> the parish and seminary of St. Sulpice.|$|R
60|$|On the way home, Peter Ruff was genial--Miss Brown silent. He {{had escaped}} from a {{difficult}} position, and {{his sense of}} gratitude toward his companion was strong.

5|$|Wellington {{monitored}} the action at Hougoumont until about 1p.m., {{by which time}} he was content enough with the position's security to concentrate his own <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the allied centre.|$|E
5|$|A new {{publication}} called Classic Rock, featuring Barton {{and many}} of the writers from Kerrang!s first run, championed the NWOBHM revival and continues to focus much of its <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> rock acts from the 1980s. Starting in the 2000s, many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles, abandoned {{in the second half of}} the 1980s. Their presence, at metal festivals and on the international rock club circuit, has been constant ever since.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
40|$|Chewing is {{crushing}} food {{not only}} to aid swallowing and digestion, but also to help stress relief and regulate cognitive function, especially in attention. It {{is well known that}} chewing gum is used for sleepiness prevention during work, learning, and driving, suggesting a link between chewing and sustained attention. We hypothesized that chewing elevates attention and/or alertness, leading to improvements in cognitive performance. We carried out a systematic review of the PubMed database. We inspected the attributes of effects <b>on</b> <b>attention</b> in studies investigating the effects of chewing <b>on</b> <b>attention</b> or alertness conducted with pre-post design in healthy subjects, except elderly. We identified 151 references, 22 of which were included: 14 (64 %) showed positive attributes of effects <b>on</b> <b>attention,</b> 1 (5 %) showed negative attributes of effects <b>on</b> <b>attention,</b> 5 (23 %) showed both positive and negative attributes of effects <b>on</b> <b>attention,</b> and 2 (9 %) showed no significant attributes of effects <b>on</b> <b>attention.</b> Thus, positive attributes of effects of chewing <b>on</b> <b>attention,</b> especially <b>on</b> sustained <b>attention,</b> were shown in over half of the reports. These effects also appeared with improvement in mood and stress relief and were influenced by time-on-task effect. Further studies are needed, but chewing could be useful for modifying cognitive function...|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} paper, F. YIN et al. analyze {{and develop a}} {{mathematical}} model to evaluate {{the performance of the}} contention-based and delay-tolerant applications in IEEE 802.16 networks. They focus their <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> allocating the uplink bandwidth efficiently; the basic goal is to optimize the performance with an optimal bandwidth allocation mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The {{team won}} the {{national}} WPSL Championship in its only season of existence, beating Chicago Red Stars 2-1 after extra time in the final. Rogers was named Coach of the Year.
