5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, <b>and</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
40|$|Marc Jeannerod pioneered a {{representational}} {{approach to}} movement <b>and</b> <b>action.</b> In his approach, motor representations provide both, declarative knowledge about <b>action</b> <b>and</b> procedural knowledge for <b>action</b> (<b>action</b> semantics <b>and</b> <b>action</b> pragmatics, respectively). Recent evidence from language comprehension <b>and</b> <b>action</b> simulation supports {{the claim that}} <b>action</b> pragmatics <b>and</b> <b>action</b> semantics draw on common representational resources, thus challenging the traditional divide between declarative <b>and</b> procedural <b>action</b> knowledge. To account for these observations, three kinds of theoretical frameworks are discussed: (i) semantics is grounded in pragmatics, (ii) pragmatics is anchored in semantics, and (iii) pragmatics {{is part and parcel}} of semantics...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} and contrasted two dispositional {{determinants of}} adaptive goal setting and successful goal striving: Self-efficacy, the confidence in own abilities, <b>and</b> <b>action</b> orientation, {{the ability of}} intuitive affect regulation. Based on a theoretical comparison, we hypothesized that self-efficacy increases autonomous motivation, whereas action orientation reduces controlled motivation in goal setting. Furthermore, both self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>action</b> orientation were hypothesized to facilitate goal striving, as indicated by a decrease in goal-related conflict (action crisis) over time. A longitudinal field study with 207 students supported the hypotheses and demonstrated substantial statistical overlap between trait self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>action</b> orientation. The results indicate that both self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>action</b> orientation promote adaptive goal setting and successful goal striving, albeit through distinct underlying mechanisms...|$|R
