50|$|In Bordeaux, {{hand picking}} is now common {{among the more}} prestigious châteaux. But while hand-picking is foremost, some {{classified}} châteaux still harvest by machine. Mechanical harvesting also has its advantages, such as flexibility: it makes possible harvesting at night, which is preferable during hot weather. While the harvesting machines today have <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> making them still more attractive, the delicate and selective process of harvesting by hand {{is still the best}} way to secure a maximum quality harvest. One problem with manual harvesting is the sheer size of vineyards in Bordeaux (not to mention the labor cost of hand-picking), {{with tens of thousands of}} hectares needing harvesting within a few weeks. The flatter geography of Bordeaux also allows for mechanical harvesting, whereas the steep slopes of wine-producing areas such as Côte-Rôtie make machine harvesting nearly impossible.|$|E

50|$|Remarkably though, the {{standards}} of films in 2016 was amazingly high. This was evidence that the workshops to train teachers on film skills held at State House Girls' High School in Nairobi had borne fruit. The secondary category was very competitive with schools effectively going for the top awards. Kangubiri Girls' High School had a winning thriller Science fiction story titled The Return to Planet Earth. The story is about a generation of African children who were evacuated to a planet in the Andromeda galaxy before the third world war broke out. Four hundred {{years into the future}} their great grandchildren, who are at the time very <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> return to learn from the unfortunate planet. State House Girls' High School produced The Principal's Daughter a story about a girl who is bashed by teachers, students and even workers because she is the principal's daughter which leads her to joining a clandestine underground movement. Kagumo High School was judged the best boys' school coming third with a film Fire of Passion that explored how parent's irresponsibility can lead to distracting the child's attention at school.|$|E
5000|$|The Chozo are {{a mysterious}} and sage-like species {{featured}} throughout the Metroid series. The origins {{and age of}} the Chozo race and civilization are unknown, but they were once spread across several planets in the Metroid universe. Lore entries in Metroid Prime suggest that the race may have traveled to a higher plane of being as opposed to dying out. The Chozo were extremely <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology,</b> some say {{they could not be}} more advanced, but the chozo took pride in their elaborate statuary. They also exchanged knowledge with other species, including the Luminoth of Aether, the Reptilicus of Bryyo, and the Elysians of Elysia (robots which the Chozo themselves built). Lore found in Metroid Prime 3 specifically mentions a fellowship of enlightened species that once existed between the Chozo, the Luminoth, the Reptilicus, and another race called the Ylla. While the former three have been expounded on in the series, the Ylla are only mentioned in this piece of lore and have yet to be seen. The Chozo were also responsible for the creation and breeding of Metroids. While in the Japanese versions of the games, the beings are only ever identified by the generic term chōjin-zoku (lit. [...] "bird-folk race"), a misunderstanding during the localization process led to the mistaken adoption of the descriptor chōzō ("bird statue"), rendered [...] "Chozo," [...] in the English versions instead. In Super Metroid, some of the Chozo statues would rise up and attack Samus; these bosses are called Torizo, substituting the native Japanese word tori [...] "bird" [...] for the usual, Chinese-derived chō. In Metroid Prime, in later areas in game play, Chozo ghosts appear and attack Samus. Although originally allies, they have been maddened by the Phazon corruption of their planet, and can no longer distinguish friend from foe. In [...] "Metroid Zero Mission" [...] Samus can enter the Chozo Ruins.|$|E
50|$|Cultural {{diversity}} is stated “as necessary for humankind as bio{{diversity is}} for nature”. According to every country's life style and culture specifically of folk communities communication differs place to place, {{we could see}} the difference in gestures also. As an example we can take Indian way of communication.As one of the biggest populated nation, India has a large diversity in its culture. Though it keeps a unity in its diversity-art, architecture, art forms and culture communicate the standard of living, knowledge, development, technology and imagination of a community. Those factors {{play a major role in}} these forms of communication. Culture influences the thinking process of people also. Culture of a person is inherited from his ancestors through gene transitions and he will be showing signs of his traditional heritage and ancestral habits. That is why there is a similarity with the profiles of parents and children in major cases regarding their education and career. It is similar in case of countries also. The countries like USA which is well <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> and research gets more and more advanced in the next generation also because there is an unconscious cultural, technical, mental and intellectual communication communicated from one to another.The influence of mother tongue is very obvious in the English accent of the people in India and it is known as Indian accent in India, in other countries there are different kinds of accents like Korean, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, and Braziliam accents. People shows their cultural and gestural differences in their style of communication. People always show a linguistic feeling and form their own communities and likes communicate with those who belongs to their own linguistic regions and makes even agitations for certain specific groups. In India reorganisation of states were done based on linguistic differences. In certain cases different languages has different meanings too as in certain words and ideas. A unity is missing in many cases. An event or fact which is very common in a region may be totally different in meaning or understanding in another region. Therefore, it makes some hurdles in the areas such as education, and inter exchange of ideas. Therefore, applicability of anything brought from one particular region should be screened well for getting the right idea.|$|E
