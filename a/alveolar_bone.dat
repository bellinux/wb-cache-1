5|$|The <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> is {{the bone}} of the jaw which forms the {{alveolus}} around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone.</b> This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to quantitatively evaluate {{the density of the}} <b>alveolar</b> and basal <b>bones</b> of the maxilla and mandible in interradicular areas by computed tomography. The Hounsfield value of the <b>alveolar</b> and basal <b>bones</b> will provide guidelines for planning anchorage and placement of orthodontic mini-implants.|$|R
30|$|Adequate bone {{volume is}} one of the {{important}} factors to obtain osseointegration in dental implants. In 1986, Lekholm et al. reported that for the implant success, a minimum of 1  mm or more of the buccal and lingual bone was necessary surrounding the implant surface. Clinicians often encounter patients with deficient vertical or horizontal <b>alveolar</b> <b>bones.</b> Reasons may vary from trauma, periodontal disease, tooth extraction, and to tumor. Under such circumstances, the implant surface may not be entirely covered by the bone, and this could increase the risk of infection, gingival recession, non-esthetic appearance, poor oral hygiene maintenance, and peri-implantitis [1].|$|R
40|$|Objective: Mini-implant {{stability}} is primarily related to bone quality and quantity. This study evaluated <b>alveolar</b> cortical <b>bone</b> thickness and density differences between interradicular sites {{at different levels}} from the alveolar crest, and assessed the differences between adolescents (12 - 18 years of age) and adults (19 - 50 years of age), males and females, upper and lower arch, anterior and posterior region of jaws and buccal and oral side. Study Design: In this retrospective study, 48 Computed Tomography scans, performed for oral surgery purposes were selected from dental records of 3, 223 Caucasian orthodontic patients. The SimPlant software (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) {{was used to measure}} cortical bone thickness and density at 13 interradicular sites and four bone levels (2, 4, 6 and 8 mm). For the statistical analysis descriptive statistics, Student's t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient were used. Results: Statistically significant differences in <b>alveolar</b> cortical <b>bone</b> thickness and density between age, gender, sites and sides were found (P< 0. 05). The Pearson correlation coefficient demonstrated a significant linear increasing of thickness and density from crest to base of alveolar crest (P. 0. 05). Conclusion. Adults show a thicker <b>alveolar</b> cortical <b>bone</b> than adolescents. <b>Alveolar</b> cortical <b>bone</b> thickness and density were greater in males than in females, in mandible than in maxilla, in the posterior region than the anterior, in oral than buccal side. There is an increase of thickness and density from crest to base of alveolar crest...|$|R
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone.</b> This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Dental {{avulsion}} is {{the complete}} displacement of a tooth from its socket in <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> owing to trauma.|$|E
25|$|Alveolar osteitis is {{inflammation}} of the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> (i.e., the alveolar process of the maxilla or mandible). Classically, this occurs as a postoperative complication of tooth extraction.|$|E
30|$|The {{research}} was conducted in the patients who had visited the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery in Seoul National University Bundang Hospital mainly for tooth loss from January 2008 to December 2013 and received treatment with an ultrawide implant of ≥ 6  mm in diameter (Superline, Dentium Co., Seoul, Korea). We examined complications after implant placement and prosthetic restoration and used radiographs to estimate {{the ratio of the}} length of an actual implant fixture to that of the fixture in a periapical view, taking the magnification rate into account, and determine the resorption on the mesial and distal <b>alveolar</b> <b>bones</b> of the implant.|$|R
5000|$|Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of {{subjects}} with tongue ornaments. The <b>alveolar</b> tooth-bearing <b>bone</b> {{may also be}} involved, jeopardizing the stability and durability of the teeth in place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery.|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{methods have}} been used in guided bone {{regeneration}} (GBR) [1, 2]. One of the most common techniques involves harvesting and implantating fresh autogenous bone grafts taken from the same patient. However, this is an expensive procedure that requires hospitalization and has a potential risk of donor site morbidity. To avoid such complications, clinicians have developed the use of biomaterials as substitutes for <b>alveolar</b> <b>bones.</b> Other types of grafts available for the maxilla and mandible include allogeneic, alloplastic, and xenogeneic ones. Autografts are the only grafts that provide osteoinductivity; unfortunately, autografts often have unpredictable resorption, morbidity at the donor site, and limited bone availability, which has stimulated research to find new alternatives for bone tissue engineering.|$|R
25|$|Another {{factor that}} makes {{periodontitis}} a difficult disease to {{study is that}} human host response can also affect the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> resorption. Host response to the bacterial-mycotic insult is mainly determined by genetics; however, immune development may play some role in susceptibility.|$|E
25|$|As {{root and}} {{cementum}} formation begin, bone is {{created in the}} adjacent area. Throughout the body, cells that form bone are called osteoblasts. In the case of <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone,</b> these osteoblast cells form from the dental follicle. Similar {{to the formation of}} primary cementum, collagen fibers are created on the surface nearest the tooth, and they remain there until attaching to periodontal ligaments.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{periodontitis}} is {{initiated by}} Gram-negative tooth-associated microbial biofilms that elicit a host response, {{which results in}} bone and soft tissue destruction. In response to endotoxin derived from periodontal pathogens, several osteoclast-related mediators target the destruction of <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> and supporting connective tissue such as the periodontal ligament. Major drivers of this aggressive tissue destruction are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and other osteoclast-derived enzymes.|$|E
2500|$|In the cancellous {{portion of}} femoral head {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} to find trabeculae with apparently intact osteocytes which seem to be [...] "alive" [...] but are no longer synthetizing collagen. This appears to be consistent with the findings in <b>alveolar</b> cancellous <b>bone.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aims: the {{assessment}} of the limit dose for the organs at risk in external radiotherapy is a fundamental step to guarantee an optimal risk-benefit ratio. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess, through contouring the single dental cavities, the absorbed radiation dose on irradiated <b>alveolar</b> <b>bones</b> during the treatment of cervico-facial tumours, so as to test the correlation between the absorbed dose of radiation at alveolar level and the level of individual surgical risk for osteonecrosis. Materials andmethods: we selected 45 out of 89 patients on the basis of different exclusion criteria. Nine of these patients showed evidence of osteoradionecrosis. The patients were treated either with 3 D conformational radiation therapy (3 D-CRT) or with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), there after <b>alveolar</b> <b>bones</b> were contoured using computed axial tomography (CAT scans) carried out following oncological and dental treatment. The dose-volume histograms (DVH) were obtained on the basis of such data, which included those relating to the dental cavities in addition to those inherent to the tumours and the organs at risk. Results: all patients, irrespective of type of treatment, received an average of 60 to 70 grays in 30 / 35 sittings. The patients treated with IMRT showed higher variation in absorbed radiation dose than those treated with 3 D-CRT. The alveolar encirclement allowed {{the assessment}} of the absorbed radiation dose, and consequently it also allowed to assess the individual surgical risk for osteonecrosis in patients with head and neck tumours who underwent radiography treatment. Conclusions: the study of DVH allows {{the assessment of}} limit dose and the detection of the areas at greater risk for osteoradionecrosis before dental surgery...|$|R
30|$|In {{clinical}} routine, {{there are}} two main CT techniques commonly used for the evaluation of maxillofacial diseases: cone beam CT (CBCT) and multidetector CT (MDCT). Both CT modalities are usually considered adequate for diagnosing OKCs and preoperative planning, owing to their ability to generate high-quality multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images in different planes. In addition, using a dedicated reconstruction software for dental arches (DentaScan), the three-dimensional dataset produced by both modalities can be further processed in MPR images that are either parallel (panoramic) or perpendicular (cross-sectional) to the curvature of the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bones.</b> These high-resolution MPR images allow three-dimensional views of the jaws and provide detailed information about the OKC and its relationship with surrounding structures (teeth, sinonasal cavities, canals, foramina and soft tissue).|$|R
25|$|Stability is the {{principle}} that describes how well the denture base is prevented from moving in a horizontal plane, and thus sliding {{from side to side}} or front to back. The more the denture base (pink material) is in smooth and continuous contact with the edentulous ridge (the hill upon which the teeth used to reside, but now only residual <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> with overlying mucosa), the better the stability. Of course, the higher and broader the ridge, the better the stability will be, but this is usually a result of patient anatomy, barring surgical intervention (bone grafts, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} bone {{in the human}} body, <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> is {{modified}} throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics using bands, wires, or appliances, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation. Thus, the tooth or teeth are slowly moved along the jaw so as to achieve a dentition that works in harmony. In this way, the width of the space between the alveoli and the root is kept about the same.|$|E
25|$|The cause(s) of {{dry socket}} are not {{completely}} understood. Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is extravasated into the socket, and a blood clot (thrombus) forms. This blood clot is replaced with granulation tissue which consists of proliferating fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from remnants of the periodontal membrane, surrounding <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> and gingival mucosa. In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, fibrillar bone and finally by mature, woven bone. The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g., secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause sclerotic bone to form). The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the degeneration of the clot and {{may be caused by}} the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and formation of kinins. Factors which promote fibrinolysis include local trauma, estrogens, and pyrogens from bacteria.|$|E

30|$|The tracing of {{the bone}} {{resorption}} is difficult for the complete denture with the continuous rated atrophy of the residual alveolar ridge beneath the conventional denture [15, 16]. Rather than monitoring the bone atrophy, this review investigates the capability of the implant {{to be responsible for}} preserving residual <b>alveolar</b> ridge <b>bone</b> and the role of implant-assisted restoration to reduce the alveolar ridge atrophy.|$|R
25|$|Dental {{avulsion}} {{is a real}} dental {{emergency in}} which prompt management (within 20–40 minutes of injury) affects the prognosis of the tooth. The avulsed permanent tooth should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage {{the surface of the}} root which may have living periodontal fiber and cells. Once the tooth and mouth are clean an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> and later splinted by a dentist for several weeks. Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth. If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva and take it to an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of tetanus immunization if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured primary teeth differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent dental crypt).|$|E
500|$|The {{periodontium}} is {{the supporting}} {{structure of a}} tooth, helping to attach the tooth to surrounding tissues and to allow sensations of touch and pressure. It consists of the cementum, periodontal ligaments, <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone,</b> and gingiva. Of these, cementum {{is the only one}} that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> to the cementum. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an alveolus, or [...] "socket". Lying over the bone is the gingiva or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.|$|E
500|$|The tooth bud (sometimes {{called the}} tooth germ) is an {{aggregation}} of cells that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental follicle. The enamel organ {{is composed of}} the outer enamel epithelium, inner enamel epithelium, stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium. These cells give rise to ameloblasts, which produce enamel and the reduced enamel epithelium. The growth of cervical loop cells into the deeper tissues forms Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath, which determines a tooth's root shape. The dental papilla contains cells that develop into odontoblasts, which are dentin-forming cells. Additionally, the junction between the dental papilla and inner enamel epithelium determines the crown shape of a tooth. [...] The dental follicle gives rise to three important cells: cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the periodontal ligaments which connect teeth to the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> through cementum.|$|E
40|$|Although it can {{be stated}} that the {{incidence}} of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws (ORNJ) in the last reported period decreases, the therapy of this diagnosis has a considerably more complicated continuance as with bisphosphonates osteonecrosis (BON). Oral findings are extensive, not only <b>alveolar</b> <b>bones</b> of jaws are affected by radiation, but also oral mucosa and salivary glands, resulting to a significant mucositis and xerostomia. Research in dental and oral surgery often involves materials and procedures which are capable of improving clinical outcomes in terms of percentages of success. The goal of this research was to find a treatment approach which could reduce bleeding, promote effective bone regeneration and rapid soft-tissue healing by employing resources which are easy to use at a modest cost. Patients in our study were divided into three categories: patients with newly diagnosed cancer waiting for treatment, patients after radiotherapy without signs of osteonecrosis and patients with fully developed osteoradionecrosis of jaws...|$|R
5|$|Oral trauma, {{including}} {{recession of}} gingival tissue and dental fracture and wear. Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments. In some cases, the <b>alveolar</b> tooth-bearing <b>bone</b> is also involved, jeopardizing {{the stability and}} durability of the teeth in place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery. Dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments.|$|R
40|$|Dentin {{matrix protein}} 1 (DMP 1), an acidic protein that is {{essential}} to the mineralization of bone and dentin, exists as proteolytically processed fragments in the mineralized tissues. In this study, we characterized the tooth and jaw phenotypes in transgenic mice containing no wild-type DMP 1, but expressing a mutant DMP 1 in which Asp 213, a residue at one cleavage site, was replaced by Ala 213 (named “Dmp 1 -KO/D 213 A-Tg” mice). The teeth and mandible of Dmp 1 -KO/D 213 A-Tg mice were compared with those of wild-type, Dmp 1 -knockout (Dmp 1 -KO), and Dmp 1 -KO mice expressing the normal Dmp 1 transgene. The results showed that D 213 A-DMP 1 was not cleaved in dentin, and the expression of D 213 A-DMP 1 failed to rescue the defects in the dentin, cementum, and <b>alveolar</b> <b>bones</b> in the Dmp 1 -KO mice. These findings indicate that the proteolytic processing of DMP 1 {{is essential to the}} formation and mineralization of dentin, cementum, and jaw bones...|$|R
500|$|Common causes include {{inflammation}} of the pulp, usually in response to tooth decay, dental trauma, or other factors, dentin hypersensitivity (short, sharp pain, usually associated with exposed root surfaces), apical periodontitis ({{inflammation of}} the periodontal ligament and <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> around the root apex), dental abscesses (localized collections of pus, such as apical abscess, pericoronal abscess, and periodontal abscess), alveolar osteitis ("dry socket", a possible complication of tooth extraction, with loss of the blood clot and exposure of bone), acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (a gum infection, also called [...] "trenchmouth"), temporomandibular disorder and others.|$|E
500|$|Painful {{conditions}} {{which do not}} originate from the teeth or their supporting structures may affect the oral mucosa of the gums and be interpreted by the individual as toothache. Examples include neoplasms of the gingival or alveolar mucosa (usually squamous cell carcinoma), {{conditions which}} cause gingivostomatitis and desquamative gingivitis. Various conditions may involve the <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone,</b> and cause non-odontogenic toothache, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, infarcts in the jaws caused by sickle cell disease, and osteomyelitis. Various conditions of the trigeminal nerve can masquerade as toothache, including trigeminal zoster (maxillary or mandibular division), trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headache, and trigeminal neuropathies. Very rarely, a brain tumor might cause toothache. Another chronic facial pain syndrome which can mimic toothache is temporomandibular disorder (temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome), which is very common. [...] Toothache which has no identifiable dental or medical cause is often termed atypical odontalgia, which, in turn, is usually considered a type of atypical facial pain (or persistent idiopathic facial pain). Atypical odontalgia may give very unusual symptoms, such as pain which migrates from one tooth to another and which crosses anatomical boundaries (such as from the left teeth to the right teeth).|$|E
2500|$|The periodontium, {{which is}} the {{supporting}} structure of a tooth, consists of the cementum, periodontal ligaments, gingiva, and <b>alveolar</b> <b>bone.</b> Cementum {{is the only one}} of these that is a part of a tooth. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>bone</b> surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called a [...] "socket".

40|$|Chronic {{periodontitis}} is an oral {{infection that}} results into destruction involving the gums, cementum, periodontium and <b>alveolar</b> process <b>bone.</b> The major etiology of periodontitis is bacterial plaque, which harbors {{a variety of}} pathogenic bacteria known as periopathogens or periodontopathogens. The most important periopathogens are anaerobic bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum and the relative anaerobe Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Periopathogens can affect the immune system cells, stimulating them to produce inflammatory mediators.
