5000|$|For some {{of these}} purposes, the R.N.X.S {{operated}} a small fleet of inshore vessels. Initially, the vessels were 45 ft and 61.5 feet Motor Fishing Vessels. These smaller boats were soon replaced by 10 Inshore Minesweepers (Ham Class). R.N.X.S. vessel names were prefixed 'XSV' for Auxiliary Service Vessel.. The Minesweepers were de-armed and converted to enable larger training crews to be embarked. The 20 mm Oerlikon Cannon or 40mm Bofors guns were removed but the mounts were kept. Over time, the Minesweepers were replaced by Fleet Tenders, the [...] "Loyals". [...] Most of this Class of ships' names were prefixed 'Loyal' apart from XSV Supporter, whose home port was Belfast ,and, given Irish political tensions at the time, the prefix [...] "Loyal" [...] was dropped.The R.N.X.S operated 11 Purpose Built Fleet Tenders and various other small craft. In 1990, a specific threat of port attack by subversive and/or Special Forces was identified and to help to counter this threat, the R.N.X.S received 4 of [...] "P2000" [...] fast patrol craft from the 14 built for the Royal Navy And these P2000s are still in service, as commissioned warships at University Royal Naval Units. [...] The sailing of merchantmen both overseas and coastal sailings involved setting up assembly anchorages where ships might be formed into convoys, a naval escort or surveillance for information on routing, intelligence, and communications. Auxiliarymen were required at <b>assembly</b> <b>anchorage</b> control to assist in these tasks.|$|E

Anderson encouraged friends and allies, including pastors and members of the locally influential Anchorage Baptist Temple, to pack the town meeting-style community council elections. By May 2004, six of the nine community council board members, including its president, were friends and political allies of Anderson. While Anchorage's community councils have no real authority, they are influential with the <b>Anchorage</b> <b>Assembly</b> because, according to Dick Traini, then chair of the <b>Anchorage</b> <b>Assembly,</b> [...] "they are the active people in the community that choose to be involved."

In 1994, he defeated former lieutenant governor Stephen McAlpine in the Democratic primary and was elected governor in the general election. Knowles's election was surprisingly close, but he also benefitted from the split conservative vote due to a strong third-party gubernatorial bid by the sitting lieutenant governor. In the election, Knowles received 41.1%, Republican candidate Jim Campbell 40.8% and lieutenant governor Jack Coghill of the Alaskan Independence Party 13%.|$|R
50|$|Building the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts {{was perhaps}} the most {{controversial}} undertaking of Knowles's 6-year tenure as mayor, largely due to the doubling of the original $35 million cost estimate by the completion of construction. Mayor Tom Fink, who took office after Knowles, threatened to defund the center over price overruns. The design of the building was criticized for lacking a drop-off, and for entrances {{on the wrong side of}} one-way streets. Even the proposed name of the center invited controversy: the <b>Anchorage</b> <b>Assembly's</b> decision to name the center after Martin Luther King Jr. was overturned by voters.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Fink {{was elected}} Mayor of Anchorage {{in the wake}} of a {{dramatic}} drop in the price of oil which devastated the local economy. During his term in office, he advocated the sale of ATU, the municipal telephone utility. He received national attention for his stance on gay rights when he vetoed a 1993 municipal ordinance that would protect city employees from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The same year, he called for the cancellation of funding for a local theater group that included homosexual themes. In both cases, he was overridden by the <b>Anchorage</b> <b>Assembly.</b>|$|R
50|$|After some {{renovation}} by {{the city}} of Anchorage, the theater was used by a catering firm as a banquet facility. Rasmuson Foundation approved a program related investment structured as a low-interest loan to the Municipality of Anchorage in 2006 so that the city could purchase, restore and use the Theater for meeting space by the Anchorage Convention and Visitors Bureau. When the <b>Anchorage</b> <b>Assembly</b> voted to prohibit the City to act as the loan guarantor, Rasmuson Foundation rescinded the award offer. Due to the economic recession in the following years, these plans did not come to fruition. In 2011, the theater's new owner, Peach Investments, presented new restoration plans.|$|R

5000|$|The garage {{is named}} after Carolyn [...] "Linny" [...] Pacillo (September 2, 1959 - November 17, 2006). Her family {{operated}} Courtney's Tudor Service on East Tudor Road, {{which was one of}} the very last remaining independent gas stations in Anchorage. The Pacillo family sold the station in 2003, which has since gone out of business. Linny Pacillo, along with her sister Susan, became pop heroes in Anchorage (and later elsewhere) by donning tutus and plugging parking meters downtown to protest strict parking enforcement. They were dubbed The Parking Fairies. State Senator Johnny Ellis, a Democrat whose district includes downtown Anchorage, sponsored the bill naming the garage for Pacillo.

40|$|In this {{preliminary}} study, {{the complexity of}} the corrosion phenomenon of post-tensioning strands in grouted <b>anchorage</b> <b>assemblies</b> was examined and both physicochemical and electrochemical key technical issues were identified. Measurements of oxygen reduction efficiency in high pH electrolytes were conducted to obtain polarization parameters to be used in modeling. The time evolution of electrical resistivity of 5 low-bleed commercial grouts was measured also for model input. A mathematical model for a simple grout-strand system was proposed and dimensionless equations were formulated, to solve the combined polarization and oxygen transport problem. Within the range of validity of the model assumptions, initial computations indicated that oxygen availability was a key factor in determining corrosion severity while grout resistivity was secondary. Predicted corrosion rates were in general agreement with field and laboratory observations. Issues for subsequent model development were identified...|$|R
5000|$|The tendons are not {{placed in}} {{direct contact with}} the concrete, but are {{encapsulated}} within a protective sleeve or duct which is either cast into the concrete structure or placed adjacent to it. At each end of a tendon is an <b>anchorage</b> <b>assembly</b> firmly fixed to the surrounding concrete. Once the concrete has been cast and set, the tendons are tensioned ("stressed") by pulling the tendon ends through the anchorages while pressing against the concrete. The large forces required to tension the tendons result in a significant permanent compression being applied to the concrete once the tendon is [...] "locked-off" [...] at the anchorage. The method of locking the tendon-ends to the anchorage is dependent upon the tendon composition, with the most common systems being [...] "button-head" [...] anchoring (for wire tendons), split-wedge anchoring (for strand tendons), and threaded anchoring (for bar tendons).|$|R

40|$|A crucial {{step in the}} {{development}} of muscle cells in all metazoan animals is the <b>assembly</b> and <b>anchorage</b> of the sarcomere, the essential repeat unit responsible for muscle contraction. In Caenorhabditis elegans, many of the critical proteins involved in this process have been uncovered through mutational screens focusing on uncoordinated movement and embryonic arrest phenotypes. We propose that additional sarcomeric proteins exist for which there is a less severe, or entirely different, mutant phenotype produced in their absence. We have used Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to generate a comprehensive profile of late embryonic muscle gene expression. We generated two replicate long SAGE libraries for sorted embryonic muscle cells, identifying 7, 974 protein-coding genes. A refined list of 3, 577 genes expressed in muscle cells was compiled from the overlap between our SAGE data and available microarray data. Using the genes in our refined list, we have performed two separate RNA interference (RNAi) screens to identify novel genes that play a role in sarcomere assembly and/or maintenance in either embryonic or adult muscle. To identify muscle defects in embryos, we screened specifically for the Pat embryonic arrest phenotype. To visualize muscle defects in adult animals, we fed dsRNA to worms producing a GFP-tagged myosin protein, thus allowing us to analyze their myofilament organization under gene knockdown conditions using fluorescence microscopy. By eliminating or severely reducing the expression of 3, 300 gene...|$|R
