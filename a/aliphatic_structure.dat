The prevailing saturated long-chain <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> of oxidation products suggested a predominantly open-chain cross-linked <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> of Aleksinac shale kerogen, classified as type Ikerogen.

The use of LC×LC–DAD, combining the use of two independent separation mechanisms (per aqueous liquid chromatography [PALC] versus size-exclusion chromatography [SEC]), has shown a great potential for unraveling and resolving the heterogeneity of WSOM, further providing a deeper insight into how size-distinguished aerosol WSOM fractions differ in hydrophobicity during different seasonal events. The combination of PALC×SEC–DAD data with an already proposed data treatment procedure revealed that the WSOM samples collected during warm seasons are enriched in <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures,</b> while those collected during colder seasons exhibit a higher degree of structures with conjugation of π-bonds (e. g., aromatics) alongside <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

Three types of peaks were found: (1) the peaks at 2923 and 1376  cm− 1 correspond to the aliphatic structure; (2) the peaks at 3050, 1585, 826, and 763  cm− 1 are the characteristic peaks of aromatic ring; (3) the peaks at 3350, 1715, 1250  cm− 1 are assigned to the oxygen-containing functional groups. The band between 400 and 600  cm− 1 relates to the ash. Curve 2 represents the FT-IR spectrum of the coal sample after HNO 3 treatment at 25  °C for 24  h. The shape of curve 2 is almost {{the same as that}} of curve 1 except the decrease of the band between 400 and 600  cm− 1 and the increase of the peaks at 1715 and 1250  cm− 1, indicating that treating raw coal sample with HNO 3 at room temperature aided in the removal of ash and the increase of oxygen-containing functional groups in the structure of coal. Curve 3 is the FT-IR spectrum of the coal sample after 24  h of reflux. It {{shows that the}} intensities of the adsorption at 1715 and 1250  cm− 1 further increase for sample 3. Besides that, a weak band appeared between 3000 and 2500  cm− 1 and a single peak showed up at 1538  cm− 1, corresponding to the adsorption of COOH and C–NO 2 group, respectively. In addition, both the peak of O–H group at 3350  cm− 1 and the peak of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> at 2923  cm− 1 decrease, and the peak at 1376  cm− 1 assigned to the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> disappeared, and also the band between 400 and 600  cm− 1 associated with the ash almost disappeared. The results of ultimate analysis and FT-IR demonstrate that treating Wucaiwan coal sample with HNO 3 under reflux condition not only was efficient in removing the ash in the coal but also introduced oxygen-containing groups such as nitro group into the organic structure of coal and reduced the content of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> relatively.|$|E

However, the (002) plane of sample 5 is higher and narrower than that of sample 4 and most of the unidentified peaks disappeared, indicating that the content of aromatic structure in the depolymerized product obtained at pH =  1.99 – 4.09 increases, and the molecular orientation between aromatic planes is more ordered, i.e., the coal structure is gradually graphitized (Zou et al. 2008).|$|E

The infrared (IR) spectra of raw and dried coals were curve-fitted {{to a series}} of bands in hydroxyl groups (3500 – 3000 cm – 1), aliphatic hydrogen (3000 – 2800 cm – 1), and carbonyl and aromatic carbon (1850 – 1500 cm – 1) adsorption regions. Following air drying, the IR adsorption of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures</b> decreased significantly, indicating that oxidation reaction mainly takes place on these structures. Carbonyl and carboxyl groups decreased up to 130 °C by 25. 9 % and 23. 9 %, respectively, and then significantly increased at higher temperatures due to oxidation. Drying of brown coals in nitrogen resulted in a significant increase in their aromaticity and a lower concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups. The loss of oxygen was confirmed by measuring the O/C ratio of raw and dried samples. The O/C ratio decreased by 30. 8 % and 40. 7 % for LY and YL coals, respectively, after drying at 200 °C for 10 min. Superheated steam fluidized-bed drying of both LY and YL coals showed the breakage of some weak <b>aliphatic</b> C–H <b>structures.</b> The decrease in adsorption of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups leads to loss of oxygen in both LY and YL steam-dried coals.

Biochar Interactions with Soil, Plant and Water – Processes and Fate, Florencia (Italia) 2013 Distinguishing {{pyrogenic}} and non-pyrogenic SOM components is {{a difficult}} task as non-selective pyrolysis products such as MAHs, PAHs and phenols can derive from multiple sources. However, black carbon (BC) may contribute significantly to the MAHs and PAHs in a given pyrolysate, especially if BC is more abundant than alternative sources. In this study, samples from a soil rich in pyrogenic material in NW Spain were subjected to K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and KMnO 4 oxidation and the residual SOM was NaOH-extracted and analyzed using analytical Py-GC-MS in order to study the susceptibility of different SOM fractions (fresh, degraded/microbial, aliphatic and specially BC) towards this oxidation agent. Besides solid-state 13 C CP MAS-NMR was also performed to support theses results. Non-oxidized samples following the same NaOH-extraction procedure were also analyzed. From Py-GC-MS, residual SOM after K 2 Cr 2 O 7 oxidation contained BC, N-containing BC (BN) and <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures</b> whilst carbohydrate products and lignocellulose were completely oxidized. This was corroborated by a relatively intense resonance of aromatic C and some signal of alkyl C (supporting {{the presence of a}} non-pyrogenic fraction mainly consisting of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures)</b> in 13 C NMR spectra. Thus K 2 Cr 2 O 7 effectively concentrates MAHs, PAHs and BN derived from BC. For KMnO 4, both techniques indicated that this reagent promotes the oxidation of carbohydrate products, mostly from degraded/microbial SOM but slightly oxidized lignocellulose and aromatic structures (pyrogenic and nonpyrogenic) not providing a good assessment of the BC signal.

40|$|The ultrafast {{excited state}} {{dynamics}} of the sunscreen ingredient menthyl anthranilate (MenA) and its precursor methyl anthranilate (MA) were studied in vacuum (using time-resolved ion yield spectroscopy) and in solution (using transient electronic absorption spectroscopy). MenA and MA both show long-lived dynamics, with the observation of a kinetic isotope effect suggesting that hydrogen motion acts as the rate determining process in the overall decay. Complementary computational studies exploring the intuitive decay pathways of MA revealed a bound S 1 state with a shallow ‘up-hill’ gradient with respect to proton transfer. From these results, {{it is suggested that}} photoexcited population is trapped in this excited state from which luminescence occurs as a prominent decay pathway.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of the plugboard wastewater was performed by an optimal electrocoagulation and electro-Fenton. The organic components with suspended fractions accounting for 30 % COD were preferably removed via electrocoagulation at initial 5 min. In contrast, the removal efficiency was increased to 76 % {{with the addition of}} H 2 O 2. The electrogenerated Fe 2 + reacts with H 2 O 2 and leads to the generation of (OH) -O-center dot, which is responsible for the higher COD removal. However, overdosage H 2 O 2 will consume (OH) -O-center dot generated in the electro-Fenton process and lead to the low COD removal. The COD removal efficiency decreased with the increased pH. The concentration of Fe 2 + ions was dependent on the solution pH, H 2 O 2 dosage and current density. The changes of organic characteristics in coagulation and oxidation process were differenced and evaluated using gel permeation chromatography, fluorescence excitation-emission scans and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

After treatment with HNO 3, the peak for the (002) plane of sample 2 and 3 slightly shifted to higher degree compared with raw coal sample (sample 1), and gradually approached the (002) plane of graphite at 26.6 °, but the peak width and height showed a significant difference, i.e., the peak of sample 2 which was only treated at 25  °C became wider and shorter while the peak of sample 3 which was treated with HNO 3 under reflux became narrower and higher. The results reveal that HNO 3 treatment under reflux condition can not only lower the ash content in the coal structure but also reduce the content of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure,</b> thereby increasing the relative content of polycyclic aromatic rings (Taylor and Bell 1980; Takagi et al. 2004).

Molecular dynamics in these systems were investigated by combining Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Currents (TSDC) and broadband Dielectric Relaxation Spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. High conductivity contribution in dielectric loss does not allow {{the study of the}} segmental a relaxation associated with the glass transition. In the glassy state two secondary relaxation mechanisms have been investigated, the gamma and the beta mechanism. The gamma relaxation mechanism, at low temperatures/high frequencies, is attributed to motions of the end groups (-OH for polyurethanes and -NH 2 for polyureas), and has been found faster in the hyperbranched polyureas. in addition, our results reveal that gamma relaxation mechanism in both series depends on the chemical structure, being faster for <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures.</b> The beta relaxation mechanism, at higher temperatures/lower frequencies, is attributed to the motions of branched ends with polar groups. Our study suggests that this mechanism may be a typical relaxation process for hyperbranched polyurethanes structures, not existed in the linear counterparts. All the systems exhibit dc conductivity at temperatures higher than T-g which shows Arrhenius-like temperature dependence and is characterized by rather high activation energies (in the order of 200 kJ/mol). At temperatures lower than T-g all the systems studied exhibit remarkably high charge mobility. In particular, aliphatic hyperbranched polyureas exhibit dc conductivity which {{has been found to be}} of VTF type concerning the temperature dependence.

It has been found in a limited number of microalgae species. There is considerable uncertainty about its formation and preservation, as well as its role in kerogen formation and the implications for the global C cycle. We tested whether the cyanobacterium Chlorogloeopsis fritschii can synthesise a biomacromolecule similar to algaenan with potential to contribute to kerogen via selective preservation. Two freshwater green microalgae, Pseudochoricystis ellipsoidea and Scenedesmus obliquus, as well as C. fritschii, were subjected to harsh solvent extraction and hydrolysis steps to obtain an insoluble and non-hydrolysable macromolecule. The residues from all three species were analysed using pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The analysis revealed that C. fritschii indeed contains a resistant biomacromolecule exhibiting the characteristic <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> of algaenan, similar to the algaenan residues from the two microalgae. Due to the robust nature of Chlorogloeopsis compared with eukaryotes, it can prevail in extreme environmental conditions such as freezing, thawing, desiccation and overheating – conditions prevalent on the primeval earth.

The considered processes include aromatization and photodestruction, sputtering by electrons and ions, and shattering due to collisions between grains. The model can be used to simulate the grain size distribution and the aromatization degree during the evolution of HII regions and supernova remnants for a specified radiation field, relative velocity of gas and dust, etc. The contribution of various processes to the evolution of hydrocarbon dust grains for parameters typical for the interstellar medium of our Galaxy is presented. Small grains (less than 50 carbon atoms) should be fully aromatized in the general interstellar medium. If larger grains initially have an <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure,</b> it is preserved to a substantial extent.

40|$|Polyphenylenes were {{prepared}} by using biphenyl-AlCl 3 -CuCl 2 according to cationic oxidative polymerization. The chlorobenzene soluble fraction was doped with 10 % (w/v) solution of FeCl 3, in acetonitrile. The alternating electrical conductivity, X-ray diffractograms and the FTIR-spectra of both undoped and doped polyphenylenes were measured. The {{proportion of the}} components used for the preparation of polyphenylenes strongly influences their structure {{as well as their}} conductive properties. The undoped polyphenylenes were found to be insulators, but most of them became semiconductors after doping. The increase of the alternating electrical conductivity sigma'(resulting from the real part of the admittance-vector) of the doped polyphenylenes has been explained considering the factors that influence the polyphenylenes structure: the high ratio of para/meta, the presence of both amorphous and crystalline regions, and the presence of polynuclear structures. On the other hand, the presence of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures</b> interrupts the conjugation system, leading to lower sigma' values...|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on four different residual fuel oils in a 732 kW boiler. Particulate matter (PM) emission samples were separated aerodynamically by a cyclone into fractions that were nominally less than and greater than 2. 5 microns in diameter. However, examination {{of several of the}} samples by computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) revealed that part of the 2. 5 micron samples (PM{sub 2. 5 +}). Inorganic sulfides and elemental sulfur were present in lower percentages. The Ni XANES spectra from all of the samples agree fairly well with that of NiSO 4, while most of the V spectra closely resemble that of vanadyl sulfate (VO{center_dot}SO{sub 4 }{center_dot}xH{sub 2 }O). The other metals investigated (Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb) were also present predominantly as sulfates. Arsenic is present as an arsenate (As{sup + 5 }). X-ray diffraction patterns of the PM{sub 2. 5 } fraction exhibit sharp lines due to sulfate compounds (Zn, V, Ni, Ca, etc.) superimposed on broad peaks due to amorphous carbons. All of the samples contain a significant organic component, with the LOI ranging from 64 to 87 % for the PM{sub 2. 5 } fraction and from 88 to 97 % for the PM{sub 2. 5 +} fraction. {sup 13 }C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis indicates that the carbon is predominantly condensed in graphitic structures. <b>Aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> was detected in only one of seven samples examined...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the synthesis of}} novel aqueous dispersions from renewable resources by means of radical emulsion polymerization. The substitution of polymeric materials from limited petrochemical resources through renewable materials {{presents the}} necessary challenge. These aqueous dispersions have potential applications as binders in paints and coatings, water-based adhesives, in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. One of the suitable starting material is the biotechnological mass product itaconic acid, which is structurally similar to acrylic and methacrylic acid. To obtain suitable monomers for emulsion polymerization itaconates are synthesized by means of esterification using itaconic acid or itaconic anhydride and the appropriate fatty alcohol as starting materials. Furthermore new monomers based on monosaccharides and itaconic acid are described. The hydrophobic sugar methacrylate is synthesized in a one-step reaction starting from 1, 2 : 5, 6 -di-O-isopropylidene-?-D-glucofuranose. Sugar latexes are obtained by means of batch emulsion polymerization of the sugar methacrylate and fatty alcohol itaconates. Another series of new latexes based on the sugar methacrylate and commercially available fatty alcohol acrylates are also specified. The copolymerization behavior of itaconates with the rigid sugar methacrylate is studied in the conventional emulsion polymerization and also in miniemulsion. The colloidal and rheological properties of the latexes are investigated. Also the thermal, optical and molecular properties of the precipitated polymers are demonstrated. The polymerization conditions are varied and the relations between them and polymer and latex properties are determined. The influence of the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> of fatty alcohol itaconates either on the polymerization kinetics or on the latex properties is disscused. Additionally this book gives {{an overview of the}} research work concerning the polymerization of the sugar methacrylate in emulsion...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} of detached seed-fern ovules (Euramerican and Cathaysian floral provinces, Pennsylvanian - Permian) as compression / impression, their palaeobiochemistry remains unknown. The Late Pennsylvanian strata of the Sydney Coalfield, Canada, have yielded numerous ovulate trigonocarpalean compressions, 6 - 8 cm long, with preserved cuticles assigned to Trigonocarpus grandis (Lesquereux) Cleal et Zodrow. The macerated cuticles are analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Carbon- 13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13 C NMR), and Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). FTIR and 13 C NMR data reveal a predominantly <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structure</b> including C-H groups (with or without hetero-substitution such as in alkyl and aryl alcohols, ethers, esters, and ketones). Larger CH 2 /CH 3 ratios (above 20) suggest the presence of long and straight aliphatic side chains linked to the main macromolecular structure. Other groups present include C-O (in phenols and phenoxy structures, and aryl and alkyl ethers and alcohols), C=O carbonyl groups (in carboxylic acids and conjugated and highly conjugated structures such as ketones), C=C (in aromatic carbon structures with and without bridging to other carbon groups), and O-H (in aliphatic or aromatic alcohols). In addition, 13 C NMR shows, compared to other cuticles in related seed ferns, a high amount of acetal groups as they occur in di- and polysaccharides. In agreement with FTIR and NMR results, Py-GC-MS data show the presence of highly aliphatic molecules (alkanes/alkenes) with carbons between C 4 and C 8 (including a complex mixture of mono and di unsaturated hydrocarbon isomers up to C 8). Other compounds detected include benzene and toluene. However, the most striking chemical feature of the pyrolysates markers {{is the presence of}} 5 isomers of C 5 H 8 including isoprene (0. 5 - 1. 0 % abundance). The latter could be derived from some tocopherol precursor (vitamin E-like compound). If confirmed, this is the earliest chemical evidence for the presence of isoprenoids in vascular plants.

Then, the aliphatic hydrocarbons linked with oxygen-containing groups such as nitro group, mineral salts, and small aromatic molecules distributed between the gaps of the first phase was dissolved in water phase when washing the system to pH =  0.012. As the washing number increase (pH =  1.99 – 4.09), {{the rest of the}} sediment depolymerized, and the depolymerized coal samples are composed of only aromatic compound linked with more oxygen-containing groups including hydroxyl, carboxyl, ester, carbonyl, nitro, and sulfonic groups, possessing the annulus wall of multilayer graphene fragment structures built up by sp 2 carbons, as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons lost aliphatic chains or ether bonds is easier to oxidation when the proportion of mixed acid and the water reached to a certain value (Ross et al. 1986). They are typical fluorescent substances of carbon nanoparticle structure (Eda et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} research we demonstrated that some amino acid derivatives of deoxyadenosine 5 '-O-monophosphate act as substrates for incorporation into DNA by HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase while retaining the canonical base-pair selectivity for all natural bases. Thus, some amino acids mimic the pyrophosphate {{group in the}} polymerization process with this enzyme. Herein we extended this study to the evaluation {{of a range of}} potential new leaving groups with aromatic and <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures</b> carrying one or two carboxylic acid functions. Out of this series, the isophthalic acid derivative of deoxyadenosine 5 '-O-monophosphate gave single-nucleotide incorporation results similar to those obtained with the L-aspartic acid phosphoramidate of deoxyadenosine monophosphate. The glycolic acid analogue is a better substrate than the glycine congener, supporting the good leaving group properties of a phosphodiester linkage. These investigations provide new insight into the structural requirements for leaving groups that can mimic the pyrophosphate moiety of nucleoside triphosphates. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} in the hydrogen isotope composition (D/H ratio values) of n-alkanes, pristane, phytane, and aromatic hydrocarbons with increasing maturity was investigated using a set of immature to mature Miocene siliceous mudstones. The D/H values of aromatic hydrocarbons change at the earliest stage (vitrinite reflectance, Ro = 0. 4 – 0. 5 %), by way of higher values in immature rocks. A dramatic increase in values is observed for pristane and phytane during the mature stage (Ro = 0. 6 – 0. 7 %), attributable to hydrogen exchange with sediment porewater. The decrease in the values of short chain n-alkanes and the disappearance of carbon number predominance in n-alkane D/H values with increasing maturity {{is a result of}} the thermal cracking of <b>aliphatic</b> <b>structures</b> in bitumen and kerogen. The long chain n-alkanes derived from higher plant wax can maintain their initial values, even in the zone of extensive oil generation (Ro < 0. 7 %) ...|$|R
