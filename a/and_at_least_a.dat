5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as it is very hard to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> partly sunny aspect.|$|E
5|$|Admission {{into the}} University Honors Program is by {{invitation}} only. The average academic profile of students that were offered honors invitations in 2015 was as follows: 4.2 weighted GPA; 32 ACT composite; 2080 SAT total. For the Honors in the Major Program students, the University Honors Office requires that prospective students {{have at least}} sixty semester hours <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> 3.2 cumulative FSU GPA. The Honors program offers students housing in Landis Hall and Gilchrist Hall. Landis Hall is the traditional home of Honors students since 1955, which is situated on Landis Green {{at the heart of}} FSU's main campus. Gilchrist Hall also houses Honors students and is conveniently located adjacent to Landis Hall. The two halls enjoy a shared study which allows Honors students living in either residence hall to easily gather with classmates and friends.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E

5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
5|$|The two 37mm (1.46in) Bordkanone BK 3,7 cannons were {{mounted in}} {{under-wing}} gun pods, each loaded with two six-round magazines of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition. With these weapons, the Kanonenvogel ("cannon-bird"), {{as it was}} nicknamed, proved very successful {{in the hands of}} Stuka aces such as Rudel. The G-1 was converted from older D-series airframes, retaining the smaller wing, but without the dive brakes. The G-2 was similar to the G-1 except for use of the extended wing of the D-5. 208 G-2s were built <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> further 22 more were converted from D-3 airframes.|$|E
5|$|December 1915 {{also saw}} {{concrete}} {{progress on the}} mission's Turco-German objective. The Emir informed von Hentig {{he was ready to}} discuss a treaty of Afghan-German friendship, but said it would take time and require extensive historical research. Work on the treaty began with drafts proposed by von Hentig. The final draft of ten articles presented on 24 January 1916 included clauses recognising Afghan independence, a declaration of friendship with Germany, and establishment of diplomatic relations. Von Hentig was to be accredited the Embassy Secretary of the German Empire. In addition, the treaty would guarantee German assistance against Russian and British threats if Afghanistan joined the war on the Central side. The Emir's army was to be modernised, with Germany providing 100,000 modern rifles, 300 artillery pieces, and other modern warfare equipment. The Germans were to be responsible for maintaining advisors and engineers, and to maintain an overland supply route through Persia for arms and ammunition. Further, the Emir was to be paid £1,000,000. Both von Hentig and Niedermayer signed this document which created—as von Hentig argued in a telegram to the Foreign Office—an initial basis to prepare for an Afghan invasion of India. Niedermayer explained that the Emir intended to begin his campaign as soon as Germany could make available 20,000 troops to protect the Afghan-Russian front, and asked for urgently for wireless sets, a substantial shipment of arms, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> million pounds initial funding. He judged conditions to be ideal for an offensive into India, and informed the general staff to expect the campaign to begin in April.|$|E

25|$|The Mini-SAR has imaged {{many of the}} {{permanently}} shadowed {{regions that}} exist at both poles of the Moon.

The radar's high CPR is not uniquely diagnostic of either roughness or ice; the science team must take into account the environment of the occurrences of high CPR signal to interpret its cause. The ice must be relatively pure <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> couple of meters thick to give this signature.

25|$|UUCP {{networks}} {{spread quickly}} {{due to the}} lower costs involved, {{and the ability to}} use existing leased lines, X.25 links or even ARPANET connections. By 1983, thousands of people participated from more than 500 hosts, mostly universities and Bell Labs sites but also a growing number of Unix-related companies; the number of hosts nearly doubled to 940 in 1984. More than 100 newsgroups existed, more than 20 devoted to Unix and other computer-related topics, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> third to recreation. As the mesh of UUCP hosts rapidly expanded, it became desirable to distinguish the Usenet subset from the overall network. A vote was taken at the 1982 USENIX conference to choose a new name. The name Usenet was retained, but it was established that it only applied to news. The name UUCPNET became the common name for the overall network.|$|E

Devin accompanied Stagg's men to discover the situation. Upon seeing Davies's brigade in retreat, Devin tried unsuccessfully to rally them. Then he sent an order to Colonel Fitzhugh to move to the road from Danse's ford, leaving one regiment on the Dinwiddie Road. After struggling through Davies's stragglers, Fitzhugh's men relieved Janeway's rear guard and stopped Corse's advance. Davies took his men to J. Boisseau's farm to be reorganized, losing dozens of men along the way, including Major James H. Hart of the 1st New Jersey Cavalry.|$|E
25|$|The J3 League is {{currently}} the third level in the association football system, supplanting the Japan Football League (JFL) which is now one step lower in the system. Being a professional league, the J.League allows only certain clubs from J3 to be promoted. In 2000, 2001, and 2006 the JFL league champion was promoted to J2; in 2005 two teams were promoted. From 2007, the league requires J.League Associate Membership <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> fourth-place finish in JFL (J3 from 2013) to be promoted to J2.

25|$|At 01:45, Patterson {{detected}} Mikawa's {{ships and}} alerted the Allied force. The Japanese scout planes dropped flares to silhouette Canberra and Chicago. The Australian cruiser {{was able to}} avoid the Japanese torpedoes fired {{at the start of}} the engagement, but was on the receiving end of the Japanese cruisers' gunfire. The first two salvos killed or wounded several senior officers, disabled both engine rooms, damaged the bridge and 4-inch gun platform and forced the flooding of her 8-inch magazines. Within two minutes, the cruiser had been hit 24 times; she was immobilised, without power, and listing to starboard, with multiple internal fires <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> fifth of her personnel dead or wounded. At least one torpedo strike was reported during the Japanese attack, although none of the 19 torpedoes fired at Canberra by the Japanese cruisers were recorded as hitting their target. Several personnel from Canberra believe that USS Bagley inadvertently torpedoed the cruiser. From the 819-strong ship's company, 84 were killed (74 during the battle, 10 dying later from wounds), and another 109 were wounded.|$|E
