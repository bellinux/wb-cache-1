5|$|The cult of Athena Polias (the city's eponymous goddess) {{was central}} to Athenian society, {{reinforcing}} morality and maintaining societal structure.

However, the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus, as opposed to typical bipeds, indicating a straight and vertical limb position. Thus, the hindlimbs, though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium, did not support the animal alone, and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15% of the bodyweight.|$|E

40|$|Let k be a knot in S 3. In [8], H. N. Howards and J.

In this article, we will prove that if <b>a</b> thin <b>position</b> <b>of</b> k induces <b>a</b> thin decomposition of double branched cover of (S 3,k) by Howards and Schultens' method, then the thin position {{is the sum of}} prime summands by stacking <b>a</b> thin <b>position</b> <b>of</b> one of prime summands of k on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thin <b>position</b> <b>of</b> another prime summand, and so on. Therefore, k holds the nearly additivity of knot width (i. e. for k = k 1 #k 2, w(k) = w(k 1) #w(k 2) - 2) in this case. Moreover, we will generalize the hypothesis to the property <b>a</b> thin <b>position</b> induces <b>a</b> manifold decomposition whose thick surfaces consists of strongly irreducible or critical surfaces (so topologically minimal.)

5|$|After {{several days}} visiting {{his father in}} Purworejo, Oerip {{returned}} to Meester Cornelis where he took up a posting to BattalionXII.

After a period patrolling the jungles outside Puruk Cahu and Muara Tewe, he was sent to Tanah Grogot, followed by Balikpapan. While stationed there Oerip was promoted to first lieutenant but faced discrimination as a native in the Dutch forces. In Banjarmasin he had convinced his commander to strike an ordinance forbidding non-Dutch officers from joining the football team, and by 1917 Oerip had received equal legal status with Dutch officers. After Balikpapan Oerip was further sent to Samarinda, Tarakan, and ultimately Malinau.|$|E
5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E
