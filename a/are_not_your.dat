Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero.

500|$|During the fleet's construction, Arnold {{ordered the}} arrest and trial of Hazen for {{dereliction}} of his duty {{with respect to}} the incident at Chambly. [...] Hazen, a politically well-connected figure (his commission to lead the 2nd Canadian came after appearing before Congress following the Battle of Quebec), turned the proceeding on its head, countercharging that Arnold had stolen the goods in question, and that the officer responsible for transporting them, a Major Scott, had damaged them in transit. [...] Major Scott's testimony was questioned and eventually rejected by the court martial, [...] which acquitted Hazen and ordered Arnold's arrest. [...] General Horatio Gates, then in command at Ticonderoga, dissolved the arrest warrant, citing the desperate need for Arnold's services against the expected British attack. [...] Arnold's silence in response to Hazen's accusation probably confirmed and deepened the opinions people already held of him; those favorably disposed to him perceived it as a dignified non-response to a ridiculous accusation, while those who disliked him saw it as the reaction of a man whose hand had been caught in the till. [...] Historians continue to debate whether Arnold was actually engaged in anything illegal. [...] In the aftermath of these incidents, Congressman Samuel Chase warned Arnold that [...] "your best friends <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> countrymen".|$|E

2500|$|After taking office, Obama stated {{his support}} for the {{creation}} of a Palestinian state and announced that he would engage in negotiations with Iran. He also declared he opposed Israeli settlements and wanted to revive peace talks.

2500|$|... "On closer {{analysis}} the oracle contains {{essential information}} which Oedipus seems to neglect." [...] The {{wording of the}} Oracle: I was doomed to be murderer of the father that begot me refers to Oedipus' real, biological father. Likewise the mother with polluted children {{is defined as the}} biological one. The wording of the drunken guest on the other hand: you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> father's son defines Polybus as only a foster father to Oedipus. The two wordings support each other and point to the [...] "two set of parents" [...] alternative. Thus the question of two set of parents, biological and foster, is raised. Oedipus's reaction to the Oracle is irrational: he states he did not get any answer and he flees in a direction away from Corinth, showing that he firmly believed at the time that Polybus and Merope are his real parents.|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides {{acknowledged}} {{that one might}} ask: Since God knows everything that will occur before it comes to pass, does God not know whether a person will be righteous or wicked? And if God knows that a person will be righteous, it would appear impossible for that person not to be righteous. However, if one would say that despite God's knowledge that the person would be righteous {{it is possible for}} the person to be wicked, then God's knowledge would be incomplete. Maimonides taught that just as it is beyond human potential to comprehend God's essential nature, as [...] says, [...] "No man will perceive Me and live," [...] so, too, it is beyond human potential to comprehend God's knowledge. This was what Isaiah intended when [...] says, [...] "For My thoughts <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> thoughts, nor your ways, My ways." [...] Accordingly, {{we do not have the}} potential to conceive how God knows all the creations and their deeds. But Maimonides said that it is without doubt that people's actions are in their own hands and God does not decree them. Consequently, the prophets taught that people are judged according to their deeds.|$|E
2500|$|Author Carol P. from Total TV Online, when {{describing}} JR as a tortured soul, commented, [...] "In {{the annals of}} literary history, there are many examples of the tortured soul anti-hero; i.e. Prince Hamlet, Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre, etc." [...] She said that people are drawn to these characters [...] "specifically because they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> run-of–the mill male protagonists who win the day" [...] {{and that they are}} rather [...] "flawed {{to such a degree that}} we, as the reader or the viewer are often afraid, that they may never find the peace and joy we desire for them". P. drew similarities between Dixie and Babe, reasoning that Babe possesses several of Dixie's worst qualities (lying, manipulation, unfaithfulness, etc.), and concluded that this was another reason JR married Babe: How can a young man, who has been raised with mixed messages about love, truth, and self worth, find a suitable life mate? For JR it wasn’t as simple as it appeared to have happened. There is so very much about Arabella 'Babe' Carey that was reminiscent to JR of his 'lost' mother; her size, her build, her coloring, her accent, her love of life, people, and experiences. JR was a goner the moment he spent any amount of time with her. What JR neglected to realize was that one person cannot and should not replace anyone in our lives; and that no two people will ever be exactly alike.|$|E
