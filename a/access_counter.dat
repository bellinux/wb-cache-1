We integrate the Wattch power model into Simple Scalar simulator {{in order to}} gain the power statistics in each time interval. For each functional unit in the processor, we add an <b>access</b> <b>counter</b> to record the access information, which is fed into the Wattch power model to calculate the dynamic power traces. In our experiments, we assume clock gating to all components and that clock gating can reduce dynamic power by 75 %, as proposed by Liao et al. (2005). For leakage power estimation of processor core units, we construct a leakage model (Liao et al. 2005) and use CACTI 5.0 (Wilton & Jouppi 1996) to accurately model cache leakage power.|$|E
40|$|The {{utility of}} cache and buffer {{is to reduce}} the time {{consumption}} when there is a data request. Due to the locality theory, the cache prefetches data for the future data request. Standing on the performance point of view, we need a mass cache to prefetch all data request. On the other hand, because of price and techniques reasons, the cache size is about dozens of mega bytes. With the capacity limit, a lot of cache management algorithms focus on two problems. Firstly which pages are to be prefetched into cache? Secondly which pages are to be swapped out of cache? Many cache management algorithms try to keep the pages with the greatest possibility of future access. The methodology of these algorithms is to maximize the possibility of cache hit. The cost of cache miss is expensive. Accordingly, new cache management algorithms are discussed in this paper. queue. E. Least Frequently Used (LFU) This algorithm swaps out the page accessed least frequently. The access times are recorded in an <b>access</b> <b>counter.</b> F.

40|$|Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) {{have become}} {{virtually}} ubiquitous {{due to the}} increasing impact of power and thermal constraints being placed on processor design, {{as well as the}} diminishing returns of building ever more complex uniprocessors. While the number of cores on a chip has increased rapidly, changes to other aspects of system design have been slower in coming. Namely, the on-chip memory hierarchy has largely been unchanged despite the shift to multicore designs. The last level of cache on chip is generally shared by all hardware threads on the chip, creating a ripe environment for resource allocation problems. This dissertation examines cache resource allocation in large-scale chip multiprocessors. It begins by performing extensive supporting {{research in the area of}} shared cache metric analysis, concluding that there is no single optimal shared cache design metric. This result supports the idea that shared caches ought not explicitly attempt to achieve optimal partitions; rather they should only react when unfavorable performance is detected. This study is followed by some studies using machine learning analysis to extract salient characteristics in predicting poor shared cache performance. The culmination of this dissertation is a shared cache management framework called SLAM (Scalable, Lightweight, Adaptive Management). SLAM is a scalable and feasible mechanism which detects inefficiency of cache usage by hardware threads sharing the cache. An inefficient thread can be easily punished by effectively reducing its cache occupancy via a modified cache insertion policy. The crux of SLAM is the detection of inefficient threads, which relies on two novel performance monitors in the cache which stem from the results of the machine learning studies: the Misses Per <b>Access</b> <b>Counter</b> (MPAC), and the Relative Insertion Tracker (RIT), which each requires only tens of bits in storage per thread. SLAM not only provides a means for extracting significant performance gains over current cache designs (up to 13. 1 % improvement), but SLAM also provides a means for granting differentiated quality of service to various cache sharers. Particularly as commercialized virtual servers become increasingly common, being able to provide differentiated quality of service at low cost potentially has significant value...|$|E

40|$|A shared counter is a {{concurrent}} object {{which provides}} the fetch-and-increment operation on a distributed system. Recently, diffracting trees {{have been introduced}} as shared counters which work well under high load. They efficiently divide high loads into lower loads that can quickly <b>access</b> lock-based <b>counters</b> that share the overall counting. Their throughputs have surpassed all other shared counters when heavily loaded. However, diffracting trees of differing depths are optimal for only a short load range. The ideal algorithm would scale from the simple queue-lock based counter to a collection of counters with a mechanism (such as a diffracting tree) to distribute the load. In this thesis, we present the dynamic diffracting tree, an object similar to a diffracting tree, but which can expand and collapse to better handle current access patterns and the memory layout of the object's data structure, providing true scalability and locality. This tree then assumes each diffracting tree over its optimal range, from the trivial diffracting tree, a lock-based counters, to larger trees that have a collection of lock-based counters.
