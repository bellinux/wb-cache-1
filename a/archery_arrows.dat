50|$|Flight archery {{relies on}} the finest in {{performance}} equipment, optimized for the single purpose of greater range, using various types of bows (some unusual such as foot bows). The search for better flight archery equipment has led to many developments in archery equipment in general, such as the development of carbon arrows.Flight <b>archery</b> <b>arrows</b> are highly specialized. They are very short (Mahmoud Effendi's was only 14 inches), so that {{the point of the}} arrow is inside the arc of the fully drawn bow, requiring a support projecting back from the bow towards the archer to keep the arrow in position, or the use of a 'siper'(Turkish) on the bow hand/wrist on which to rest the arrow. Also, the shafts are 'barrelled', tapering towards both ends from the middle, to reduce both weight and air resistance.|$|E

Archery performance {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the vibrational behaviour of arrows (including the natural frequencies and mode shapes). This paper investigates the vibration of composite <b>archery</b> <b>arrows</b> through analytical and finite element modelling. Computer models used in this paper employ modal analysis to identify the significant modes of vibration. Results from the numerical simulations are also compared to experimental measurements using a Polytec scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (PSV- 400). Experiments use both mechanically and acoustically coupled vibration actuators to vibrate the composite arrow structure. Evaluation of the modal behaviour shows good agreement between the theoretical models and the experiments. Marianne Rieckmann, John Codrington and Ben Cazzolato[URL]...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} two support-interference-free {{measurements of}} aerodynamic forces exerted on an <b>archery</b> <b>arrow.</b> The first measurement is {{performed in a}} wind tunnel with JAXA's 60 cm Magnetic Suspension and Balance System, whereas the second measurement is carried out by a free flight experiment. In the latter measurement, the trajectory and rotation of the arrow is recorded by two high-speed video cameras and the arrow's down range velocity decay rate is analyzed to determine the drag coefficient. The arrow-shooting system developed by Miyazaki et al. (2013) is utilized, in order to investigate Re number dependence of the drag coefficient for. We attach two points (piles) of different type (streamlined and bullet) to the arrow-head and two kinds of vanes (SPIN- WING-VANE and GAS PRO) to the arrow-tail. The boundary layer remains laminar for any combination of point and vane, if Re is less than. It becomes turbulent for Re larger than and the drag coefficient increases to about 2. 6, when the bullet point and SPIN-WING-VANE are attached. In the same Re range, two values of drag coefficient are found for the combination of streamlined point and SPIN-WING-VANE. The lower value (about 1. 6) corresponds to a laminar boundary layer and the larger value (about 2. 6) to a turbulent boundary layer. In contrast, for GAS PRO vanes, the boundary layer remains laminar at any Re considered, irrespective of the point- shape. These findings confirm that both the point- and vane-shapes have a crucial influence on the laminar to turbulent transition of the boundary layer. We also asked an elite female archer (recurve bow) to shoot the same A/C/E arrow (with bullet point and SPIN-WING-VANE), of which velocity is 58 m/s (). The arrow launched by the archer oscillates along its length (Archer's Paradox), and the drag coefficient {{is found to be}} about 2. 65 (turbulent value), indicating that the oscillation of the arrow induces the boundary layer transition...|$|R

Because of its high draw weight and mechanical efficiency, the Turkish composite bow became a powerful weapon in the Seljuk and the Ottoman empire.

In this study of the Ottoman composite archery bows in the collections of Izmir Ethnography Museum, a small wood sample was investigated on the basis of its wood anatomy. The results showed that it was made of maple wood (Acer sp.) and some of its qualitative and quantitative anatomical properties are presented here. One of the key properties for the identification of maple wood is the helical thickening throughout the body of the vessel element. Helical thickenings in vessel elements in cutting surfaces of maple-wooden core increase the bonding surface between the wood and sinew-horn. In most of the woods preferred traditionally for bow-making, helical thickenings in tracheids, vessel elements or ground tissue fibres should be taken into account at a hierarchy of cellular structures for elucidating the efficiency of Ottoman composite-wooden bow...|$|R
