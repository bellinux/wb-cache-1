5|$|The Peace Candle {{was first}} erected in 1951, {{and has been}} put up almost every year since then. Due to damage or disrepair, the Peace Candle has been {{replaced}} with new candle structures twice since the original construction. The first candle lasted until 1968, the second candle from 1969 to 1989, and the current candle was built in 1990 {{and is expected to}} last until around 2014. The structure is dedicated to the Easton area men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> served or are serving in the United States armed forces.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} {{for bringing the}} world into chaos, Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end. Guided by Yune through Micaiah, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower of Guidance (a massive structure in Begnion's capital) where Ashera lies. Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification {{of the world as}} a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein. Each of them run into the Disciples of Order, formerly regular men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists. In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka, who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion's thumb. Ike also learns that the Black Knight's true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius. In an encounter with Senator Lekain, Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate. Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child, and that her (previously unknown) older sister was killed years previously. This revelation is outwardly refuted by the Empress, but she inwardly develops a degree of doubt in herself. All three armies eventual convene {{at the base of the}} Tower of Guidance. Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune's champions against Ashera.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} whether women with anorexia or bulimia nervosa <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> recovered showed cognitive bias towards shape, food and adolescent issues. DESIGN: A five-group analysis of variance design was used, in which the different client groups were the independent variables. The dependent variable was performance on an emotional Stroop task. METHODS: Current anorexia sufferers (N = 31), current bulimia sufferers (N = 24), recovered anorexics (N = 23), recovered bulimics (N = 11) <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never suffered from eating disorders (N = 33) were recruited through health-care professionals, support groups and newspapers. Colour-naming times for target and comparison Stroop cards were measured. RESULTS: Women currently suffering from bulimia, <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> recovered from anorexia, {{were found to be}} more distracted by shape concerns than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never suffered eating disorders <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> recovered from bulimia. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that there may be an enduring cognitive bias among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> recovered from anorexia. This is the first study in which impairment on an emotional Stroop task has been found to persist after recovery from a clinical condition...|$|R

25|$|Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, {{practices}} and laws exist {{in many countries}} and institutions {{in every part of}} the world, including in territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination—but they have sometimes been called reverse discrimination. In the US, a government policy known as affirmative action was instituted to encourage employers and universities to seek out and accept groups such as African Americans <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been subject to discrimination for a long time.|$|E

25|$|Sexual attraction, {{behavior}} and identity {{may also be}} incongruent, as sexual attraction or behavior {{may not necessarily be}} consistent with identity. Some individuals identify themselves as heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual without having had any sexual experience. Others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Likewise, self-identified gay or lesbian individuals may occasionally sexually interact with members of the opposite sex but do not identify as bisexual. The terms queer, polysexual, heteroflexible, homoflexible, {{men who have sex with}} men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women may also be used to describe sexual identity or identify sexual behavior.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort {{in association with}} frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits. Symptoms usually are experienced as acute attacks that subside within one day, but recurrent attacks are likely. There may also be urgency for bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation (tenesmus), bloating, or abdominal distension. In some cases, the symptoms are relieved by bowel movements. People with IBS, more commonly than others, have gastroesophageal reflux, symptoms relating to the genitourinary system, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, backache, and psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. About a third of men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> IBS also report sexual dysfunction typically {{in the form of}} a reduction in libido.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the country, the United States has sought to compensate the men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> served in its armed forces. In 1917, the U.S. Congress passed legislation emphasizing an indemnity model for veterans disability benefits. Congress sought to clarify and better specify provisions of the law in 1919 amendments to the original bill. Since that year, compensation has been provided to veterans suffering from physical or mental disabilities that were incurred during, or aggravated by, military service, and which have adversely impacted the veteran's ability to work. The amount of compensation provided—both cash payments and VA-sponsored services—are based on the veteran's average impairment in earnings capacity. Since OIF/OEF, PTSD has grown to be the third most compensated disability in the VA after hearing loss and tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|Endal's {{owner was}} Allen Parton. Parton {{suffered}} serious head injuries whilst serving with the Royal Navy in the Gulf in 1991, including 50% memory loss and inability to reliably make new memories {{for more than}} around 2 days (for example, not recognising his neighbour of 7 years), physical disability (he was a wheelchair user), speech and word difficulties, inability to perceive materials {{that are out of}} his sight, and inability to safely judge speed and distance of traffic. For a considerable time after partnering with Endal, he was unable to speak and was limited to basic sign language. In 2008, commenting on a portrait of Endal, Parton said that one of his greatest fears was that, in 10 years, he would be unable to remember what Endal looked like.

25|$|The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), {{adopted in}} 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from {{discrimination}} and equality under the law.

Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help Nigerian women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure {{the health and well-being of}} families, including information and advice on family planning.|$|E
