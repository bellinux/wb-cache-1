5|$|Copper {{is one of}} the few metals {{that occur}} in nature in {{directly}} usable metallic form (native metals) as opposed to needing extraction from an ore. This led to very early human use, from c. 8000 BC. It was the first metal to be smelted from its ore, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a shape in <b>a</b> <b>mold,</b> c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.|$|E

5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into <b>a</b> <b>mold</b> cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer {{to feel a little}} sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from <b>a</b> <b>mold</b> of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
5|$|The {{precious}} metals {{silver and gold}} were not common in the Eastern Ranges, while copper was mined in Gachantivá, Moniquirá and in {{the mountains to the}} south of the Bogotá savanna at Sumapaz. The process of elaborating the fine filigree figures took place by creating <b>a</b> <b>mold</b> of obsidian, shale or clay, filling the open space with bee wax, obtained through trade with the neighbouring indigenous peoples from the Llanos Orientales to the east of the Altiplano; the Achagua, Tegua and Guayupe. The bee wax occupied the voids of the mold and the mold was heated by fires. The bee wax would melt, leaving an open space where the tumbaga or sometimes gold was poured into, a process called lost-wax casting. Using this method, modern tunjos are still fabricated in the centre of Bogotá.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. <b>A</b> <b>mold</b> of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E

25|$|This {{technique}} {{does not}} require the use of a solid porogen like SCPL. First, a synthetic polymer is dissolved into a suitable solvent (e.g. polylactic acid in dichloromethane) then water is added to the polymeric solution and the two liquids are mixed in order to obtain an emulsion. Before the two phases can separate, the emulsion is cast into <b>a</b> <b>mold</b> and quickly frozen by means of immersion into liquid nitrogen. The frozen emulsion is subsequently freeze-dried to remove the dispersed water and the solvent, thus leaving a solidified, porous polymeric structure. While emulsification and freeze-drying allow for a faster preparation when compared to SCPL (since it {{does not require}} a time consuming leaching step), it still requires the use of solvents. Moreover, pore size is relatively small and porosity is often irregular. Freeze-drying by itself is also a commonly employed technique for the fabrication of scaffolds. In particular, it is used to prepare collagen sponges: collagen is dissolved into acidic solutions of acetic acid or hydrochloric acid that are cast into <b>a</b> <b>mold,</b> frozen with liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized.|$|E
