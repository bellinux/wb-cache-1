5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} <b>at</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>State</b> University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, {{were accused of}} raping a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure of how many people had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her and Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed her picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} <b>at</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>State</b> University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation {{was the leading}} cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were {{the leading cause of}} colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E

He married young, but his first wife, Margaret (Stephens), died 3 weeks following birth of their second child, a daughter named Nancy Stephens Ware. Following graduation, with the financial help of his father he bought a grain and dairy farm near Arden, a small town southwest of Pittsburgh, where he learned {{about the process of}} farming firsthand. His brief experience as a working farmer made him almost a unique figure among pioneer members of the American Communist Party, a group almost exclusively composed of urban laborers, factory workers, or intellectuals, mostly foreign-born.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Russell Marker, a {{professor}} of organic chemistry <b>at</b> <b>Pennsylvania</b> <b>State</b> University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from sarsaparilla, which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the saponin from inedible Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana and Dioscorea composita) found in the rain forests of Veracruz near Orizaba. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety diosgenin. Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the barbasco yam had started and {{the period of the}} heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.|$|E
