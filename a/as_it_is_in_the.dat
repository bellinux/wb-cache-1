5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E

5|$|The golden white-eye {{differs from}} the other {{white-eyes}} in having large eyes and an outermost primary wing feather that is not reduced (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other species). It is a large white-eye, 14cm (5.5in) long and weighing around 20g (0.7oz). The species has bright, unmistakable plumage, with: an orange-yellow head coupled with a pale eye-ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. The bill and legs are also orange. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males can be told from the females only when examined in the hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown-yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{isotopes}} of nobelium are known, {{with mass}} numbers 250–260 and 262; all are radioactive. Additionally, nuclear isomers {{are known for}} mass numbers 251, 253, and 254. Of these, the longest-lived isotope is 259No with a half-life of 58minutes, and the longest-lived isomer is 251mNo with a half-life of 1.7seconds. However, the still undiscovered isotope 261No is predicted to have a still longer half-life of 170min. Additionally, the shorter-lived 255No (half-life 3.1minutes) is more often used in chemical experimentation {{because it can be}} produced in larger quantities from irradiation of californium-249 with carbon-12 ions. After 259No and 255No, the next most stable nobelium isotopes are 253No (half-life 1.62minutes), 254No (51seconds), 257No (25seconds), 256No (2.91seconds), and 252No (2.57seconds). All of the remaining nobelium isotopes have half-lives that are less than a second, and the shortest-lived known nobelium isotope (250No) has a half-life of only 0.25milliseconds. The isotope 254No is especially interesting theoretically <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a series of prolate nuclei from 231Pa to 279Rg, and the formation of its nuclear isomers (of which two are known) is controlled by proton orbitals such as 2f5/2 which come just above the spherical proton shell; it can be synthesized in the reaction of 208Pb with 48Ca.|$|E

Tea from Benghazi has a uniquely thick, bitter taste. Tea drinking is a social activity that close friends and relatives usually take part in.|$|E
25|$|The Fraterculini {{are thought}} to have {{originated}} in the Pacific primarily because of their greater diversity there; there is only one extant species in the Atlantic, compared to two in the Pacific. The Fraterculini fossil record in the Pacific extends at least {{as far back as the}} middle Miocene, with three fossil species of Cerorhinca, and material tentatively referred to that genus, in the middle Miocene to late Pliocene of southern California and northern Mexico. Although there no records from the Miocene in the Atlantic, a re-examination of the North Carolina material indicated that the diversity of puffins in the early Pliocene was as great in the Atlantic <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific today. This diversity was achieved through influxes of puffins from the Pacific; the later loss of species was due to major oceanographic changes in the late Pliocene due to closure of the Panamanian Seaway and the onset of severe glacial cycles in the North Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|Outside Piedmont, Barbera {{is found}} {{throughout}} Italy, {{often as a}} component in mass vino da tavola blends. In the Lombardy region, {{it is seen as}} a varietal in Oltrepò Pavese with wines that range from slightly spritzy to semi-sparkling frizzante. Elsewhere in Lombardy it is blended with Croatina and {{as part of a larger}} blend component in the red wines of Franciacorta. Southeast of Piedmont, Barbera is found in Emilia-Romagna in the hills between Piacenza, Bologna and Parma. As in Lombardy, Barbera is often softened by blending with the lighter Croatina <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Val Tidone region for the DOC wine of Gutturnio. In Sardinia, the grape is used around Cagliari in the wine known as Barbera Sarda and in Sicily, the grape is used in various blends under the names Perricone or Pignatello made near Agrigento. Barbera was an important grape in re-establishing the wine industry of the Apulia and Campania regions following World War II due to its high yields and easy adaption to mechanical harvesting. Today it is a permitted variety to be blended with Aglianico in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Taurasi though it is rarely used.|$|E

25|$|Mount Barker {{is one of}} the 5 {{nominated}} subregions of the Great Southern wine {{region in}} Western Australia, which is Australia's largest wine region with a rectangle 200 kilometres from east to west and over 100 kilometers from north to south. The area has been described as 'the birthplace of the Great Southern wine region' and has won numerous awards for a variety of wines. Situated <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the Great Southern, the continental aspects of the climate make this quintessential country for Riesling and Shiraz. While, as {{with the rest of the}} region, rainfall is winter-spring dominant, late vintage rains can create problems. Mount Barker's continentality also means greater diurnal temperature fluctuations and the occasional spring frost. The Plantagenet Plateau, with Mount Barker its centre point, is marked by its marri soils, lateritic gravelly/sandy loams coming directly from granite rock protusions. Lat: 34 36’S; Alt: 180–250 m; Hdd: 1488; Gsr: 287mm; Mjt: 19C; Harvest: Early March to mid-April; Chief Viticultural Hazard: Spring frosts; late vintage rain. Plantagenet Wines established in 1968 was one of the first wineries in the region and is located within the town boundary.|$|E
25|$|Mar Sarkis, Ehden is {{a monastery}} {{located in the}} Zgharta District in the North Governorate of Lebanon. It is {{situated}} in the Qozhaya valley, the northern branch of the valley of Qadisha, {{to the east of}} Ehden. It overlooks Ehden, Kfarsghab, Bane and Hadath El Jebbeh. Given its exceptional location commanding the valley at 1500 meters altitude, the monastery is called the Watchful Eye of Qadisha. It is dedicated to Saints Sarkis and Bakhos (Saints Sergius and Bacchus). The name Ras Al Nahr means the top of the river <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the Mar Sarkis Source, the main contributor to the river Qlaynsieh which, after joining the Qannoubine river, will form near Tripoli the river Abou Ali. The Monastery belongs to the Lebanese Antonin Maronite Order, a Monastic Order founded on August 15, 1700, by the Maronite Patriarch Gabriel Al Blouzani from Blaouza (1704-1705). The first church of Saints Sarkis and Bakhos was built in the mid 8th Century A.D. on the ruins of a Canaanite temple dedicated to a divinity of agriculture. Next to it, another church dedicated to Our Lady was constructed in 1198 A.D.. Several buildings were added from 1404 up until 1690 when Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy restored part of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface tension}} of a watery surface (the {{water-air}} interface) {{tends to make}} that surface shrink. When that surface is curved <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alveoli of the lungs, the shrinkage of the surface decreases {{the diameter of the}} alveoli. The more acute the curvature of the water-air interface the greater the tendency for the alveolus to collapse. This has three effects. Firstly the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or non-compliant). Surfactant reduces the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more compliant, or less stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli have a greater tendency to collapse (i.e. cause atelectasis) at the end of exhalation {{that at the end of}} inhalation. Since surfactant floats on the watery surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink during exhalation. This causes them to have a greater surface tension-lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced). The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels, and keeps the alveoli dry.|$|E
