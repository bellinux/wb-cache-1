40|$|Background: This {{study was}} carried out to explore whether <b>amnioscopy</b> could help us to {{management}} of the uncertain date fetus to differ the prematurity from growth-restriction and assessment of post-term pregnancies as well. Notify the meconium staining of amniotic fluid is another aspect of <b>amnioscopy,</b> too. Study design: This was a descriptive study of 80 pregnant women from 2007 to 2008 at a university hospital, Tehran, Iran. The characteristics of amniotic fluid were documented on admission by inspection with transcervical <b>amnioscopy,</b> in all singleton pregnancies. Data were analyzed statistically. Results: Eighty women were admitted in labor {{during the study period}} and fulfilled the study inclusion criteria and had amniotic fluid evaluation available. Three pregnancies were uncertain date that managed according to amnioscope findings. Amniotic fluid were meconium stain in 22. 5 % (n = 18) and were clear 58. 7 % (n = 47) at <b>amnioscopy</b> and it was confirmed after delivery. Conclusion: This study suggests that <b>amnioscopy</b> is an easy and safe procedure for assessment of amniotic fluid characteristics. It could help us to differ prematurity (with vernix) from growth restriction(with yellowish or meconium staining). Further analysis will determine its role in the perinatal outcome...|$|E
40|$|<b>Amnioscopy</b> is the {{simplest}} and most widely used method for the estimation of slow progessive hypoxic fetal risk during the last four weeks of pregnancy [4]. A questionnaire organized to-gether with WAGNER including 25 % of all obstetrics clinics in our country showed that in 1971 85 % of them used <b>amnioscopy</b> [5]. In {{the case of a}} multiple pregnancy the use of this simple procedure {{did not appear to be}} fully satisfactory because there was an un-certainty about the state of the second twin. By combining <b>amnioscopy</b> with amniocentesis it is now possible to supervise both twins with equal certainty. The identification of the second amniotic cavity is made possible by the in...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} preventive measures in obstetrics is the termination of pregnancy at the right time. It is difficult to define some im-portant features of fetal maturity in high-risk infants because of the preventive early termina-tion of pregnancy. Laboratory procedufes [3] by which the fetal maturity is evaluated determine the functional maturity of separate organs, or they are able to estimate the completed develop-ment of the fetus. By combining several methods [7] one can approach very closely to the real maturity, while any single method shows con-siderable errors. During routine amnioscopies milky amniotic fluid has frequently been observed immedia-tely before the spontaneous delivery of mature infants. A striking fact was that the delivery began spontaneously with the appearance of milky amniotic fluid although the cervix was not yet ripe. It has been observed further that although the cervix was ripe the delivery did not begin spontaneously if the amniotic fluid was clear. In our hospital, nearly 2500 women have given birth in recent years. Approximately one half of these women have been followed with amniosco-py. <b>Amnioscopy</b> in the non-risk-group is usually started at term, but <b>amnioscopy</b> in the risk group is, of course, started earlier. l Material and methods By <b>amnioscopy</b> [9] the quality of the amniotic fluid proper äs well äs the quantity of vernix Curriculum vita...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{benefits}} of routine <b>amnioscopy</b> in the screening of fetal distress, the CTG score, the pH of umbilical artery and the Apgar score were determined and compared in two groups of patients: one group had meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), the other (control) had clear amniotic fluid. Although the prepathological and pathological CTG scores were more frequent in the MSAF group, {{the values of the}} umbilical artery pH had the same distribution in the two groups. The percentage of acidotic fetuses in the MSAF group is very low (2. 9 p. 100) and practically the same as in the control group (2. 5 p. 100). The Apgar score distribution at one and five minutes is also the same in the two groups. The distribution of CTG scores in acidotic fetuses is the same in the two groups, but the pre-acidotic fetuses born with meconial fluid have more often a pre-pathological or pathological CTG score. Fetuses with normal or suspect CTG-score and nevertheless acidotic or pre-acidotic pH values at birth are equally present whether the liquid is stained or not. <b>Amnioscopy</b> is therefore of no help even in this situation. In conclusion, the discovery of a MSAF is the manifestation of fetal hypoxia in only 2. 9 p. 100 of cases: the detection of this condition is better achieved by CTG recordings than by routine <b>amnioscopy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Eighty-two {{patients}} at 287 days' gestation or longer were tested by nonstress test (NST), <b>amnioscopy,</b> ultrasound assessment of amniotic fluid volume, and Doppler velocimetry. Several maternal and fetal arteries were analyzed: uterine, umbilical, descending thoracic aorta, renal, and middle cerebral. During the study, other maternal-fetal functional indices were recorded: hPL, estriol, hematocrit, platelets, mean platelet volume, and uric acid. No abnormalities {{were found in}} the uterine, umbilical, middle cerebral, thoracic descending aorta, and renal artery velocimetry in post-dates gestations. However, a significant reduction of the time-averaged mean velocity in the descending thoracic aorta was associated with an increased incidence of oligohydramnios, meconium-stained fluid, abnormal NST, and cesarean delivery for fetal distress. The present study suggests that serial Doppler flow measurements of mean velocity of the fetal descending thoracic aorta may be a simple and rapid technique for identifying prolonged pregnancies at increased risk for perinatal complications...|$|E
40|$|Prenatal {{diagnosis}} of inborn errors of metabolism has been possible {{only if the}} enzyme affected is expressed in amniotic fluid cells grown in culture. Arginase is essentially undetectable in normal human fibroblasts, amniotic fluid, and amniotic fluid cells but is present in high amounts in red blood cells. It is absent in the red blood cells of patients with liver arginase deficiency. The properties of the enzyme in the red cells of healthy children and adults were compared {{to those of the}} enzyme obtained from cord blood red cells of 13 [...] 20 -week fetuses obtained at hysterotomy. The activities, heavy metal requirements, heat stability, pH optimum, kinetic properties, and reaction with anti-arginase antibody were examined. Both enzyme species were either identical or substantially similar by all criteria. The adult and fetal enzymes are, therefore, probably determined by the same structural gene. Fetal red cells obtained during amniocentesis and <b>amnioscopy</b> should then be a suitable tissue to use to make the prenatal {{diagnosis of}} arginase deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Prenatal {{interventions}} {{may prevent}} some sequelae of congenital anomalies, yet open fetal surgery {{is limited by}} pre-term labor. We are developing amnioscopic strategies to reduce risks for in utero surgery. Methods: Seven fetal sheep were accessed percutaneously under ultrasound guidance, via maternal laparoscopy/transuterine trocars, or via laparoscopically assisted partial uterine exteriorization (mini-hysterotomy). Three fetal immobilization methods were investigated: 2 mm grasping forceps, 2 - 0 absorbable Roeder loop lasso, and detachable metal T-fasteners. Results: Percutaneous access with 2 mm trocars required accessible amniotic fluid pockets. The laparoscopically assisted method enabled 5 mm trocar placement under direct fetal visualization. Mini-hysterotomy avoided trocars and was leak-proof. 2 mm graspers enabled fetal manipulation with repeatable applications. Roeder loop sutures were not readily repositioned, and required two 3 mm or larger trocars. T-fasteners were easily deployed into fetal skin via the self-contained needle applicator with minimal hemorrhage. Cutaneous marks were present immediately from the grasper and T-fastener, but not at postoperative day 10. The Roeder loop produced no observable effects. All devices demonstrated adequate intrauterine performance. Conclusions: Minimally invasive fetal surgery promises to lower maternal-fetal risks. All strategies permitted prolonged <b>amnioscopy</b> and fetal manipulation. The 2 mm grasper was easiest to use, producing no observable lasting trauma...|$|E
40|$|Tensions between East and West {{during the}} so called Cold War era {{concentrated}} among others on the divided city of Berlin. The contest between East- and West-Germany for the lowest infant mortality rates catalysed the development of improved perinatal care in both parts of Berlin. In East Berlin care for mothers and newborns was concentrated in centralized institutions with departments of obstetrics and neonatology often residing wall to wall in the same building. West Berlin initially struggled with structural problems related to the newly founded Freie Universität Berlin. Until the mid- 1970 s, East Berlin was more successful in terms of reducing infant mortality rates which was likely due to more efficiently organized perinatal care. Things changed over time when the former GDR could {{not keep up with}} technical developments which led to lower infant mortality in West Berlin. Several important methods in the field of perinatal medicine were developed or significantly influenced by research groups in Berlin. Especially discoveries made in the district hospital of Neukölln need to be emphasized. Among others intranatal micro-blood sampling for the assessment of foetal wellbeing during labour was developed there, a method which is considered the advent of perinatal medicine by several authors. In addition <b>amnioscopy</b> was developed in Neukölln, a method which helped to reduce perinatal mortality in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Further discoveries respectively contributions to the field which were made in Berlin include, {{but are not limited to}} the area of Rh incompatibility and obstetric sonography...|$|E
