5|$|Although <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> {{and hence}} {{visible to the}} Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any ancient constellations. The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{tears of}} the Eye of Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the morning star, the Eye can also be equated with the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, {{at the start of the}} Egyptian year, Sothis' heliacal rising, in which the star rose <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, the Eye of Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Vega {{can often}} be seen near the zenith in the mid-{{northern}} latitudes during the evening in the Northern Hemisphere summer. From mid-southern latitudes, {{it can be seen}} low above the northern horizon during the Southern Hemisphere winter. With a declination of +38.78°, Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of 51°S. Therefore, it does not rise at all anywhere in Antarctica or in the southernmost part of South America, including Punta Arenas, Chile (53°S). At latitudes to the north of +51°N, Vega remains continually <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> as a circumpolar star. Around July 1, Vega reaches midnight culmination when it crosses the meridian at that time.|$|E
5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. To see it after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable to see it. Even in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E

5|$|The Červená hora {{image was}} {{especially}} valuable. It recorded the fireball's trajectory over approximately 110°, starting 51° <b>above</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>horizon,</b> passing <b>the</b> zenith just 1° westward and disappearing only 19° <b>above</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>horizon</b> (thus crossing about 60% of the sky). Its camera was also {{equipped with a}} rotating shutter that interrupted the exposure 12.5 times per second and divided the captured track of the fireball, allowing the determination of its speed. Over the last 4°, the fireball's angular velocity was lower than {{the resolution of the}} instrument. The Svratouch image recorded the trajectory only for about 15°, beginning at 30° <b>above</b> <b>the</b> northwest <b>horizon,</b> and <b>the</b> pictured fireball was quite weak. Despite this, the data were sufficient for the calculations.|$|R

5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
5|$|The festival {{takes place}} in late May or early June, to {{coincide}} with the full moon. It falls one week before the Christian feast of Corpus Christi. Events include several processions of holy icons and dances in and around the shrine of the Lord of Quyllurit'i. The culminating event for the indigenous non-Christian population takes place after the reappearance of Qullqa in the night sky; it is the rising of the sun after the full moon. Tens of thousands of people kneel to greet the first rays of light as the sun rises <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> The main event for the Church is carried out by ukukus, who climb glaciers over Qullqipunku and bring back crosses and blocks of ice to place along the road to the shrine. These are believed to be medicinal with healing qualities.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{has been}} an object of veneration in many {{cultures}} throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the sky, whose presence <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun {{was thought to be}} a solar deity or other supernatural entity. Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.|$|E

5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E

Due to {{atmospheric}} refraction, these do not occur exactly on the September equinox and the March equinox, respectively: the Sun is <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> for four days longer at each equinox. The place has no solar time; there is no daily maximum or minimum solar height <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> The station uses New Zealand time (UTC+12, UTC+13 during daylight saving time) since all flights to McMurdo station depart from Christchurch and, therefore, all official travel from the pole goes through New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|The sun remains {{below the}} horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but owing to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an {{occasion}} for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight {{for a couple of}} hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February the sun is <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm, and by 1 April it is <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time).|$|E
25|$|Posidonius {{calculated}} the Earth's circumference {{by reference to}} the position of the star Canopus.

Since he thought Rhodes was 5,000 stadia due north of Alexandria, and the difference in the star's elevation indicated the distance between the two locales was 1/48 of the circle, he multiplied 5,000 by 48 to arrive at a figure of 240,000 stadia for the circumference of the earth.|$|E
