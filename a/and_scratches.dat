Initially unaware, he later saw pictures of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family across the building and learned that Al-Nasr was owned by the Gaddafi family. Owumi began playing with Al-Nasr during a three-game losing streak, and his Libyan teammates had bruises <b>and</b> <b>scratches,</b> as they were beaten by security during such slumps.

Unfortunately all her hard working animals are out already and the only free hands (or hooves) available are the two alpacas Nuzzle <b>and</b> <b>Scratch.</b> The Boss knows they aren't any good so is reluctant to send them, but there is usually some misunderstanding over the phone and they end up getting the job. Nuzzle <b>and</b> <b>Scratch</b> mess up <b>and</b> the person rings the Boss to complain. She convinces them to 'give them another chance' <b>and</b> Nuzzle <b>and</b> <b>Scratch</b> normally turn things around and really impress the person who hired them.

40|$|Does {{the spinal}} cord use a single network to {{generate}} locomotor <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> rhythms or two separate networks? Previous research showed that simultaneous swim <b>and</b> <b>scratch</b> stimulation (“dual stimulation”) in immobilized, spinal turtles evokes a single rhythm in hindlimb motor nerves with a frequency often greater than during swim stimulation alone or scratch stimulation alone. This suggests that the signals that trigger swimming <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> converge <b>and</b> are integrated within {{the spinal cord}}. However, these results could not determine whether the integration occurs in motoneurons themselves or earlier, in spinal interneurons. Here, we recorded intracellularly from hindlimb motoneurons during dual stimulation. Motoneuron membrane potentials displayed regular oscillations at a higher frequency during dual stimulation than during swim or scratch stimulation alone. In contrast, arithmetic addition of the oscillations during swimming alone <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> alone with various delays always generated irregular oscillations. Also, the standard deviation of the phase-normalized membrane potential during dual stimulation was similar to those during swimming or scratching alone. In contrast, the standard deviation was greater when pooling cycles of swimming alone <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> alone {{for two of the}} three forms of scratching. This shows that dual stimulation generates a single rhythm prior to motoneurons. Thus, either swimming <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> largely share a rhythm generator or the two rhythms are integrated into one rhythm by strong interactions among interneurons...|$|R

25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} rabies from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E
25|$|As an {{independent}} competitor, KTVU aired a nightly film showcase, The 8 O'Clock Movie, {{as an alternative}} to network programs that aired during prime time on then-NBC affiliate KRON-TV (channel 4, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), CBS station KPIX (channel 5) and ABC-owned KGO-TV (channel 7). Continuing into its early years as a Fox affiliate, KTVU frequently aired classic movies (around 20 per week) in the 8:00p.m. time slot as well as on Sunday afternoons. Many of the films presented were prints restored by the station's editing department to eliminate color and splicing errors, <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> present within the negatives. It also occasionally aired movies originally assigned an R rating for their theatrical release (such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Walkabout) without editing for strong profanity, nudity or violence, some of which aired during prime time. In 1992, KTVU ran a station-edited version of the 1984 science fiction film Dune, which combined footage from the Alan Smithee television cut with the original theatrical release (thereby restoring all the violence featured in the latter cut, while eliminating some of the objectionable edits that caused director David Lynch to remove his name from the credits of the television print).|$|E
25|$|Among {{the oldest}} archaeological {{examples}} of guns in Europe, {{there are two}} pieces from Sweden, the Loshult gun, and lesser known Morko gun. Possibly Europe's oldest extant firearm, the Loshult gun is a cast-bronze gun {{in the shape of}} a vase discovered in 1861 and named after the Swedish parish where the farmer dug it up. It is generally dated to around the mid 14th century and measures 31cm overall, at a weight of 9 kilograms; the bore at the muzzle is 36mm narrowing down to 31mm on its way to the rear. A replica made by scholars has performed well shooting both arrows and other projectiles such as lead balls, grapeshot, and pieces of flint. The arrows and lead balls proved capable of penetrating late medieval plate armor as well as hitting a stationary target 200 meters away. However scholars believe the gun was primarily used for short range engagements because of the deep ruts <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> in the barrel, which suggests that it carried shrapnel, an inaccurate but deadly projectile. It is now preserved in the Statens Historiska Museet Stockholm, inv.-no. 2891. The Morko gun was found by a fisherman in the Baltic Sea at the coast of Södermansland near Nynäs before 1828 and dates to around the same period as the Loshult gun, ca. 1390. In Germany the oldest gun is the Tannenberg handgonne discovered in 1849 at the bottom of a water well of the 1399 destroyed Tannenberg castle in Hessen. It was found with a lead ball still loaded, and its wooden staff nearby, which started decaying after being exposed to air. The gun was aimed using the wooden staff, which fit into the back socket of the gun. References to gunnis cum telar (guns with handles) were recorded in 1350 and by 1411 it was recorded that John the Good, Duke of Burgundy, had 4000 handguns stored in his armory.|$|E

40|$|Furnished cages for {{laying hens}} {{exist in a}} wide variety of sizes and designs and should be {{equipped}} to allow hens to express some of their behavioural priorities. European Council Directive 1999 / 74 /EC stipulates that litter must be provided for pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> but the type of litter and the pad where litter is delivered are not defined. In the same way, neither the maximum nor the optimum number of birds per cage has been defined. Two successive experiments were carried out to analyse pecking, <b>scratching</b> (PS) <b>and</b> dustbathing (DB) behaviours performed in different furnished cages with different designs. Three group sizes of ISA brown laying hens (20, 40 or 60 hens, with the same density in all the cages), with or without additional feed distribution as litter substrate, were compared in the first experiment. The second experiment focussed on DB behaviour and compared two pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> pads (artificial turf or rubber mats), with or without wheat bran distribution as litter substrate, in groups of 60 hens per cage. Irrespective of litter presence, group size, and type of pad, DB and PS were mainly performed in the pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area, showing the attractiveness of this area. In the first experiment, feed–litter provision in pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area increased PS and DB behaviours, while group size did not affect them. In the second experiment, hens performed more DB in the pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area when wheat-bran litter was present than when it was absent. Rubber matting was more attractive to hens for DB than artificial turf matting. Durations of DB bouts were not affected by the presence or absence of wheat-bran litter or the choice of pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> pad. In furnished cages, hens clearly seek out pads and litter to perform PS, and providing litter (feed or wheat bran) or rubber in pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area is attractive for hens to DB in it. However, the cage design could be improved to promote more DB activity, for instance by increasing space of pecking <b>and</b> <b>scratching</b> area in the cage...|$|R
