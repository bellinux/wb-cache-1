5|$|Snow is an {{important}} consideration for loads on structures. To <b>address</b> <b>these,</b> European countries employ Eurocode 1: Actions on structures - Part 1-3: General actions - Snow loads.

Both standards employ method that translate maximum expected ground snow loads onto design loads for roofs.|$|E

5|$|To <b>address</b> <b>these</b> issues, the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) {{eliminated}} Puerto Rico {{from the}} national Food Stamp program and created the Nutrition Assistance Program for Puerto Rico as a block grant to provide more administrative flexibility to the Commonwealth while reducing Federal expenditures.

5|$|A {{development}} {{in recent years}} that seeks to <b>address</b> <b>these</b> issues has been termed evidence-based medicine.

Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.|$|E
5|$|Following release, {{there were}} several {{complaints}} about the game crashing, having a vague user interface, and lacking any save system. In response to these complaints, Svensson noted that a patch was being discussed with the development team to <b>address</b> <b>these</b> issues in a future update. An updated version was released on January 28, 2013 under the name, Street Fighter X Mega Man V2. The update boasts an improved user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes, a password save system reminiscent of the original Mega Man games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and an additional boss character.|$|E

5|$|In 1872, {{some time}} after they {{had taken over the}} Sikhs' territory, the British {{developed}} the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor, and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine was over difficult, rocky terrain. To <b>address</b> <b>these</b> problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to <b>address</b> <b>these</b> issues.|$|E

5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism development strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to <b>address</b> <b>these</b> issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|Solar One {{operated}} successfully from 1982 to 1988, {{proving that}} solar power towers work efficiently to produce utility-scale power from sunlight. The Solar One plant used water/steam as the heat-transfer fluid in the receiver; this presented several problems {{in terms of}} storage and continuous turbine operation. To <b>address</b> <b>these</b> problems, Solar One was upgraded to Solar Two, which operated from 1996 to 1999. Both systems had a 10 MW power capacity.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Brazil, PedroII was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss {{of respect for the}} Catholic Church. The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to <b>address</b> <b>these</b> deficiencies. As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.|$|E

5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP <b>address.</b> <b>These</b> messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly <b>address</b> <b>these</b> forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
