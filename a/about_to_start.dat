5|$|Having {{been turned}} down by several {{professional}} clubs, including Newcastle United, Sunderland, Derby County and Southport, Bruce was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> work as an apprentice plumber at the Swan Hunter dockyard when he was offered a trial by Third Division club Gillingham, whose manager Gerry Summers had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament. He travelled down to Kent with another player from the Wallsend club, Peter Beardsley, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away. At the time Bruce was playing as a midfielder, but he was switched to the centre of defence {{by the head of}} Gillingham's youth scheme, Bill Collins, whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} spend another five weeks in Europe, and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|The band of robbers, now at home, are <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> {{splitting}} their {{stolen goods}} equally, {{when the police}} barge in. While three of the robbers are subdued after a fight, one manages to make his escape via a window and ends up on the roof. The two policeman chase the criminal, who eludes them by jumping from rooftop to rooftop. After the robber jumps down to the street, he runs toward the railroad station and boards a departing train. The police officers arrive but are too late, as the robber has left. The officers tell the train dispatcher to send a telegram to the next station, informing them of the fugitive and asking them to catch {{him as soon as}} possible. When the train reaches the next station, the burglar exits the train and unknowingly runs right into the path of policemen. With all four of the robbers caught, they are sentenced to forty years in jail. While doing work in the jail's quarry, the group review their failure, with each robber pinning the blame on another.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fourth}} over, Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump. Before lunch, Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1/7, while Bill Johnston {{accompanied}} {{him from the}} other end because Keith Miller had a back injury and was only able to bat. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Bill Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After the lunch break, Hutton fell, and Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a bouncer. Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Bill Edrich—who was playing across the line of the ball—for five. Tom Dollery was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall’s next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck. Dollery's bat was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> its downward swing by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said that Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell of 2/11 by Lindwall; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control, but the home side were given some respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels.|$|E
5|$|Saeed captained Iraq {{through the}} 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 1985, playing 8 matches and scoring 8 goals {{including}} four against Lebanon in two 6–0 wins for Iraq, a winning goal against Jordan in Iraq's 3–2 win, which was Saeed's 100th appearance with the senior national team. Iraq {{finished in the}} top of the Group 1B table at 6 points in the first round, getting qualified to the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC Second Round. Saeed scored two goals in Iraq's 3–2 away win over the UAE. They lost 2–1 in their home match which qualified them to the final round on away goals. Saeed also scored in Iraq's victorious match against Syria in Taif in which Iraq won 3–1 getting qualified for the first time of their history to the FIFA World Cup after ending their away match in a 0–0 draw. When the 1986 FIFA World Cup was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>start,</b> there were some speculations about Saeed not being in Iraq's squad, due to his injury, but he joined the team in the last moments. On 4 June, Saeed played in Iraq's first match against Paraguay, where they were defeated by a single goal. After the match, Iraq's head coach, Evaristo de Macedo, discontinued Saeed from the squad, due to his former injury, and sent him back to Baghdad. Iraq lost their two other matches against Belgium and Mexico, getting knocked out from the group stage of the cup. Since then, Iraq was not able to qualify to the World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Washbrook {{had been}} criticised after the First Test for playing aggressively and taking too many risks {{early in his}} innings, having fallen twice to attacking shots. He {{continued}} {{to play in a}} similar way, rather than adopting the traditional opener's strategy of not playing at any ball unless it was going to hit the stumps and waiting for the bowlers to tire. Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over, playing at a ball outside off stump, and ended his pre-lunch spell with 1/7 from six overs, while Johnston accompanied him from the other end. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After lunch, Hutton did the majority of the scoring, before playing outside a Johnson off break on the front foot and being bowled for 20 to leave England at 32/2. The English opener had been uncertain against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the last Test while trying to avoid a bouncer, and Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrichwho was playing across the linewith an outswinger for five. Edrich had toiled for 70 minutes in scoring those runs. Dollery came out and played the first ball with his pads before being bowled for a duck from the next delivery. Dollery's bat was still <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> its downward swing towards by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell by Lindwall that yielded 2/11 as the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his extreme pace. England were 46/4 and Australia firmly in control.|$|E
