5|$|Andy {{rushes to}} the {{potential}} client, a company called Prestige Direct, and impresses the CEO (Dan Castellaneta) with his dedication—in addition to his personal phone number, he also gives him {{a copy of his}} house key. Meanwhile, Dwight, Jim, and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win the client, only to hear that the company has gone with Andy. After Andy wins the client, he calls Robert and offers him the client if Robert will re-hire him. Robert is furious at his attempt to blackmail him, and hangs up on Andy. This leads Andy to seek help from David Wallace (Andy Buckley), the former Chief Financial Officer of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi-millionaire. Andy tells David that, despite being in poor shape, Dunder Mifflin could be worth twice its net worth if the company's management is restructured. This piques David's interest, who allows Andy to come into his home <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about his business proposal.|$|E

25|$|The video {{begins by}} showing Yamaguchi fishing at dawn on a bridge in a {{suburban}} area, while he lip-synchs to the song. He is met by a middle-aged man (played by actor Yuya Matsuura), who tries to offer him an orange <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> A fish then bites on Yamaguchi's line, and the pair are excited. During the second sequence, the footage of the first scene is shown sped-up and reversed. Mori intended for the reversed scenes of Yamaguchi singing the song to create a feeling of uneasiness. The video continues to reverse, showing footage of Yamaguchi walking towards the bridge to fish, ending in a scene where his mouth synchs up with the song's lyrics, despite the footage being in reverse. The third sequence shows Yamaguchi capturing the fish, and ends with him triumphantly holding up the Asian carp he had just caught.|$|E

[...] He also stated JD was next on his list to call regarding a major recording contract he was negotiating for the band. In an interview with Confidential on 1 March 2009, Murphy stated [...] "The whole thing has been bizarre – he was basically a contractor and his contract had ended."

[...] "If the band said to me tomorrow, 'We'd still like you to make that call <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about working on a project,' I'd have to say 'Sorry, I have to go.'"
