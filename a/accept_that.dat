5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E

Through Periyar's movement Temple Entry Acts of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.|$|E

His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E

Most sources <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details.

5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. This is perhaps largely because scholars and officials could not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> artisans performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by {{a small minority of}} Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers and farmers, and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self-sufficient villages and without commercial interests.|$|E
