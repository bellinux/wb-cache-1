In this work, malic, citric, succinic, pyruvic, acetic and lactic acids are separated using a sodium hydrogen phosphate background electrolyte with direct detection mode with a diode array detector. The separation exhibits lower sensitivity than equivalent methods with indirect detection mode, however, the risk of co-migration with unknown compounds in beer matrixes is significantly reduced. This is due to (i) a higher efficiency (250, 000 – 400, 000 theoretical plates), (ii) a higher selectivity than any equivalent method using an indirect detection mode, and (iii) the possibility to monitor other wavelengths in parallel (260 nm for example) to check for possible co-migration with phenolic or benzoic acids.

40|$|This work {{represents}} {{a survey of}} the occurrence of hydroxycinnamic acids and volatile phenols in a variety of beer styles. The contribution of 4 -vinylguaiacol to the overall flavour perception of top-fermented specialty beers was shown. Significant differences in hydroxycinnamic acids (both free and ester-bound) and volatile phenol content between different beers were observed. The variability in volatile phenol content between different beers and beer styles {{can be explained by the}} high incidence of Pad 1 (+) phenotype and the variability of Pad 1 activity observed among top-fermenting brewing yeast strains. The relative importance of thermal versus enzymatic decarboxylation can account for the differences found between bottom and top-fermented beers. Concerning the optimisation of volatile phenol levels in beer, the selection of a suitable brewing yeast strain is the most important means of creating a phenolic taste profile in beer. Given that a considerable amount of hydroxycinnamic <b>acids</b> in <b>beer</b> still occurs in ester-bound form, enhancing the enzymatic release of these phenolic flavour precursors during mashing can greatly enhance the phenolic aroma potential of wort.

It was found that binding of aldehydes increased with increasing pH, especially for binding to cysteine. Furthermore, a sample preparation approach was developed to release aldehydes from their bound-state. After binding between aldehydes and cysteine, the strong base 4 -vinylpyridine (4 VP) was added to the samples as a competitor of the aldehydes toward cysteine binding, and subsequent release of aldehydes was clearly observed. The same approach also resulted in a release of aldehydes from preformed bisulfite adducts. Sample treatment with 4 VP was also applied to fresh pale lager beer, resulting in increased levels of free beer-aging aldehydes.

40|$|Abstract Iron has an {{important}} role on the prevention of anemia, which is {{an important}} public health problem. Results from studies, conducted in humans and animals, have shown that iron ions (Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +) have cariostatic properties. Alone or {{in combination with other}} ions, like fluoride and copper, iron has a great effect on the reduction of the cariogenic potential of the sugar. The iron content of beer should be as low as possible. Under normal conditions, the iron content of fermented beer is below 0. 2 ppm. If it is higher in the finished beer, a pickup of iron after fermentation is indicated. Iron is said to enter more readily in solution in a beer highly saturated with CO 2 gas. Highly oxidized beers also dissolve more iron. High amount of iron can contribute to color increase due to an interaction with wort and/or beer tannins and hop constituents. The aim of this work was the implementation and optimizations of some UV-VIS molecular absorption spectrometric methods for determination of total iron from commercial beer samples; the results were compared with those obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) using a spectrometer Shimadzu AA 6200.

Abstract: Background: Emerging evidence suggests that by affecting mineral balance, aluminum (Al) may enhance some events associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Aim: To {{examine the effect of}} Al(NO 3) 3 exposure on brain Al, cooper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), silicon (Si), and zinc (Zn) levels, and the metal-change implication in brain oxidant and inflammatory status. Methods: Four groups of six-week-old male NMRI mice were treated for three months: i) controls, administrated with deionized water; ii) Al, which received Al(NO 3) 3; iii) Al+silicic acid, which were given Al(NO 3) 3 plus silicic acid; and iv) Al+beer, which received Al(NO 3) 3 plus beer. Results: Brain Al and TBARS levels and TNFα and GPx expressions increased, while Cu, Mn, and Zn levels, and catalase and CuZn-SOD expression decreased (at least, p <  0. 05) in Al versus control animals. Al, Si, and TBARS levels and TNFα expression decreased (p <  0. 05) in Al+silicic acid and Al+beer specimens while Cu, Mn, and Zn levels and antioxidant expression increased versus the Al group. Brain Al levels correlated negatively with those of Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn, and catalase, CuZn-SOD, and GPx enzyme expressions but positively with Si and TBARS levels and TNFα expression. Two components of the principal component analysis (PCA) explained 71. 2 % of total data variance (p <  0. 001).

The recent large increase in publications applying electroanalytical techniques to environmental, pharmaceutical and clinical applications is discussed in Chapter 1, including a discussion of electrode materials and their applications, the use of modified electrodes to improve selectivity and reduce electrode passivation, in addition to an overview of the use of electrochemical detection in flowing solution analysis. Chapter 2 describes the use of polarography at a dropping mercury electrode to investigate the cure chemistry o f anaerobic adhesives. The influence of transition metal ions, in the presence of accelerators, on the catalytic decomposition of the free radical initiators /-Butyl perbenzoate, /-Butyl hydroperoxide and benzoyl peroxide is discussed. The determination of clenbuterol in bovine urine is discussed in Chapter 3. The electrochemical characteristics of the | 3 -agonist were investigated at a bare carbon paste electrode. The application of a thin Nafion film to the electrode surface permitted accumulation o f clenbuterol onto the electrode surface {{while at the same time}} selectively excluding anionic interferences present in the urine sample. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to detect low levels of clenbuterol in urine. Amperometric and voltammetric detection coupled to capillary electrophoresis, applied to the determination of anionic phenolic <b>acids</b> in <b>beer</b> and wine, is outlined in Chapter 4.

40|$|The {{shelf-life}} of a packaged beer {{is determined}} by its ability to resist detrimental changes to its flavour, aroma and clarity. The most common symptoms of beer deterioration are the development of colloidal (non-biological) haze, formation of offflavours, precipitation of sediment, and, in extreme cases, the growth of spoilage organisms. The susceptibility of a beer to spoilage by any of these mechanisms may be predicted by measurement of appropriate indicator compounds. The aim of this thesis was to develop new or improved liquid chromatographic methods for the determination of these compounds, using selective detection systems which allowed direct injection of samples following dilution and/or clarification. Where appropriate, these methods were applied {{to the development of}} optimised stabilisation protocols. The area studied in greatest detail was the application of analytical technology to the investigation of beer colloidal stability. Novel methods for the determination of flavanols in beer were developed, and new procedures for the isolation of flavanol standards were described. These methods were then applied to the detailed study of the role of these compounds in beer haze and flavour instability. The stabilisation process was also studied in detail, and optimised stabilisation protocols were recommended. Volatile phenolics in beer were also studied. Novel methods for the determination of phenolic-off-flavour (POF) causing compounds were developed, and were applied to the optimisation of brewing regimes {{as well as to the}} classification of POF-producing yeasts. Oxalate may cause hazes and sediments in beers. A method was therefore developed for the determination of soluble and insoluble oxalate in beer and beer sediments, and the factors leading to the formation of such sediments were examined with a view to recommending procedures which could prevent the incidence of oxalate complaints in beer. Novel analytical methods using electrochemical detection were also developed for the determination of carbohydrates in beers, worts and non-alcoholic beverages, and for the determination of ascorbic <b>acid</b> in <b>beer</b> and malt beverages. These methods were then applied to the assessment of beer quality in general...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to simulate the}} drinking habits of gout patients. Beer or squash was drunk over a 4 -hour period on two successive days by five gouty and five normouricaemic men. Serum lactate increased with beer and squash, but elevation of plasma uric acid was confined to beer drinking. Urate clearance increased with both beverages, but 24 -hour uric acid excretion was accentuated only by beer. The purine content of several beers was measured and the principal constituent found to be guanosine, which {{is probably the most}} readily absorbed dietary purine. It was concluded that the hyperuricaemic effect of beer was mediated by the digestion of purines contained by the beer and by an effect of ethanol on uric acid synthesis. There was no evidence that beer taken in usual quantities reduced the renal excretion of uric <b>acid.</b> KEY WORDS: <b>Beer,</b> Alcohol, Purines, Uric acid. THE long-cherished notion that habitual alcohol consumption is associated with hyperuricaemia (1) has been confirmed (2, 3). This relationship has been apparent in our own previous studies (4 - 6). Alcohol is thought to cause hyperuricaemia by reducing uric acid excretion. Lieber et al. (7) demonstrated a rise of serum urate, a 20 - 50 % reduction o...|$|R
40|$|Separation of cis-iso-α-acids from trans-iso-α-acids, {{starting}} from the commercial isomerised hop extract, was successfully carried out by complex formation of the trans-iso-α-acids with β-cyclodextrin. The separation was performed on laboratory scale permitting the quantitative dosage of cis-iso-α-acids resp. trans-iso-α-acids to 50 L of fermented beer, addition rate 25 mg/L. The methodology consists of two successive complex formation steps with a saturated solution of β-CD in water. The precipitate from the first complex formation step is enriched in trans-isomers, which can be recovered from the β-CD inclusion complexes. The collected first supernatant is already enriched in cis-isomers, {{but in order to}} obtain a higher enrichment in cis-isomers in this fraction, it was incubated again with β-CD for a second complex formation step. The cis-isomers were then isolated from the second supernatant by solid phase extraction. The final cis- and trans-isomers fractions were highly enriched in respectively cis-iso-α-acids (98 %) and trans-iso-α-acids (90 %), as opposed to common isomerised hop extracts with a typical ratio of 70 % cis-iso-α-acids and 30 % trans-iso-α-acids. The established methodology for the isolation of cis-iso-α-acids and trans-iso-α-acids from a commercial isomerised hop extract allows highly advanced beer bittering on pilot scale and represents an innovative tool to further investigate both the cis- and trans-specific bitter <b>acids</b> degradation in <b>beer</b> in relation to flavor stability. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A taste sensor {{that uses}} lipid/polymer {{membranes}} can evaluate aftertastes felt by humans using Change in membrane Potential caused by Adsorption (CPA) measurements. The sensor membrane for evaluating bitterness, {{which is caused}} by acidic bitter substances such as iso-alpha <b>acid</b> contained in <b>beer,</b> needs an immersion process in monosodium glutamate (MSG) solution, called “MSG preconditioning”. However, {{what happens to the}} lipid/polymer membrane during MSG preconditioning is not clear. Therefore, we carried out three experiments to investigate the changes in the lipid/polymer membrane caused by the MSG preconditioning, i. e., measurements of the taste sensor, measurements of the amount of the bitterness substance adsorbed onto the membrane and measurements of the contact angle of the membrane surface. The CPA values increased as the preconditioning process progressed, and became stable after 3 d of preconditioning. The response potentials to the reference solution showed the same tendency of the CPA value change during the preconditioning period. The contact angle of the lipid/polymer membrane surface decreased after 7 d of MSG preconditioning; in short, the surface of the lipid/polymer membrane became hydrophilic during MSG preconditioning. The amount of adsorbed iso-alpha acid was increased until 5 d preconditioning, and then it decreased. In this study, we revealed that the CPA values increased with the progress of MSG preconditioning in spite of the decrease of the amount of iso-alpha acid adsorbed onto the lipid/polymer membrane, and it was indicated that the CPA values increase because the sensor sensitivity was improved by the MSG preconditioning...|$|R
40|$|Pediococcus damnosus can coflocculate with Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{and cause}} beer {{acidification}} {{that may or}} may not be desired. Similar coflocculations occur with other yeasts except for Schizosaccharomyces pombe which has galactose-rich cell walls. We compared coflocculation rates of S. pombe wild-type species TP 4 - 1 D, having a mannose-to-galactose ratio (Man:Gal) of 5 to 6 in the cell wall, with its glycosylation mutants gms 1 - 1 (Man:Gal = 5 : 1) and gms 1 Delta (Man:Gal = 1 : 0). These mutants coflocculated at a much higher level (30 to 45 %) than that of the wild type (5 %). Coflocculation of the mutants was inhibited by exogenous mannose but not by galactose. The S. cerevisiae mnn 2 mutant, with a mannan content similar to that of gms 1 Delta, also showed high coflocculation (35 %) and was sensitive to mannose inhibition. Coflocculation of P. damnosus and gms 1 Delta (or mnn 2) also could be inhibited by gms 1 Delta mannan (with unbranched alpha- 1, 6 -linked mannose residues), concanavalin A (mannose and glucose specific), or NPA lectin (specific for alpha- 1, 6 -linked mannosyl units). Protease treatment of the bacterial cells completely abolished coflocculation. From these results we conclude that mannose residues on the cell surface of S. pombe serve as receptors for a P. damnosus lectin but that these receptors are shielded by galactose residues in wild-type strains. Such interactions are important in the production of Belgian <b>acid</b> types of <b>beers</b> in which mixed cultures are used to improve flavor. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Growth of {{specific}} lactic <b>acid</b> bacteria in <b>beer</b> leads to spoiled product and economic {{loss for the}} brewing industry. Microbial growth is typically inhibited by the combined stresses found in beer (e. g., ethanol, hops, low pH, minimal nutrients); however, certain bacteria have adapted to grow in this harsh environment. Considering {{little is known about}} the mechanisms used by bacteria to grow in and spoil beer, transcriptome sequencing was performed on a variant of the beer-spoilage organism Pediococcus claussenii ATCC BAA- 344 (T) (Pc 344 - 358). Illumina sequencing was used to compare the transcript levels in Pc 344 - 358 growing mid-exponentially in beer to those in nutrient-rich MRS broth. Various operons demonstrated high gene expression in beer, several of which are involved in nutrient acquisition and overcoming the inhibitory effects of hop compounds. As well, genes functioning in cell membrane modification and biosynthesis demonstrated significantly higher transcript levels in Pc 344 - 358 growing in beer. Three plasmids had the majority of their genes showing increased transcript levels in beer, whereas the two cryptic plasmids showed slightly decreased gene expression. Follow-up analysis of plasmid copy number in both growth environments revealed similar trends, where more copies of the three non-cryptic plasmids were found in Pc 344 - 358 growing in beer. Transcriptome sequencing also enabled the addition of several genes to the P. claussenii ATCC BAA- 344 (T) genome annotation, some of which are putatively transcribed as non-coding RNAs. The sequencing results not only provide the first transcriptome description of a beer-spoilage organism while growing in beer, but they also highlight several targets for future exploration, including genes that may have a role in the general stress response of lactic acid bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Elevated {{circulating}} total homocyst(e) ine concentrations {{are associated}} with a higher prevalence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). We utilized data from the Caerphilly Prospective Cohort Study to assess the predictive power of the serum total homocyst(e) ine concentration for future IHD. Serum total homocyst(e) ine concentrations were measured in 2290 men in the Caerphilly cohort, a representative population sample of men aged 50 – 64 years. During a 5 -year follow-up period, 56 men suffered fatal IHD, 77 had a non-fatal myocardial infarction, while 21 were found to have ECG evidence of myocardial infarction (MI) when examined at follow-up. The mean serum total homocyst(e) ine concentration in the total of 154 men who experienced an incident IHD event was 12. 4 μmol/l, whereas the 2136 men who experienced no such event had a mean level of 11. 7 μmol/l. The difference between these means, examined by logistic regression and standardising for the effects of differences in age, social class, smoking, BMI, diabetes, HDL-cholesterol and prevalent IHD is 0. 47 μmol/l (95 % CI=− 0. 13 to 1. 11 μmol/l). The mean difference for the 56 men who died, and whose death was attributed to IHD, is 0. 81 μmol/l (95 % CI=− 0. 17 to 1. 88 μmol/l) after correction for confounding factors. Vitamin nutritional status and alcohol intake were significant negative determinants of serum total homocyst(e) ine concentrations; the effect of alcohol is explained by the folic <b>acid</b> content of <b>beer,</b> which is the preferred alcoholic beverage in Caerphilly. It is concluded that the serum total homocyst(e) ine concentration is weakly predictive of IHD events, though in the present data adjustments for other factors attenuated the relationship and it became not statistically significant (P> 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 6, 2016 - June 6, 2017 When hops are added to beer, varying degrees of hoppy aroma persist in the finished beer {{as a result of}} a number of factors. Dry-hopping is a technique whereby hops are added to beer post-fermentation to leverage the maximum aroma potential of the hop essential oils while minimizing bitterness contribution from the hop alpha acids. Brewers are very interested in understanding dry-hopping as this practice is widely used throughout the industry. The studies herein investigate both the dry-hop process as a vehicle to dose flavor and aroma into beer and hop/processing factors that contribute to this operation. Hop oil serves as the primary reservoir of aromatic compounds in the hop plant and it is hypothesized that using hops with greater total oil content will result in more hoppy aroma in dry-hopped beers. An unhopped beer was dry-hopped with 23 individual Cascade hop lots and was evaluated using sensory descriptive analysis. There was no correlation between total oil content (ml oil/ 100 g hops) and overall hop aroma intensity (OHAI). Therefore, the specific volume of hop oil in hops is an inadequate indicator of hoppiness potential in dry-hopped beer. Cascade, Chinook, and Centennial hops are some of the most popular American hops used by brewers across the globe. Because of their high use, there exists a need to understand how the hop-derived, analytical profile of these cultivars in the beer system can be used to enhance quality assurance strategies. An in-depth flavor analysis approach utilizing Solvent-Assisted Flavor Evaporation (SAFE) and Aroma Extract Dilution Analysis (AEDA) was carried out to understand which compounds contribute the most to the character of these hops in the dry-hopped system. The analysis revealed Cascade, Chinook, and Centennial had 9, 10, and 11 character impact compounds (CIC). Commonalities were observed among the three cultivars regarding 2 -furanmethanol, linalool, geraniol, cis-geranic acid methyl ester, and n-decanoic <b>acid</b> in <b>beer.</b> Variation between the Centennial and Chinook cultivars is a function of only a few character impact compounds whereas Cascade is markedly different, anchored heavily by benzenacetaldeyde. This knowledge could help introduce potential replacements, removals, and/or reductions for these hop cultivars in the future. When stored under pro-oxidative conditions, qualitative changes in the chemical and aroma profile of Hallertauer Mittelfrüh (HHA) hops occurs. It was hypothesized that lager beer dry-hopped with oxidized HHA would impact both the qualitative attributes related hop aroma in the finished beer and influence consumer acceptance. Lager beer was dry-hopped using oxidized hops and a non-oxidized control at two different hopping rates (3. 8 g/L, 1. 5 g/L). Trained panelists using descriptive analysis evaluated the beer dry-hopped at 3. 8 g/L. At this dosing rate, significant qualitative changes were observed in the beer as a result of using oxidized hops. The beers dry-hopped with the oxidized hops had significantly higher sensory ratings for woody and herbal attributes, which are associated with “noble” hop aroma. 60 consumers rated their acceptance of the beers dry-hopped at a lower rate of 1. 5 g/L and no significant difference in overall liking was found between the hop preparations. While changes in hop chemistry occur as a result of oxidation, these changes may not adversely affect overall liking of beer prepared with oxidized hops but may serve as a way to enhance "noble" hop aroma in lager beer. Dry-hopping can be used as a method to assess the aroma potential of a hop cultivar, for instance as a tool used during the late stages of the hop breeding process or as a way to determine beer performance of a prospective hop cultivar when evaluating hops pre-purchase. These evaluations, though quick, are commonly prone to high variation. From a hop perspective, more effective sampling and preparation techniques were implemented to reduce within lot variation and increase homogeneity. From a processing perspective, increased volumes of liquid, duplicate dry-hopping events, blending and filtration methodology, as well as oxygen control have reduced the process derived variation. The Oregon State dry-hopping method has evolved to best display hop material in dry-hopped beer in an accurate and precise manner as well as reveal the variable nature of small-scale hop evaluations...|$|R
