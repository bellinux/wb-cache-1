5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom {{and throughout the}} rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian became a classical language that was usually reserved for reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> hieroglyphs. For the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian remained the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E
5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all {{charges against him}} but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising <b>and</b> <b>writing.</b> <b>In</b> this work {{he noted that the}} rise of industrial capitalism in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E

5|$|Sigeberht {{secured the}} future of the Church in East Anglia when he {{established}} a school in his kingdom so that boys could be taught reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> Latin, on the model that he had witnessed in Gaul. Felix assisted him by obtaining teachers of the kind who taught in Kent. According to the Life of Gregory the Great, Paulinus of York, who from 633 to 644 was the Bishop of Rochester in northern Kent, had been connected with Rædwald's court during the exile of Edwin.|$|E
5|$|Yelü Bei was {{twenty-six years}} old at the time of his father's death. A polymath, Bei {{exemplified}} many of the values of the Chinese aristocracy; he was an expert in music, medicine, fortune-telling, painting, <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> (<b>in</b> both Chinese and Khitan). He was also an accomplished warrior, leading troops into battle during his father's conquest of Balhae. After the campaign ended in victory for the Liao in 926, Emperor Taizu gave Bei command of the conquered territory––which became known as the principality of Dongdan––as well as the title of Prince of Dongdan.|$|E
5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E

25|$|In 1930 (1309 AH), {{after months}} of {{cultural}} stagnation, a group of writers founded the Herat Literary Circle.

Both, especially the Kabul publication, had little success in becoming venues for modern Persian poetry <b>and</b> <b>writing.</b> <b>In</b> time, the Kabul publication turned into a stronghold for traditional writers and poets, and modernism in Dari literature was pushed to the fringes {{of social and cultural}} life.|$|E
