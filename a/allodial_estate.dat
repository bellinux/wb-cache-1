5000|$|Otto II of Bilstein was {{the last}} male {{member of the family}} line. In 1301 he sold the Bilstein fief and, subsequently, also his <b>allodial</b> <b>estate</b> to Landgrave Henry I of Hesse and died in 1306.|$|E
5000|$|The hill castle {{stands at}} a height of [...] {{and may have been}} built around 1486 by Conz of Hirschaid. It was {{probably}} originally an <b>allodial</b> <b>estate</b> of the Lords of Hirschaid. Later, feudal sovereignty passed to the Bishopric of Bamberg.|$|E
50|$|In 1301, Count Otto II of Bilstein, {{with the}} consent of his wife, Catharina, sold the Bilstein fief and {{subsequently}} also his <b>allodial</b> <b>estate</b> to Landgrave Henry I of Hesse. With his death in 1306 the comital line came to an end.|$|E
50|$|In 1125, Agnes' brother, Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, died childless, leaving Agnes and her {{children}} as heirs to the Salian dynasty's immense <b>allodial</b> <b>estates,</b> including Waiblingen.|$|R
50|$|In {{many regions}} only allodiaries were counted as freemen, i.e., those who enjoyed all common, public rights and duties. They served as {{territorial}} assemblymen (Landesgemeinde). The allodiaries {{of the early}} Middle Ages {{are one of the}} groups out of which the nobility sprang over time. They saw themselves as equal partners of the territorial lords, because they participated alongside them as members of the territorial assembly and were not their vassals. The freedoms associated with <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> (tax exemption, hunting rights, etc.) were only exercised by the nobility in most states - even if, after 1500, they had to subordinate themselves increasingly to the territorial princes (as part of the establishment of statehood) - who remained, politically and economically, the most influential group of landowners. The term ‘allod’ only occurs in the Franconian region and those territories influenced legally by Frankish tribes. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, there were no more allods in England at all (though Lundy was later deemed to not be in England) and, in France, <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> existed mainly in the south. In Germany, the <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> were mainly those owned by the nobility in the south. There were many lords who founded their powerful position on extensive <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> in the eastern Alpine countries and the lands of the Bohemian Crown. The king as lord paramount never exercised lordship over the whole Empire.|$|R
50|$|The nobility possessed {{hereditary}} <b>allodial</b> <b>estates,</b> {{which were}} worked by dependent sebri, {{the equivalent of}} Byzantine paroikoi; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree. The nobility was obliged to serve the monarch in war.|$|R
50|$|An <b>allodial</b> <b>estate</b> {{could also}} be created when a lord renounced his rights in favour of his vassal. Deforested land was {{considered}} allodial by the princes. Conversely, free territorial lords were sometimes punished by the Emperor by converting their allodial land into fiefs.|$|E
50|$|The first fortifications were {{probably}} built between 1300 and 1330 by Dietrich von Wildenstein. He sold it in 1360 {{to the emperor}} and Bohemian king, Charles IV, who had the fort upgraded into a border castle {{in order to protect}} his Bohemian <b>allodial</b> <b>estate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} {{areas in the}} present day region of Franconia were, apart from bishoprics and Hohenstaufen <b>allodial</b> <b>estates,</b> the Meranian lands and the counties of Henneberg, Greifenstein, Wiltberg, Rieneck, Wertheim, Castell, Hohenlohe, Truhendingen and Abenberg.|$|R
25|$|The convent's main benefactor, the Brobergen family (also spelt Broc(k)bergen, {{extinct in}} 1745) {{intended}} to make it their proprietary monastery. The , holding <b>allodial</b> <b>estates,</b> tried to establish the nunnery as their power base out of the immediate prince-archiepiscopal reach, an idea also pursued by the Brobergens' kinsman , but failed.|$|R
50|$|This form of {{ownership}} {{meant that the}} landowner owed no feudal duties to any other person. An allod could be inherited freely according to the usual law of the land. To begin with, the income from <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> was not even liable for taxes paid to the territorial princes (Landesfürsten).|$|R
50|$|In the 14th century, {{they not}} only had their own castles in Egloffstein, but also in Stolzenrode, Leienfels, Burggaillenreuth, Neuhaus an der Pegnitz, Lauterbach, Wolfsberg, Wadendorf, Neunkirchen am Brand, Löhlitz and Henfenfeld {{as well as a}} water castle in Kunreuth. The Egloffsteins used their own <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> to found the {{chaplaincy}} in Egloffstein.|$|R
50|$|When the {{imperial}} ban {{was placed on}} Henry the Lion in 1180, he lost his titles as Duke of Saxony and Duke of Bavaria. He went into exile for several years, but was then allowed {{to stay on the}} (<b>allodial)</b> <b>estates</b> inherited from his mother's side until the end of his life.|$|R
5000|$|Dušan's Code (1349) {{named the}} {{administrative}} hierarchy as following: [...] "lands, cities, župas and krajištes", the župas and krajištes were {{one and the}} same, with the župas on the borders were called krajištes (frontier). The župa consisted of villages, and their status, rights and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary <b>allodial</b> <b>estates,</b> which were worked by dependent sebri, the equivalent of Greek paroikoi; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the decline of the kingdom to its {{respective}} <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> {{at the end of the}} 14th century and the general weakness at the time of its count-kings (Grafenkönige), [...] "kingless assemblies" [...] (Königlose Tage) gained increasing importance. At these gatherings, the principal rulers in the empire held counsel. Only rarely were Hoftage now called. From these kingless assemblies emerged the legal institution of the Imperial Diet at the end of the 15th century.|$|R
5000|$|The code {{enumerated}} {{the administrative}} hierarchy as following: [...] "lands, cities, župas and krajištes"; the župas and krajištes were {{one and the}} same, where župas on the borders were called krajištes (frontier). The župa consisted of villages, and their status, rights, and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary <b>allodial</b> <b>estates,</b> which were worked by dependent sebri, the equivalent of Greek paroikoi: peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree. The earlier župan title was abolished and replaced with the Greek-derived kefalija (kephale, [...] "head, master").|$|R
5000|$|In all {{of these}} ways, the allod {{differed}} from fiefs, which were mere tenures held by feudatories (Lehnsmänner) or their vassals (Vasallen). Overall suzerainty in a fief remained with the feudal lord, who could require of his vassals certain services which varied from vassal to vassal. Also, the ownership of a fief was split so that a lord had dominium directum and his tenant in fee had dominium utile (German nutzbares Eigentum). By contrast, an allodiary had a full freehold interest — or dominium plenum (volles Eigentum) — in his allod. This was also reflected in the contemporaneous synonym for an allod, Erbe und Eigen (loosely [...] "inheritance and ownership"). Borough properties were usually allodial in nature. Likewise, ecclesiastical institutions (e.g. abbeys and cathedrals) owned <b>allodial</b> <b>estates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The monarch had wide autocratic powers, but was {{surrounded}} and advised by a permanent council of magnates and prelates. The court, chancellery and administration were rough copies {{of those of}} Constantinople. The Code named the administrative hierarchy as following: [...] "lands, cities, župas and krajištes", the župas and krajištes were one and the same, with the župas on the borders were called krajištes ("frontier march"). The župa consisted of villages, and their status, rights and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary <b>allodial</b> <b>estates,</b> which were worked by dependent sebri, the equivalent of Greek paroikoi; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree. The earlier title of župan was abolished and replaced with the Greek kephale (kefalija, [...] "head, master").|$|R
5000|$|At {{the peace}} of Lunéville in 1801, {{the part of the}} landgraviate on the left bank of the Rhine was {{surrendered}} to France and, in 1815, other parts were ceded to Prussia, the landgrave Victor Amadeus being compensated by the abbey of Corvey and the Silesian Duchy of Ratibor. Victor was the last male member of his family, so, with the consent of Prussia, he bequeathed his <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> to his nephews the princes Victor and Chlodwig of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfurst. When the landgrave died on 12 November 1834 the remaining parts of Hesse-Rotenburg were united with Hesse-Kassel according to the arrangement of 1627. It may be noted that Hesse-Rotenburg was never completely independent of Hesse-Kassel. Perhaps the most famous member of this family was Charles Constantine (1752-1821), a younger son of Landgrave [...] Constantine, {{who took part in the}} French Revolution under the name Citoyen Hesse.|$|R
50|$|Originally the {{territory}} {{belonged to the}} Duchy of Saxony but in 1180, after the imperial ban had been imposed on the Welf prince, Henry the Lion, he lost his ducal lands in Saxony and Bavaria. However, in 1235, Henry's grandson, Otto the Child, was promoted {{to the rank of}} prince {{as a result of the}} reconciliation between the Houses of Hohenstaufen and Welf and was given the <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> of the family claimed by them in the area between Lüneburg and Brunswick as the new and independent Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In the region west of Hanover, the Welfs had but few allodial possessions and so that area was disputed between the House of Welf and the bishops of Hildesheim and Minden. It was largely ruled by comital dynasties, such as the counts of Wölpe in the northwest, the counts of Hallermund in the southwest and the counts of Rhoden in the west and in Hanover.|$|R
5000|$|Zemské desky (Landtafel; in old Czech, always Desky zemské, literal translation, [...] "Land tables") is old Czech {{source of}} law. It is {{predecessor}} of land registry for real <b>estates</b> owned under <b>allodial</b> title (hereditary <b>estates).</b> Also resolutions of Diets, rulings of the Land (supreme) Court and other general legal rules were recorded there.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was built}} around 1200 by the lords of Windeck. The family, {{probably}} of Franconian origin and {{based in the}} Ortenau, owned wealthy <b>allodial</b> <b>estates</b> and held numerous fiefs from various liege lords, such as the empire, the Prince-Bishopric of Straßburg, the counts of Eberstein {{as well as the}} Vogtei of Schwarzach Abbey as an Afterlehen of the burgraves of Nuremberg. The first documentary evidence dates to 1212 when a certain Melchior von Windeck comes to light, and, in 1248, the lords of Windeck are mentioned in a document at Schwarzach Abbey as ministeriales of the Bishop of Straßburg. The castle itself, however, is first mentioned in 1335. It became a jointly-managed castle or Ganerbenburg very early on as a result of divisions of inheritance.In the early 13th century the New Windeck Castle (Burg Neu-Windeck) was built by a branch of the family near Lauf within sight of Old Windeck. During the course of the 13th and 14th centuries, the lords of Windeck came into conflict many times with neighbouring territorial lords, the city of Straßburg and the counts of Württemberg in alliance with the Martinsvögel during the so-called Schlegler Wars, during which the castle was besieged, but never captured and so remained largely undamaged. In the late 14th century, however, it was stricken by a devastating fire. Stables and domestic buildings were razed, and the valuable archives, the basis of numerous legal titles, were destroyed. Reinhard von Windeck had the affected buildings rebuilt.|$|R
5000|$|The {{founder of}} the family was Johan Gyldenär, a Major in a Finnish {{infantry}} regiment in the Swedish army. He came from Sweden but his father, Conrad Guldener, was from either Germany or the Netherlands. [...] Johan was mentioned by the records {{for the first time}} in 1622 when he received Storhoplaks, Mäkkylä and Kilo in the parish of Espoo ( [...] Storhoplaks was then a part of Helsinki rural parish [...] ) in Finland from the Crown. He built the Alberga manor house in the village of Storhoplaks. In 1624, Alberga was created an <b>allodial</b> freehold <b>estate.</b> In 1628 he exchanged Mäkkylä for Träskända village ( [...] now the manor of Järvenperä [...] ) in the same parish. On 16 November 1646 Johan Guldener was ennobled with the name of Gyldenär and introduced in 1650 in the House of Nobility Riddarhuset with the number 388. In 1647, he was a Major in the Viborg ( [...] now Viipuri, Finland [...] ) Infantry Regiment, which was sent to Riga. He was the commander of the Vargskärs fort of Helsingfors ( [...] now Helsinki [...] ) in 1656 and 1658. He retired in 1664 with the rank of Major and the thanks [...] "for his gracious services of many years" [...] for sina hulda och långvariga tjänster. He died around 1685 at the age of 87 years. His wife was Elin Horn af Kankas, the daughter of the Royal Councilor Arvid Horn af Kankas from Finland ( [...] Family No. 12 in Riddarhuset [...] ) and his second wife, Ingeborg Iwarsdotter Stjernkors ( [...] Family No. 39 [...] ). They had three children.|$|R
