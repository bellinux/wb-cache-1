5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who {{continues}} to broadcast his demand on all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling effect on the interspecies conference since {{it is clear that}} not <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> support it. On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of the array.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{views of}} {{conscience}} usually {{see it as}} linked to a morality inherent in <b>all</b> <b>humans,</b> to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience. Common secular or scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably genetically determined, with its subject probably learned or imprinted (like language) {{as part of a}} culture.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in <b>all</b> <b>humans,</b> contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E

5|$|Peter {{suspects}} Connors is the Lizard and unsuccessfully {{confronts the}} creature in the sewers. The Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via {{the name on}} an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school, where they fight. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. The Police corner Spider-Man by taking off his mask and Captain Stacy discovers that Spider-Man is really Peter. The Lizard plans to make <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy requests Peter avoid Gwen, {{in order to keep}} her safe. Peter initially does so, but later at school, suggests to Gwen he may see her after all.|$|E
5|$|Shana formulates a {{countermeasure}} and {{is ultimately}} successful in adding a single law to Xanadu where the Denizens {{are not allowed}} to eat humans anymore. With Xanadu created, the Denizens depart to the new world, soon followed by hundreds of Flame Haze determined to help enforce order on it. Yuji intends to go to Xanadu alone and make sure humans and Denizens can eventually learn to coexist, but Shana refuses to be left behind. In the end, Yuji accepts Shana's feelings and the two kiss, which activates a spell left to Yuji by Crimson Lord Lamia that restores his existence, so Yuji is no longer a Torch. With the help of another spell from Lamia, Yuji successfully restores <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> in Misaki City whose existence was absorbed by the Denizens before he and Shana depart for Xanadu together.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed {{that there would be}} no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.|$|E

5|$|<b>All</b> <b>humans</b> {{have two}} copies of the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's love {{interest}} is Destiny (Canis selfabsorbedb*tchicus), an Afghan hound. However, Destiny {{has no interest}} in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary (Tony Way), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot understand what Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (Felis retardicus), an idiotic cat to whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (Aves aggravaticus), a pigeon who likes to revel in the misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> and foxes for the way they treat birds. Lastly, there is Vince, Nelson's older brother (Vulpus c***itcus), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one swear word that is always bleeped over.|$|E

5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to <b>all</b> <b>humans,</b> and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E
5|$|Two millennia ago, humans {{developed}} spyrix, a {{power source}} which absorbs spirits to supply power. In response, the spirit Maxwell gathered humans, {{who share a}} symbiotic relationship with spirits, onto an isolated land protected by a barrier; the isolated land became known as Rieze Maxia and the outer lands as Elympios. As spirits are needed to sustain nature, Maxwell waits for the day <b>all</b> <b>humans</b> on Elympios die off before dispelling the barrier. Twenty {{years prior to the}} present, an Elympion cruise ship becomes trapped in Rieze Maxia, eventually forming a terrorist group known as Exodus. Exodus works with the Elympios military {{to find a way to}} destroy the barrier. In the present era, Rieze Maxia is ruled by two countries called Rashugal and Auj Oule. While the two countries appear to live in harmony, they both initiate black operations in attempts to conquer the other in hopes of uniting Rieze Maxia as a single country.|$|E
