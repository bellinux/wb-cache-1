5|$|For {{both sexes}} clothes were tight-fitted, and narrow waists and wrists were <b>appreciated.</b> <b>The</b> silhouettes for grown men and young girls {{emphasized}} wide shoulders and narrowed to the waist; the silhouettes for female aristocrats were more complicated. The Sogdian clothing underwent a thorough process of Islamization {{in the ensuing}} centuries, with few of the original elements remaining. In their stead, turbans, kaftans, and sleeved coats became more common.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of defensive structures was {{closely linked to}} the establishment of the palaces in mainland Greece. The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, like on the acropolis of Athens, Tiryns and Mycenae or on coastal plains, in the case of Gla. Mycenaean Greeks in general <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, reflected by the visual impressiveness of their fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} created to not have direct {{connections}} to the first Shin Megami Tensei, {{to ensure that it}} was interesting independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create the concept of a story vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei future. Reviewers enjoyed the gameplay and the lowered difficulty compared to the prior game; some <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> plot and themes, but some thought that certain themes, while fresh at the time of release, felt clichéd in retrospect.|$|E

5|$|To {{develop a}} {{distinctive}} {{look for the}} various species of the Covenant, Bungie artists drew inspiration from reptilian, ursine, and avian characteristics. A Covenant design scheme of purples and reflective surfaces was made to separate the alien from human architecture. The Covenant were generally well received by critics who <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> challenge they provided to players; several critics lamented the change of the main enemies from Elites to Brutes in Halo 3 and conversely praised their return in the later Halo: Reach.|$|E

5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever {{there was a}} need. It was utilized {{in a variety of}} agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it was capable of doing at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> breed for its willingness to remain calm, stationary and tethered for long periods of time. Due to the modernization of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} much {{of two years}} at the writer's workshop at the University of Iowa, teaching one course each term, Vonnegut was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for research in Germany. By the time he won it, in March 1967, he was becoming a well-known writer. He used the funds to travel in Eastern Europe, including to Dresden, where he found many prominent buildings still in ruins. At {{the time of the}} bombing, Vonnegut had not <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> sheer scale of destruction in Dresden; his enlightenment came only slowly as information dribbled out, and based on early figures he came to believe that 135,000 had died there.|$|E

This was a French bus platform that was fitted with an armoured body, to be used as troop transport. Although it was big, slow and its performance was not good, the Spanish Army learned the value of armored vehicles and bought a second one. Spanish Army officers <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> advantages of using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.|$|E
