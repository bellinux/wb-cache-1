5|$|During the November to May dry season, {{power output}} {{is limited by}} the river's flow rate, as seen in the {{diagrams}} on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The <b>actual</b> <b>power</b> output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Schreck stood down as {{commander}} and Berchtold {{took over the}} leadership. Berchtold changed {{the title of the}} office position, which became known as the Reichsführer-SS. Schreck remained on the SS rolls as an SS-Führer and worked as Hitler's private chauffeur after Maurice until 1934. In 1930, after the SS had begun to expand under Heinrich Himmler, Schreck was appointed an SS-Standartenführer, but had little <b>actual</b> <b>power.</b> He continued to serve at Hitler's side and they were on very good terms.|$|E

Ambushing Nelson and his sidekicks, they commence saturation bombing with water balloons. Nelson's thugs surrender, and Nelson is taken prisoner. He threatens {{to beat up}} Bart {{as soon as he}} is untied. Herman drafts the armistice treaty, which states that Nelson will retain his position and name, but will not hold any <b>actual</b> <b>power.</b> Then, Bart and Nelson sign the treaty. Then, Marge enters with cupcakes, and peace prevails.|$|E

5|$|Prince Frederick campaigned {{actively}} for {{the opposition}} in the British general election, 1741, and Walpole was unable to secure a stable majority. Walpole attempted to buy off the prince {{with the promise of}} an increased allowance and offered to pay off his debts, but Frederick refused. With his support eroded, Walpole retired in 1742 after over 20 years in office. He was replaced by Spencer Compton, Lord Wilmington, whom George had originally considered for the premiership in 1727. Lord Wilmington, however, was a figurehead; <b>actual</b> <b>power</b> was held by others, such as Lord Carteret, George's favourite minister after Walpole. When Wilmington died in 1743, Henry Pelham took his place {{at the head of the}} government.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who {{were glad to}} be rid of the former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of the}} equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by any <b>actual</b> <b>power.</b> The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E
5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its <b>actual</b> <b>power</b> yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E

5|$|After David II's death, Robert II, {{the first}} of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was {{followed}} in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the regnal name Robert III. During Robert III's reign (1390–1406), <b>actual</b> <b>power</b> rested largely in the hands of his brother, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany. After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the Duke of Albany) of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future James I, sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son Murdoch.|$|E
5|$|Henry the Young King {{fought a}} short war {{with his brother}} Richard in 1183 over the status of England, Normandy and Aquitaine. Henry II moved in support of Richard, and Henry the Young King died from {{dysentery}} {{at the end of}} the campaign. With his primary heir dead, Henry rearranged the plans for the succession: Richard was to be made King of England, albeit without any <b>actual</b> <b>power</b> until the death of his father; Geoffrey would retain Brittany; and John would now become the Duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard. Richard refused to give up Aquitaine; Henry II was furious and ordered John, with help from Geoffrey, to march south and retake the duchy by force. The two attacked the capital of Poitiers, and Richard responded by attacking Brittany. The war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation in England at the end of 1184.|$|E
5|$|With {{his eldest}} son dead, Henry rearranged {{the plans for the}} succession: Richard was to be made king of England, albeit without any <b>actual</b> <b>power</b> until the death of his father; Geoffrey would have to retain Brittany, as he held it by marriage, so Henry's {{favourite}} son John would become the duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard. Richard, however, refused to give up Aquitaine; he was deeply attached to the duchy, and had no desire to exchange this role for the meaningless one of being the junior King of England. Henry was furious, and ordered John and Geoffrey to march south and retake the duchy by force. The short war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation at Westminster in England at the end of 1184. Henry finally got his own way in early 1185 by bringing Eleanor to Normandy to instruct Richard to obey his father, while simultaneously threatening to give Normandy, and possibly England, to Geoffrey. This proved enough and Richard finally handed over the ducal castles in Aquitaine to Henry.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{peak power}} estimated using 4 commonly used regression equations with <b>actual</b> peak <b>power</b> derived from force platform {{data in a}} group of adolescent basketball players. Twenty-five elite junior male basketball players (age, 16. 5 +/- 0. 5 years; mass, 74. 2 +/- 11. 8 kg; height, 181. 8 +/- 8. 1 cm) volunteered to participate in the study. <b>Actual</b> peak <b>power</b> was determined using a countermovement vertical jump on a force platform. Estimated peak power was determined using countermovement jump height and body mass. All 4 prediction equations were significantly related to <b>actual</b> peak <b>power</b> (all p < 0. 01). Repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated significant differences between <b>actual</b> peak <b>power</b> and estimate peak power from all 4 prediction equations (p < 0. 001). Bonferroni post hoc tests indicated that estimated peak power was significantly lower than <b>actual</b> peak <b>power</b> for all 4 prediction equations. Ratio limits of agreement for <b>actual</b> peak <b>power</b> and estimated peak power were 8 % for the Harman et al. and Sayers squat jump prediction equations, 12 % for the Canavan and Vescovi equation, and 6 % for the Sayers countermovement jump equation. In all cases peak power was underestimated...|$|R

5|$|After Indian Independence in 1947, all the non-princely {{states were}} subject to a test of {{religious}} majority in which the Muslim majority areas formed the Dominion of Pakistan, while the other regions formed the Dominion of India. Murshidabad (the capital city for both, the Nawabs of Bengal and the Nawabs of Murshidabad) {{became a part of}} East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) for two days, as it had a Muslim majority. However, it became a part of India on 17 August 1947. The Pakistani flag was brought down from the Hazarduari Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop the palace. The Nawabs, after the takeover by the British had no <b>actual</b> <b>power</b> and after merging with India too, they had yielded power, as the Government of India took over control of all the areas that merged with India. Furthermore, with the promulgation of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950, the Dominion of India was transformed into the Republic of India, and the Article 18 of the Indian Constitution (which {{is a part of the}} Right to Equality, a fundamental right in India), titles were abolished. The Article prevents the state from confirming any title except those titles given by the Government to those who have made their mark in military and academic fields. Such titles and awards include the Bharat Ratna, the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan (the Supreme Court of India, on 15 December 1995, upheld the validity of such awards). Thus, with the promulgation of the Constitution, the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad was abolished. And although, the Nawab Waris Ali Meerza held titles such as Raes ud-Daulah, they were not officially or legally recognised.|$|E
5|$|George did {{not play}} a senior role in {{government}} until his wife Anne succeeded as queen on William's death in 1702. George was the chief mourner at William's funeral. Anne appointed him generalissimo of all English military forces on 17 April, and Lord High Admiral, the official but nominal head of the Royal Navy, on 20 May. <b>Actual</b> <b>power</b> at the Admiralty was held by George Churchill, whose elder brother was John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, a great friend of Anne's and the captain-general of English land forces. Prince George had known the Churchills for years: another brother Charles Churchill, {{had been one of}} his gentlemen of the bedchamber in Denmark, and Marlborough had accompanied George on his journey from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683. His secretary in the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother-in-law of the Duchess of Marlborough, who was Anne's close confidante and friend. George followed William III as Captain-General of the Honourable Artillery Company, and was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Anne failed, however, in her attempts to persuade the States General of the Netherlands to elect her husband captain-general of all Dutch forces, to maintain the unified command of the Maritime Powers that William had held.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{situation}} in Hungary had begun to deteriorate as the tide of the war began to turn decisively against Germany and its allies. Following the catastrophic Axis defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (in which Hungarian troops fighting alongside German forces suffered a staggering 84% casualty rate) the regime of Miklos Horthy began secretly pursuing peace talks with the United States and the United Kingdom. Upon learning of Horthy's duplicity, Adolf Hitler ordered the occupation of Hungary by German troops in March 1944. The Wehrmacht quickly {{took control of the}} country and placed Horthy under house arrest. A pro-German puppet government was installed in Budapest, with <b>actual</b> <b>power</b> resting with the German military governor, SS-Brigadeführer Edmund Veesenmayer. With the Nazis now in control, the relative security from the Holocaust enjoyed by the Jews of Hungary came to an end. In April and May 1944 the Nazi regime and its accomplices began the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland. Under the personal leadership of SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann, who would later be tried and hanged in Israel for his major role in the implementation of the Nazis' Final Solution, deportations took place at a rate of 12,000 people per day.|$|E
