5|$|Relay races {{emerged in}} the United States in the 1880s as a {{variation}} on charity races between firemen, who would hand a red pennant on to teammates every 300yards. There <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>very</b> common relay events: the 4×100 metres relay and the 4×400 metres relay. Both events entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one-off men's medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics. The 4 × 100 m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track, meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4 × 400 m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend, at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inner-most part of the circuit. For {{the second and third}} baton change overs, teammates must align themselves in respect of their team position – leading teams take the inner lanes while teammates of the slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes.|$|E

And I think that if we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E

In his review for the album, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine referred to the lyrics as a declaration of independence.

Knowles countered by saying, [...] "It's good to have her advice, but we really have different goals".|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} {{name for}} England is Albion. The name Albion originally {{referred to the}} entire island of Great Britain. The nominally earliest record of the name appears in the Aristotelian Corpus, specifically the 4th century BC De Mundo: [...] "Beyond the Pillars of Hercules is the ocean that flows round the earth. In it <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>very</b> large islands called Britannia; these are Albion and Ierne". But modern scholarly consensus ascribes De Mundo not to Aristotle but to Pseudo-Aristotle, i.e. it was written later in the Graeco-Roman period or afterwards. The word Albion (Ἀλβίων) or insula Albionum has two possible origins. It either derives from a cognate of the Latin albus meaning white, {{a reference to the}} white cliffs of Dover (the only part of Britain visible from the European mainland) or from the phrase the [...] "island of the Albiones" [...] in the now lost Massaliote Periplus, that is attested through Avienus' Ora Maritima to which the former presumably served as a source. Albion is now applied to England in a more poetic capacity. Another romantic name for England is Loegria, related to the Welsh word for England, Lloegr, and made popular by its use in Arthurian legend.|$|E

500|$|Authors of an {{ethnological study}} of slavery at Kingsley Plantation {{characterized}} Kingsley {{as a man}} of complex paradoxes, defiantly proud of his success as a slaveholder, yet dedicated to his multiracial family. Kingsley published a defense of slavery in 1828, identifying himself only as [...] "An Inhabitant of Florida". [...] He rationalized the institution as a necessary condition for any society, beneficial to owner and slave alike, and to the overall economy. He did not consider race the only factor that should determine servitude status, writing, [...] "Few, I think will deny that color and condition, if properly considered, <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>very</b> separate qualities ... our legislators ... have mistaken the shadow for the substance, and confounded together two very different things; thereby substantiating by law a dangerous and inconvenient antipathy, which can have no better foundation than prejudice." [...] In 1823 President James Monroe appointed Kingsley to Florida's Territorial Council, where he tried to persuade them to define the rights of free people of color. When it became apparent to him that they could not, he resigned. The council passed laws that increasingly restricted the rights which free blacks enjoyed under Spanish control. The treatise was Kingsley's response to these restrictions; he favored the Spanish three-tier system of white landowners, black slaves, and freed blacks. The pamphlet was reprinted again in 1834, and Southerners used its arguments to defend slavery in debates leading to the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Defending Flynn's personality, Levi {{explained}} that [...] "Deep down, Flynn {{has a good}} core, although that characteristic is brought out of him through the purity, love and naiveté of Rapunzel." [...] The actor concluded that [...] "These <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>very</b> different characters that end up learning a lot from each other on a rather crazy adventure." [...] According to Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, Flynn [...] "teaches [...] about courage". Rob Vaux of Mania.com described the character's relationship with Rapunzel as a [...] "partners-in-crime sort of chemistry, filled with mischief and the odd pratfall while establishing a rhythm wholly their own." [...] Rapunzel eventually convinces Flynn to go by his birth name, Eugene Fitzherbert, which Conny Eisfeld described in her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) The Art of Adapting Fairy Tales as [...] "more humane". Stephen D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide called Flynn [...] "a charismatic bad boy", comparing him to Sinbad from DreamWorks' [...] (2003). Similarly, The New York Times Brooks Barnes felt that [...] "Making the leading man an unlikable thief is a subtle yet startling twist for Disney, and Flynn ... is glib {{in a way that}} many people now associate with DreamWorks." [...] On Flynn's thievery, Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum determined that the character [...] "only steals because he's basically a nice-guy underachiever who needs a better outlet for his leadership abilities". According to Tison Pugh, author of The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past, Flynn [...] "amalgamates the comedy-action hero with the swashbuckling romantic sensations of Errol Flynn, layering them over a fairy-tale hero attributed with comedic lines that undermine the romantic nostalgia of the film's setting", while serving as a source of comic relief at times. Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times believes that Flynn carries [...] "most of the [...] modern humor". Likewise, Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail described Flynn as the film's [...] "main source of action, humour and, eventually, romance".|$|E
