5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow patterns, and the construction of <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> hatchery.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} an OBE in 1974. In 1996, {{he was awarded}} honorary Irish citizenship. The honour amounts to full Irish citizenship; it is the highest honour the Irish state gives and is rarely granted. In 1994, he was made a Freeman {{of the city of}} Dublin, and was given a honorary doctorate by the University of Limerick. In 1997, he {{was appointed}} a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland. Charlton was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of his contribution to the English game. There is a life-size statue of him at Cork Airport in Ireland, representing him sitting in his fishing gear and displaying <b>a</b> <b>salmon.</b>|$|E

25|$|He {{retired to}} the West Country in 1976. He enjoyed country sports. On one occasion, he shot 250 {{pheasants}} at one stand with one gun; another time, he caught <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> weighing 32lb. He had also hunted big game in Africa, and enjoyed fast cars, driving an Aston Martin.|$|E
25|$|Intraspecific {{competition}} doesn't just involve direct {{interactions between}} {{members of the same}} species (such as male deer locking horns when competing for mates) but can also include indirect interactions where an individual depletes a shared resource (such as a grizzly bear catching <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> that can then no longer be eaten by bears at different points along a river).|$|E

25|$|Salmon {{negotiate}} waterfalls and rapids by leaping or jumping. They {{have been}} recorded making vertical jumps as high as 3.65 metres (12ft). The height {{that can be achieved}} by <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> depends on the position of the standing wave or hydraulic jump {{at the base of the}} fall, as well as how deep the water is.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mammalian natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, CNP), other natriuretic peptides with similar structure and properties have been isolated elsewhere in the animal kingdom. <b>A</b> <b>salmon</b> natriuretic peptide known as salmon cardiac peptide has been described, and dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP) {{has been found in}} the venom of the green mamba, as well as an NP in a species of African snake.|$|E

25|$|In Norse mythology, after Loki tricked {{the blind}} god Höðr into killing his brother Baldr, Loki jumped into a river and {{transformed}} himself into <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> to escape punishment {{from the other}} gods. When they held out a net to trap him he attempted to leap over it but was caught by Thor who {{grabbed him by the}} tail with his hand, and this is why the salmon's tail is tapered.|$|E
25|$|In the Finnish language, the {{asterism}} {{is sometimes}} called with its old Finnish name, Otava. The meaning of the name has been almost forgotten in Modern Finnish; it means <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> weir. Ancient Finns believed the bear (Ursus arctos) was lowered to earth in a golden basket off the Ursa Major, and when a bear was killed, its head was positioned on a tree to allow the bear's spirit to return to Ursa Major.|$|E
25|$|Holinshed {{mentions}} Hayward's source, Scattergood, {{as a spy}} {{who entered}} Leith {{pretending to be a}} fugitive or deserter. Peter Carew reported on 28 May 1560 that the French had no meat or drink except water for three weeks. There was only bread and salted salmon. These were rationed with 126 ounces of bread for a man each day and <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> between six men each week. There were 2,300 French soldiers in Leith and more than 2,000 others.|$|E

25|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the Chilkat River in Alaska has {{particularly}} good spawning grounds. Each year these attract a run of up to half <b>a</b> million chum <b>salmon.</b> <b>As</b> the <b>salmon</b> run up the river, bald eagles arrive in their thousands to feast at the spawning grounds. This results in some of the world's largest congregations of bald eagles. The number of participating eagles is directly correlated with the number of spawning salmon.|$|R

25|$|Edward IV was {{disappointed}} {{by the failure of}} his 1474 treaty with James III who had promised that his son, Prince James would marry Cecily of York. The betrothal was made in October 1474 with a forty-five year truce to last until 1519. Her dowry payments were to be made yearly on 3 February in Edinburgh, brought by Edward's servants from Norham Castle, and a meeting was to be held to resolve the dispute over the 'fish-garth,' <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> trap on the Esk. Since February 1475, Edward's officers had delivered installments of Cecilia's 20,000 mark dowry to James's treasurer in St Giles, Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|Two weirs {{impede the}} flow of the river at Durham, both {{originally}} created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> leap and fish counter, monitoring sea trout and salmon, and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994, it may not be surprising that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} 1641 from Glasgow {{was made to}} replace the ancient Saint Mungo's. This bell had the Chapter of Glasgow's seal on it, a tree and <b>a</b> <b>salmon,</b> {{together}} with a representation of an ancient square-shaped bell; like that of Saint Mungo, which still existed at that date. Saint Mungo's bell was rescued by a Glasgow magistrate, James Laing, after the reformation and the Glasgow officials purchased it for the substantial sum of £10 Scots in 1577. In 1640 the council had a new dead bell made, Saint Mungo's bell probably having become too worn. This was then used {{for many years and}} then lost; however in 1867 it was recovered and returned to the Glasgow corporation. The present whereabouts of Saint Mungo's bell is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Following {{this final}} stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he {{disguised}} himself as <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> and {{hid in the}} waterfall of Franangrsfors, where the Æsir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son Nari, and his son Narfi changed into a wolf. Skaði fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence {{that all of the}} earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} of Newfoundland {{was seeking to}} encourage trade and end hostilities between the Beothuk and the English. But he approved an expedition, to be led by Captain David Buchan, to recover a boat and other fishing gear that had been stolen by the Beothuk. John Peyton Jr. led one of the groups. His father was John Peyton Sr., <b>a</b> <b>salmon</b> fisherman known for his hostility toward the small tribe. On a raid, Peyton's group killed Demasduit's husband Nonosbawsut, then ran her down in the snow. She pleaded for her life, baring her breasts to show she was a nursing mother. They took Demasduit to Twillingate, where Peyton Jr. earned a bounty on her. Her baby died. Peyton Jr. was later appointed Justice of the Peace at Twillingate, Newfoundland.|$|E
