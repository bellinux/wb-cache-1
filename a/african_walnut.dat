40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal {{processing}} (roasting and boiling) on the nutritional, antinutritional, and antioxidant properties of <b>African</b> <b>walnut</b> was studied. Tetracarpidium conophorum (<b>African</b> <b>walnut)</b> {{was subjected to}} thermal treatment of roasting (RWIS), boiling with shell (BWIS), and boiling without shell (BWOS). The resulting samples with raw nut (RAAW) which served as control were analysed for proximate composition, antinutritional components, and antioxidant activity. The protein, fat, and ash contents of the samples on dry basis were 29. 14 %, 54. 14 %, and 3. 32 % (RAAW); 24. 13 %, 61. 75 %, and 2. 77 % (BWIS); 22. 47 %, 62. 65 %, and 2. 16 % (BWOS); and 24. 25 %, 60. 52 %, and 2. 48 % (RWIS), respectively. Thermal processing had significant effect on all the proximate principles; boiling and roasting generally reduced the protein and ash contents of the nut. Boiling with or without shell reduced the phytate and tannin contents of the nut while roasting increased the level of these two antinutritional components; walnut boiled without shell however, had the lowest phytate and tannin contents of 0. 815 [*]mg/ 100 [*]g and 0. 239 [*]mg/ 100 [*]g, respectively. The antioxidant activities of the samples were 8. 47 % (RAAW), 13. 82 % (BWIS), 14. 96 % (BWOS), and 7. 29 % (RWIS).

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>walnut</b> (Coula edulis) is a {{tree species}} of African {{evergreen}} forests, {{the seeds of}} which are collected and traded by African people. Many animal species consume <b>African</b> <b>walnut</b> diaspores; however, their roles as dispersers or predators {{have yet to be}} clarified. In this study, we present observations conducted in two different habitats of a Gabonese region over a 3 -year period. The originality of this research resides in the combination of three complementary approaches: (i) the use of camera-traps (ii) the exploration of land rodent burrows and (iii) the examination of elephant dung. In total, 408 camera-trap photographs have shown seven animal species involved in the dispersal/predation of C. edulis. Among these seven frugivorous species, the bush pig was found to be the main consumer and predator of seeds. Land rodents (Muridae) are potential predators, as they damaged the seeds and buried them deep in the soil. They may also {{play a role in the}} regeneration process as a result of the loss of seeds during transportation. Finally, no seeds appeared to emerge intact from elephant faeces. These results indicate that the natural regeneration rate of this tree species is low, unless other complex mecha-nisms are involved. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFPs) are of significant nutritional, {{economic and cultural}} importance {{for the people of}} central Africa. However, many products have not yet been the subject of scientific studies; such is the case of Coula edulis. Although very little is known about this species, it has many uses and its fruits are regularly eaten and marketed by various communities. Cultivation of this tree species remains however very limited, mainly because of the low germination potential of its seeds. Its wood, renowned for its termite resistance, is used locally for construction. Mechanical tests conducted on the timber have put its technological aptitudes to the fore; it has indeed the potential {{to become one of the}} most sought-after commercial species. As in the future, Coula edulis could be managed for its wood as well as its non timber products, in-depth studies aiming at the sustainable development of this natural resource need to be implemented...|$|E
40|$|The {{proximate}} composition, {{ascorbic acid}} and heavy metal content of (<b>African</b> <b>walnut)</b> Tetracarpidium conophorum were evaluated using chemical analysis. The {{result of the}} proximate composition showed the following; moisture (48. 70 %), carbohydrate (53. 20 %), crude protein (35. 22 %), crude fat (6. 21 %), crude fiber (3. 34 %) and ash (2. 03 %). It also contained 53. 50 mg/ 100 ml of ascorbic acid. The heavy metal concentrations in the fruit is Fe (0. 064 ppm), Mn (0. 012 ppm), Cr (0. 001 ppm), Ni (0. 005 ppm) while the concentrations of Hg, Pb and Cd were not detected. The results revealed that the T. conophorum is rich in ascorbic acid and carbohydrate with moderate valves of crude protein while the ash content was shown to be very low. This result shows that T. conophorum nut is not polluted with heavy metals since the concentrations of the heavy metals were all below WHO permissible limits.

Results show that the conophor nut (<b>African</b> <b>walnut)</b> has average sphericity of 0. 91, radial diameter of 2. 90 cm and an axial diameter of 3. 19 cm. The density of the fresh nuts (68. 8 % moisture content) was found to be about 0. 877 g/cm 3 while the nut thickness was 0. 067 cm. Full cracking of nuts increased with decreasing moisture content and increased drop height. The cracking energy was influenced by nut mass and radial diameter as well as shell moisture content.

The effect of processing on antinutrients contents of the pulp of African elemi AE Canarium schweinfurthii and kernel of <b>African</b> <b>walnut</b> AW Plukenetia conophora consumed as traditional snacks masticatories in Nigeria were investigated. The levels of the antinutrients in raw samples of the traditional snacks as well as their corresponding residual levels in samples subjected to graded doses of heat treatment were evaluated using standard methods. Saponins alkaloids cyanogenic glycosides and oxalate were obtained in both samples while AE contained tannins and flavonoids in addition. The concentrations of saponins 1. 000. 19 and flavonoids 14. 982. 91 in raw AE and saponins 1. 050. 13 in AW were increased by the processing methods. The rest of the antinutrients were decreased in both samples. The effects on saponins and oxalate became significant p 0. 05 as the processing time was increased.

40|$|The {{development}} of local forest products is hampered by insufficient knowledge about their potential and inadequate assessments of {{their impact on}} the national economy. Furthermore, lack of knowledge on the availability of agroforestry tree products (AFTPs) in their biotope prevents effective planning for sustainable management of non-timber forests products (NTFPs) to contribute to poverty reduction. A survey conducted in the Mbam-Inoubou region in central Cameroon shows the significant agroforestry potential of <b>African</b> <b>walnut,</b> Tetracarpidium conophorum, a vine considered as an important associated species in cacao agroforests. The survey results indicate that this vine is fairly abundant in agroforests and commonly planted and used, and could therefore be included in the processing chain to improve household incomes at local, national and even regional levels. The surveys conducted for the study show that sales of products from this liana species can earn creditable incomes. Given this finding, an effort should be made by the different players concerned to improve the distribution of these products by supplying as much information as possible. Doing so would ensure the promotion of African walnuts, oil extract and other new products by bringing them into the national and international marketing system.

Hence, the evaluation of some selected nuts commonly consumed as snacks in the South West of Nigeria for antioxidant activity (AA) and total phenolic content (TPC) using ferric-ion reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay and Folin-Coicalteau method. Results show that AA of nuts such as kola nuts (Cola acuminata; Cola nitida), coconut (Cocos nucifera), bitter kola (Garcina cola), <b>African</b> <b>walnut</b> (Plukenetia conophora), and cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale) ranged from 13. 0 to 53. 21 µmol Trolox Equivalent/ 100 g dry weight while the total phenolic content ranged from 204. 95 to 1955. 14 mg Gallic acid Equivalent/ 100 g of dry sample. Statistical analysis of the relationship between AA and TPC showed a random, nonlinear relationship between the two parameters, suggesting that the antioxidant activity of the nuts is not dependent on phenolics. The result also indicates that the nuts can be utilized as scavenger/mopping agents of free radicals, which are usually generated by essential metabolic processes in the body and environmental pollutions; thereby alleviating the symptoms of chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension and any other age-related diseases reported to be on the increase in developing countries...|$|E

The extract exhibited bactericidal activity against the uro-pathogens in varying degrees at different concentrations tested. In the agar diffusion test, P. aeruginosa showed the highest zone of inhibition (18 mm) at the highest concentration tested (200 mg/mL); while P. mirabilis, K. aerogenes and E. coli showed zones of inhibition of 15, 13 and 12 mm respectively. E. coli and K. aerogenes did not show any zone of inhibition, while P. aeruginosa (14, 12, 10 and 8 mm) and P. mirabilis (13, 11, 8 and 7 mm) showed varied zones of inhibition at extract concentration of 150, 100, 50 and 25 mg/mL, respectively. P. aeruginosa had the least minimum inhibitory concentration (6. 25 mg/mL), followed by P. mirabilis (12. 5 mg/mL); while E. coli and K. aerogenes has the same MIC (150 mg/mL). The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) gave a range of (6. 25 – 200) mg/mL.

40|$|<b>African</b> <b>Walnut</b> (Tetracarpidium conophorum- Mull. Arg) is a {{perennial}} climbing shrub which grows {{mainly in the}} Western region of Africa. It is found mainly in Nigeria, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon as well. The nuts are encased in pods which may contain between 2 to 5 nuts. The seed is enclosed in a hard shell-like case. The nuts are commonly processed by boiling or roasting and consumed as a snack or used as soup thickener. In ethnobotanical medicine, the nut extract is extensively used in decoctions for treatment and/or management of common and chronic ailments such as malaria, dysentery, high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer. The nuts are generally exposed to high temperatures (25 – 37 °C) and relative humidity (RH) which increases susceptibility to fungal contamination and nutrient degradation, hence, raising concerns over product quality and safety. Experiment simulating the common retail postharvest storage and processing practices was conducted to: (i) determine the effects on the fatty acid profile; (ii) assess {{the impact on the}} fungal population contaminating the nut shells at different maturity stages, and potential mycotoxigenic implications; (iii) evaluate the cytotoxicity of four extract of the nut on lung cancer (A 549) cells; and finally (iv) assay the total phenolic content and profile potential individual phenolic components of the nut. Results indicated the presence of essential and non-essential fatty acids namely; palmitate, oleate, stearate, linoleate, arachidate and α-linolineate with α-linolineate being the most abundant (1. 1 – 8. 2 mg/g freeze-dry weight). Boiling and roasting generally improved the concentration of the fatty acids best when nuts are cold stored at 5 °C for maximum of 10 days. Potential mycotoxigenic species - Aspergillus section Nigri, Aspergillus flavus/Parasiticus, Fusarium spp. and Penicillium spp. - were frequently isolated from cultured shell pieces of stored nuts. When compared with unprocessed nuts, roasting completely prevented fungal contamination in shell pieces from nuts in the non-stored (NSN) group at early maturity stage, while boiling significantly reduced the level of contamination to about 58 % (P < 0. 05). Simulating open market conditions caused 100 % fungal contamination in all boiled samples and roasted samples at early maturity. Mycotoxin analysis using Yeast Extract agar (YES) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) - Fluorescence detector (FLD) showed that Aflatoxins - G 1 (AFG 1), B 1 (AFB 1), G 2 (AFG 2), and B 2 (AFB 2) were produced by 20 isolates with both AFG 1 and AFB 1 being predominant at concentration ranges 4 – 32, 200 and 4 – 22, 700 ng/g plug weight, respectively. No Ochratoxin A (OTA) was detected. Phenolic component analysis indicated unprocessed (20. 79 ± 1. 0 mg gallic acid equivalent per gram freeze-dry weight – GAE/g FDW) samples showed the highest value for total phenolics while both boiling (9. 90 ± 1. 8 mg GAE/g FDW), and roasting (9. 32 ± 2. 7 mg GAE/g FDW) reduced the amount by more than 50 % when compared with unprocessed. Potential individual phenolic compounds were unambiguously separated using high performance liquid chromatography – diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). There were no differences between chromatograms of defatted and non-defatted unprocessed, roasted and boiled samples. Cytotoxicity evaluation showed no decrease in cell densities in plates treated with extracts from unprocessed nuts at all concentrations. Diethyl ether-ethyl acetate (10 µg/mL) and n-butanol (1000 and 500 µg/mL) extracts of roasted nuts as well as dichloromethane and water (1, 10 µg/mL) of boiled nuts caused a non-significant decrease of < 10 % in cell densities when compared with the phosphate buffered saline-media control. However, all extracts showed no cytotoxic effect on the A 549 cells <b>African</b> <b>walnut</b> is basically produced at subsistence level in Nigeria, but considering the presence of desirable fatty acid profile and phenolic compounds, need for increased industrial scale production is herein recommended. Although fungal attack and potential mycotoxin risk on the nut may be high, retail processing by roasting has prospects to greatly accentuate the risk. Cold storage of the nut may help to improve the shelf life although it may not be cost effective for local farmers in Nigeria and Africa, however, it provides opportunity for export business. Although the nut extracts showed no cytotoxic effect on A 549 lung cancer cell lines, there is need to investigate further to confirm it non-cytotoxicity activity on other cancer lines and normal cell lines...|$|E
