5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of potassium metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal.

Potassium chloride {{is used in the}} United States for lethal injection executions.|$|E
5|$|M. l. dulcis, {{commonly}} known as lavender-flanked fairywren, is found in Arnhem Land. It was described in 1908 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews, though this and subspecies rogersi were long considered forms of the lovely fairywren (M. amabilis) until integrades were noted over a wide area of northern Australia with subspecies assimilis. Like subspecies rogersi, females are predominantly blue-grey rather than grey-brown and have white lores <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> rings rather than the rufous coloration of the other subspecies.|$|E

5|$|According to Naman Ramachandran, {{the author}} of , most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic {{activities}} went unpublicised {{because he did not}} want them to be so. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs prevented a majority of people from donating eyes, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. Rajinikanth's fan associations regularly organise blood donation <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> donation camps and distribute food during his birthday.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the sinking, several ships sailed to the disaster area to recover victims' bodies. The White Star Line chartered the cable ship Mackay-Bennett from Halifax, Nova Scotia to retrieve bodies. Three other ships followed in the search: the cable ship Minia, the lighthouse supply ship Montmagny and the sealing vessel Algerine. Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Upon recovery, each body retrieved by the Mackay-Bennett was numbered and given as detailed a description as possible to help aid in identification. The physical appearance of each body—height, weight, age, hair <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> colour, visible birthmarks, scars or tattoos, was catalogued and any personal effects on the bodies were gathered and placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number.|$|E

5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain <b>and</b> <b>eye,</b> with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E

Manning a Lewis Gun during the action, he was injured twice, {{suffering}} shrapnel wounds to his face <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> from an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek. He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to hafnium in the {{workplace}} by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for exposure to hafnium and hafnium compounds in the workplace as TWA 0.5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the same recommended exposure limit (REL). At levels of 50mg/m3, hafnium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1 ppm (1mg/m3) during an 8-hour workday.

5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to {{warfarin}} in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin absorption, <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for warfarin exposure in the workplace as 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 100mg/m3, warfarin is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} excimer lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> surgery.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{administration}} {{in the second and}} third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E
5|$|William Wilde was Ireland's leading oto-ophthalmologic (ear <b>and</b> <b>eye)</b> {{surgeon and}} was knighted in 1864 for his {{services}} as medical adviser and assistant commissioner to the censuses of Ireland. He also wrote books about Irish archaeology and peasant folklore. A renowned philanthropist, his dispensary {{for the care of}} the city's poor at the rear of Trinity College, Dublin, was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road. On his father's side Wilde was descended from a Dutchman, Colonel de Wilde, who went to Ireland with King William of Orange's invading army in 1690. On his mother's side Wilde's ancestors included a bricklayer from County Durham who emigrated to Ireland sometime in the 1770s.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E
