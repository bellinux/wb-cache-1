40|$|Purpose: The {{evaluation}} of modified <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> – Kevlar – as reinforcement in silicon {{materials used in}} medicine. Design/methodology/approach: Samples of laminated material based on modified <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> and medical silicone were made by a method of manual formation of laminates that is impregnation of reinforcement with matrix to hardening silicone process using hardening methods connected with heat. Created material was observed on Scanning Electron Microscopy manufactured by Zeiss. Findings: The {{results show that the}} modification of <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> has a positive influence on adhesion of silicon material to <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> and strengthening of tested samples.

The influence of the surface finish composition and content has been studied in the field of cables and textiles, but there is no published data concerning the effect of a finish treatment on the hydrolytic degradation. <b>Aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> with different finish contents have been aged in an alkaline environment. The degradation has been identified by FTIR, viscosimetry, TGA, SEM and tensile tests. For Technora fibres, the presence of finish appears to limit the tensile strength loss of <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> at pH 11 by limiting abrasion, as well as bulk and surface degradation. For Twaron fibres, higher finish content only has a slight influence on the fibres durability at pH 11 and pH 9, by limiting abrasion and bulk degradation...|$|R

Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is fibreglass, followed by aluminium, steel, carbon fibre, and ferrocement (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed {{and is no longer}} limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as plywood, veneers, skinned balsa and epoxy resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat.

50|$|Many {{polymers}} are {{strengthened by}} hydrogen bonds in their main chains. Among the synthetic polymers, {{the best known}} example is nylon, where hydrogen bonds occur in the repeat unit and {{play a major role}} in crystallization of the material. The bonds occur between carbonyl and amine groups in the amide repeat unit. They effectively link adjacent chains to create crystals, which help reinforce the material. The effect is greatest in <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre,</b> where hydrogen bonds stabilize the linear chains laterally. The chain axes are aligned along the fibre axis, making the fibres extremely stiff and strong. Hydrogen bonds are also important in the structure of cellulose and derived polymers in its many different forms in nature, such as wood and natural fibres such as cotton and flax.|$|E

Micrographs were also made to provide an additional support to the experimental data of this work. It was shown that both investigated techniques for modifying <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> are adequate to promote their interfacial adhesive bonding to epoxy matrices due to the surface roughness and chemical affinity to the epoxy resin.

40|$|Uncertainties {{about the}} long term bearing {{capacity}} of <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> have made designers reluctant to utilize them for external pre-stressing for cable-stayed bridges. Recent research carried out on cable-stayed bridges {{has found that the}} steel cables, although well protected from the external environment, are subject to corrosion, resulting in a risk of structural defects and malfunctions. The question that prompted this study is whether simple and non-destructive non-linearity tests can be used for assessing structural damage in <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> or elements. The concept is to detect weak non-linearities in the dynamic response measured on fibres and ropes and to use the level of non-linearity as an indicator for evaluating the residual life span of aramid elements, cables and ropes. In perspective, a non-linearity test may be easily integrated in structural health monitoring protocols to be employed on aramid cables and elements to collect timely notifications about possible anomalies in the structural behaviour. In order to investigate the sensitivity of such an approach to structural health monitoring, non-linearity characterisation tests were conducted on <b>aramid</b> <b>fibres</b> by applying controlled sweep-sine excitations at different loading levels. In order to have a comparative term and to test the setup machine, a similar characterisation procedure was also applied to a novel material, the silicon carbide, which is known to exhibit a purely brittle behaviour, with no appreciable plastic deformatio...|$|R
5000|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a form}} {{of concrete}} used in construction which is [...] "pre-stressed" [...] by being placed under compression prior to supporting any loads beyond its own dead weight. [...] This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength [...] "tendons" [...] located within or adjacent to the concrete volume, and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service. Tendons may consist of single wires, multi-wire strands or threaded bars, and are most commonly made from high-tensile steels, carbon fibre or <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre.</b> The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces, and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces. This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared to conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations.|$|E

40|$|In this study, 2 -phenoxyethanol {{was used}} as a carrier to realise the bright-colour dyeing of <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre.</b> Fourier {{transform}} infrared, X-ray diffraction, and thermal analyses were used to characterise the modification of 2 -phenoxyethanol on the <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre</b> structure. The dyeing performance, including the K/S value and the dye uptake, was tested by varying the concentration of 2 -phenoxyethanol and related experimental parameters. Structural analysis suggests strengthened H-bonds, lower crystallinity, and slightly lower thermal stability after 2 -phenoxyethanol treatment, which {{can be explained by the}} swelling effect of 2 -phenoxyethanol, enlarging the amorphous structure through the reassembly of hydroxyl bonding to the <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre.</b> The dyeing performance can be improved by increasing the dyeing time, the temperature, and the concentration of sodium nitrate under slightly acidic condition.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the creep rupture of Kevlar@ 29, Twaron@ 1000, and Technora T 2000 <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre</b> yams {{was carried out in}} the temperature range 25 - 120 T in air and three other environments (Saudi/Iranian crude oil, pure water, and low pH water) at 65 T with the objective of characterising the long term failure behaviour of these fibres and determine if they can be used to replace the stress rupture test conducted on RTP for qualification purposes. The standard loglo-loglo ISO 9080 extrapolation procedure, the modified lin-logio ISO 9080 extrapolation procedure and the time temperature superposition method were used to model and interpret the results. When tested in air, the different yams showed similar but not identical regression parameters. The results of the standard logio-logio ISO 9080 and the modified lin-logio methods correlated well. The standard logio-logio form, however, gave slightly higher values for the 20 year mean stress and LPL. Its use is recommended because it is consistent with the model assumed in the regression of RTP. There was no evidence of any 'knee' in the relationships after long periods or at high temperatures. This suggests that there is no change in failure mechanism, and lends confidence to both the long term use of <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre</b> in air and the recommended qualification procedures. RTP regression curve constants and those of tested <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre</b> were similar indicating the validity of <b>aramid</b> <b>fibre</b> stress rupture tests as a replacement for RTP tests. Crude oil immersion produced a small but significant reduction in behaviour. At 650 C a suitable crude oil reduction factor applied to the long ten-n LPL would be 0. 9. Pure water produces a marked reduction in strength after short periods, at 65 C. Finally, water of low pH resulted in a large reduction in performance and considerable scatter with one fibre type. With the other, the effect appeared to be similar to that of pure water. Based on the understanding of the failure mechanism and the creep process in aramid fibres, a creep strain model is proposed for estimating the strain to failure based on the material's properties.
