5|$|Following Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{received}} the ball, {{but failed to}} gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> The Deacons' offense went three and out {{and was forced to}} punt. On Tech's next possession, they too had difficulty moving the football on offense. Though they picked up <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> off of a penalty on Wake Forest, they were unable to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> by their own devices and were forced to punt the ball away.|$|E
5|$|Texas' post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech four-yard line. A two-yard run was followed by an 11-yard carry by Ken Oxendine who earned <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 17-yard line. After the first down, Oxendine earned another six yards. Druckenmiller then completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Bryan Jennings for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 35-yard line. Texas committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then a long pass downfield fell incomplete. Two more plays failed to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> and the Hokies punted.|$|E
5|$|The Hurricanes {{picked up}} <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on one rush each from Hobbs and Roan, but {{were unable to}} gain another. After a Miami punt, Tech {{returned}} to offense from its 46-yard line. Casey picked up <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on a pass, then gained another after a seven-yard scramble that followed a three-yard rush by Lawrence. Lawrence then gained <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on his own after rushing for nine yards and five yards, driving the Hokies to the Miami 15-yard line in the process. After entering the Miami red zone, however, Tech was unable to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> and Casey was sacked for a loss of 13 yards. Facing a fourth down and needing 20 yards for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Tech coach Bill Dooley sent in kicker Dennis Laury to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and with 29 {{seconds left in the}} first half, Tech cut Miami's lead to 143.|$|E
50|$|If {{a penalty}} against the {{defensive}} team moves the ball past {{the line to}} gain, the offensive team gets <b>a</b> new <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Some defensive penalties give the offense <b>an</b> automatic <b>first</b> <b>down</b> regardless of the distance.|$|R

5|$|After the Virginia Tech kickoff {{and a short}} return, Miami {{began the}} first drive of the game at its 32-yard line. The game's first play was an {{incomplete}} pass from Miami quarterback Jim Kelly. After a one-yard rush, Kelly completed his first pass of the game, an 18-yard toss that drove Miami to the Tech 49-yard line and gave the Hurricanes <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Miami then committed a 15-yard penalty, pushing the Hurricanes back into {{their side of the}} field. On the second play after the penalty, Kelly completed a 29-yard pass that gave Miami <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> The Hurricanes were further aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Virginia Tech, giving Miami <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 20-yard line. From there, it took Miami just three plays to score a touchdown, the final play being a 15-yard pass from Kelly to Larry Brodsky. With 12:37 remaining in the quarter, Miami took a 70 lead.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, North Carolina had <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 34-yard line. Keldorf {{threw an}} eight-yard pass to Crumpler, North Carolina, was {{stopped for a}} one-yard loss on a running play, then the Tar Heels earned <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a four-yard run by Geter. On first down, Keldorf threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Second down resulted in a 15-yard gain and <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on a run by Geter along {{the left side of}} the field. Now at the Tech eight-yard line, Geter ran straight ahead for a five-yard gain. Geter was stopped for a two-yard loss on the next play, but North Carolina recovered from the loss with a five-yard pass from Keldorf to Carrick for a touchdown. The extra point kick was blocked, but a penalty against Virginia Tech allowed Carolina kicker Josh McGee another chance at the extra point. The second attempt was successful, and the kick gave the Tar Heels a 423 lead with 5:01 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another first down, this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1925, a call of offside {{against a}} {{defensive}} unit {{brought with it}} <b>an</b> automatic <b>first</b> <b>down</b> {{in addition to a}} five-yard advancement of the ball for the offense. However, a December 1924 meeting of the Football Coaches' Association of America spurred a change of rules for the 1925 season eliminating the provision for <b>an</b> automatic <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> while leaving the five yard penalty intact.|$|R

5|$|Following Tennessee's post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} kick return, the Virginia Tech offense {{began at}} its 24-yard line. The first Tech play of the quarter, a run up the middle by Edmonds, {{resulted}} in a 17-yard gain and <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Dwayne Thomas followed Edmonds' run {{with one of his}} own, advancing the ball to the 50-yard line. He pushed into Tennessee territory on the next play, a five-yard run that gave the Hokies <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tennessee 45-yard line. DeShazo then ran nine yards, and Tech gained <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on the next play. Inside the Tennessee 35-yard line, however, the Volunteers' defense stiffened. DeShazo passed for a seven-yard gain, but the Hokies were unable to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> until DeShazo scrambled for a 13-yard gain on fourth down. The run kept the Tech drive alive as the Hokies now had <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tennessee 14-yard line. Tennessee forced another third-down play, but the Hokies gained <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tennessee three-yard line with a pass from DeShazo to Thomas. Four plays later, the Hokies scored their first points of the game as Thomas dove across the goal line on fourth down. The subsequent extra point was good, and the Hokies cut Tennessee's lead to 217 with 5:17 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller entered {{the game to}} guide the Hokies' offense. The first play of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards. Two more runs by Oxendine failed to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> however, and Virginia Tech punted. Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the kick to the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued trying to run out the clock. Tennessee failed to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> and the resulting punt rolled {{into the end zone}} for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Clemson's offense {{started at}} its 25-yard line. On {{the first play}} of the drive, Dantzler {{completed}} a pass to wide receiver Rod Gardner, who ran for 25 yards and <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the 50-yard line. A nine-yard shovel pass play {{was followed by a}} run up the middle for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 37-yard line. Dantzler completed an eight-yard pass, then a running play was stopped short of the first-down marker. On third down, Dantzler faked a quarterback sneak in order to attempt a long pass downfield. Dantzler was unable to pass, however, and was sacked for a four-yard loss. Rather than attempt a field goal or punt the ball, Clemson coach Tommy Bowden had his team attempt to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Dantzler scrambled forward, but didn't gain the five yards needed. The Tigers thus turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 28-yard line.|$|E
50|$|Pitts ran {{the reverse}} {{again in the}} third quarter and picked up <b>a</b> {{critical}} <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Otis Taylor scored on the next play.|$|R

5|$|From their one-yard line, the Hurricanes ran a short rush up the middle, then Kelly {{connected}} on a 28-yard pass {{to tight}} end Mark Cooper for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Three short rushes by fullback Speedy Neal resulted in 12 yards and <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> With time running {{out in the}} quarter, Kelly attempted and completed a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Rocky Belk, driving the Hurricanes to the Tech 30-yard line and bringing the quarter to an end. Miami led, 70 {{at the end of}} the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's defense {{also held}} fast {{on the next}} possession, and Tech was unable to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> {{following}} the turnover. Tech's punt was returned to the Indiana 38-yard line, where the Hoosier offense returned to the field. At first, the Hoosiers were successful moving the ball as they picked up <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> in Tech territory via a pass from Paci. The success was short-lived, however, as the Hoosiers were unable to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> once on the Tech {{side of the field}} and had to punt. Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 21-yard line, where Tech began its third possession of the second half. Tech picked up <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> via two DeShazo passes, but couldn't gain another. Tech's punt was downed at the Indiana 20-yard line, and Indiana's offense began work with 3:02 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Kendrick {{returned}} Clemson's post-score kickoff to the Tech 23-yard line. A two-yard run by Suggs {{was followed}} by a pass to Davis at the Tech 39-yard line for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Two running plays set up third down and two, then Vick completed a 50-yard pass to Kendrick, who picked up <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Clemson four-yard line. From there, it took Suggs two rushes to pass the goal line for Virginia Tech's third touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 2110 with 2:26 before halftime.|$|E

With time running out in the first half, Taylor completed a nine-yard pass to Boone, then ran six yards for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Cincinnati 26-yard line. The Hokies then called another timeout to stop the clock with three seconds remaining in the quarter.

5|$|Texas {{began its}} third {{possession}} with 7:58 {{remaining in the}} quarter. From the 28-yard line, running back Shon Mitchell gained 14 yards and <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the 42-yard line. Brown then completed a 26-yard pass to Adams, who earned <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 32-yard line. Now in Tech territory, Mitchell gained eight yards on a run {{to the left side}} of the field. On second down, Williams ran straight ahead for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 17-yard line. Mitchell then advanced to the 12-yard line on a running play, but Brown threw an incomplete pass on second down. Facing a third down and needing five yards, Texas was stopped for a short gain, but Tech was called for an offsides penalty. The five yards negated the third-down stop and gave Texas <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the six-yard line of Virginia Tech. Two plays later, Brown completed a pass to tight end Pat Fitzgerald, who ran into the end zone for a touchdown. The subsequent extra point kick was good, and Texas took a 70 lead with 4:32 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

50|$|New {{head coach}} Cole started strong with a shutout downing of Peru State, {{the first time}} these teams met, without {{allowing}} the visiting team even <b>a</b> single <b>first</b> <b>down</b> in the game.|$|R
5|$|The Tigers' third {{possession}} didn't produce {{anything more}} than their first two possessions did. A running play was stopped for no gain, Dantzler was sacked for a loss of three yards by David Pugh, and a scramble by Dantzler gained only four yards. Clemson's punt was downed at the Tech 41-yard line, and the Hokies had another chance on offense. On the first play of the drive, Vick scrambled for a nine-yard gain. On the next play, Tech gained <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on a run by backup running back Andre Kendrick to the Clemson 46-yard line. After an incomplete pass, Vick completed a six-yard toss to Kendrick. A five-yard offsides penalty gave Tech <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Clemson 35-yard line, then Vick completed a six-yard throw to wide receiver Emmett Johnson. This was followed by Vick scrambling for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Clemson 19-yard line. A reverse run by Johnson picked up five yards, then a run up the middle gained <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Clemson nine-yard line. Two rushes by Kendrick failed to reach the five-yard line, then Vick ran six yards for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 140 with 1:08 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{first play}} of the Tech drive {{resulted}} in a 12-yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on an end-around. Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on the first play after Hyman's rush, but earned 10yards on two subsequent rushes, setting up a fourth down. Needing one yard for <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> behind by 16points, and with time running down in the quarter, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the first down play rather than kick a field goal. Humes again rushed the ball, and as time ran out in the third quarter, picked up enough ground for the first down. With one quarter of play remaining, Auburn led Virginia Tech 16–0, but the Hokies had picked up <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> inside the Auburn 10-yard line to begin the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Air Force in {{possession}} of the ball, facing fourth down, and needing to advance mere inches to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> During the Falcons' attempt to gain those inches, however, Tech's Bruce Smith broke through the Air Force offensive line and sacked Bart Weiss for a loss. Having failed to gain <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Air Force turned the ball over to Virginia Tech, which began a drive at its 42-yard line. Tech's Eddie Hunter moved the ball forward on three consecutive rushes, earning <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>down</b> and driving into Air Force territory. Seeking {{to tie the game}} or gain a lead with a trick play; Tech head coach Bill Dooley ordered a play involving a pass by Hunter instead of quarterback Mark Cox. The pass was intercepted by Air Force defender Scott Thomas, and the Falcons took over on offense at their 38-yard line with 12:58 remaining in the game.|$|E
