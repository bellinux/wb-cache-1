40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} of environmental antecedents to <b>asset</b> <b>restructuring</b> in nine French civil law countries in Latin America and Europe.

40|$|One of {{the most}} lively debated effects of banking {{acquisitions}} is the change in lending and asset allocation of the target bank in favour of transactional activities, {{at the expense of}} small and informational opaque borrowers. These changes {{may be the result of}} two distinct restructuring strategies of the asset portfolio of the bidder bank. An asset cleaning strategy (ACS), in which the acquiring bank makes a clean sweep of all the negative net present value activities in the portfolio of the acquired bank, and an asset portfolio strategy (APS), in which the acquiring bank permanently changes the portfolio allocation of the acquired bank. In this paper we focus on Italian bank acquisitions and test which <b>asset</b> <b>restructuring</b> strategy was predominantly pursued over the period 1997 - 2003. Moreover, we estimate both a model for the whole Italian banking industry and a model for the acquired banks located in economic backward Southern regions. At the national level we find evidence of a primacy of ACSs over APSs. When we concentrate on bank acquisitions that occurred in the Mezzogiorno (Italy’s Southern regions), evidence seems to reverse, i. e.

40|$|One of {{the most}} lively-debated effects of banking {{acquisitions}} is the change in lending and asset allocation of the target bank in favor of transaction-based products, {{at the expense of}} small and informationally opaque borrowers. These changes {{may be the result of}} two distinct restructuring strategies pursued by the acquirer with respect to the asset portfolio of the acquired bank: a cleaning strategy (CS), in which the acquirer makes a clean sweep of all the negative net present value activities in the portfolio of the acquired bank, and a portfolio strategy (PS), in which the acquiring bank permanently changes the portfolio allocation of the acquired bank. In this paper we focus on Italian bank acquisitions and test which <b>asset</b> <b>restructuring</b> strategy was predominantly pursued over the period 1997 – 2003. Moreover, we distinguish acquisitions according to their geographic diversifying character and to the physical and cultural distances that separate acquiring from acquired banks. When we look at the mean value, we do not find clear evidence of a primacy either of CSs or PSs. When we separate in-market from out-of-market bank acquisitions, however, results show that the CSs prevail only in the former type of deals, while in the latter the portfolio of acquired banks is subject to PSs. Finally, we find that differences in <b>asset</b> <b>restructuring</b> strategies can be explained by differences in corporate culture and the workplace environment of the dealing partners...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of short term debt on equityholders' risk taking decisions. We show that if short term debt limits the expropriation of debtholders, it also implies a lower leverage, which prevents the firm from increasing tax shields. We then examine the incentive of equityholders to increase the firm risk when debtholders hold the option to swap a perpetual coupon bond with short term debt. We find that this option mitigates equityholders' risk shifting incentives. Compared to standard short term debt, this restructuring option deters debtholders expropriation, it increases leverage and it reduces the loss in tax shields due to asset substitution. <b>Asset</b> substitution <b>Restructuring</b> Debt maturity Agency costs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} effects of using {{proceeds}} from asset sales {{as a source of}} funding for mergers and acquisitions (M&As). The first empirical chapter investigates the financing decisions made by acquiring firms and seeks to test a new theoretical framework proposed by Edmans and Mann (2017) which models a firm’s funding choice between asset sales and equity offerings. Their theory identifies settings in which a firm may prefer to select one financing source over the other, which may result in deviations from traditional financing theories. The predictions of this framework are empirically tested in an M&A setting. The second empirical chapter provides evidence that mergers and acquisitions occur as part of <b>asset</b> <b>restructuring,</b> in which asset sale proceeds are associated with increased acquisition probability.
