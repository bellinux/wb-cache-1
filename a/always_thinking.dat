25|$|The size of {{the assets}} the Custodian {{controlled}} only became clear over the next year. Late in 1918, Palmer reported he was managing almost 30,000 trusts with assets worth $500 million. He estimated that another 9,000 trusts worth $300 million awaited evaluation. Many of the enterprises in question produced materials significant to the war effort, such as medicines, glycerin for explosives, charcoal for gas masks. Others ranged from mines to brewing to newspaper publishing. Palmer built a team of professionals with banking expertise {{as well as an}} investigative bureau to track down well-hidden assets. Below the top-level positions, he distributed jobs as patronage. For example, he appointed one of his fellow members of the Democratic National Committee to serve as counsel for a textile company and another the vice-president of a shipping line. <b>Always</b> <b>thinking</b> like a politician, he made sure his group's efforts were well publicized.|$|E
25|$|Alec Smart (Ricky Diamond) - The sly and untrustworthy tenant {{who moves}} into the flat above Bodger's in Series 7. He was <b>always</b> <b>thinking</b> up schemes to make money, often tricking Mrs Dribelle and Bodger in the process. He sucks up to Mrs Dribelle while {{secretly}} trying to scam her. In the episode 'Mrs Dribelle's Big Day' he asks her to marry him, {{with the intention of}} getting his hands on her money. After Mrs Dribelle discovers his plan, she throws him out of the flat. A year later when Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford at the beginning of Series 8 to run a hotel, they are horrified to discover that Mr Smart is their next door neighbour once again. He is also running a hotel, but never seems to have any guests and is always trying to steal Bodger's or trying to outshine his rival in every despicable way possible. He was last seen in the episode 'Doggone' when he kidnapped China the dog in order to obtain a reward for finding him. As he is not seen or mentioned again in the series, it is assumed that he moved away from Puddleford or still lives next door but never mentioned.|$|E
25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m <b>always</b> <b>thinking</b> about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E

In 2009, the siblings manipulate their parents {{to get them back}} together in marriage. The storyline, inspired by The Parent Trap (1961), sees Steffy and Thomas tamper with SMS text messages between Ridge and his former love, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) to make Brooke believe that Ridge had dumped her, so she will not interrupt his reunion with Taylor. However, Brooke crashes the wedding after the marriage becomes official.|$|E
500|$|Anne's {{apparent}} {{withdrawal of}} genuine affection occurred {{for a number}} of reasons. She was frustrated by Sarah's long absences from Court and despite numerous letters from Anne to Sarah on this subject, Sarah rarely attended, and wrote her excuses in letters to Anne. There was also a political difference between them: Anne was a Tory (the party known as the [...] "Church party", religion being one of Anne's chief concerns), and Sarah was a Whig (the party known to support Marlborough's wars). Sarah did not share Anne's deep interest in religion, a subject she rarely mentioned, although at their last fraught interview she did warn Anne that she risked God's vengeance for her unreasoning cruelty to Sarah. The Queen did not want this difference to come between them; but Sarah, <b>always</b> <b>thinking</b> of her husband, wanted Anne to give more support to the Whigs, which she was not prepared to do.|$|E

In her 2012 album Banga, singer Patti Smith released [...] "This Is the Girl," [...] written as a homage to Winehouse. Mark Ronson dedicated his UK number one album Uptown Special to Winehouse, stating: [...] "I'm <b>always</b> <b>thinking</b> of you and inspired by you."

500|$|Development and {{production}} for Tucker: The Man and His Dream included {{the involvement of}} Tucker's children and grandchildren. Jeff Bridges was cast {{in the title role}} and, for research, studied Preston Tucker's mannerisms and movements through home movies. Tucker's descendants also granted Bridges the opportunity to sport the man's black pearl ring and cuff links for his wardrobe. Preston's son, John Tucker, said that Bridges has [...] "got it all in the mannerisms and the look. My father was very positive, <b>always</b> <b>thinking</b> of what came next. Jeff captures that." [...] Martin Landau was enthusiastic about accepting the pivotal role of Abe Karatz as a means to avoid typecasting. The construct of family values {{played a crucial role in}} the Tuckers' life and Coppola studiously selected Joan Allen for the part of Vera, Tucker's devoted wife while Christian Slater and Elias Koteas fill in the other central roles of eldest son and Tucker's friend and confederate, Alex Tremulis. Coppola's family was undergoing a stressful time during the production and he dedicated the film to Gio, his eldest son, who died before filming began.|$|E

The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, right then and there... She {{said she was going}} to be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was <b>always</b> <b>thinking</b> about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E

The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss her, that you are <b>always</b> <b>thinking</b> about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter.

YouTube was forced to close Gaga's official channel with the statement: [...] "YouTube ladygagaofficial account was closed, because we have received, several instances, third-party notifications informing us that many people, including the following, filed a claim for infringement of copyright: Air Productions." [...] Later, Air Productions issued a statement that the notification was sent in error, and they had asked Google and YouTube to rectify this; Gaga's account was re-opened, and Taratata apologized to the singer: [...] "Really sorry for the problem with YouTube. Everything works again!" [...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, against the backdrop of many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show.

[...] "Philo was a very deep person – tough to engage in conversation, because he was <b>always</b> <b>thinking</b> about {{what he could do}} next," [...] said Art Resler, an ITT photographer who documented Farnsworth’s work in pictures. One of Farnsworth's most significant contributions at ITT was the PPI Projector, an enhancement on the iconic [...] "circular sweep" [...] radar display, which allowed safe air traffic control from the ground. This system developed in the 1950s was the forerunner of today’s air traffic control systems.|$|E
