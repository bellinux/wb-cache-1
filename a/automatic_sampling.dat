5000|$|The {{analysis}} {{can be done}} on samples which the operator brings to the analyser or the analyser can {{be connected to the}} source of the samples and the sampling be done automatically. The source of samples for <b>automatic</b> <b>sampling</b> is commonly some kind of process such as a chemical process. Analysers which are connected to a process, and conduct <b>automatic</b> <b>sampling,</b> can be called online (or on-line) analysers or sometimes inline (or in-line) analysers. For inline analysis, a sensor can be placed in a process vessel or stream of flowing material to conduct the analysis. Another method of online analysis is allowing a sample stream to flow from the process equipment into an analyser, sometimes conditioning the sample stream in between such as reducing pressure or changing the sample temperature. Such sampling is typically for fluids (either liquids or gases). If the sample stream is not substantially modified by the analyser, it can be returned to the process. Otherwise, the sample stream is not returned; for example, if any reagents have been added for the analysis.|$|E

Ten tonnes of barley inoculated with Penicillium verrucosum were incubated until the OTA concentration reached approximately 15 µg/kg and sampled with manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>sampling.</b> A nested experimental design and ANOVA was used to estimate variance components from sampling, sample reduction, sample preparation and analysis.

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>sampling</b> of end-tidal 133 Xe has {{a number}} of {{distinct}} advantages over manual or computer analysis of continuously sampled curves. Because the sample remains within the radiation-counting cell for a finite period of time, counts can be accumulated between breaths. This results in higher count rates, improved counting statistics, and a possi-ble reduction in the isotope dose needed to achieve a statistically reasonable number of counts. Also, automated sampling provides on-line computation of rCBF and renders editing of "bad " points a rather simple process. While com-puter programs can be written to select samples from a con-tinuous curve, the programming may be quite cumbersome. Our <b>automatic</b> <b>sampling</b> timer can be easily constructed for approximately $ 100. A detailed circuit diagram is presented in figure 5.
