5|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} research {{investigations of the}} rhodocene system {{was to understand the}} nature of and bonding within the metallocene class of compounds. In more recent times, interest has been rekindled by the desire to explore <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> metal–metal interactions that occur when metallocene systems are linked. Potential applications for such systems include molecular electronics, semi-conducting (and possibly ferromagnetic) metallocene polymers (an example of a molecular wire), and exploring the threshold between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its two predecessors, Valkyria Chronicles III was not {{released}} in the west.

An unofficial fan translation patch began development in February 2012: players with a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could download <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> patch, which translated the game's text into English. Compatible with the Extra Edition, the patch was released in January 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E

25|$|Ant attacks {{represent}} a large predatory pressure for {{many species of}} wasps, including the Polistes versicolor.

25|$|The fetials were {{a college}} of 20 men {{devoted to the}} {{religious}} administration of international affairs of state. Their task was to preserve <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> fetial law (ius fetiale), {{a complex set of}} procedures aimed at ensuring the protection of the gods in Rome's relations with foreign states. Iuppiter Lapis is the god under whose protection they act, and whom the chief fetial (pater patratus) invokes in the rite concluding a treaty. If a declaration of war ensues, the fetial calls upon Jupiter and Quirinus, the heavenly, earthly and chthonic gods as witnesses of any potential violation of the ius. He can then declare war within 33 days.|$|E
25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E

25|$|A {{flat tax}} system and income taxes overall are not {{inherently}} border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported {{to a foreign}} country (see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price). Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> tax component on imports. The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would impact the global competitiveness of a country. However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed Border Tax Equity Act in the U.S. attempts this). Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit {{is a violation of}} the World Trade Organization agreement. Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally.|$|E
25|$|Another {{practice}} {{was the use}} of pigeons when treating swellings. Swellings which were white in appearance and deep were unlikely to break and must be anointed with Oil of Lillies or Camomil. Once the swelling rises to a head and is red in appearance and not deep in the flesh, it can be broken {{with the use of a}} feather from a young pigeon's tail. The feather's fundament was held to the swelling and would draw out the venom. However, if the swelling dropped and became black in appearance since it had taken in coldness, the physician had to be cautious when drawing the cold from the swelling. If it was too late to prevent, the physician would take the young pigeon, cut her open from breast to back, break her open <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> pigeon (while still alive) over the cold swelling. The cupping therapy was an alternative method which was heated and then placed over the swellings. Once the sore was broken, the physician would apply Mellilot Plaister with Linimentum Arcei and heal the sore with digence.|$|E
25|$|On Tatooine, {{there is}} a droid factory that the Galactic Empire has set up, So the {{rebellion}} sends C-3PO and R2-D2 and you, a rebel agent disguised as a Jawa to complete missions leading to the secret droid factory and to reprogram the evil droid army, but first, you must win the trust of your fellow Jawas. To proceed to the droid factory, the player must complete eight training missions and four top-secret missions with task-specific requirements, Such as 'Droid must be magnetic, Droid {{must be able to}} see in the dark, or Droid must weigh less than 100 kilograms. This allows you to complete the mission. Through experiential learning, players learn about <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> scientific principles of energy, force, light, engineering, and magnetism. In addition, the game encourages players to apply math, logic, and critical thinking skills. The game contains 87 droid parts which can be combined in 25 million different combinations for manufacturing. In the Jawa Droid Workshop, players can paint and name their creations, and make them dance, while a holographic design grid lets players have a 360 degree view of their work in progress. In in-game InDex provided players with encyclopedic explanations on the science used in the game to help players; it could also link to the internet for access to further links.|$|E

500|$|Just {{before his}} death, Delius {{prepared}} a codicil to his will whereby the royalties on future performances {{of his music}} {{would be used to}} support an annual concert of works by young composers. Delius died before this provision could be legally effected; [...] Fenby says that Beecham then persuaded Jelka in her own will to abandon the concerts idea <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> royalties towards the editing and recording of Delius's main works. After Jelka's death in 1935 the Delius Trust was established, to supervise this task. As stipulated in Jelka's will, the Trust operated largely under Beecham's direction. After Beecham's death in 1961 advisers were appointed to assist the trustees, and in 1979 the administration of the Trust was taken over by the Musicians' Benevolent Fund. Over the years the Trust's objectives have been extended so that it can promote the music of other composers who were Delius's contemporaries. The Trust is a co-sponsor of the [...] Royal Philharmonic Society's Composition Prize for young composers.|$|E
