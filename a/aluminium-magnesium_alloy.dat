50|$|Many {{standard}} magnesium alloys {{are easily}} welded by gas or resistance-welding equipment, but cannot be cut with an oxygen torch. Magnesium alloys are not welded to other metals, because brittle inter-metallic compounds may form, {{or because the}} combination of metals may promote corrosion. Where two or more parts are welded together, their compositions must be the same. Soldering of magnesium alloys is feasible only for plugging surface defects in parts. The solders are even more corrosive than with aluminium, and the parts should never be required to withstand stress. Riveted joints in magnesium alloy structures usually employ aluminium or <b>aluminium-magnesium</b> <b>alloy</b> rivets. Magnesium rivets are not often used because they must be driven when hot. The rivet holes should be drilled, especially in heavy sheet and extruded sections, since punching tends to give a rough edge to the hole and to cause stress concentrations.|$|E

The bomb consisted of a hollow body made from <b>aluminium-magnesium</b> <b>alloy</b> with a cast iron/steel nose, and filled with thermite incendiary pellets. It was capable of burning for up to ten minutes. There was also a high explosive version and delayed high explosive versions (2-4 minutes) which were designed to kill rescuers and firefighters.

5000|$|The HBR {{was first}} {{introduced}} as the [...] "DB Coach" [...] at the 1954 Paris Salon, with production beginning in January 1955. An earlier prototype with a body made of Duralinox (an <b>aluminium-magnesium</b> <b>alloy)</b> had been shown at the 1953 Paris Salon, but productionising the car took some time. The early Chausson designs received retractable headlamps and often the front portion of the roof is plexiglass. This plexiglass sunroof, with a removable inner cover, continued to be available throughout the HBR's life. Chausson built the fibreglass body; this was considered an experience-gaining effort and DB was charged a very modest per-unit price. The first hundred interim cars were built by Chausson, after which, experiment over, they sold the tooling to Deutsch and Bonnet themselves. They in turn turned the equipment over to another bodybuilding company which proceeded to sell the finished bodies to DB, meaning DB {{got into the car}} manufacturing business at a minimal cost.
