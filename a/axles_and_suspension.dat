50|$|A {{short-lived}} Sherpa 200 derived Kit Car {{produced by}} Sherpley Motors of Loughborough was manufactured briefly between 1997 and 2007, first being reported in Which Kit of October 1997. The kit was engineered to loosely resemble a vintage Bentley. The early Speed Six design just used Sherpa <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension,</b> fitted to a custom chassis and mated to an engine of buyer's choice before being fitted with an Aluminium and fiberglass fabricated body; the later Speed Four model used the complete Sherpa 200 chassis and running gear (and occasionally engine) to {{enable it to}} pass the stricter SVA rules imposed after 1999. The vehicle did not prove to be popular, and only 17 examples of the Sherpley were manufactured between these dates; the last one known to be sold still in kit form was advertised on eBay in 2013 prior to being sold privately for an undisclosed sum.|$|E
5000|$|To combat {{these issues}} the Railway Clearing House (an {{organisation}} originally {{set up to}} share out revenue from joint services between companies) introduced minimum standards for private owner wagons in 1887. Companies that were signed up to the RCH refused to allow wagons that {{did not meet the}} standards in their trains, although there was a lengthy grace period for owners to upgrade or replace their older wagons. New and stricter standards were introduced by the RCH in 1909 which required hydraulic buffers and oil-lubricated bearings as well as numerous other details {{in the construction of the}} frame, brakes, <b>axles,</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> that made the RCH's design the basis for virtually every British mineral and goods wagon for the next 30 years. Wagons that complied with the standards carried a plate saying 'RCH'. Although the 1909 design standards were supposed to be fully enforced by 1914 the advent of World War I meant that they were suspended and many non-compliant wagons actually remained in service until well after the Grouping of 1921.|$|E

50|$|On September 13, 2007, at the Defence Systems and Equipment International trade show, Chrysler LLC {{unveiled}} a Wrangler Unlimited version designed for military use dubbed the J8. The unarmored Jeep J8 {{is equipped with}} larger brakes, <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> components than the civilian version and has a payload capacity of 1,339 kg (2,952 lb). The J8 also differs from the civilian model by utilizing heavy-duty rear leaf springs for carrying heavier payloads. The Jeep J8 {{is powered by a}} VM 2.8-liter (169 CID) four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine that produces 118 kW (158 hp) and 400 N·m (295 lbf·ft) of torque, providing towing capability of up to 3,500 kg (7,700 lb). The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The J8 also features a unique air-intake system with special filtration and a hood-mounted snorkel that enables the J8 to wade in water up to 762 mm (30 in) deep and tackle sandstorm conditions for up to five hours. Available as a two-door with an extended pickup bed for personnel or equipment transport, or a four-door multipurpose vehicle, it may be produced with numerous vehicle-body and seating configurations in either right-hand- or left-hand-drive. Targeted for use by the militaries in overseas markets, the J8 is not available in the United States because it will not meet U.S. emissions requirements. The J8 will be produced in Egypt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} design of walking beam pendel axle {{suspension}} system. This <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> systems are mainly required for transportation of heavy duty and Over Dimension Consignment (ODC) cargo, which is exceeding legal limit {{in terms of}} length, width and height. Presently, in Indian transportation industry, ODC movement growth rate has increased in transportation of bridge sections (pre-cast beams), transformers, heavy machineries, boilers, gas turbines, windmill blades etc. However, current Indian standard road transport vehicles are facing lot of service and maintenance issues due to non availability of suitable axle and suspension to carry the ODC cargoes. This in turn will lead to increased number of road accidents, bridge collapse and delayed deliveries, which finally result in higher operating cost. Understanding these requirements, this work was carried out. These axles and suspensions are designed for optimum self – weight with maximum payload carrying capacity with better road stability...|$|E
50|$|The 1952 Ford Taunus had {{received}} a stylish new body, but its engine was little changed from the (originally British designed) unit fitted in 1935 to the Ford Eifel and other underpinnings, including its rear <b>axle</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension,</b> were little changed {{from those of the}} 1939 Ford Taunus G93A. By contrast, the P4, originally designed for large scale manufacture in North America, was technically innovative, featuring a newly developed compact V4 engine which would provide the basis for engines designed and produced by Ford of Germany for twenty years. The Taunus P4 was also a front-wheel drive design at a time when other German auto-makers were still avoiding what was then seen as an unnecessarily complicated lay-out.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on the modeling and simulation of a multi-degree of freedom 3 -axle rigid truck. The linear model features cab and seat suspensions, rigid live <b>axles,</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> geometries. The Lagrange 2 ̆ 7 s equation was used to obtain the motion equations and system matrices, and the numerical central difference method was adopted to obtain the system responses subject to sinusoidal road excitations, programmed in MATLAB. Furthermore, the eigenvectors, the seat bounce acceleration, the maximum dynamic tyre loads and the maximum suspension dynamic deflections were studied. ADAMS/View was then used to conveniently reexamine the model in the virtual environment as validation. Some advanced simulations such as sweep sine and triangular bump excitation were also conducted in ADAMS. As a result, some very important characteristics of this particular truck were revealed {{which can be used}} either to better understand the vehicle dynamic performance or to improve the original design specifications...|$|E

50|$|Compared to the {{production}} BMW E90 model, the <b>axles</b> <b>and</b> the <b>suspension</b> geometry has been changed significantly. The new axles design include a camber setting that could be adjusted independently of any other settings parameters, such as roll center and track.

The track width and camber were increased, while the wheel carrier and bearing were carried over from {{the production}} model.|$|R
50|$|Obviously any four wheel vehicle needs {{suspension}} {{for both the}} front wheels <b>and</b> the rear <b>suspension,</b> but in two wheel drive vehicles these can be very different configuration.

For rear-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has many constraints and the development of the superior but more expensive independent suspension layout has been difficult. Four-wheel drive often have suspensions that are similar for both the front and rear wheels.|$|R

5000|$|In 1957, Yenko {{set up a}} {{performance}} shop for Chevrolet vehicles. The customers could either order high performance parts or have their car modified by Yenko's mechanics. The first popular aftermarket car made by Yenko came in 1965, {{in the form of}} a modified version of the Chevrolet Corvair. Named [...] "The Stinger", these Corvairs were modified with a variety of different body accessories, engine upgrades that produced outputs of up to 240 hp, as well as upgrades in steering, transmissions, <b>suspension,</b> <b>and</b> positraction differentials. A total of 185 Stingers are believed to have been built between 1965 and 1967. In 1967, when Chevrolet began selling the Camaro, Yenko began to modify SS Camaros by replacing the original L-78 396 in³ (6.5 L) engine with a Chevrolet Corvette's L-72 427 in³ (7.0 L) and upgrade the rear <b>axle</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspensions.</b> He also modified other Chevrolet vehicles like Chevelle and Nova by fitting them with L-72 engines.
