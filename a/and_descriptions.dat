5|$|An astronomical text {{recovered}} from Tomb no.3 in Mawangdui contains images <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> of 29 different comets.

This text can be solidly dated as being prior to 168 BC, the date assigned to the tomb. It {{may be associated with}} a similar astronomical text from the same tomb, which details planetary motions for the seventy years ending 177 BC.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the novel during a trip to Brittany arranged by a family friend in 1828. Intrigued by the people and atmosphere of the region, he began collecting notes <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> for later use. After publishing an Avertissement for the novel, he released three editions – each of them revised significantly. The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles as he wrote and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800.|$|E
5|$|David's {{first five}} books, {{particularly}} the earlier works, contained recipes interspersed with literary quotation <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{of people and}} places that inspired her.

Her interest in the history of cooking led her in her later years to research the history of spices, baking, and ice.|$|E

40|$|Description grammars {{represent}} a formalism for generating verbal descriptions of designs, {{used in conjunction}} with shape grammars. A description grammar constitutes a set of description rules that define a language of descriptions. A description grammar interpreter implements the mechanisms to interpret <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>description</b> rules, apply description rules to descriptions to derive new <b>descriptions,</b> <b>and</b> generate the members of the corresponding language of descriptions. In this paper, we argue the need {{for the development of a}} (general) description grammar interpreter, offer a formal notation for <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>description</b> rules, describe the representation <b>and</b> implementation of <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>description</b> rules, <b>and</b> provide an example implemented using the description grammar interpreter.

It gives more details about the Clans previously unrevealed in the main series. Cats of the Clans, featuring illustrations <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the cats, was released on 24 June 2008.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Brigham Young, Chamberlin was {{employed}} as a lecturer and George Leib Harrison Foundation {{research fellow at the}} University of Pennsylvania from 1911 to 1913. From March 1913 to December 31, 1925, he was the Curator of Arachnids, Myriapods, and Worms at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, where many of his scientific contributions were made. Here his publications included surveys of all known millipedes of Central America and the West Indies; <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> of animals collected by the Canadian Arctic Expedition (1913–1916); by Stanford and Yale expeditions to South America; and by various expeditions of the USS Albatross. He was elected a member of the American Society of Naturalists and the American Society of Zoologists in 1914, and in 1919 served as second vice-president of the Entomological Society of America. He served as a technical expert for the U.S. Horticultural Board and U.S. Biological Survey from 1923 until the mid 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E

5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E
5|$|More {{information}} {{is known about}} the looms used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture, compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures <b>and</b> <b>descriptions,</b> many pertaining to silk. It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to be far superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the draw loom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades.|$|E

5|$|Some critics, {{including}} Murray Rothbard, {{have sought}} to show that Keynes had sympathy with Nazism, {{and a number of}} writers described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits <b>and</b> <b>descriptions,</b> some of which can be characterized as antisemitic, others as philosemitic. Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current {{at the time that he}} accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.|$|E
5|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} {{renewed interest}} in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting {{the large number of}} mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog <b>and</b> <b>descriptions</b> on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E
