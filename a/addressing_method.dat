2500|$|Bistable LCDs do {{not require}} {{continuous}} refreshing. Rewriting is only required for picture information changes. In 1984 HA van Sprang and AJSM de Vaan invented an STN type display that could be operated in a bistable mode, enabling extreme high resolution images up to 4000 lines or more using only low voltages. Since a pixel however may be either in an on-state or in an off state at the moment new information needs to be written to that particular pixel, the <b>addressing</b> <b>method</b> of these bistable displays is rather complex, reason why these displays did not {{made it to the}} market. That changed when in the 2010 [...] "zero-power" [...] (bistable) LCDs became available. Potentially, passive-matrix addressing can be used with devices if their write/erase characteristics are suitable, which was the case for ebooks showing still pictures only. After a page is written to the display, the display may be cut from the power while that information remains readable. This has the advantage that such ebooks may be operated long time on just a small battery only. High-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the picture information are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{is used to}} {{describe}} two different concepts. The first is [...] "dynamic DNS updating" [...] which refers to systems {{that are used to}} update traditional DNS records without manual editing. These mechanisms are explained in RFC 2136, and use the TSIG mechanism to provide security. The second kind of dynamic DNS permits lightweight and immediate updates often using an update client, which do not use the RFC2136 standard for updating DNS records. These clients provide a persistent <b>addressing</b> <b>method</b> for devices that change their location, configuration or IP address frequently.|$|E
50|$|Multicast is {{a network}} <b>addressing</b> <b>method</b> for the {{delivery}} of information {{to a group of}} destinations simultaneously using the most efficient strategy to deliver the messages over each link of the network only once, creating copies only when the links to the multiple destinations split (typically Network switches and routers). However, like the User Datagram Protocol, multicast does not guarantee {{the delivery of}} a message stream. Messages may be dropped, delivered multiple times, or delivered out of order. A reliable multicast protocol, like PGM, adds the ability for receivers to detect lost and/or out-of-order messages and take corrective action (similar in principle to TCP), resulting in a gap-free, in-order message stream.|$|E

5000|$|A DOS {{extender}} is {{a program}} that [...] "extends" [...] DOS so that programs running in protected mode can transparently interface with the underlying MS-DOS API. This was necessary {{because many of the}} functions provided by DOS require 16-bit segment and offset addresses pointing to memory locations within the first 640 kilobytes of memory. Protected mode, however, uses an incompatible <b>addressing</b> <b>method</b> where the segment registers (now called selectors) are used to point to an entry in the Global Descriptor Table which describes the characteristics of the segment. The two methods of addressing are mutually exclusive, with the processor having to make costly switches to real (or V86) mode to service non-protected mode requests.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{hard drives}} didn't come with an {{embedded}} disk controller; a separate controller card was used, and {{the operating system}} had to know the exact physical [...] "geometry" [...] of the drive behind the controller to use it. As the geometry became more complicated and drive sizes grew over time, the CHS <b>addressing</b> <b>method</b> became restrictive. Since late 1980s, hard drives begun shipping with an embedded disk controller that had good knowledge of the physical geometry; they would report a false geometry to the computer, e.g. {{a larger number of}} heads than actually present, to gain more addressable space. These logical CHS values would be translated by the controller, thus CHS addressing no longer corresponded to any physical attributes of the drive.|$|E
50|$|A {{critical}} {{influence on}} performance {{of an open}} addressing hash table is the load factor; that is, {{the proportion of the}} slots in the array that are used. As the load factor increases towards 100%, the number of probes that may be required to find or insert a given key rises dramatically. Once the table becomes full, probing algorithms may even fail to terminate. Even with good hash functions, load factors are normally limited to 80%. A poor hash function can exhibit poor performance even at very low load factors by generating significant clustering, esp. with the simplest linear <b>addressing</b> <b>method.</b> Generally typical load factors with most open addressing methods are 50%, whilst separate chaining typically can use up to 100%.What causes hash functions to cluster is not well understood , and it is easy to unintentionally write a hash function which causes severe clustering.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} four decades, two address-matching <b>methods,</b> the street-based <b>address</b> {{geocoding}} <b>method</b> and address-point-matching method, {{have been used to}} identify geographical coordinates from postal addresses. However, street-based <b>address</b> geocoding <b>methods</b> developed for the US addressing system are not universally applicable in developing a single-portal geocoding middleware for worldwide Internet-based geographic information systems applications. Problems also exist with address-point matching especially in its capability to identify features and incorporate 3 D locational data from 3 D addresses for analysis of large public buildings, shopping centers or metro-subways, that exist in urban environments. To alleviate these problems, this paper details two alternative address-matching <b>methods,</b> an area-based <b>address</b> geocoding <b>method</b> and a 3 D <b>address</b> geocoding <b>method.</b> The area-based <b>address</b> geocoding <b>method</b> is a 2 D positioning method based on a 2 D area-based address-matching technique. The 3 D <b>address</b> geocoding <b>method</b> is based on a universally applicable 3 D address-geocoding technique. To elaborate, this paper introduces (1) �a BlockObject model and designs reference databases for an area-based address system, (2) �a 3 D indoor network model representing the internal structures of urban environment, and (3) �a 3 D address geocoding algorithm based on a 3 D indoor geocoding method. To illustrate the benefits of the 3 D address-positioning method, this paper implements 3 D indoor navigation to define optimal routes within a single building. ...|$|R

40|$|LUN value meaning {{unspecified}} LU PROBLEM: In management applications (and possibly elsewhere), {{the need}} sometimes arises to indicate explicitly {{that the value}} for a parameter is not specified. It is not always practical to add a flag for each parameter indicating this situation.

PROPOSAL: It was originally thought to use an otherwise reserved LUN to indicate that a real LUN is not specified; however, this risks that the reserved LUN may someday be defined for another purpose. It is proposed in the following to define a LUN that references no entity whatsoever.
