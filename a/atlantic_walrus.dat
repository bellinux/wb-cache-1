5|$|The {{much smaller}} {{population}} of Atlantic walruses ranges from the Canadian Arctic, across Greenland, Svalbard, {{and the western}} part of Arctic Russia. There are eight hypothetical subpopulations of walruses, based largely on their geographical distribution and movements: five west of Greenland and three east of Greenland. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walrus</b> once ranged south to Sable Island, Nova Scotia, and as late as the eighteenth century was found in large numbers in the greater Gulf of St. Lawrence region, sometimes in colonies of up to 7,000 to 8,000 individuals. This population was nearly eradicated by commercial harvest; their current numbers, though difficult to estimate, probably remain below 20,000.

5|$|The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) {{is a large}} flippered {{marine mammal}} with a {{discontinuous}} distribution about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. The walrus is the only living species in the family Odobenidae and genus Odobenus. This species is subdivided into three subspecies: the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walrus</b> (O. r. rosmarus) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific walrus (O. r. divergens) which lives in the Pacific Ocean, and O. r. laptevi, which lives in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{population}} size of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses</b> (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) is depleted relative to historical abundance levels. In Svalbard, centuries of over-exploitation brought the walrus herds to {{the verge of}} extinction, and such bottlenecks may have caused loss of genetic variation. To address this for Svalbard walruses, mitochondrial haplotypes of historical walruses from two major haul-out sites, Bjørnøya and Håøya, within the Archipelago were explored using bone samples from animals killed during the peak period of harvesting. Results Using ancient DNA methodologies, the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND 1) gene, the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene, and the control region (CR) were targeted for 15 specimens from Bjørnøya (of which five were entirely negative) and 9 specimens from Håøya (of which one was entirely negative). While ND 1 and COI sequences were obtained {{for only a few}} samples, the CR delivered the most comprehensive data set, and the average genetic distance among historic Svalbard samples was 0. 0028 (SD =  0. 0023). Conclusions The CR sequences from the historical samples appear to be nested among contemporary <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses,</b> and no distinct mitochondrial haplogroups were identified in the historical samples that may have been lost during the periods of extensive hunting. However, given the low sample size and poor phylogenetic resolution it cannot be excluded that such haplogroups existed...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{management}} of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses</b> (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) past and present in the four range states—Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia—which have permanent populations of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses.</b> Populations in all four countries have been depleted, although the extent of depletion is not well known. Inuit in Arctic Canada and Greenland hunt <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses</b> for subsistence while they have been protected at Svalbard (Norway) since 1952 and in the western Russian Arctic since 1956. Since {{the second half of}} the 20 th Century Canada and Greenland have increased protection of their walrus. Generally the number of walruses landed in Canada is governed by the number of hunters and/or people in the settlement and not by stock-specific quotas. Although quotas have been set in few communities, it is not known if they are adequate to prevent overhunting. A quota system for walrus hunting in Greenland began in 2006. The current control system is largely effective in ensuring the quotas are applied and that reporting is correct. Greenland currently sets quotas based on recommendations from scientific assessments using recent population estimates to allow population growth from a depleted population.   A challenge with respect to managing walrus hunting remains the variable and sometimes high rates of lost animals. Since the 1960 s changes in socio-economics in hunting areas of Arctic Canada and Greenland (and the use of snowmobiles instead of dog sleds in Canada) have led to a general decrease in interest in hunting of walruses and reduced harvest on walrus stocks in these countries. Although there is an active ongoing cooperation between Canada and Greenland scientists regarding assessments of shared populations of walruses currently there is no formal agreement between the two range states on co-management of shared stocks. Protection of walrus from other anthropogenic impacts generally focusses on large-scale industrial activity. The level of protection afforded to walrus habitat in many areas depends entirely on the rigor with which the Environmental Impact Assessments are conducted. Basic information on walrus such as numbers and stock discreteness is often lacking and sufficient lead-time is required to collect baseline data. Moreover, although most environmental protection legislation considers ‘cumulative impacts’, practical application remains problematic. The effectiveness of environmental protection regulations depends on industry compliance and the management authorities’ ability to enforce compliance. Because walrus are found in remote locations, enforcement remains a challenge. Increased human activity allowed by the current change in distribution and quality of arctic sea ice poses new threats to walrus if not well regulated. International agreements have varying importance for management within and among member states. Regulations governing international trade serve to identify illegally obtained products and to encourage range states to have a sustainable quota system. International cooperation in information sharing has had clear benefits for management of walruses in the past. The maintenance and expansion of these international efforts will improve {{the management of}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses</b> in the future...|$|R

These dates coincide with the hypothesis derived from fossils that the walrus evolved from a tropical or subtropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic.

40|$|Until {{recently}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses</b> (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) {{have been}} subject to relatively intense exploitation in West Greenland. Animals in this stock have also been hunted in Nunavut/Canada. However, the demographic identity of these animals and their connection with walruses in neighbouring areas is poorly resolved, hampering the determination of sustainable harvest levels. It has been suggested that walruses in West Greenland are genetically linked with walruses at SE Baffin Island (Canada) where they are also hunted for subsistence purposes. To determine the relationship(s) between walruses in these areas we conducted a genetic analysis including recent samples from West Greenland, Southeast Baffin Island in western Davis Strait, Hudson Strait in Canada and Northwest Greenland in northern Baffin Bay. Seventeen microsatellite markers were applied to all samples. Walruses in West Greenland and at Southeast Baffin Island did not differ from each other and therefore may be regarded as belonging to the same stock. However, walruses in these two areas differed genetically from both Northwest Greenland and Hudson Strait walruses. These findings support (1) that there are subunits within the range of walruses in the Hudson Strait-Davis Strait-Baffin Bay region and (2) that walruses along E Baffin Island and W Greenland constitute a common population that receive some influx from Hudson Strait. Thus, sustainable catch levels in Southeast Baffin Island (Nunavut) and in West Greenland must be set in light of the finding that they belong to the same stock, which is exploited in these two areas. This requires Canadian-Greenlandic co-management of the W Greenland-SE Baffin Island walrus stock. </p...|$|R
40|$|Walruses, Odobenus rosmarus, play a {{key role}} in the Arctic ecosystem, {{including}} northern Indigenous communities, which are reliant upon walruses for aspects of their diet and culture. However, walruses face varied environmental threats including rising sea-water temperatures and decreasing ice cover. An underappreciated threat may be the large amount of solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) that continues to reach the Arctic as a result of ozone loss. UV has been shown to negatively affect whales. Like whales, walrus skin is unprotected by fur, but in contrast, walruses spend long periods of time hauled-out on land. In this study, we combined the results of histological analyses of skin sections from five <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses,</b> Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus, collected in Nunavik (Northern Quebec, Canada) with qualitative data obtained through the interviews of 33 local walrus hunters and Inuit Elders. Histological analyses allowed us to explore UV-induced cellular lesions and interviews with experienced walrus hunters and Elders helped us to study the incidences and temporal changes of UV-induced gross lesions in walruses. At the microscopic scale, we detected a range of skin abnormalities consistent with UV damage. However, currently such UV effects do not seem to be widely observed at the whole-animal level (i. e., absence of skin blistering, erythema, eye cataract) by individuals interviewed. Although walruses may experience skin damage under normal everyday UV exposure, the long-term data from local walrus hunters and Inuit Elders did not report a relation between the increased sun radiation secondary to ozone loss and walrus health...|$|R

40|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses</b> (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) {{belonging}} to the Baffin Bay subpopulation occur year round in the North Water polynya (NOW) between NW Greenland and eastern Ellesmere Island (Canada).

During the open-water period NW Greenland is virtually devoid of walruses which concentrate along eastern and southern Ellesmere Island {{at this time of the}} year. To determine the abundance of walruses in the NOW area, aerial surveys were conducted in August of 1999, 2008, and 2009. In July 2009, nine satellite-linked transmitters were deployed in nearby Kane Basin. Surveys on 9 and 20 August 2009 along eastern Ellesmere Island were the most extensive and were augmented with concomitant data on haul-out and at water surface activity from three (1 F, 2 M) of the nine tags that were still functioning. We therefore focus on the 2009 surveys. Walruses were observed on the ice and in water primarily in Buchanan Bay and Princess Marie Bay where the remaining functional tags were located. The Minimum Counted population (MCP) was 571 on 20 August. Adjusting the MCP of walruses on ice for those not hauled out, the estimate of abundance of walruses in the Baffin Bay stock was 1, 251 (CV= 1. 00, 95 % CI = 1, 226) when adjusted by the proportion of tags ‘dry’ at the time of the survey and 1, 249 (CV= 1. 12, 95 % CI = 1, 370) when adjusted by the average time tags were dry.

40|$|Abstract Background Direct {{observations}} of underwater behaviour of free-living marine mammals are rare. This {{is particularly true}} for large and potentially dangerous species such as the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus). Walruses are highly specialised predators on benthic invertebrates – especially bivalves. The unique feeding niche of walruses has led to speculations as to their underwater foraging behaviour. Based on {{observations of}} walruses in captivity and signs of predation left on the sea floor by free-living walruses, various types of feeding behaviour have been suggested in the literature. In this study, however, the underwater feeding behaviour of wild adult male <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses</b> (O. r. rosmarus) is documented {{for the first time}} in their natural habitat by scuba-divers. The video recordings indicated a predisposition for use of the right front flipper during feeding. This tendency towards dextrality was explored further by examining a museum collection of extremities of walrus skeletons. Results During July and August 2001, twelve video-recordings of foraging adult male walruses were made in Young Sound (74 ° 18 N; 20 ° 15 V), Northeast Greenland. The recordings did not allow for differentiation among animals, however based on notes by the photographer at least five different individuals were involved. The walruses showed four different foraging behaviours; removing sediment by beating the right flipper, removing sediment by beating the left flipper, removing sediment by use of a water-jet from the mouth and rooting through sediment with the muzzle. There was a significant preference for using right flipper over left flipper during foraging. Measurements of the dimensions of forelimbs from 23 walrus skeletons revealed that the length of the right scapula, humerus, and ulna was significantly greater than that of the left, supporting our field observations of walruses showing a tendency of dextrality in flipper use. Conclusion We suggest that the four feeding behaviours observed are typical of walruses in general, although walruses in other parts of their range may have evolved other types of feeding behaviour. While based on small sample sizes both the underwater observations and skeletal measurements suggest lateralized limb use, which is the first time this has been reported in a pinniped. </p...|$|R

40|$|To date no problem-free method {{exists for}} the {{immobilisation}} of free‑ranging walruses (Odobenus rosmarus). In the period 1989 - 2001, 69 immobilisations with etorphine HCl were performed by remote darting of 41 individual free-ranging adult <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walruses</b> (O. r. rosmarus), with body masses 633  ‑  1883  kg, as a rerequisite for the attachment of radio tracking and dive recording instruments, and for studies of metabolism. Ten individuals were immobilised several times. We present data on these 69 immobilisations {{and evaluate the}} method. Full immobilisation was achieved in 58 cases (84  %). The animals were insufficiently restrained in 6 cases (9  %) and 5 animals died (7  %) following the immobilisation. The animals were fully immobilised and approachable after 5  min (n =  38, range = 1. 9 ‑ 12. 4 min, SD = 2. 2) with a dose of etorphine of 6. 1  μg/kg (range 2. 4  ‑  12. 6  μg /kg, SD =  2. 4). Induction time was negatively correlated with the dosage of etorphine. Etorphine-induced apnoea lasted 13. 7  min (n = 36, range  17. 0  ‑ 26. 7  min, SD = 5. 1) and was reversed by multiple doses of the antagonist diprenorphine HCl. The first dose of antagonist of 12. 2  mg (n = 39, range  6. 0  ‑ 21. 0  mg, SD = 3. 5) was administered 8. 4  min (n = 38, range  4. 7  ‑ 18. 0  min, SD = 2. 8) after injection of the agonist. The total dose of diprenorphine per animal ranged between 7. 7 and 41. 7  μg/kg (n = 31, mean = 17. 2  μg/kg, SD = 7. 5). For some animals blood pH values were measured following the apnoea and reached low levels (min pH 6. 8). For animals that were immobilised several times there were no indications of changed sensitivity to etorphine as reflected in unchanged induction times. Mortalities could neither {{be related to the}} doses of agonist and antagonist, nor to the times of administration of the drugs. From this (n = 69) and other (n = 103) studies involving etorphine immobilisation of <b>walruses</b> (both <b>Atlantic</b> and Pacific) the overall success rate is 83  % (8  % casualty rate). We conclude that the combination etorphine‑ diprenorphine is suitable for both single and multiple immobilisations of walruses provided that (a) a casualty rate of 7 - 8 % is acceptable (b) the antagonist diprenorphine is administered fast and well into a tissue with good blood irrigation, and (c) the animal is promptly intubated endotracheally to facilitate the restoration of breathing after drug-induced apnoea...|$|R

Here, we assessed the individual stereotypy of both mother and calf barks recorded in the wild by measuring frequency and temporal acoustic parameters. Both discriminant function and artiWcial neural network analyses resulted in high correct classiWcation rates, underlying a well-deWned individual stereotypy in parame-ters related to frequency modulation and frequency values. Playback experiments showed that mothers were more responsive to the barks of their own calf than to those of unrelated young. Finally, propagation experiments revealed that barks propagate at greater distances over water surface than over ice, acoustic features such as frequency modula-tion and frequency spectrum being highly resistant to degra-dation during propagation. Thus, acoustic analysis and propagation experiments suggest that these frequency parameters might be the key acoustic features involved in the individual identiWcation process.

The Late Wisconsinan and Holocene {{record of}} the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walrus</b> is known from {{numerous}} collections of bones and tusks from Arctic Canada and south to North Carolina, {{as well as from}} many archaeological sites in the Arctic and Subarctic. In contrast, the Pacific walrus has no dated Late Wisconsinan or early Holocene record in North America, and it may have been displaced into the northwest Pacific at Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walrus</b> rapidly exploited newly deglaciated territory, moving northward from its LGM refugium and reaching the Bay of Fundy by 12 800 B. P., the Grand Banks by 12500 B. P., southern Labrador by 11 500 B. P., and the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) by 9700 B. P. Its southern range limit may have retracted to the Bay of Fundy by ca. 7500 B. P. Within the CAA, walrus remains cluster in two main age groups: 9700 to 8500 B. P. and 5000 to 4 / 3000 B. P. This pattern strongly resembles the distribution of bowhead whale radiocarbon ages from the same area, which suggests a common control by sea-ice conditions. Walrus remains occur in Indian culture archaeological sites as old as 7500 B. P. and, in some cases (Namu, British Columbia, and Mackinac Island, Michigan), they evidently represent long-distance human transport. They are much more common in Paleoeskimo and Neoeskimo culture sites. However, they occur in very low abundances, and generally as debitage, in sites older than Dorset (2500 B. P.). The walrus, therefore, may not have been hunted by early Paleoeskimos. Beginning with Early Dorset, walrus remains occur in definite diet-related contexts. Middle Dorset (2300 to 1500 B. P.) and late Thule (< 400 B. P.) sites are missing from the High Arctic, and there may be a similar gap in the middle Pre-Dorset (3400 to 2600 B. P.). Sea-ice condition...|$|E
40|$|There are few {{reports on}} nonmetabolic bone malformations in pinnipeds. One report [7] {{described}} vertebral deformity and osteonecrosis of hindlimb bone in a California sea lion (Zafophus cafifornianus); {{the main cause}} was probably tubercu-losis. Another report [2] described alveolitis and pulpitis of a canine tooth in a walrus. The few reports o n tumors in pinnipeds refer to soft tissues [l, 3 - 6, 81. Parts of the skeleton of an adult male <b>Atlantic</b> <b>walrus</b> (Odobenus odobenus) were recovered on a rocky beach in Cumberland Sound, Baffin Island, N. W. T., in August 1966. The bones found were skull, mandible, left scapula and humerus, several bones of the left manus, several ribs and vertebrae, and right tibia. There was {{a great amount of}} hypertrophic alveolar bony matter {{on both sides of the}} scapula (fig. 1). The hypertrophic bone structure was spongy superficially and lamellar in its depth. There were several cavities within the pathologic bony formation. Some cavities on the medial aspect of the scapula were large. The hypertrophic tissue was dome shaped and regular. Two left ribs, probably the fourth and the fifth or the fifth and the sixth, had hypertrophic bone formation o...|$|E
