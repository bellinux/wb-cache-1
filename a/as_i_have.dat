5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E

5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

But she did not; indeed, she sat herself down upon the stone at my side and covered her face with her hands <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done and began to weep <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done.

60|$|It was {{a startling}} likeness, and {{necessarily}} had a startling look.

60|$|There {{she stood}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left her, but now {{her eyes were}} fixed upon the ground and her face once more was {{brooding}} absently as though no such a man <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever been. It came into my mind that already she had forgotten me, the plaything of an hour, who had served her turn and been cast aside.|$|R

25|$|To-day we {{are living}} in what is the first {{genuinely}} pagan age—that is to say, there are so many people, particularly children, who never remember having heard hymns at their mother's knee, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> whose first tunes are from Radio One, and not from any hymn book; whose first acquaintance with their friends and relations and other people is not in the Sunday School or in the Church at all, as mine was.|$|E
25|$|Your honor, I {{feel that}} I {{have been convicted}} of violating an unjust statute.

25|$|Advocates for the {{homeless}} have developed various events, commemorations, and projects {{to raise awareness of}} the issue of homelessness. In 1987, the United Nations established a International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. In England, advocates founded an annual event named Homelessness Action Week.In Australia, NGOs have founded two main annual events: Homeless Persons' Week, and Youth Homelessness Matters Day. Some advocates have taken to social media to raise awareness with projects such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> A Name.|$|E
25|$|They {{are trying}} to persuade me to let my boy be inoculated with smallpox.

But for my part I leave the matter to the grace of God. It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in this world in which He placed it or {{to take it to}} Himself.|$|E
25|$|How the Other Half Lives sold {{well and}} was much quoted. Reviews were {{generally}} good, although some reviewers criticized it for oversimplifying and exaggerating. Riis attributed the success {{to a popular}} interest in social amelioration stimulated by William Booth's In Darkest England and the Way Out, and also to Ward McAllister's Society <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> Found It, {{a portrait of the}} moneyed class. The book encouraged imitations such as Darkness and Daylight; or, Lights and Shadows of New York Life (1892), which somehow appropriated Riis's own photographs.|$|E

25|$|Merleau-Ponty {{demonstrates}} a corporeity of consciousness {{as much as}} an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them. In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote: “Insofar <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> hands, feet; a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a way that I do not choose” (1962, p.440).|$|E
25|$|If Xerxes {{chose not}} to rush into a naval encounter, but instead kept his ships close to the shore and either stayed there or moved them towards the Peloponnese, victory would be his.

25|$|I {{have spent}} 70 {{years of study}} and travel in order to equip myself with {{information}} that would enable me to speak and write with authority on the course of world affairs.

Since I do not speak with political authority I have no means of communicating my conclusions except by putting them in print myself and distributing them in the most advantageous way that is available to a private citizen.|$|E
