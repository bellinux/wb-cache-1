40|$|Both {{microtubule}} destabilizer and stabilizer {{agents are}} important molecules in anticancer therapy. In particular, paclitaxel {{has been demonstrated}} to be effective {{for the treatment of}} ovarian, breast, and nonsmall cell lung carcinomas. It has been shown that emergence of resistance against this agent correlates with an increase in the relative abundance of tubulin isoform betaIII and that the more recently discovered IDN 5390 can be effectively used once resistance has emerged. In this paper, we analyze the binding modes of these <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents</b> to type I and III isoforms of beta-tubulin by computational methods. Our results are able to provide a molecular explanation of the experimental data. Using the same protocol, we could also show that no preference for any of the two isoforms can be detected for epothilone A, a potentially very interesting drug for which no data about the emergence of resistance is currently available. Our analysis provides structural insights about the recognition mode and the stabilization mechanism of these <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents</b> and provides useful suggestions for the design of more potent and selective <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryTaxol {{and other}} <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents</b> are {{frontline}} chemotherapy agents but the mechanisms responsible for patient benefit remain unclear. Following a genome-wide siRNA screen, we identified the oncogenic transcription factor Myc as a taxol sensitizer. Using time-lapse imaging to correlate mitotic behavior with cell fate, {{we show that}} Myc sensitizes cells to mitotic blockers and agents that accelerate mitotic progression. Myc achieves this by upregulating a cluster of redundant pro-apoptotic BH 3 -only proteins and suppressing pro-survival Bcl-xL. Gene expression analysis of breast cancers indicates that taxane responses correlate positively with Myc and negatively with Bcl-xL. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-xL restores apoptosis in Myc-deficient cells. These results open up opportunities for biomarkers and combination therapies that could enhance traditional and second-generation <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|With several {{successful}} anticancer {{drugs on}} the market and numerous compounds in clinical developments, <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents</b> represent an important category of anticancer agents. However, clinical utility of the tubulin-binding agents is somewhat limited due to multiple drug resistance (MDR), poor pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index. Another significant limitation of current modulators of tubulin dynamics is their marginal clinical efficacy. While demonstrating impessive in vitro activity, majority of tubulin-binding agents have not displayed antitumor activity in clinic. This fact is usually attributed to poor balance between efficacy and toxicity, so-called therapeutic window. It is related to multiple features of a drug including pharmacokinetics, off-target toxicity and other poorly recognized factors. In addition, drug efflux pumps play a role in tumors developing resistance to the tubulin-binding drugs. There is ongoing need for the modulators of other intracellular targets that result in the same anti-mitotic effect without adverse effects of “traditional ” tubulin binders. For example, kinesins, microtubule motor proteins, play critical role in the mitotic spindle function and represent potential targets for the discovery of novel cancer therapiesi. Proteins that control cellular progression through mitosis include kinases and cysteine proteases, namely Polo, Bub, Mad, Aurora, Cdk 1, separase and othersii. Historically, researches focused on two classes of <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents</b> (Fig. 1). The first class includes compounds that bind reversibly to tubulin and prevent microtubule assembly and disassembly (modulators of MT dynamics). The second class features molecules that regulate mitotic events vicariously by interacting with specific intracellular targets such as mitotic kinesins, kinases, separase, etc. Fig. 1.

50|$|Brentuximab vedotin {{consists}} of the chimeric monoclonal antibody brentuximab (cAC10, which targets the cell-membrane protein CD30) linked with maleimide attachment groups, cathepsin cleavable linkers (valine-citrulline), and para-aminobenzylcarbamate spacers to three to five units of the <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agent</b> monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE, reflected by the 'vedotin' in the drug's name). The peptide-based linker bonds the antibody to the cytotoxic compound in a stable manner so the drug is not easily released from the antibody under physiologic conditions to help prevent toxicity to healthy cells and ensure dosage efficiency. The peptide antibody-drug bond facilitates rapid and efficient drug cleavage inside target tumor cell. The antibody cAC10 part of the drug binds to CD30 which often occurs on diseased cells but rarely on normal tissues.The antibody portion of the drug attaches to CD30 {{on the surface of}} malignant cells, delivering MMAE which is responsible for the anti-tumour activity. Once bound, brentuximab vedotin is internalised by endocytosis and thus selectively taken up by targeted cells. The vesicle containing the drug is fused with lysosomes and lysosomal cysteine proteases, particularly cathepsin B, start to break down valine-citrulline linker and MMAE is no longer bound to the antibody and is released directly into the tumor environment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Microtubules {{have been}} one of the most {{effective}} targets for the development of anticancer agents. Cancer cells treated by these agents are characterized by cell arrest at G 2 /M phase. Microtubule-targeting drugs are, therefore, referred to as <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents.</b> However, the clinical application of the current antimitotic drugs is hampered by emerging drug resistance which is the major cause of cancer treatment failure. The clinical success of antimitotic drugs and emerging drug resistance has prompted a search for new <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents,</b> especially those with novel mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to determine whether microtubules can be S- glutathionylated in cancer cells and whether the glutathionylation will lead to microtubule dysfunction and cell growth inhibition. The study will determine whether microtubule S- glutathionylation can be a novel approach for <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents.</b> Methods 2 -Acetylamino- 3 -[4 -(2 -acetylamino- 2 -carboxyethylsulfanylcarbonylamino) phenyl carbamoylsulfanyl]propionic acid (2 -AAPA) was used as a tool to induce microtubule S -glutathionylation. UACC- 62 cells, a human melanoma cell line, were used as a cancer cell model. A pull-down assay with glutathione S- transferase (GST) -agarose beads followed by Western blot analysis was employed to confirm microtubule S -glutathionylation. Immunofluorescence microscopy using a mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin-FITC was used to study the effect of the S- glutathionylation on microtubule function; mainly polymerization and depolymerization. Flow cytometry was employed to examine the effect of the S- glutathionylation on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Cell morphological change was followed through the use of a Zeiss AXIO Observer A 1 microscope. Cancer cell growth inhibition by 2 -AAPA was investigated with ten human cancer cell lines. Results Our investigation demonstrated that cell morphology was changed and microtubules were S -glutathionylated in the presence of 2 -AAPA in UACC- 62 cells. Accordingly, microtubules were found depolymerized and cells were arrested at G 2 /M phase. The affected cells were found to undergo apoptosis. Cancer growth inhibition experiments demonstrated that the concentrations of 2 -AAPA required to produce the effects on microtubules were compatible to the concentrations producing cancer cell growth inhibition. Conclusions The data from this investigation confirms that microtubule S -glutathionylation leads to microtubule dysfunction and cell growth inhibition and can be a novel approach for developing <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Microtubules (MTs) play {{important}} and diverse roles in eukaryotic cells. Their function and biophysical properties have made α−and β−tubulin, {{the main components}} of MTs, the subject of intense study. Interfering with normal MT dynamics, for example, by the addition of tubulin ligands, can cause the cell great distress and affect MT stability and functions, including mitosis, cell motion and intracellular organelle transport. It has been shown in the literature that tubulin is an important target molecule for developing anticancer drugs. Tubulin binding molecules have generated considerable interest after the successful introduction of the taxanes into clinical oncology and the widespread use of the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine. These compounds inhibit cell mitosis by binding to the protein tubulin in the mitotic spindle and preventing polymerization into the MTs. This mode of action is also shared with other natural agents eg colchicine and podophyllotoxin. However various tubulin isotypes have shown resistance to taxanes and other MT agents. Therefore, there is a strong need to design and develop new natural analogs as <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents</b> to interact with tubulin at sites different from those of vinca alkaloids and taxanes. This minireview provides SAR on several classes of <b>antimitotic</b> <b>agents</b> reported in the literature.
