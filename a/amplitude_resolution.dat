Well known mature {{actuation}} technologies have limitations that do not allow to satisfy all the requirements in terms performances (e. g. bandwidth, time response, closed-loop controllability, output force and displacement <b>amplitudes,</b> <b>resolution,</b> etc.). This is true peculiarly for those devised as matrices in which taxels are arranged {{in a number of}} arrays and rows.

40|$|AbstractAlthough the {{cochlear}} implant {{has been widely}} acknowledged as the most successful neural prosthesis, {{only a fraction of}} hearing-impaired people who can potentially benefit from a cochlear implant have actually received one due to its limited awareness, accessibility, and affordability. To help overcome these limitations, a 26 -electrode cochlear implant has been developed to receive China's Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) approval in 2011 and Conformité Européenne (CE) Marking in 2012. The present article describes design philosophy, system specification, and technical verification of the Nurotron device, which includes advanced digital signal processing and 4 current sources with multiple <b>amplitude</b> <b>resolutions</b> that not only are compatible with perceptual capability but also allow interleaved or simultaneous stimulation. The article also presents 3 -year longitudinal evaluation data from 60 human subjects who have received the Nurotron device. The objective measures show that electrode impedance decreased within the first month of device use, but was stable until a slight increase at the end of two years. The subjective loudness measures show that electric stimulation threshold was stable while the maximal comfort level increased over the 3 years. Mandarin sentence recognition increased from the pre-surgical 0 %-correct score to a plateau of about 80 % correct with 6 -month use of the device. Both indirect and direct comparisons indicate indistinguishable performance differences between the Nurotron system and other commercially available devices.

40|$|Conventional AVO {{techniques}} {{are based on}} the linear approximation of Zoeppritz equations for the inversion of elastic properties across a subsurface interface. However, for a layered model consisting of internal multiple layers beyond seismic resolution, {{it can be difficult to}} use the traditional AVO inversion methods due to the practicalities of picking <b>amplitudes,</b> <b>resolution</b> problems, and thin-layer effects. We propose an improved AVO inversion method applied to a layered model for inversion of layer thickness and properties by incorporating the frequency content of the wavelet. The proposed method uses the propagator matrix method as a theoretical description of the frequency-dependent reflection coefficients for the layered model in an inversion scheme. We test the proposed method on a single layered model with synthetic data to produce an inversion for layer thickness and porosity, and then investigate the feasibility of the method for the characterization of the fracture zone in the Bakken formation. For the inversion of the reference crack density and layer thickness of the fracture zone in the Bakken formation, the minima of the objective functions generate inversion results that indicate a reasonable fit with the true model parameters. The inversion error may result from the intrinsic complexity of reflections from a layered model, in which several different combinations of layer thicknesses and associated properties may produce similar frequency-dependent coefficients. By contrast, in the multicomponent model data example, the inversion of converted PS-wave data seems to be less stable compared to PP-wave data. The potential of the proposed AVO inversion method may include applications to complex models, such as a sandstone/shale interbedded system, or a formation that presents internal heterogeneit...|$|R

40|$|The SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery {{are widely}} used in order to monitor {{displacements}} impacting the Earth surface and infrastructures. The main remote sensing technique to extract sub-centimeter information from SAR imagery is the Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR), based on the phase information only. However, {{it is well known}} that DInSAR technique may suffer for lack of coherence among the considered stack of images. New Earth observation SAR satellite sensors, as COSMO-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X, and the coming PAZ, can acquire imagery with high <b>amplitude</b> <b>resolutions</b> too, up to few decimeters. Thanks to this feature, and to the on board dual frequency GPS receivers, allowing orbits determination with an accuracy at few centimetres level, the it was proven by different groups that TerraSAR-X imagery offer the capability to achieve, in a global reference frame, 3 D positioning accuracies in the decimeter range and even better just exploiting the slant-range measurements coming from the amplitude information, provided proper corrections of all the involved geophysical phenomena are carefully applied. The core of this work is to test this methodology on COSMO-SkyMed data acquired over the Corvara area (Bolzano – Northern Italy), where, currently, a landslide with relevant yearly displacements, up to decimeters, is monitored, using GPS survey and DInSAR technique. The leading idea is to measure the distance between the satellite and a well identifiable natural or artificial Persistent Scatterer (PS), taking in account the signal propagation delays through the troposphere and ionosphere and filtering out the known geophysical effects that induce periodic and secular ground displacements. The preliminary results here presented and discussed indicate that COSMO-SkyMed Himage imagery appear able to guarantee a displacements monitoring with an accuracy of few centimetres using only the amplitude data, provided few (at least one) stable PS’s are available around the monitored area, in order to correct residual biases, likely due to orbit errors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies have}} shown that the human right-hemispheric {{auditory}} cortex is particularly sensitive to reduction in sound quality, with an increase in distortion resulting in an amplification of the auditory N 1 m response measured in the magnetoencephalography (MEG). Here, we examined whether this sensitivity is specific to the processing of acoustic properties of speech or whether it can be observed also in the processing of sounds with a simple spectral structure. We degraded speech stimuli (vowel /a/), complex non-speech stimuli (a composite of five sinusoidals), and sinusoidal tones by decreasing the <b>amplitude</b> <b>resolution</b> of the signal waveform. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>resolution</b> was impoverished by reducing the number of bits to represent the signal samples. Auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEFs) were measured in the left and right hemisphere of sixteen healthy subjects. Results We found that the AEF amplitudes increased significantly with stimulus distortion for all stimulus types, which indicates that the right-hemispheric N 1 m sensitivity is not related exclusively to degradation of acoustic properties of speech. In addition, the P 1 m and P 2 m responses were amplified with increasing distortion similarly in both hemispheres. The AEF latencies were not systematically affected by the distortion. Conclusions We propose that the increased activity of AEFs reflects cortical processing of acoustic properties common to both speech and non-speech stimuli. More specifically, the enhancement is most likely caused by spectral changes brought about by the decrease of <b>amplitude</b> <b>resolution,</b> in particular the introduction of periodic, signal-dependent distortion to the original sound. Converging evidence suggests that the observed AEF amplification could reflect cortical sensitivity to periodic sounds. </p...|$|E
