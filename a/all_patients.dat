5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population.

The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
