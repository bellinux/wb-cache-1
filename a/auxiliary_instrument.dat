5000|$|Longtime {{classical}} music practice has expected the non-principal {{player in a}} section to double the common <b>auxiliary</b> <b>instrument</b> (e.g., 2nd flute and piccolo; 2nd oboe and English horn). In commercial work, including Hollywood film scores and—most notably—Broadway musicals, the practice gradually evolved, with some specialists developing great expertise with multiple members of three, four, or even all five of the woodwind families noted above. In such commercial work, players are paid an additional (percentage) premium for each additional double—but hiring four or five proficient [...] "reed doublers" [...] is still more cost-effective to the production than hiring numerous additional players. Even before 1940, Broadway reed players were commonly expected to double three, four, or five instruments; {{one of the most}} notorious mid-century examples was the Reed III book for West Side Story (1957), requiring flute, piccolo, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, and tenor & baritone saxophones.|$|E

40|$|Salinity {{intrusion}} is a {{key issue}} for estuarine water quality management. Aquatic ecosystem sustainability is highly dependent on salinity concentration dynamics and must be studied for each particular environment. Salinity intrusion into the estuary of the river Lima, in the north-western region of the Iberian Peninsula, was studied based on a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and mass transport model. Tide heights and river discharges are the major causes affecting salinity intrusion, and have been analyzed by means of estuarine circulation simulation for different scenarios. The upstream propagation of the salinity front under unfavorable conditions reaches a river section located at about 12 km upstream the river mouth. The developed model constitutes {{a powerful tool for}} evaluation of the salinity intrusion pattern in the river Lima estuary, and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>instrument</b> for decision making in river basin water management...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ontologies {{has been}} widely used in the formal {{description}} of scientific knowledge, {{as well in the}} practice of the conceptual modeling. Considering the description of scientific knowledge, several ontologies has been proposed in the biomedical domain. This article describes an ongoing research in the domain of blood transfusion, presenting the construction of a domain ontology about hemocomponents and hemoderivatives. Such ontology, named HEMONTO, has been developed using top-level ontologies, biomedical domain ontologies, among other resources. The ontology is based in a set of philosophical principles that has been identified in the literature under the label “ontological realism”and relies on technologies developed in the scope of Semantic Web. HEMONTO aims to provide both a knowledge repository about blood transfusion and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>instrument</b> for modeling and evaluation of the information systems.

In conjunction with notation software, MIDI technology provides a complex musical score which also serves as a hyper-descriptive kinetic map, allowing the examination of not only the music itself but also the kinetic behavior of the pianist at the keyboard. Finally, by negotiating a Native voice for ethnomusicology, shifting the focus from a purely ethnographic approach toward one that acknowledges the Native practitioner/scholar, this thesis argues for a common ground between Academic ontology and Native epistemology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a highly accurate <b>auxiliary</b> <b>instrument</b> pointing system which can provide fine pointing {{for a variety}} of solar-, stellar-, and Earth-viewing scientific instruments during extended space shuttle orbital missions. This system, called the Annular Suspension and Pointing System (ASPS), consists of pointing assemblies for coarse and vernier pointing. The 'coarse' assembly is attached to the spacecraft (e. g., the space shuttle) and consists of an elevation gimbal and a lateral gimbal to provide coarse pointing. The vernier pointing assembly consists of the payload instrument mounted on a plate around which is attached a continuous annular rim. The vernier assembly is suspended in the lateral gimbal using magnetic actuators which provide rim suspension forces and fine pointing torques. A detailed linearized mathematical model is developed for the ASPS/space shuttle system, and control laws and payload attitude state estimators are designed. Statistical pointing performance is predicted in the presence of stochastic disturbances such as crew motion, sensor noise, and actuator noise...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: this {{research}} aimed to understand the motivation for reporting adverse events {{from the perspective of}} nursing staff in the work environment. METHOD: qualitative study that used the phenomenology of Alfred Schutz for reference, which offers a systematic approach to understand the social aspects of human action. Data were collected by open interviews with 17 nurses and 14 technicians/assistant nurses in a university hospital. RESULTS: motivation was revealed through six categories: all types of occurrences must be reported; the incident report is an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>instrument</b> to health care provision management; the culture of punishment in transition; nurses as the agents responsible for voluntary reporting; sharing problems with higher management and achieving quality in the work process. DISCUSSION: it was unveiled that, when reporting adverse events, team members perceived themselves to be in a collaborative relationship with the institution and trusted that they would receive administrative support and professional security, which encouraged them to continue reporting. Reporting allows health care professionals to share responsibilities with managers and encourages corrective actions. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: the study revealed the nursing staff's motivation for adverse event reporting, contributing to reflections on institutional policies aimed at patient safety in health care...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we will explain, in an {{exploratory}} and preliminary character, the possibilities and contributions of a Teaching Model as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>instrument</b> to planning, development {{and evaluation of}} proposals for science teaching that are geared at the promotion of cognitive changes. Thus, we will describe the instruments used in the planning of an introductory course on heat and temperature with 8 th graders, and we will analyze their results. The proposed model tries to establish pedagogical stages conceived from the successive triads that mark the evolution of causal thinking in intra, inter and transobjectal terms (Piaget &Garcia, 1987). Research findings of this work, based on the analysis of written material produced by the students throughout the process lead us to affirm the intrinsic complexity of human learning, understanding complexity as historical, irreversible, unforeseeable, and undertermined phenomena (Prigogine & Stengers, 1997 / 1998). We conclude with considerations about {{the range of the}} realized changes in science teaching and about the groundlessness of a linear reading of their findings. The model analysis will be carried out in terms of teaching, learning and, mainly, of the relationships between teaching and learning...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of selective logging have being intensified in the Amazon region. The Jamari National Forest (FLONA) {{is located in}} the North of the Rondônia State, Brazil, enclosing an area of 215000 ha. The FLONA is into an area of conflict against the region's lumber and also is the first area to the concessions otorged by the Brazilian Government. These facts motivated this work. The methodology was done with a dataset of 23 years of images Landsat-TM 5, CBERS- 2 and CBERS- 2 B from the study area. The application of the spectral mixing model and arithmetic operations of fractions images allowed the best visual interpretation to selective logging exploration. After the identification of the selective logging exploration areas, it was calculated an area of 395, 46 km 2 and found an average of 16, 47 km 2 /year. The frequency of the selective logging exploration was next to the damping area. Thus, a multitemporal mapping of the selective logging exploration in the study area was generated.
