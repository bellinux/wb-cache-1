The trolleybuses operate in bus-only lanes, separated from other traffic; such lanes already were present on this route. Several of STE's other trolleybus routes also operate in bus-only lanes over some portions of their route.|$|E

To estimate the U-turn adjustment factor, 198 queues with 2, 327 U-turn vehicles and 1, 564 left-turn vehicles were used to develop a regression model with the headway as the dependent variable and the U-turn percentage as the independent variable. The resulting quadratic model shows an increase in the <b>average</b> <b>headway</b> as the percentage of U-Turn traffic increases, with an R 2 of 0. 591. This indicates that the presence of U-turning vehicles has a significant effect on increasing the <b>average</b> <b>headway</b> thus reducing the capacity of signalized intersection.

40|$|ABSTRACT Increasing {{the amount}} of {{development}} in various fields will affect the increase of transportation needs. It {{can be seen from}} platoon patterns of traffic flow in the urban roads, including Jl. Slamet Riyadi Surakarta. The parameter used to describe this condition is time headway between two successive vehicles in the traffic flow. This study aims to identify the patterns of platoon that occur in the field, to determine the <b>average</b> <b>headway</b> of any kind of existing pattern, and then to calculate the flow rate of headway based, and then to compare the result with field based. The data used in this study are: traffic flow recording, geometric and environmental conditions including the road network. The pattern of platoon is created by the possibility of the number and types of vehicles that can occur in a selected traffic lane. Based on observation, {{it can be seen that}} there are 9 patterns of platoon in the field and it can be grouped as follows: Model 1, MC followed by MC/HV/LV; Model 2, LV followed by LV/MC/HV; and Model 3, HV followed by HV/MC/LV. Based on the analysis, it can be seen that the highest of <b>average</b> <b>headway</b> (2. 22 seconds) occurred at 12 : 05 - 12 : 20, while the lowest (1. 80) occurred at 10 : 35 - 10 : 50.

Thc multiple prescnce depends on several parameters, such as the site, the road type, the demand of transport, so that its mathematical description is particularly complex. A ease study on two-lane two-way bridges with a span of about 20 m was carried out to investigate the effects of multiple presence. Using arbitrary-point-in-time distributions of mid-span moments corresponding to single and two lane events, multiple presence factors are obtained for the specified average recurrence intervals. The arbitrary-point-in-time distributions of moments for two lanes are derived using the convolution integral and the distribution for a single lane. The multi-lane reduction factors can be obtained finally by comparing the responses of multiple presence events. The convolution methodology permits the ADTI to be altered analytically, provided the reduction in <b>average</b> <b>headway</b> does not significantly alter the arbitrary-point-in-time distribntions of response.

40|$|As highway systems {{become more}} congested, it becomes {{increasingly}} {{important to understand}} the reliability with which we can estimate important performance measures such as volume to capacity ratios, particularly as we move toward leveraging field infrastructure to obtain real-time performance measures. In 1947, Greenshields wrote a paper that characterized “green time consumed” by “car-in-line-number” that ultimately was called headway. <b>Average</b> <b>headway</b> is one of principles used by the highway capacity manual to estimate saturation flow rate at signalized intersections. However, the current analytical techniques calculate a deterministic value for saturation flow rate that does not consider the stochastic variation of saturation flow rate. This paper reviews techniques used to estimate saturation flow rate, and proposes enhanced calculation methods to group saturation flow rate estimates by queue length. Grouping saturation flow rate estimates by queue length provides a convenient framework to evaluate saturation flow rate reliability. The inter-quartile range (25 % - 75 %) of saturation flow rates was calculated to be 1000 vph based on Greenshields’ calculation techniques. Using the proposed enhanced calculation characterizing saturation flow rate, the inter-quartile range of saturation flow rate was shown to decrease from approximately 400 vph with 5 cars in a queue to 300 vph with 10 cars in queue. Because saturation flow rate is a fundamental input to volume-to-capacity performance measures, characterizing the stochastic variation of saturation flow rates provides a basic input for assessing how reliably one can estimate important performance measures such as volume-to-capacity ratios, as well as other performance measures that build upon volume-to-capacity ratios...|$|E

An important contribution of this research is the empirical work, i. e. estimating models using statistically rigorous methods and microscopic data collected from real traffic. With the ever increasing congestion at airports around the world, studies into ways of maximizing infrastructures capacity and minimizing delay costs while meeting the goals of the airlines are necessary. The methodology applied for the calculation of runway capacity start from the traffic data elaboration of the Naples International Airport: we have been determined this aim from the airline pattern in the above airport. The hourly capacity is calculated as the inverse of the headway of consecutive aircraft operation; this is drawn with an average of the time headway in the “critical periods”. The determination of the “capacity periods" it happens in three phases: in the first one we are drawn by the sample the stationary periods; in the second we are considered, of these, only those with the lowest <b>averages</b> time <b>headway,</b> these are called "critical" periods; subsequently we are examined only that (critical periods) had time length less than the 60 minutes and that have an <b>average</b> of time <b>headway</b> that it is almost attested around to a constant value. The stationary periods, as it says the same definition, are characterized by the relatives constant time headway, in other words there aren’t meaningful phenomenon of increase or diminution of the traffic flow. The critical periods are static periods that are found on the traffic flow curve defined "critic", this curve we have obtained to envelop some values that mark the lower limit of the diagram defined time length vs. averages of the static periods. Defined the critical periods we have been determined the experimental headway curves and we compared with those theoretical. Of such experimental curves we have been considered the characteristics values: the average and the standard deviation. In this way we have determined a matrix of the <b>average</b> time <b>headway</b> both for operations flight that for type of airplane. The following step has been that to define and to implement the analytical model. We suggest a mathematic algorithm that is able to optimize, a posteriori, the flight operation under the delay restraint. The algorithm determines the best sequence of aircrafts that minimizes the delays and it maximizes the runway capacity. The proposed methodology, even if determine an evident improvement of the runway capacity, in the respect of thresholds of acceptable average delays (constrain), represents an initial methodological phase that will desirably conclude in the determination of a "dynamic" model, that is able to assist the inspectors' job in way real-time, assigning, opportunely, an excellent sequence of the successions of flight operations...|$|R
