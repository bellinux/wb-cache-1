40|$|The {{effect of}} three {{potassium}} channel openers, nicorandil, <b>aprikalim,</b> and bimakalim, on experimental myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury was examined in barbital-anaesthetizeddogs. In {{a model of}} reversible injury, administration of nicorandil at a hypotensive dose and <b>aprikalim</b> at a non-hypotensive dose resulted in a reduction in contractile dysfunc-tion during reperfusion ('stunning ') following brief coronary artery occlusion (15 min) when the drugs were administered before occlusion. Administration of <b>aprikalim</b> only during reperfusion had no beneficial effect. Pre-treatment with the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -dependent potassium (KATP) channel antagonist, glibenclamide, blocked completely the beneficial effects of nicorandil and <b>aprikalim,</b> although glibenclamide did not block the haemodynamic effects of nicorandil. In a model of irreversible ischaemia j reperfusion injury (120 min of ischaemia and 30 min of reperfusion) pre-treatment with equihypotensive doses of nicorandil and bimakalim produced marked reductions in myocardial infarct size. Similarly, <b>aprikalim</b> at a non-hypotensive dose reduced myocardial infarct size in dogs subjected to 90 min of ischaemia and 5 h of reperfusion, and the protective effects of <b>aprikalim</b> were antagonized completely by glibenclamide. These results indicate that nicorandil, <b>aprikalim,</b> and bimakalim are protective in two experimental models of ischaemia/reperfusion injury. The mechanism of action of these agents is not completely understood, but {{it appears to be}} a result of myocardial KATP channel activation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: [corrected] <b>Aprikalim,</b> an {{adenosine}} triphosphate (ATP) sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channel opener, attenuates {{the elevation of}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and improves the contractile functions after hyperkalemic and hypothermic cardioplegia. There is evidence that cardioplegia increases the Na+-Ca 2 + exchange activity without affecting Ca 2 + influx through L-type Ca 2 + channels or Ca 2 + content in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the intracellular Ca 2 + store. METHODS: We measured the Na+-Ca 2 + exchange outward current with the patch-clamp technique in single rat ventricular myocytes exposed to hyperkalemia and hypothermia {{in the presence of}} <b>aprikalim.</b> The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) during cardioplegia, and the contractile function and [Ca 2 +]i transients induced by electrical stimulation or caffeine during rewarming and reperfusion in single ventricular myocytes were also determined. Contraction and [Ca 2 +]i were determined with video tracking and spectrofluorometry, respectively. RESULTS: <b>Aprikalim,</b> 100 micromol/L, the effect of which was blocked by glibamclamide, a K(ATP) inhibitor, significantly attenuated the hyperkalemia-elevated Na+-Ca 2 + exchange current by 26 % and 11 % at 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C, respectively. <b>Aprikalim</b> also attenuated significantly the [Ca 2 +]i elevated during cardioplegia. Furthermore <b>aprikalim</b> significantly attenuated the reduction in amplitude and prolongation in duration of contraction of myocytes after cardioplegia. The effects of <b>aprikalim</b> mimicked those of nickle (Ni 2 +), a Na+-Ca 2 + exchange blocker. The electrically or caffeine-induced [Ca 2 +]i transients were unaltered by cardioplegia or <b>aprikalim.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Aprikalim</b> attenuates the Na+-Ca 2 + exchange outward current elevated by hyperkalemia, which may attenuate the [Ca 2 +]i elevation during hyperkalemia and improve the contractile function after cardioplegia in the ventricular myocyte. The study provides further support that addition of a K(ATP) channel opener to the cardioplegic solution may produce beneficial effects in open heart surgery...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that}} dilatation of the basilar artery in response to activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels is impaired in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Changes in basilar artery diameter in response to <b>aprikalim,</b> a direct activator of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, were measured in anesthetized SHRSP and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats through a cranial window. Topical application of <b>aprikalim</b> increased basilar artery diameter in WKY rats. Glibenclamide, a selective inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, abolished aprikalim-induced vasodilatation. Thus, ATP-sensitive potassium channels are functional in the basilar artery of WKY rats in vivo. <b>Aprikalim</b> (10 ~ 6 mol/L) dilated the basilar artery by 31 ± 5 % (mean + SEM) in WKY rats but only 5 ± 1 % in SHRSP. The concentration-response curve to <b>aprikalim</b> in SHRSP was significantly shifted to the right, but {{the response to the}} highest concentration of <b>aprikalim</b> (10 ~ 55 mol/L) was similar in SHRSP and WKY rats.

Dilator responses of the basilar artery to forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, and nitroprusside, a direct activator of guanylate cyclase, were normal in SHRSP.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of the KCO <b>aprikalim</b> (RP 52891) on human arteries used as coronary bypass grafts with emphasis on the possible difference in the inhibitory effect on depolarizing agent-mediated rather than receptor-mediated contraction. METHODS: Human internal mammary artery segments (IMA, n = 88) taken from 28 patients were studied. Concentration-relaxation curves for <b>aprikalim</b> were established in IMA precontracted with three vasoconstrictors (K+, U 46619, and phenylephrine). In IMA rings incubated with <b>aprikalim</b> (1 or 30 microM) for 10 min concentration-contraction curves for the three vasoconstrictors were constructed. RESULTS: Aprikalim-induced relaxation was less in K+ (37. 3 +/- 6. 4 %) than in U 46619 (80. 2 +/- 7. 7 %, P= 0. 002), or phenylephrine (67. 5 +/- 7. 0 %, P= 0. 038) -precontracted IMA. The EC 50 for K+-(- 5. 40 +/- 0. 12 log M) was significantly higher than that for phenylephrine (- 6. 43 +/- 0. 30 log M, P= 0. 007) but not significant compared with that for U 46619 (- 5. 81 +/- 0. 11, P> 0. 05). Pretreatment with <b>aprikalim</b> depressed the contraction by phenylephrine from 140. 6 +/- 27. 6 % to 49. 3 +/- 14. 1 % (P= 0. 002) and shifted the EC 50 11. 0 -fold higher in rings treated with 1 microM <b>aprikalim</b> (P= 0. 007). Treatment of <b>aprikalim</b> did not significantly reduce the K+ and U 46619 -induced contraction (P> 0. 05) but shifted the concentration-contraction curves rightward (2. 8 -fold higher for K+, P< 0. 05 and 2. 2 -fold higher for U 46619, P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <b>aprikalim</b> has vasorelaxant effects in human conduit arteries used as coronary artery bypass grafts contracted by a variety of vasoconstrictors and this effect is vasoconstrictor-selective with greater potency for alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists than for depolarizing agent K+.

40|$|Objective: Studies have {{suggested}} that collateral vessels of the coronary and hind-limb circulations are more sensitive to activation of ATP-sensitive Kq channels than are non-collateral vessels. The objective {{of the present study}} was to compare responses of microvascular non-collaterals, native collaterals and stimulated collaterals in the heart to three vasodilators which act through different mechanisms: activation of ATP-sensitive Kq channels with <b>aprikalim,</b> release of nitric oxide with acetylcholine, and endothelium-independent activation of soluble guanylate cyclase with nitroglycerin. Methods: Collateral growth was stimulated by placing an Ameroid occluder on. the proximal left circumflex artery in dogs. Non-collaterals, native collaterals and stimulated collaterals 100 – 220 mm in diameter were isolated, cannulated on micropipettes and pressurized in vitro. Vessel diameters were measured using videomicroscopy. Results: Dilation y 8 y 5. y 9 y 6. y 8 y 4. to <b>aprikalim</b> 10 – 10 M, acetylcholine 10 – 10 M and nitroglycerin 10 – 3 = 10 M were similar in non-collateral, native collateral and stimulated collaterals.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that microvascular native and stimulated collaterals respond to activation of ATP-sensitive Kq channels and acetylcholine similar to non-collaterals of similar size.

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effects of <b>aprikalim,</b> a specific KATP channel opener, on spinal cord ischemic injury. MethodsFifty-four rabbits were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (n =  18, sham operation), group 2 (n =  18, 30  min of normothermic aortic cross-clamping) and group 3 (n =  18, <b>aprikalim</b> 100  μg/kg was administered 15  min before 30  min of normothermic aortic cross-clamping). Neurologic evaluation was performed according to the modified Tarlov scale. Six animals from each group were sacrificed at 24, 48 and 168  h postoperatively. The lumbar spinal cords were harvested and examined histologically. The motor neurons were counted and the histologic lesions were scored (0 – 3, 3 : normal). ResultsGroup 3 (<b>aprikalim</b> group) had better Tarlov scores compared to group 2 at all-time points (P <  0. 025). The histologic changes were proportional to the Tarlov scores and group 3 had better functional outcome as compared to group 2 at 168  h (number of neurons: 21. 2  ±  4. 9 vs. 8. 0  ±  2. 7, P <  0. 001 and histologic score: 1. 67  ±  1. 03 vs. 0. 50  ±  0. 55, P =  0. 03).

This hypothesis was investigated in an isolated, blood-perfused, rabbit heart Langendorff model during 30 minutes of normothermic global ischemia. Hyperpolarized cardiac arrest induced by <b>aprikalim,</b> an opener of adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channels, was compared with hyperkalemic depolarized arrest and with unprotected global ischemia. Left ventricular pressure was recorded over a wide range of balloon volumes before ischemia and 30 minutes after reperfusion. End-diastolic pressure versus balloon volume data were fitted to a two-coefficient exponential relationship. Changes in the diastolic compliance of the left ventricle were assessed by comparison of preischemic and postischemic coefficients within each cardioplegia group. Postischemic recovery of developed pressure was used to assess changes in left ventricular systolic function. The tissue water content of each heart was also determined. Myocardial protection with <b>aprikalim</b> resulted in better postischemic recovery of developed pressure (90 % ± 9 %) than either protection with hyperkalemic cardioplegia (73 % ± 11 %) or no protection (62 % ± 9 %). Myocardial tissue water content in hearts protected with hyperkalemic cardioplegia (77. 4 % ± 1. 4 %) was less than the tissue water content of either unprotected hearts (79. 4 % ± 1. 2 %) or hearts protected with <b>aprikalim</b> (78. 7 % ± 0. 9 %). Despite these differences, neither hyperkalemic cardioplegia (p = 0. 15) nor <b>aprikalim</b> cardioplegia (p = 0. 30) was associated with a significant postischemic decrease in ventricular compliance.

40|$|Objectives This work {{evaluated}} the potential usefulness of pharmacological activation of cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) {{in the prevention}} of drug-induced QT prolongation in anaesthetised guinea-pigs. Prolongation of cardiac repolarisation and QT interval is an adverse effect of many drugs blocking HERG potassium channels. This alteration can be dangerously arrhythmogenic and has been associated with the development of a particular form of ventricular tachyarrhythmia known as torsade de pointes. Methods The well-known KATP openers <b>aprikalim,</b> cromakalim and pinacidil were used. Moreover, three benzothiazine derivatives, which have been reported as potent activators of KATP channels, were also used. Key findings Pharmacological activation of KATP channels caused a reduction of the QT prolongation, induced by astemizole, cisapride, quinidine and thioridazine. In contrast, the QT prolongation induced by haloperidol, sotalol and terfenadine, which are known to block HERG channels but also KATP channels, was not influenced by KATP activation. Glibenclamide and tolbutamide (non-selective blockers of KATP channels expressed both in sarcolemmal and in mitochondrial membranes) antagonised the effects of K ATP openers, whereas 5 -hydroxydecanoic acid (selective blocker of the mitochondrial KATP channels) failed to antagonise the effects of KATP openers, indicating that only the sarcolemmal KATP is involved in the cardioprotective activity.

40|$|The {{sulfonylurea}} receptor (SUR) is {{the important}} reg-ulatory subunit of ATP-sensitive K channels. It is an ATP-binding cassette protein comprising 17 transmem-brane helices. SUR is endowed with binding sites for channel blockers like the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glib-enclamide and for the chemically very heterogeneous channel openers. SUR 1, the typical pancreatic SUR iso-form, shows much higher affinity for glibenclamide but considerably lower affinity for most openers than SUR 2. In radioligand binding assays, we investigated the role of two amino acids, T 1285 and M 1289, located in trans-membrane helix (TM) - 17, in opener binding to SUR 1. These amino acids were exchanged for the correspond-ing amino acids of SUR 2. In competition experiments using [3 H]glibenclamide as radioligand, SUR 1 (T 1285 L, M 1289 T) showed much higher affinity toward the cya-noguanidine openers pinacidil and P 1075 than SUR 1 wild type. The affinity for the thioformamide <b>aprikalim</b> was also markedly increased. In contrast, the affinity for the benzopyrans rilmakalim and levcromakalim was unaffected; however, the amount of displaced [3 H] glibenclamide binding was nearly doubled. The binding properties of the opener diazoxide and the blocker glibenclamide were unchanged. In conclusion, mutation of two amino acids in TM 17 of SUR 1, especially of M 1289, leads to class-specific effects on opener binding by increasing opener affinity or by changing allosteric coupling between opener and glibenclamide binding...|$|E

However, {{the effects of}} MCC- 134 on cardiac surface KATP channels and mitochondrial KATP (mitoKATP) channels are unknown. A mixed agonist/blocker with differential effects on the two channel types would help to clarify the role of KATP channels in cardioprotection. Methods and Results—To index mitoKATP channels, we measured mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence in rabbit ventricular myocytes. MCC- 134 alone {{had little effect on}} basal flavoprotein fluorescence. However, MCC- 134 inhibited diazoxide-induced flavoprotein oxidation in a dose-dependent manner (EC 50 � 27 �mol/L). When ATP was included in the pipette solution, MCC- 134 slowly activated surface KATP currents with some delay (� 10 minutes). These results indicate that MCC- 134 is a mitoKATP channel inhibitor and a surface KATP channel opener in native cardiac cells. In cell-pelleting ischemia assays, coapplication of MCC- 134 with diazoxide abolished the cardioprotective effect of diazoxide, whereas MCC- 134 alone did not alter cell death. These results were reproducible in both rabbit and mouse myocytes. MCC- 134 also attenuated the effect of ischemic preconditioning against myocardial infarction in mice, consistent with the results of cell-pelleting ischemia assays.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} actions of K channel openers (KCOs) on KATe channels were studied with the patch clamp technique in excised inside-out patches from frog skeletal muscle fibers.

The effects of KCOs could therefore be attributed solely to a competitive interaction between KCOs and nucleotides, as confirmed by observations that ATP decreased the apparent affinity for KCOs and that, conversely, KCOs decreased ATP or ADP sensitivity. Protons antagonized the action of the non-benzopyran KCOs, pinacidil and <b>aprikalim,</b> by enhancing their dissociation rate. This effect resembled the effect of acidification on benzopyran KCOs (Forestier, C., Y. Depresle, and M. Vivaudou.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} produces marked abnormalities {{in motor}} nerve conduction, but the mechanism is not clear. In {{the present study}} we hypothesized that in the streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rat impaired vasodilator function is associated with reduced endoneural blood flow (EBF) which may contribute to nerve dysfunction. We examined whether diabetes-induced reductions in sciatic nerve conduction velocity and EBF were associated with impaired endothelium-dependent dilation in adjacent arterioles. We measured motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) in the sciatic nerve using a non-invasive procedure, and sciatic nerve nutritive blood flow using microelectrode polarography and hydrogen clearance. In vitro videomicroscopy was used to quantify arteriolar diameter responses to dilator agonists in arterioles overlying the sciatic nerve. MNCV and EBF in 4 -week-STZ-induced diabetic rats were decreased by 22 % and 49 % respectively. Arterioles were constricted with U 46619 and dilation to acetylcholine (ACh), <b>aprikalim,</b> or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) examined. All agonists elicited dose-dependent dilation in control and diabetic rats, although ACh-induced dilation was significantly reduced in diabetic rats. Treating vessels from normal or diabetic rats with indomethacin (INDO) alone did not significantly affect ACh-induced relaxation. However, ACh-induced vasodilation was significantly reduced by treatment with KCl or Nω-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) alone. Combining LNNA and KCl further reduced ACh-induced dilation in these vessels. Diabetes causes vasodilator dysfunction in a microvascular bed that provides circulation to the sciatic nerve. These studies imply that ACh-induced dilation in these vessels is mediated by multiple mechanisms that may include the endothelial-dependent production of nitric oxide and endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor. This impaired vascular response is associated with neural dysfunction...|$|E

40|$|Openers of ATP-sensitive K+ {{channels}} (KATP channels) {{are thought}} to act by enhancing the ATPase activity of sulphonylurea receptors (SURs), the regulatory channel subunits. At higher concentrations, some openers activate KATP channels also {{in the absence of}} MgATP. Here, we describe binding and effect of structurally diverse openers in the absence of Mg 2 + and presence of EDTA. Binding of openers to SUR 2 B was measured using a mutant with high affinity for [3 H]glibenclamide ([3 H]GBC). In the absence of Mg 2 +, ‘typical' openers (benzopyrans, cyanoguanidines and <b>aprikalim)</b> inhibited [3 H]GBC binding with Ki values ∼ 200 × higher than in the presence of MgATP. Minoxidil sulphate and nicorandil were inactive, whereas binding of diazoxide was unaffected by MgATP.

This study examined the simultaneous electric and tonic alteration of coronary microarteries at the cellular level during and after exposure to depolarizing cardioplegia or hyperpolarizing cardioplegia, with emphasis on endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor–mediated relaxation and hyperpolarization. MethodsPorcine coronary microarteries (diameter, approximately 200 - 400 μm) were incubated with depolarizing cardioplegia (20 mmol/L KCl) or hyperpolarizing cardioplegia (10 μmol/L <b>aprikalim)</b> for 1 hour. Cellular membrane potential with a glass microelectrode in a coronary smooth muscle cell and isometric force of the muscle were simultaneously measured in a myograph. ResultsDepolarizing cardioplegia incubation produced a stable contraction (from 4. 9 ± 0. 3 mN to 7. 3 ± 0. 4 mN) and depolarization (from − 51 ± 1 mV to − 41 ± 2 mV). In contrast, hyperpolarizing cardioplegia relaxed (from 4. 8 ± 0. 3 mN to 3. 5 ± 0. 3 mN) and hyperpolarized (from − 51 ± 2 mV to − 56 ± 1 mV) the smooth muscle. After exposure to depolarizing cardioplegia, the bradykinin-induced, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor–mediated relaxation reduced from 66. 2 % ± 5. 0 % to 18. 4 % ± 3. 7 % (P <. 001), and the membrane hyperpolarization reduced from 18 ± 1 mV to 7 ± 1 mV (P <. 001) {{in the presence of}} indomethacin and NG-nitro-l-arginine. In contrast, hyperpolarizing cardioplegia did not affect the bradykinin-induced responses. ConclusionsIn the coronary microarteries, exposure to hyperpolarizing cardioplegia preserves whereas depolarizing cardioplegia reduces the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor–mediated electric (hyperpolarization) and mechanical (relaxation) responses. Thus hyperpolarizing cardioplegia is superior to depolarizing cardioplegia in protecting the endothelial function in the coronary microcirculation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHyperkalemic {{solutions}} {{that are used}} as cardioplegic agents, while effective in inducing electromechanical arrest, are only partially cardioprotective, and ventricular dysfunction has been observed. The underlying pathophysiology of cardioplegia-associated ventricular dysfunction is complex and not fully understood, {{but it could be}} related, in part, to intracellular Ca 2 + loading induced by high K+ concentrations present in cardioplegic solutions. Yet no effective cytoprotective means against possible intracellular Ca 2 + loading, under these conditions, has been described. Recently, potassium channel openers, which open adenosine triphosphate–sensitive K+ channels, have been reported to possess cardioprotective properties under global ischemic conditions. However, it is not known whether these novel agents could prevent intracellular Ca 2 + loading that could occur during cardioplegia. Intracellular Ca 2 + was monitored in ventricular myocytes, loaded with the Ca 2 +-sensitive fluorescent probe Fluo- 3 AM, using epifluorescent digital imaging and laser confocal microscopy. Exposure of a myocyte to a 16 mmol/L concentration of K+, a concentration of K+ commonly used in cardioplegic solutions, induced a nonhomogeneous increase in intracellular Ca 2 +. Potassium channel opening drugs, such as <b>aprikalim</b> or nicorandil, effectively prevented these solutions from increasing intracellular Ca 2 +. The preventive effect of potassium channel opening drugs was antagonized by glyburide, a selective blocker of adenosine triphosphate–sensitive K+ channels. This study demonstrates, at the single cardiac cell level, that solutions containing a 16 mmol/L concentration of K+ promote intracellular Ca 2 + loading, which can be prevented by potassium channel opening drugs. Therefore, potassium channel opening drugs should be considered to prevent intracellular Ca 2 + loading {{associated with the use of}} cardioplegic solutions.

40|$|Abstract We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that dilatation of cere-bral arterioles during hypoxia is mediated by activation of ATP-sensitive K ' channels. The diameter of pial arterioles was measured through a closed cranial window in anesthetized rabbits. Topical application of <b>aprikalim</b> (10 ` 6 mol/L), a direct activator of ATP-sensitive K ' channels, dilated pial arterioles by 18 + 3 % (mean+SEM). Glibenclamide (10 ` 6 mol/L), an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive K ' channels, virtually abolished aprikalim-induced vasodilatation. When arterial P 02 was re-duced from 129 ± 3 to 25 ± 1 mm Hg, the diameter of cerebral arterioles increased by 66 ± 9 % (P<. 05). Glibenclamide inhib-ypoxia produces relaxation of cerebral blood H vessels and marked increases in cerebral blood flow. 1 - 4 The mechanism that mediates hypoxia-induced vasodilatation in the cerebral circula-tion is poorly defined, although several studies suggest that adenosine may play an important role. 5 - 7 Activation of ATP-sensitive K ' channels {{appears to be a}} major mechanism that mediates vasodilatation. 8 - 11 In the coronary circulation, dilatation in response to hypoxia appears to be mediated by activation of ATP-sensitive K ' channels. 12 The first goal {{of the present study was}} to test {{the hypothesis that}} activation of ATP-sensitive K ' channels mediates dilatation of cere-bral arterioles during hypoxia in vivo. We attempted to determine whether dilatation of cerebral arterioles in response to hypoxia is attenuated by glibenclamide, a selective inhibitor of ATP-sensitive K ' channels. 9 ' 10 Several lines of evidence suggest that adenosine may contribute to cerebral vasodilatation during hypoxia. In some blood vessels, adenosine may activate ATP-sensi-tive K ' channels. 12 - 14 Thus, the second goal of the present study was to determine whether vasodilatation in response to adenosine is attenuated by glibenclamide...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Hyperpolarizing cardioplegia has {{recently}} been proposed for myocardial protection. To compare the protective effect of hyperpolarizing cardioplegia and depolarizing (hyperkalemic) cardioplegia on coronary endothelium, we studied porcine coronary arteries in the organ chamber. Methods: Relaxation mediated by the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) {{was used as the}} index of endothelial function because (1) hyperkalemia without ischemia does not impair the nitric oxide–mediated function according to previous studies and (2) EDHF relaxes vessels by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. Therefore depolarizing cardioplegia may inhibit this function, but hyperpolarizing cardioplegia may preserve it. EDHF-mediated relaxation was induced by bradykinin and the calcium ionophore A 23187 with the presence of indomethacin (7 μmol/L; INN: indometacin), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and N G-nitro-l-arginine (300 μmol), a nitric oxide biosynthesis inhibitor in U 46619 (30 nmol/L) -induced precontraction. The vessels were exposed to either hyperpolarizing cardioplegic solution (the potassium-channel opener <b>aprikalim,</b> 0. 1 mmol/L) or depolarizing cardioplegic solution (high potassium concentration, 20 mmol/L for A 23187 and 50 mmol/L for bradykinin experiments) for 1 hour with a constant supply of oxygen to exclude the effect of ischemia. Results: EDHF-mediated relaxation was significantly impaired in either A 23187 or bradykinin studies (80. 1 % ± 7. 5 % vs 24. 9 % ± 14. 2 %, p = 0. 004, n = 8 in each group for A 23187, and 71. 4 % ± 4. 7 %, n = 13, vs 40. 5 % ± 12. 9 %, n = 7, p = 0. 01, for bradykinin). The effective concentration causing 50 % of maximal relaxation was significantly increased in the A 23187 experiments with the treatment of hyperkalemia. In contrast, in aprikalim-treated arteries, the EDHF-mediated relaxation induced by either A 23187 or bradykinin was unchanged. Conclusions: We conclude that EDHF-mediated coronary endothelial function is maximally preserved by hyperpolarizing cardioplegia but impaired by depolarizing cardioplegia. These findings support the use of hyperpolarizing cardioplegia in cardiac operations. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 114 : 643 - 50...|$|E
40|$|Cerebrovascular {{reactivity}} {{is severely}} affected by ischemia, {{and changes in}} vascular responses have been reported after cortical spreading depression and head trauma as well. Cortical depolarization (CD) occurs during ischemia, cortical spreading depression, and head trauma, but its effects on cerebrovascular reactivity are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that CD induced by KCI diminishes the vascular responsiveness to various vasodilatory stimuli in piglets. Responses of pial arterioles were determined by changes in vascular diameter by use of a closed cranial window and intravital microscopy. Baseline arteriolar diameters were 105 +/- 3 mu m (mean +/- SEM, n = 27). CD was elicited by topical administration of 1 mol/L KCl for 3 min. Vascular responses were measured before and 1 h after CD. KCI elicited CD and constricted arterioles by 54 +/- 4 % (n = 27). N-methyl-D-aspartate induced dose-dependent vasodilation that was unaffected by CD; the percent changes were 9 +/- 1 versus 8 +/- 1 (before and after CD) at 10 (- 5) mol/L, 19 +/- 2 versus 18 +/- 3 at 5 x 10 - 5 mol/L, and 29 +/- 2 versus 26 +/- 3 at 10 (- 4) mol/L (n = 9). Hypercapnic vasodilation was not diminished by CD; the percent changes were 15 +/- 2 I versus 16 +/- 4 at 5 %, and 27 +/- 5 versus 27 +/- 6 at 10 % inspired CO 2 (n = 8), <b>Aprikalim</b> and forskolin caused dilation that was also resistant to prior CD; the percent change values were 21 +/- 4 versus, 18 +/- 3 and 16 +/- 2 versus 16 +/- 4 at 10 (- 6) mol/L, 36 +/- 5 versus 34 +/- 5 and 34 +/- 7 versus 37 +/- 7 at 10 - 5 mol/L (n = 8), respectively. Finally, calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced vasodilation was unaffected by CD; percent changes were 15 +/- 3 versus 16 +/- 2 at 10 (- 7) mol/L and 26 +/- 4 versus 22 +/- 3 at 10 (- 4) mol/L (n = 8). The intact vascular responses after CD suggest that this component is not responsible for decreased cerebrovascular reactivity after ischemia, head trauma, or cortical spreading depression...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the major}} killers and cardiac operations are frequently performed. My research interests {{in the last decade}} in the following fields in cardiovascular and surgical research are under one major theme - to understand the mechanism of cardiac surgery related vascular systems and to improve the results of cardiac surgery. These fields are: 1) analyses of operative results in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and heart valve operations; 2) experimental studies on the endothelial function related to nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization; 3) experimental studies on the grafts for CABG, particularly on arterial grafts; 4) experimental studies on function of the coronary circulation directly related to open heart surgery and heart transplantation. The vascular endothelial function is composed of complex substances and NO is the major mediator. When the NO production is inhibited, another mechanism - endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization {{plays an important role in}} the endothelium-smooth muscle function. We for the first time directly measured the NO release by electrochemical methods and the hyperpolarization by electrophysiological methods in the human vessels used as arterial and venous grafts. In CABG, venous grafts have high occlusion rates and successful use of various arteries is achieved. However, arterial grafts have different tendency to develop spasm and the long-term patency of the grafts may be different. A unanimous opinion on the choice of the grafts has not been formed. We have performed a serious of experiments to investigate I) the smooth muscle contraction and the endothelial function; 2) the possible spasmogens (vasoconstrictors); 3) receptor function; 4) morphometric characteristics; and 5) segmental differences regarding the reactivity. Based on these studies, we have proposed, for the first time, a functional classification to understand the difference among arterial grafts. Further, we have carried out extensive pharmacologic studies to examine the effect of a wide range of vasodilators to form a scientific basis for clinical antispastic therapy in the arterial grafts. This has resulted in successful clinical protocols. Further, the coronary endothelial function is related to the postoperative heart function. Previous studies were focused on the nitric oxide (NO) release in the coronary circulation. We have demonstrated that NO release is tolerant to the cardioplcgic exposure if the ischemic effect is excluded. However, the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) mediated function (electrical hyperpolarization and mechanical relaxation) in both large and micro coronary arteries is altered after the hyperkalemic cardioplcgic arrest or donor heart preservation with hyperkalemic solutions. We have, for the first time, demonstrated this and proposed a mechanism that this is related to the prolonged partial depolarization of the cellular membrane of the smooth muscle and inhibition of potassium (K⁺) channels. Further, for the first time again, our work has demonstrated that hyperpolarizing cardioplegia using K⁺ channel openers (such as <b>aprikalim</b> or KRN 4884) is superior to the depolarizing (hyperkalemic) cardioplegia with regard to the protection of the EDHF-related endothelial function. We anticipate that the findings from my studies will be useful in the further improvement of the results of cardiac surgery...|$|E
