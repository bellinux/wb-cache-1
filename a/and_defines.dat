5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of feed-in tariffs—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid <b>and</b> <b>defines</b> a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to {{a high level of}} investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristic of Noh stage is its independent roof that hangs over the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes {{the sanctity of the}} stage, with its architectural design derived from the worship pavilion (haiden) or sacred dance pavilion (kagura-den) of Shinto shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space <b>and</b> <b>defines</b> the stage as an architectural entity.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Constitution {{adopted in}} 1848 {{is the legal}} {{foundation}} of the modern federal state. It is among the oldest constitutions in the world. A new Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons <b>and</b> <b>defines</b> federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level: the bicameral parliament (legislative), the Federal Council (executive) and the Federal Court (judicial).|$|E
5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, <b>and</b> <b>defines</b> a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|E
5|$|Golondrina points (formerly Plainview Golondrina) are {{lanceolate}} spear or dart projectile points, {{of medium}} size, dated to the transitional Paleo-Indian Period, between 9000–7000 BP. Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts {{and may have}} served to bring down medium-sized animals such as deer, as well as functioning as butchering knives. Distribution is widespread throughout most of Texas, and points have also been discovered in Arkansas and Mexico. The concentration of Golondrina specimens is highest across the South Texas Plains, where the point is the most prevalent of Paleo-Indian types <b>and</b> <b>defines</b> a distinctive cultural pattern for the region. The Golondrina point is so named for its flared basal corners ("ears"), which resemble a swallow's (golondrina in Spanish) split tail. Classification of Golondrina can be difficult because of its similarity to other types, particularly the Plainview point, to which it was originally thought to be related.|$|E
