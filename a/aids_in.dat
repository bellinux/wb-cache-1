5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 <b>aids</b> <b>in</b> neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E

5|$|Feathers are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that <b>aids</b> <b>in</b> thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types of feathers, each serving {{its own set of}} purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and {{all other}} living {{tetrapods}} have a rod-like bone called the stapes that <b>aids</b> <b>in</b> hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum —or homologous tympanum— to the inner ear. Temnospondyls also have a stapes, which projects into the otic cavity. The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe-finned fishes. The positioning of the stapes and {{the shape of the}} otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous, but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Therefore, ear structures in temnospondyls were not ancestral to those of all other tetrapods.|$|E

40|$|Background: Regulated intramembranous {{proteolysis}} of the amyloid-b {{precursor protein}} by the c-secretase yields amyloidb, {{which is the}} major component of the amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the APP intracellular domain (<b>AID).</b> <b>In</b> vitro studies have involved <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> apoptosis and gene transcription. In vivo studies, which utilize transgenic mice expressing <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> the forebrain, only support a role for <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> apoptosis but not gene transcription. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we have further characterized several lines of AID transgenic mice by crossing them with human Tau-bearing mice, to determine whether over-expression of <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> the forebrain provokes AD-like pathologic features in this background. We have {{found no evidence that}} AID overexpression induces AD-like characteristics, such as activation of GSK- 3 b, hyperphosphorylation of Tau and formation of neurofibrillary pathology. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, these data suggest that AID transgenic mice do not represent a model that reproduces the overt biochemical and anatomo-pathologic lesions observed in AD patients. They can still be a valuable tool to understand the role of <b>AID</b> <b>in</b> enhancing the cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, whose pathways still need to b...|$|R

5|$|In nuclear polyadenylation, a poly(A) tail {{is added}} to an RNA {{at the end of}} transcription.

Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed histone downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3' end of the histone mRNA is formed.|$|E

5|$|Political {{activism}} in American gay communities was {{transformed by the}} arrival of <b>AIDS</b> <b>in</b> the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used direct action tactics. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of <b>AIDS</b> <b>in</b> the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups Queer Nation, Pink Panthers and the Lesbian Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.|$|E
