40|$|Sustainability can be {{understood}} as the concept of being in business permanently. This interpretation leads to an 'attitude' based on long-term thinking and value-driven activities to realise organisational benefits. The key basis for sustainable management processes in our knowledge-driven economy is formed by organisational knowledge and learning processes. But how can a manager with such an attitude concretely implement sustainability in his strategic work? What are the main assets in his specific organisation? How does the roadmap for the sustainability strategy - optimised for his organisation - look like? This paper provides answers and offers with the Kiel maturity model an innovative approach for practitioners with a scientific underpinning. It aims to facilitate the implementation of an individualised knowledge management as the main asset that focuses on organisational learning. In our knowledge-based society, the importance of organisational knowledge and learning strongly increases. In this paper, knowledge and learning are seen as the most relevant <b>asset</b> <b>group.</b> The Kiel maturity model focuses this <b>asset</b> <b>group</b> and offers for future-oriented management leaders an individual adaptable framework for developing their specific sustainability roadmap. knowledge management; KM; meta-learning; sustainability; learning organisations; future-oriented management; Kiel maturity model; sustainable management processes; organisational learning; organisational knowledge...|$|E

These are low to medium rise structures which often have varying functional requirements and usage. Building assets are the second largest <b>asset</b> <b>group</b> managed by local government. Efficient management of these assets requires understanding of deterioration of building components, identifying effective condition monitoring methods, forecasting deterioration and resulting maintenance expenditure, decision making considering risk, cost and sustainability throughout life cycle of assets.

The implemented method is based on a probabilistic model which takes into account all the uncertainties of the involved variables and allows following a performance approach based on given loss or damage thresholds. Given the landslide area-extent and type as the only deterministic input, all other properties to derive landslide severity and frequency are statistically inferred from actual landslides and probabilistically managed to derive probability density functions of the demand of resistance. In turn, the capacity of resistance (i. e., fragility functions) is derived via damage surveys and cards compilation for each investigated <b>asset</b> <b>group</b> (structures, roads and lifelines) and for each limit state (aesthetic, functional and structural). Finally, convolution of landslide hazard, asset fragility and exposure (as the amount of potentially damaged goods) allows the computation of the risk for each limit state condition...|$|E

40|$|The {{accounting}} procedures cannot be analyzed without a previous evaluation. Value is in general a very subjective issue, usually {{the result of}} a monetary evaluation made to a specific <b>asset,</b> <b>group</b> of assets or entities, or to some rendered services. Within the economic sciences, value comes from its very own deep history. In accounting, the concept of value had a late and fragile start. The term of value must not be misinterpreted as being the same thing with cost, even though value is frequently measured through costs. At the origin of the international accounting standards lays the framework for preparing, presenting and disclosing the financial statements. The framework stays as a reference matrix, as a standard of standards, as a constitution of financial accounting. According to the international framework, the financial statements use different evaluation basis: the hystorical cost, the current cost, the realisable (settlement) value, the present value (the present value of cash flows). Choosing the evaluation basis and the capital maintenance concept will eventually determine the accounting evaluation model used in preparing the financial statements of a company. The multitude of accounting evaluation models differentiate themselves one from another through various relevance and reliable degrees of accounting information and therefore, accountants (the prepares of financial statements) must try to equilibrate these two main qualitative characteristics of financial information...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{began with}} an {{introduction}} and literature review in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, I propose a new intertemporal asset-pricing model based on heterogeneous beliefs to bring together the concur- rent theories that could generate value and momentum effects. In this model, I assume that such behaviour occurs simply due to an agnostic view of forecasting returns considering the dominant strategy in the market. Given the endogenous price determination in the model, individuals were expected to adjust their own strategies to match the dominant strategy to obtain higher profits (from more accurate forecasts). The idea was to bridge the literature on intertemporal asset allocation with the one on heterogeneous beliefs. In Chapters 3 and 4, I consider the empirical problem of implementing Markowitz (1952) mean-variance optimisation on a portfolio of stocks. In particular, I focus on the out-of-sample performance of the minimum-variance portfolio obtained {{from the use of}} <b>asset</b> <b>group</b> information and regularisation methods to obtain more stable estimates of the parameters in the model. Specifically, in Chapter 3, I introduce the use of regularisation methods to the portfolio selection problem and a literature review on the subject. In Chapter 4, I propose two alternative approaches {{for the use of the}} group structure information and to obtain more stable and regularised minimum-variance portfolios. I show that these procedures produce significantly better results in the portfolios compared with the unconstrained minimum-variance portfolios estimated from the whole data set in terms of portfolio variance and the Sharpe ratio.

40|$|Once the TAS 41 “Agriculture” {{standard}} which {{mentions the}} regulation of accounting transactions about agricultural activities became valid {{for the first time}} in 2006 in Turkey, biological assets and the living assets that are used to grow those assets began to be accounted within the scope of this law. The legal practice was valid until 2014 but after a revision of the TAS 41, the concept of “bearer plant” was added to the standard in 2014. Bearer plants, unlike the living * Yrd. Doç.

The bearer plants which have this property came under the TAS 16 “Tangible” standards with the amendment. The study bring out the hazelnut farming which is a type of herbal production. As a biological asset hazelnut fruit is derived from the filbert and filberts fully comply with the all properties of the bearer plants which are defined in TAS 41. So filberts are described as bearer plants in the study. The aim of the study is to offer suggestions about which accounting transactions should be done coherently to the TAS from capitalization the multi-stemmed shrubs to end of term assessment and evaluation for manufacturing companies dealing with hazelnut cultivation. For this reason, it is carried out the case study method in the research and submitted samples for the practice based on real data of a hazelnut grove whose owner is Durak Hazelnut Corporation, one of the important companies in hazelnut industry in Turkey. In the study results, in general it is found that the filberts classified as bearer plants have a separate value which are on a plowed land, from this separate value in the initial recognition hazelnut filberts can be recorded in the account of other tangible assets where they are in the tangible <b>asset</b> <b>group</b> and since a value increase of hazelnut groves by years it is defined that it will be a better approach to use revaluation model rather than cost model as an endterm measuring method. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{analyzed}} {{the correlation between}} asset and liabilities using the canonical correlation method, {{in the case of}} correlation we analyze the interdependence between two variables, by using canonical correlation analyses we study the interdependence between two groups of variables, X consisting of p variables and Y with q variables from which the best linear combination can be constructed to maximize the correlation between X and Y. While on the financial markets the relation between variables may be linear or non-linear and although canonical correlation analyses only the linear combination of variables it is a more efficient tool than then simple correlation. The <b>asset</b> <b>group</b> which we analyze is composed of different types of loans, derivatives and other earning assets, while in the group of liabilities we have deposits (short and long term), interest bearing liabilities and trading liabilities. We find that the assets and liabilities in the banking sector are directly linked. In the context of the global financial crisis (2007 - 2008) and the afterwards financial recession this direct correlation between assets and liabilities created a vicious cycle in which the losses from assets had a direct impact on the liabilities which also influenced the levels of assets. The behavior of different variables is important, especially in the financial markets, mainly due to the structure of financial markets. The banking sector and the systemic risk associated with it can affect the financial system and even the whole economy so the study of the correlation of assets and liabilities may give us insights on the causes of the financial crises. We use a panel of fifty-nine European banks for the 2004 - 2011 period and we analyses the correlation between assets and liabilities. We find that there exists a direct and strong connection between different classes of assets held by banks and the structure of liabilities. The impact of the economic crisis on the banking sector has shown that this kind of connection between the structure of assets and liabilities is not the best choice because a negative fluctuation in assets generates a negative impact on the structure of liabilities. The direct connection between assets and liabilities amplifies the systemic risk of the banking sector and can also have an impact on other markets due to their spillover effects...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project endeavors to frame a methodology {{that can be}} used to categorize firm value strategies (production logics) and choices of factor inputs (tangible and intangible assets), which are used to fuel production cycles for goods and services outputs. A secondary goal of the research is to attempt to determine what <b>asset</b> <b>group</b> combinations (resources) are combined by various classes of firms to produce sustainable outcomes for the A/E/C firms in the survey. The National Bureau of Economic Research recently issued a system of national accounts (acknowledging both tangible and intangible assets) that reflects the macro-economy but at the same juncture, lamented the fact that a firm-level micro-economic schema did not exist to mirror the national system. This study makes an effort to redress that void by investigating how such a system of accounts - measured on the input side of the ledger [...] could begin to fill in a gap in information and understanding as pointed out by participants in the National Academy of Sciences symposium of 2009 entitled "Intangible Assets: Measuring and Enhancing Their Contribution to Corporate Value and Growth. " In brief, the research represents an effort to make a contribution to a growing body of knowledge about intangible assets by solidifying a framework within which both tangible and intangible assets may be more appropriately conceptualized and more adequately measured for purposes of current and future investigations. The research also provides a methodology for beginning to understand how some design and construction industry firms rely on specific asset categories for operating success, corporate stock value and business continuity. It is conceivable that managers would use a variation of the methodology to better balance ongoing investments in their firm's portfolio of tangible and intangible resources. The mixed methods used in this research support the following conclusions: 1) In terms of rank order of asset deployment categories by firms, intangible assets appear to have a modest edge over tangible assets for deployment by value shop firms (architecctural and engineering design firms), but these emphases are not consistent among value chain-oriented (construction) firms. 2) Although pronounced differences were expected, there was little evidence of differences in rank order of asset category accumulation and deployment by firms (according to the Delphi panel) regardless of whether the firm was focused on continuity and longevity or (alternatively) short-term profit maximization. 3) Because of their ambidexterity in production logic, the expert panel had difficulty placing EPC (Engineer - Procure - Construct), design-build and integrated services firms in a single Stabell - Fjeldstad value logic category, and a new composite category was posited based on Delphi panel feedback.
