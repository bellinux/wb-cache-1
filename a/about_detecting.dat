The original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, every thing depends on {{the selection of a}} spot with capabilities. What is said <b>about</b> <b>detecting</b> and bringing into practice nice relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of those mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought. The phrase quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no degree. That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The negative merit suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be circumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can be apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits of denial--to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the critical art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a [...] "Cato," [...] but we are in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an [...] "Inferno." [...] The thing done, however; the wonder accomplished; and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The sophists of the negative school who, through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What, in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.|$|E

Vakoch argues that replication of a putative SETI signal is essential for confirmation, and the lack of such replication means that past signals such as the Wow! signal have little credibility. [...] "Without corroboration from an independent observatory, a putative signal from extraterrestrials doesn't have a lot of credibility," he told CNN. He urged that HD 164595 should not be treated as a plausible candidate without further confirmation: “Assuming we don’t find any evidence of a transmitting civilization as we conduct follow-up observations, the worst outcome would be to turn HD 164595 into another Wow signal - seen once, never confirmed, but lurking in the imagination as perhaps really a message from another world. Unless we can observe another similar signal from the vicinity of this star, we need to dismiss the May 2015 signal as a spurious result, and not wishfully hope it was really from ET.” ...|$|E

The detection of DE genes has become increasingly useful in cancer studies, where oncogenes are only activated in a minority of samples.

In simulated examples, I compare MF to the traditional F-statistic, the outlier robust F-statistic in [10] and the outlier F-statistic in [10]. The aspects of comparison include the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) score, accuracy rate and reproducibility of gene lists.

40|$|Abstract. Network traffic {{anomalies}} {{detection and}} characterization {{has been a}} hot topic of research for many years. Although the field is very ad-vanced in the detection of network traffic anomalies, accurate automated classification {{is still a very}} challenging and unmet problem. This paper presents a new algorithm for automated classification of network traffic anomalies. The algorithm relies on three steps: (i) after an anomaly has been detected, identify all (or most) related packets or flow records; (ii) use these packets or flow records to derive several distinct metrics directly related to the anomaly; and (iii) classify the anomaly using these metrics in a signature-based approach. We show how this approach can act as a filter to reduce the false positive rate of detection algorithms, while pro-viding network operators with (additional) valuable information <b>about</b> <b>detected</b> anomalies. We validate our algorithm on two different datasets: the METROSEC project database and the MAWI traffic repository. ...|$|R
