40|$|Abstract: There are {{different}} {{structure of the}} network <b>and</b> the <b>variables,</b> <b>and</b> {{the process of learning}} Bayesian networks has a lot of different forms. The structure of the network can be unknown or known, <b>and</b> the <b>variables</b> can be observable or hidden in {{some or all of the}} data points. Consequently, there are four cases of learning Bayesian networks from data: known structure <b>and</b> observable <b>variables,</b> unknown structure <b>and</b> observable <b>variables,</b> known structure <b>and</b> unobservable <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> unknown structure <b>and</b> unobservable <b>variables.</b> In this paper, we focus on known structure <b>and</b> observable <b>variables,</b> unknown structure <b>and</b> observable <b>variables...</b>|$|R

5|$|Genome : The Liliaceae {{include the}} species {{with the largest}} genome size within the angiosperms, Fritillaria assyriaca (1C=127.4pg), while Tricyrtis macropoda is as small as 4.25pg. Chromosome numbers vary by genus.

5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, <b>and</b> <b>variable</b> degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E

The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E

5|$|Observed {{by humans}} {{since the dawn}} of history, the {{behaviour}} of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, myrmecologists, study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. Their complex <b>and</b> <b>variable</b> social structures have made ants ideal model organisms. Ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by Sir John Lubbock in 1881. Studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and sociobiology, and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies. Ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria, specially constructed glass framed enclosures. Individuals may be tracked for study by marking them with dots of colours.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large <b>and</b> <b>variable</b> {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E
5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{was placed in}} the genus Pitohui with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the whistlers. The hooded pitohui and the closely related variable pitohui were both found {{to be related to the}} Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui <b>and</b> <b>variable</b> pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui was the type species for the genus Pitohui, the hooded pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E

5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting <b>and</b> <b>variable</b> temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time.
