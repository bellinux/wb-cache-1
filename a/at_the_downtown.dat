5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May.

5|$|Between 1936 and 2001, {{the award}} was given {{at an annual}} gala {{ceremony}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Downtown</b> Athletic Club in New York City. The Downtown Athletic Club's facilities were damaged during the September 11, 2001 attacks. Due to financial difficulties stemming from the damage, the DAC declared bankruptcy in 2002, turning over its building to creditors. Following the club's bankruptcy {{and the loss of}} the original Downtown Athletic Club building, the Yale Club of New York City assumed presenting honors in 2002 and 2003. The ceremony was moved to the New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square for the 2002, 2003, and 2004 presentations, but since 2005, the event has been held at the venue now known as PlayStation Theater, also in Times Square. The move to the PlayStation Theater allowed the Downtown Athletic Club (and ultimately, the award's successor, The Heisman Trust) to resume full control of the event—the most prominent example of which was the return of the official portraits of past winners—despite the loss of the original presentation hall.|$|E
