He was {{left out of}} all five ODIs during the tour before heading home. He then played in all 14 of Punjab's round-robin matches in the 2009 Indian Premier League held in South Africa, taking 17 wickets at 22.94 with an economy rate of 7.74, and scored 196 runs at 19.60. He started strongly, taking nine wickets in four matches {{in the early stages}} of the tournament, before taking only two in the next five matches, and ending with six in the last three fixtures. Punjab failed to make the semi-finals.|$|E

Surveillance, that is continual observation {{of a time}} series {{with the goal of}} timely detection of possible important changes in the underlying process, is used in quality control, economics, medicine and other fields.

Since the methods also have interesting optimality properties, the results also enlighten different criteria of optimality. Evaluations are made of the "The Likelihood Ratio Method" which utilizes an assumption on the intensity and has the Shiryaevoptimality. Also, the Roberts and the CUSUM method are evaluated. These two methods combine the likelihood ratios in other ways. A comparison is also made with the Shewhart method, which is a commonly used method...|$|R
5|$|The next day, Aya {{sees the}} orange {{mass of people}} from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has {{engineered}} special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>alarming</b> rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board.|$|E
5|$|While a small {{minority}} of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people, a few species are of conservation concern. The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding cockroach (Panesthia lata) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee, but the cockroach may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself. The introduction of rats, the spread of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity. Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, Delosia ornata and Nocticola gerlachi. Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels. Only 600 Delosia ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist, and these are threatened by a hotel development. No action has been taken to save the two cockroach species, but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction. In the former Soviet Union, cockroach populations have been declining <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>alarming</b> rate; this may be exaggerated, or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic. One species of roach, Simandoa conserfariam is considered extinct in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The first F-111C {{was officially}} {{delivered}} in 1968, finally giving Australia an aircraft that could fly to Jakarta, drop bombs, and return without refueling. (The RAAF only acquired air-to-air refueling for the F/A-18, possibly to avoid causing difficulties with other Asian countries {{by increasing the}} F-111C's already great range.) Training began in 1967, with RAAF personnel seeing terrain-following radar and other sophisticated equipment for the first time. However, development delays and structural problems delayed acceptance of aircraft by the RAAF until 1973. These issues were mainly {{to do with the}} wing attach points, and the redesign of the F-111 engine intakes. Completion of contractual requirements to the satisfaction of Australia also took time, damaging the morale of the hundreds of trained RAAF personnel who had little to do. The program costs, during 1963–1967, grew <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>alarming</b> rate; estimates by the USAF {{at the start of the}} program was placed at US$124.5 million, but by April 1967 had risen to $237.75 million. While the initial price of US$5.21 million per aircraft was capped at US$5.95 million, R, labor, and other costs were not. The rising price, three unexplained losses of USAF F-111As in Vietnam during their first month of deployment, and the British and U.S. Navy's orders' cancellations caused further controversy in Australia during 1968. By 1973, however, when the F-111A had accumulated 250,000 flight hours, it had the best safety record among contemporary aircraft, which presaged the F-111C's own excellent record.|$|E

One is the "Exponentially weighted moving average" method, EWMA, (with several variants) and the other one is the CUSUM method (Vmask). Illustrations are presented to explain the observed differences. It is demonstrated that a high probability of alarm in the beginning (although it gives good ARL properties) might cause difficulties since a low predicted value makes action redundant at early alarms...|$|R

25|$|A news {{commentator}} {{writing for}} The Lancet, Andrew Meldrum, said that President Mugabe’s Youth Militia threatened health professionals that provided medical treatment to political opponents.

According to Douglas Gwatidzo, {{the chairman of the}} Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights group, Zimbabwe had only one doctor assigned to a group of 12,000 citizens. Doctors in Zimbabwe fill only 25% of the medical posts available, and even fewer specialist positions are taken. According to Meldrum, this poses serious challenges to health care for diseases like HIV/AIDS and cholera. Similarly, the effects of cholera are exacerbated without proper nutrition, and Zimbabwe has faced food shortages for the last several years.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{decrease in}} the member of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>alarming</b> rate, thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, {{increase the amount of}} detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth. In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources.|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{surveillance}} is used {{to detect}} a change in a process. It might for example be a change {{of the level of}} a characteristic of an economic time series or a change of heart rate in intensive care. An alarm is triggered when there is enough evidence of a change. When surveillance is used in practice it is necessary to know the characteristics of the method, in order to know which action that is appropriate <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>alarm.</b> The average run length, the probability of <b>a</b> false <b>alarm,</b> the probability of successful detection and the predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm</b> are measures that are used when comparing the performance of different methods for statistical surveillance. In the first paper a detailed comparison between two important methods, the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average and the CUSUM, is made. Some consequences of using only the average run length as the measure of performance are demonstrated. Differences between the methods are discussed in regard to the measures mentioned above. The second paper is focused on the predictive value of <b>an</b> <b>alarm,</b> that is the relative frequency of motivated alarms among all alarms.
