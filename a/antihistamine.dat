5|$|If {{no signs}} of an {{allergic}} reaction are present, an ice pack or commercially available sprays are used to relieve the pain. Stingose is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting. Other treatments include washing the stung area with soap and water, and if continuous pain remains for several days, <b>antihistamine</b> tablets are taken for one to three days.|$|E
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that seasonal allergies affect up to approximately 44 % of the population. Many people compromise the quality of their lives in order to function on a day to day basis. There are several treatments that are available in alleviating symptoms related to seasonal allergies, but many people have difficulty adhering to certain recommended regimens. Intranasal corticosteroids have been thought of as the first line of therapy in the treatment of seasonal allergies, but these require daily treatments. Systemic <b>antihistamines,</b> on the other hand, provide allergic relief on an as-needed basis, but are subject to a higher possibility of side effects as they are systemically metabolized. Topical <b>antihistamines</b> are a class of medications that could possibly provide similar, if not better, effectiveness in symptomatic control of seasonal allergies. Methods: The focus {{of this study was to}} review clinical trials providing comparison between topical <b>antihistamines</b> and systemic <b>antihistamines.</b> Clinical trials within the last fifteen years comparing topical <b>antihistamines</b> with systemic <b>antihistamines</b> and with placebos, were carefully selected and analyzed. Double-blinded and randomized clinical trials of specific topical <b>antihistamines</b> and systemic <b>antihistamines</b> were identified by a systematic literature search using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PUBMED search engines. Results: Based on the seven randomized, double-blinded, and placebo controlled clinical trials, the efficacy of topical <b>antihistamines</b> was significantly greater than systemic <b>antihistamines.</b> Both topical and systemic <b>antihistamines</b> significantly improved symptoms compared to placebo. Conclusion: Overall, topical and systemic <b>antihistamines</b> reduced seasonal allergy symptoms, particularly allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. This review confirms the effectiveness of topical <b>antihistamines</b> when compared to systemic <b>antihistamines...</b>|$|R

5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating <b>antihistamine</b> and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of <b>antihistamine</b> tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from the sting.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anti{{histamine}}s</b> {{that block}} the histamine H1 receptors {{are the first}} line of therapy. First generation <b>antihistamines</b> such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax) block both central and peripheral H1 receptors and can be very sedating. Second generation <b>antihistamines</b> such as loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), or desloratadine (Clarinex) selectively antagonize only the peripheral H1 receptors and are therefore less sedating, less anticholinergic, and generally preferred over the first generation <b>antihistamines.</b> To obtain the maximal benefit, it is important to take the <b>antihistamines</b> daily instead of only during acute exacerbations. Patients who donâ€™t respond to the maximum dose of H1 <b>antihistamines</b> may benefit from the addition of H2 <b>antihistamines.</b> However, not all combinations have proven beneficial. Studies have shown improvement with the combination of hydroxyzine and cimetidine but not with the combination of cetirizine and cimetidine.|$|R

40|$|Urticaria is a {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases. Chronic urticaria significantly impacts quality-of-life of patients. Second generation, non-sedating <b>antihistamines</b> are recommended as {{first line treatment}} for chronic spontaneous urticaria. In patients with inadequate control of symptoms, increase in dosage of non-sedating <b>antihistamines</b> up to four fold has been recommended. This recommendation is based on low cost, good safety and good evidence of efficacy of non-sedating, second generation <b>antihistamines.</b> This article reviewed Indian data on up-dosing of <b>antihistamines</b> in chronic urticaria.

25|$|Antidepressant {{doses of}} doxepin {{are defined as}} 25 to 300mg/day, {{although}} are typically above 75mg/day. <b>Antihistamine</b> doses, including for dermatological uses and as a sedative/hypnotic for insomnia, {{are considered to be}} 3 to 25mg, although higher doses between 25 and 50mg and in some cases even up to 150mg have been used to treat insomnia. At low doses, below 25mg, doxepin is a pure <b>antihistamine.</b> At antidepressant doses of above 25mg, doxepin has significant antiadrenergic, antiserotonergic, and anticholinergic effects, and these activities contribute to its side effects.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine was {{discovered}} in 1951. It was initially developed as an <b>antihistamine</b> and major tranquilizer for use in patients with schizophrenia; its antidepressant effects were discovered serendipitously when moods of patients improved.|$|E
25|$|Other drugs {{related to}} {{hydroxyzine}} are cyclizine, buclizine, and meclizine, and they share {{all or most}} of the benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and side effects of hydroxyzine. The second-generation <b>antihistamine</b> cetirizine is in fact one of the metabolites of hydroxyzine produced in the human body. Unlike hydroxyzine, cetirizine is not reported to appreciably cross the blood-brain barrier, but it has been reported to be associated with dystonic reactions as well as sedation. Therefore, it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective <b>antihistamine</b> but removing {{some or all of the}} anxiolytic and other psychoactive properties, but it may cause dystonic reactions and drowsiness in some patients.|$|E
40|$|Background: Allergic {{rhinitis}} and urticaria are chronic persistent allergic {{conditions that}} need proper management as they significantly reduce {{quality of life}} measures. Of the many pharmacological options of allergic rhinitis and urticaria, second-generation <b>antihistamines</b> are the mainstay of therapy. Aims: This review focuses on the knowledge of medical residents toward prescribing <b>antihistamines,</b> {{according to the new}} ARIA and GA 2 LEN guidelines for allergic rhinitis and urticaria, attempting to find the cause of less prescription of newer second-generation <b>antihistamines</b> by finding out the knowledge and attitude of the doctors prescribing them to the patients. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out among resident doctors at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Primary data from 100 resident doctors, who gave their informed consent, was collected. A prevalidated questionnaire regarding knowledge, attitude and prescribing practice of <b>antihistamines</b> was filled up. The data was then analyzed with suitable statistical tests. Every question was first validated using the Chi-square test, and significance was below 10 % hence proving validity of the questions. Results: Out of the doctors surveyed, 82 % of doctors said they prescribed second-generation <b>antihistamines,</b> while 18 % still prescribed first-generation <b>antihistamines.</b> Out of the 82 % that prescribed second-generation <b>antihistamines,</b> 8. 9 % also prescribed first-generation <b>antihistamines</b> as well. 23 % of doctors surveyed had heard about the ARIA and GAL 2 EN guidelines and their recommendations for prescribing second-generation <b>antihistamines</b> over the older first-generation <b>antihistamines,</b> while 77 % of them had not heard of these position papers. Conclusion: First-generation or classic <b>antihistamines</b> are still overused {{due to the lack of}} knowledge of various guidelines that have been published. The main reason for not prescribing the second-generation <b>antihistamines</b> was due to the increased cost per tablet compared to the more economical first-generation <b>antihistamines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: H 1 <b>antihistamines</b> {{are widely}} used as {{therapeutics}} for allergic diseases. Sedation is a well-known side effect of H 1 <b>antihistamines</b> and sometimes it is life-threatening for patients. Thus {{it is important to}} evaluate the sedative properties of H 1 <b>antihistamines</b> to avoid side effects. For this purpose, histamine H 1 receptor (H 1 R) occupancy and proportional impairment ratios (PIR) are now being used. However, {{it is not easy to}} obtain these parameters. Here, we sought to evaluate the sedative properties of H 1 <b>antihistamines</b> by means of a large-scale surveillance at health insurance pharmacies. Methods: The survey was conducted at 37 health insurance pharmacies. The therapeutic efficacy and the degree of sleepiness were quantified through a questionnaire using the visual analog scale (VAS) directly from 1742 patients who received H 1 <b>antihistamines.</b> Results: The degree of sleepiness caused by the first-generation <b>antihistamines</b> was significantly higher than that of the second-generation <b>antihistamines.</b> The high VAS score in case of efficacy was found in d-chlorpheniramine, olopatadine, and ebastine. Among the mean values of efficacy, all second-generation <b>antihistamines</b> except for loratadine, bepotastine, and mequitazine were significantly higher than that of clemastine. Regarding the degree of sleepiness, clemastine scored the highest VAS score, and significantly lower scores were obtained in all second-generation <b>antihistamines.</b> Conclusions: The sedative properties of the H 1 <b>antihistamines</b> obtained from VAS analysis were very similar to those of H 1 R occupancy from positron emission tomography (PET) studies and PIR from meta-analysis. Our results indicate that large-scale surveillance using VAS might be useful to evaluate the profiles of H 1 <b>antihistamines...</b>|$|R
25|$|Hydroxyzine's {{predominant}} {{mechanism of}} action is as a potent and selective histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. This action is responsible for its <b>antihistamine</b> and sedative effects. Unlike many other first-generation antihistamines, hydroxyzine has very low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and in accordance, has low or no propensity for producing anticholinergic side effects. In addition to its <b>antihistamine</b> activity, hydroxyzine {{has also been shown}} to act more weakly as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the dopamine D2 receptor, and the Î±1-adrenergic receptor. The weak antiserotonergic effects of hydroxyzine likely underlie its usefulness as an anxiolytic, as other antihistamines without such properties have not been found to be effective in the treatment of anxiety.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{permanent}} effects to people from this condition. Orally administered hydroxyzine, an <b>antihistamine,</b> is sometimes prescribed to treat swimmer's itch and similar dermal allergic reactions. In addition, bathing in oatmeal, baking soda, or Epsom salts {{can also provide}} relief of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|At doses used {{to treat}} depression, doxepin appears to inhibit the reuptake of {{serotonin}} and norepinephrine and to have <b>antihistamine,</b> adrenergic and serotonin receptor antagonistic, and anticholinergic activities; at low doses {{used to treat}} insomnia {{it appears to be}} selective for the histamine H1 receptor.|$|E
50|$|Second-generation <b>antihistamines</b> {{cross the}} blood-brain barrier {{to a much}} lower degree than the first-generation <b>antihistamines.</b> Their main benefit is they {{primarily}} affect peripheral histamine receptors and therefore are less sedating. However, high doses can still induce drowsiness through acting on the central nervous system. Some second-generation <b>antihistamines,</b> notably cetirizine, can interact with CNS psychoactive drugs such as bupropion and benzodiazepines.|$|R

25|$|The (S)-(+) {{enantiomer}} of mirtazapine {{is responsible}} for antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, while the (R)-(â€“) enantiomer {{is responsible for}} antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor. Both enantiomers are involved in antagonism of the H1 and Î±2-adrenergic receptors, although the (S)-(+) enantiomer is the stronger <b>antihistamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since many of {{the uses}} of <b>antihistamines</b> involve {{conditions}} such as rashes, which should be treatable by local application, there is some rationale for developing drugs for topical use. The known side effects of <b>antihistamines</b> could in principle be avoided if the drug were functionalized to avoid systemic absorption. The known poor absorption of quat salts make such derivatives attractive for nonabsorbable <b>antihistamines</b> for topical use.Thus, reaction of the well-known antihistaminic drug promethazine with methylchloride leads to thiazinamium chloride.|$|R
