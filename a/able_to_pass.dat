5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of the stations seldom had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> underneath the bridge at low tide.) However, on 15 December 1975, Bessie Surtees collided with the Swing Bridge, forcing it to close {{for the rest of}} that weekend.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins with}} Arthur Penhaligon and Leaf {{attempting}} {{to return to}} Earth after their adventures in the Border Sea. While Leaf is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> {{through the front door}} and return to Earth, the presence of a Nithling duplicate of Arthur prevents him from doing so, and he is forced to remain in the Lower House.|$|E
5|$|The {{committees}} {{are governed by}} the Standing Orders of the Senate, {{as well as being}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> their own resolutions to govern certain aspects of their operations (such as the processing of correspondence and submissions to inquiries).|$|E
5000|$|It had <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>passed</b> {{completely}} {{through a}} two-inch (internal diameter) ring.|$|R
5000|$|Bacteria, viruses, {{and other}} organisms are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>passed</b> from mother <b>to</b> child. Several {{vertically}} transmitted infections {{are included in}} the TORCH complex, which stands for: ...|$|R
50|$|Proxy {{voting is}} the type of voting where a {{registered}} citizen who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> vote <b>passes</b> on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.|$|R
5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|As a goaltender, Lehman was {{a strong}} skater and good puckhandler. He chased down loose pucks, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the puck to his forwards, {{surprising}} the other team's defenders. Playing in the OPHL, Lehman scored a goal by shooting the puck in the opponent's net. The first NHL goaltender to duplicate such a feat was Ron Hextall, who did it in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through it with no resistance.|$|E
25|$|He died on 30 December 1965. On his death, his titles were split; his daughter, Ann, {{inherited}} the peerage, as this title was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>passed</b> down the female line; the baronetcy <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> his younger brother, Ewan.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{contemporary}} {{scientists were}} unable to find illusionism in Faticoni's work, the media frequently suggested that his unusually abilities were due to other-worldly forces. Popular psychics of the time suggested that spirits assisted him with staying afloat. Although the 'Human Cork' promised to reveal the secret of his buoyancy, he died before he was <b>able</b> <b>to,</b> <b>passing</b> away on August 2, 1931 at St. Vincent's Hospital whilst visiting relatives in Jacksonville, Florida. Faticoni's obituary in the New York Times carried the headline; [...] "Human Cork dies, secret untold".|$|R
5000|$|The story {{revolved}} around a boy, Bobby, and his girlfriend, {{who happened to}} be a ghost. As such, she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly, <b>pass</b> through walls, and do all sorts of ghostly things, causing great hilarity and hi-jinks.|$|R
5|$|The FBB {{closed the}} Security Zone checkpoints, {{but by then}} Stauffenberg's car had been let through two of them {{as he left the}} area. Contrary to the imposed {{security}} doctrines in place, Stauffenberg and his adjutant were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the closed Security Zone 3 checkpoint and proceed to the airport for the flight to Berlin. They succeeded in getting away before clarity of the events could be established by the military and security personnel at the Wolf's Lair complex.|$|E
5|$|The three cruisers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> {{through the}} line of drifters, and at 03:30 began attacking the small barrage ships. The Austro-Hungarians {{frequently}} gave the drifter crews warning to abandon ship before opening fire. In some instances, the drifter crews chose to fight: Gowan Lee returned fire on the Austo-Hungarian ships. The ship was heavily damaged, but remained afloat; her captain—Joseph Watt—was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorm asthma is the {{triggering}} of an asthma {{attack by}} environmental conditions directly {{caused by a}} local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.|$|E
6000|$|The chief {{shook his}} head. [...] "Winter coming for good," [...] he said, waving his hand towards {{the range of}} snowy summits to the north. [...] "Clouds there still; if stop, not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cross <b>pass</b> till next summer." ...|$|R
50|$|RSS {{aggregators}} such as Google Reader and Bloglines may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{receive and}} <b>pass</b> on RSS feeds that are blocked when accessed directly.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this pardon, Martin was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get legislation <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> assist the Rhode Island Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force to expedite its investigation of traders of child pornography and other cybercrimes.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{completing}} her Ph.D., Kelsey {{joined the}} University of Chicago faculty. In 1942, {{like many other}} pharmacologists, Kelsey {{was looking for a}} synthetic cure for malaria. As a result of these studies, Kelsey learned that some drugs are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the placental barrier. While there she also met fellow faculty member Dr. Fremont Ellis Kelsey, whom she married in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold and John André {{finally met}} on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On {{the morning of}} September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, the ship that was {{intended}} to carry André back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André {{so that he would}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark, Meera Reed, and Benjen Stark arrive {{near the}} Wall. Benjen takes his leave, {{stating that the}} Wall's magical {{protection}} prevents the dead (and therefore, him) from being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass.</b> Meera assists Bran to a weirwood tree and he re-enters the vision of Eddard Stark at the Tower of Joy. Ned finds his sister Lyanna Stark covered in blood from childbirth. With her dying breath, Lyanna pleads with Ned {{to take care of}} her son, who is revealed to be Jon Snow.|$|E
50|$|During the Civil War Kline crossed Union-Confederate {{lines to}} attend church meetings. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> obtain <b>passes</b> {{from both sides}} (though both were wary of him since he gave medical and spiritual help to both Union and Confederate troops). At one time, {{suspected}} of holding Union sympathies, he was imprisoned for two weeks in Virginia.|$|R
5000|$|The Prime Minister can [...] "engage the responsibility" [...] {{of his or}} her Government {{before the}} National Assembly. This process {{consists}} of placing a bill before the Assembly, and either the Assembly overthrows the Government, or the bill is passed automatically (article 49). In addition to ensuring that the Government still has support in the House, some bills that might prove too controversial <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the normal Assembly rules are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>passed</b> this way.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the {{following}} year that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> approach the <b>pass</b> from the east along the Beaver River. On July 24, 1882, he managed <b>to</b> reach the <b>pass</b> he had only observed in the distance the previous year.|$|R
5|$|Cho was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> both {{background}} checks and successfully complete both handgun purchases after he {{presented to the}} gun dealers his U.S. permanent residency card, his Virginia driver's permit to prove legal age and length of Virginia residence and a checkbook showing his Virginia address, in addition to waiting the required 30-day period between each gun purchase. He was successful at completing both handgun purchases {{because he did not}} disclose on the background questionnaire that a Virginia court had ordered him to undergo outpatient treatment at a mental health facility.|$|E
5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were {{a little better than}} at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> along further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he took along when he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5000|$|Alexandros Margaritis led {{the field}} away from pole position, taking command {{for the first}} half of the race. After the pit stop and driver change, Sumo Power's Peter Dumbreck was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> catch up to leader Marc Hennerici, {{eventually}} passing the Corvette into Turn 1 in the final ten minutes of the race. The Vitaphone Maserati of Andrea Bertolini, following close behind the two, was eventually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> also <b>pass</b> Hennerici and secure second place ...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the neutral {{particles}} in the IGM could not recognize {{the existence of the}} SuHMS owing to their long scattering mean free path in comparison with the scale of the SuHMS. Therefore, the particles are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> freely <b>pass</b> through the SuHMS and the HMS with the velocity V_IGM^S and produce the motion V_np^HMS observed in the solar system (cf. Fig. 28).|$|R
50|$|Although it is {{unlikely}} that there was truth in Amelia’s claims it is certain that she was in no way entitled to call herself Countess of Derwentwater as the title was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>passed</b> through a male line. Given that the title had been attainted after the 1715 uprising the use of any title was inappropriate regardless of the truth of Amelia's claims.|$|R
5|$|Official {{interest}} in Hurst Castle increased {{again in the}} 1840s, as the introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. Previously, sailing ships had been only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the castle slowly when moving against the tide, making them vulnerable to its guns; steam ships threatened to cruise past at speed. Military estimates and surveys in 1850 and 1851 suggested that the armament should therefore be significantly increased, to include more and much heavier guns.|$|E
5|$|Reporting to the {{training}} camp, Mulan is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> as a man, although her military skills are initially inexperienced. Mushu provides clumsy guidance to Mulan on how to behave like a man. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main Imperial Army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a burnt-out encampment and discover that General Li and his troops have been massacred by the Huns.|$|E
5|$|Senior {{membership}} {{is open to}} all U.S. citizens, and resident aliens aged 18 and over who are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> an FBI background check. There is no upper age limit, nor membership restrictions for physical disabilities, due to the number of different tasks which members may be called on to perform. Cadet {{membership is}} open to those aged between 12 and 18 who maintain satisfactory progress in school, as determined by the cadet's unit commander; upon their 18th birthday, cadets may become senior members or remain in the Cadet Program until they are 21.|$|E
50|$|Currently, only {{enrolled}} {{members of}} the Quinault Indian Nation and their guests are allowed onto the beaches throughout the reservation. However guests are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> obtain access <b>passes</b> {{that allow them to}} use the beaches for the day issued.|$|R
50|$|Jay-pass : a forearm or {{overhead}} {{pass that}} places the setter {{in a position}} <b>to</b> only be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> set the <b>passer</b> who initiated the pass. Generally <b>passed</b> low <b>to</b> the ground and immediately {{in front of the}} passer.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully automated system for traffic surveillance which is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> count <b>passing</b> cars, deter-mine their direction, and the lane {{which they are}} taking. The system works without any manual input whatsoever and it is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> automatically calibrate the camera by de-tecting vanishing points in the video sequence. The pro-posed system is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> work in real time and therefore it is ready for deployment in real traffic surveillance applica-tions. The system uses motion detection and tracking with the Kalman filter. The lane detection is based on clustering of trajectories of vehicles. The main contribution {{is a set of}} filters which a track has <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> in order <b>to</b> be treated as a vehicle and the full automation of the system...|$|R
