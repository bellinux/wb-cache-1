40|$|Some {{simple method}} of test for {{pulmonary}} function, {{to be employed}} in determining the degree of re-expansion of the residual portion of the lung in the follow-up stydy of patients following lung resection, has been sought after. The author assumed {{that the use of}} the ratio % MBC/% VC as an index might be of value for this purpose. It might also be of value in determining whether the residual portion is properly re-expanded and whether there is over-expansion which may cause chronic emphysematous change to occur in the future. So, in an attempt to evaluate this method, the degree of re-expansion of the residual portion was examined and pulmonary function tested in 63 patients who had had the lungs resected up to five segments without an additional thoracoplasty, with no postoperative complications. Roentgenographically, they were divided into two groups : those with a dead space and those without one. (Gaensler et al. had referred to this ratio as <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>index.</b> Here the ratio is used for an entirely different purpose.) 1. In determining the ratio, the values less than 1. 0 were found in many patients with no dead space (in 20 out of 29 patients), while values more than 1. 0 were found in many patients with a dead space (in 28 out of 34 patients). It would seem that the index is a useful guide to re-expansion of the residual portion of the lung. 2. Pulmonary function tests were carried out 6 months after operation in 5 patients who had undergone an extensive lung resection, with the residual portion so well re-expanded as to leave no dead space. (4 patients had had left upper lobectomy, and 1 right upper lobectomy with the resection of one segment.) The ratio RV/TLC was slightly increased aboue normal, but blood gas content was normal. No patients showed emphysematous change due to over-expansion. The index was in the range 1. 0 to 0. 8. 3. pulmonary function was tested 24 months after operation in 3 patients who had undergone extensive lung resection, with the residual portion as well re-expanded as the 5 patients reviewed above. (2 patients had had left upper lobectomy, and 1 right upper lobectomy with the resection of one segment.) The ratio RV/TLC was slightly increased above normal, but blood gas content was in the normal range. All the patients were free from emphysematous change due to ove-erxpansion of the residual portion. The index ranged from 1. 0 to 0. 8. In view of the observations made in this experiment, it may be said that the ratio %MBC/% VC is of value as an index in the determination of the degree of re-expansion of the residual portion of the lung following pulmonary resection. The patients with no dead space will be free from the failure of pulmonary function and will not need an additional thoracoplasty, if the index is in the range 1. 0 to 0. 8...|$|E

With due regard to the all clinical states, the mode of response caused by the administration of drugs were classified into the effective, unchanged and exacerbated. 7 cases with pulmonary emphysema, 5 with bronchial asthma, and one with hyperthyrosis were compared and contrasted with cardiac patients. In order to study the influence of postural change upon respiratory function, lung- and ventilation volumes were measured in lying and standing positions, and as circumstances require, also in sitting, with special reference to the relationship to circulatory dynamical factors. 1. The tidal volume of cardiac patients was in general found {{less than that of}} normal health, provided that in bronchospasm, cor pulmonale, pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma the tidal volumes were commonly determined larger than those in normal health. The patients with rales in any of groups tended to have the small tidal volume. 2. The respiratory minute volume in bronchial asthma was a little on the average, whereas in cardiac disorders it was rather larger than that in normal health. Expressly, in lying the patients with hyperthyrosis, auricular fibrillation and bronchospasm, and in standing, the patients with pulmonary emphysema, cor pulmonale and cardiogenic bronchospasm tended to show the higher R. M. V. than those of normal subjects. 3. The inspiratory capacities in pulmonary emphysema, cor pulmonale and bronchial asthma were used to be found within normal range both in lying and standing, while those capacities in cardiac disorders were often observed less than that in normal health. Especially, the cases with rales showed the low value. 4. The expiratory reserve volumes in pulmo-cardiac diseases were estimated subnormally, whereas those in cor pulmonale, pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma were relatively higher than those in cardiac diseases on the average. The cases with rales showed occasionally the marked low value. 5. The vital capacity in any group of cardiac diseases was measured less than that in normal health. V. C. in pulmonary emphysema, bronchial asthma existed usually with normal range. The patients suffered from rales showed frequently the very low value. 6. The maximal breathing capacity in any group of diseases observed here, especially in cardiogenic bronchospasm or cor pulmonale was determined less than that in normal health, whereas the left ventricular failure showed not so marked decrease on the average. M. B. C. of the cases with rales were commonly estimated low. 7.

Objectives The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> on Iranian veiled females at various exercise intensities and climatic conditions. Methods The current experimental study was conducted on 51 healthy veiled females with Islamic clothing (n = 30) in two hot-dry climatic chambers (wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) = 32 ± 0. 1 °C and WBGT = 30 ± 0. 1 °C, 40 % relative humidity (RH) without <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> and (n = 21) with <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> 0. 31 m/s in sitting and light workload conditions, respectively, for 60 minutes. The WBGT, oral temperature and heart rate were measured simultaneously every five minutes during the heat exposure and resting state. Data were analyzed using correlation and line regression by SPSS ver. 16. Results In both groups, oral temperature and heart rate increased during heat exposure. The increase of oral temperature and heart rate were larger in the group with <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> (sitting position, 37. 05 ± 0. 20 °C, 98. 30 ± 7. 79 bpm, light workload, 37. 34 ± 0. 24 °C, 124. 08 ± 6. 09 bpm) compared those of the group without <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> (sitting position, 36. 70 ± 0. 36 °C, 69. 74 ± 0. 98 bpm, light workload, 36. 71 ± 0. 27 °C, 110. 78 ± 17. 9 bpm).

These standards, also known as the Belt Air Rule, contained a section which limited the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> in the conveyor belt entry to no greater than 500 feet per minute unless otherwise approved by the US Mine Safety and Health Administration in the fire suppression system section of a mine 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s ventilation plan. The Belt Air Rule included a requirement dictating compatibility of <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> with fire suppression systems. The final rule of limiting <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> in the belt entry was challenged in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court granted that petition and vacated the requirement on the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> cap, according to MSHA. The removal of the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> cap from the final rule, paired with the compatibility requirement, led to a need for research on high <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s influence on fire suppression system performance in belt entries. Test data was needed that illustrated the relationship between fire suppression system performance and <b>air</b> <b>velocity,</b> especially with the increased use of wider belts in underground coal mines, so National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and MSHA collaborated to obtain the data. However, this work was initiated before the revised Belt Air Rule was promulgated on December 31, 2008, when 1000 fpm <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> became a requirement. Four differen...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the airflow inside school {{building}} office compartments with moderate environments, in steady-state conditions, is experimentally and numerically analyzed. The experimental tests {{are made in}} a developed experimental chamber, while the numerical results are obtained in a developed numerical model. The <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> fluctuations are experimentally measured and the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> root mean square, the air turbulence intensity, the draft risk, the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> fluctuation frequencies, and the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> fluctuation equivalent frequencies are calculated. The mean and local air renovation rates, using the decay tracer gases method with a carbon dioxide concentration, are calculated. The three-dimensional <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> and the <b>air</b> renovation rate are numerically calculated. Both these experimental and numerical results are compared {{to better understand the}} airflow topology inside this kind of compartment and evaluate the comfort level, namely the thermal comfort, local thermal discomfort, and air quality levels, to which occupants are subjected. The analyzed airflow topology, with the air forced inlet and outlet located above the occupants' head level, is divided into two areas: the non-occupied upper area, which contains the airflow inlet and outlet, with high <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> levels, is developed to facilitate the contaminant extraction released by the occupants, while the occupied lower area, with low <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> levels, is developed to ensure good thermal comfort and reduced local discomfort levels, with the capacity to transport the occupants' contaminants to the upper area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this study, {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} air heater samples with three different shapes (chevron, wave and dimple type) to reduce theplumes from cooling towers. The tests were conducted {{for a range of}} frontal <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> of 1 ~ 3 m/s and water flow rate 0. 19 ~ 0. 33 kg/s. The results showed that the heat transfer rate increased with increasing <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> or water flow rate. The air-side pressure drop also increased with increasing <b>air</b> <b>velocity.</b> At the same frontal <b>air</b> <b>velocity,</b> the highest heat transfer rate was obtained for the chevron sample (1. 5 ~ 1. 7 times compared to that of the plate sample), followed by the dimple, wave and plate samples. The heat transfer rate per unit power consumption was also 15 % larger than that of the dimpl...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{investigating}} the air flow when a train runs into a tunnel, {{the authors of this}} paper simplified the problem as stated in the former report and investigated the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> in the inlet and outlet of the pipe by moving short columns into the horizontal pipes. Hara has studied about the air pressure when the train runs into the tunnel in case of changing the top shapes of the train, but nothing seems to be investigated about the <b>air</b> <b>velocity.</b> Then, in the present paper, we report about the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> in case of changing the shape of the top and back of the columns. On the other hand, we state about the <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> in case of the high speed of the column corresponding to that of the train...|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  4 that the moving {{traverse}} method appears to obtain higher readings than the fixed-point traverse method at four measuring stations. The measured average <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> from the two methods match very well, especially in the range of 0.5 – 1.5  m/s (100 – 300  fpm). However, the differences in the average velocities of the two measuring methods at locations A 2, A 3, A 4, and A 6 exceed 0.3  ms/s (60  ft/min), where the <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> exceed 2.0  m/s (400  fpm). It is premature to say whether the greater velocity causes the larger difference between the moving traverse method and the fixed-point traverse method. As {{can be seen}} in Fig.  5, the average <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> from fixed point traverse and moving traverse are very close at both measuring locations A 26 and A 27, although both the measured <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> are above 2.0  m/s (400  fpm). The magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> may not be a contributor to the differences observed between these two measuring methods.|$|R
40|$|Drying {{characteristics}} of Quercus were determined experimentally {{as a function}} of temperature, <b>air</b> <b>velocity,</b> and variety (Quercus Persica and Quercus Libani). In order to estimate and select a suitable drying curve, five different thin layer drying models were fitted to the experimental data. Experiments were performed at the air temperatures of 50, 60 and 70 °C. At each temperature level, two <b>air</b> <b>velocities</b> were adjusted: 0. 5 and 1 m/s. The effect of air temperature was found to be significant in comparison to <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> for drying of fresh Quercus fruits. Increasing <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> at constant <b>air</b> temperature resulted in the decrease of drying time. Among all the selected drying models, the Page model was found as the best mathematical model for describing the drying kinetics of Quercus fruits. Based on the results, drying temperature of 70 oC and <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> of 1 m/s are the optimum values for drying Quercus fruit. Drying time and Page model constants were found to be dependent significantly on the variables studied...|$|R
40|$|Heat stress {{contributes}} to increased late-mortality and decreased growth of broilers grown during hot weather. Tunnel ventilation {{is commonly used}} to alleviate heat stress by increasing sensible heat loss. As broilers approach heavy BW (> 2. 5 kg) in hot weather, operating tunnel ventilation continuously as opposed to only during times of high ambient temperature may improve growth rate and nutrient utilization. This study evaluated growth responses of male broilers subjected to high <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> (2. 79 m/s) for either 12 or 24 h from 37 to 51 d of age. The experimental treatments were 1) control (still <b>air),</b> 2) <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> of 1. 65 m/s (325 ft/min) for 12 h and 2. 79 m/ s for 12 h, and 3) <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> of 2. 79 m/s (550 ft/min) for 24 h. A cyclical temperature regimen of 25 – 30 – 25 °C (77 – 86 – 77 °F) was used with a constant 23 °C dew point. Providing continuous high <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> of 2. 79 m/s from 37 to 51 d of age led to a 112 -g increase in BW gain and decreased feed conversion ratio by 15 points compared with subjecting broilers to high <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> of 2. 79 m/s for only 12 h. Broilers subjected to both high and low <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> improved BW gain, feed consumption, and feed conversion over the control birds. These results indicate that continuous ventilation at high <b>air</b> <b>velocity</b> improves BW gain and feed conversion ratio of heavy broilers during the last 2 wk of the grow-out...|$|R
