50|$|Designed by famous yacht {{designer}} L. Francis Herreshoff, this {{is essentially}} the same pattern as an <b>admiralty</b> <b>anchor,</b> albeit with small diamond shaped flukes or palms. The novelty of the design lay in the means by which it could be broken down into three pieces for stowage. In use, it still presents all the issues of the admiralty pattern anchor.|$|E
50|$|The shield anchor, crossed {{with the}} carbine, {{has been part}} of the Naval Infantry since 1823. The shield of the Naval Infantry, as today, is the essence of their {{integration}} into the meaning of heraldry. Examples are the gold trim, which gives nobility, seriousness and elegance; the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>anchor,</b> which symbolizes belonging to the Navy; and finally crossed muskets, which were the weapons that our Marines had, strengthening our country as a nation-state, free and sovereign. Together they represent the dedication to serve Mexico by air, land and sea. The color red has always characterized the Marines around the world.|$|E
50|$|Until the mid-20th century, anchors {{for smaller}} vessels were either {{scaled-down}} versions of <b>admiralty</b> <b>anchors,</b> or simple grapnels. As new designs with greater holding-power-to-weight ratios, {{a great variety}} of anchor designs has emerged. Many of these designs are still under patent, and other types are best known by their original trademarked names.|$|R

5000|$|In 1956, Captain T.C. Pullen, RCN, sailed HMCS Labrador on an {{expedition}} through the Northwest Passage. During this voyage Labrador recovered two <b>Admiralty</b> Pattern <b>anchors</b> on Fury Beach, Somerset Island (Nunavut). The anchors were left there in 1825 by the crews of Fury and Hecla, with stores, boats, and other useful items, as Fury had been beset in ice {{and had to}} be abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 19th century anchors were of imperfect manufacture, the means of effecting good and efficient welding being absent and the iron poor, whilst the arms, being straight, generally parted at the crown, when weighing from good holding-ground. A clerk in Plymouth Yard, named Pering, {{in the early part of}} that century (1813) introduced curved arms; and after 1852 the British <b>admiralty</b> <b>anchor,</b> under the direction of the Board, was supplied to H.M. ships, followed by Lieutenant (afterwards Captain) Rodger's anchor. Rodger's anchor marked a great departure from the form of previous anchors. The arms were formed in one piece, and were pivoted at the crown on a bolt passing through the forked shank. The points or pees to the palms were blunt. This anchor had an excellent reputation amongst nautical men of that period, and by the committee on anchors, appointed by the British admiralty in 1852, it was placed second only to the anchor of Trotman.|$|E
50|$|The stockless anchor, {{patented}} in England in 1821, {{represented the}} first significant departure in anchor design in centuries. Though their holding-power-to-weight ratio is significantly lower than <b>admiralty</b> pattern <b>anchors,</b> their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption. In contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors, stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the hawsepipes, and the flukes against the hull (or inside a recess in the hull).|$|R
50|$|In 1953, it {{was decided}} to return the Conway to Birkenhead for a refit. On 14 April, the ship left her {{moorings}} in the Menai Straight under tow, but was driven ashore shortly afterwards by unexpectedly strong tides and wrecked, watched by a large crowd on the Menai Suspension Bridge. A fire in 1956 then destroyed her. One may still find nails and timber at the site. Two <b>Admiralty</b> Pattern <b>anchors</b> from the Conway survive; one at the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool and one at Victoria Dock, Caernarfon, outside the former Maritime Museum.|$|R

After an escort trip to New Guinea, Manley returned to Seeadler Harbor. In mid-December, she shifted to Noemfoor Island for tactical exercises and training for the liberation of Luzon.|$|R
25|$|For centuries {{large numbers}} of lead bars have been found on the Mediterranean seabed, and there was debate over whether they were anchor stocks or not. It was argued by some that iron tipped wooden anchors secured by ropes were not heavy enough to be {{effective}} {{so they had to}} have metal stocks and there was considerable academic controversy over the issue. The Nemi ships, constructed during the transition period when iron anchors were replacing wooden ones, were the first Roman wrecks found to have intact anchors, and confirmed that the lead bars were indeed anchor stocks. Two types of anchor were found, one of oak with iron-tipped flukes and a stock of lead while the other was of iron with a folding timber stock that closely matched the design of the <b>Admiralty</b> pattern <b>anchor</b> re-invented in 1841. In the 1960s, a similar anchor was found in Pompeii and in 1974 another was found buried near Aberdarewllyn in Gwynedd, Wales. These further discoveries confirmed that these technologically advanced anchors were a standard Roman design.|$|R

This thesis examines the history and development of the English <b>Admiralty</b> pattern <b>anchor,</b> from ca. 1550 to 1850. The anchor is not necessarily the most essential piece of equipment onboard a vessel, but it is certainly a standard implement of extreme importance. Mariners take the anchor for granted, landlubbers seldom give it a thought, and yet the anchor has become the very symbol of the sea. Before the beginning of the 16 th century, the basic design of the anchor had been fully developed. Little or no gross modification was attained during the following two hundred years, apart from the general increase in anchor size and some minor manufacturing techniques. In the middle of the 19 th century, with the increases in the knowledge of iron technology, there were radical changes in the design of anchors. These anchors were different in their design, being stockless anchors made of cast iron, instead of the earlier wrought iron anchors. This thesis examines the small changes that the anchor underwent, in an attempt to help other researchers date and identify a specific anchor's heritage. The parts of the anchor are described, as well as the terminology involved in anchoring a vessel. The number, weight, and size of anchors for the various sizes of vessels are listed for the time periods...|$|R
