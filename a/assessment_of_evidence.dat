2500|$|In 2008, {{a report}} {{published}} by the International Food Policy Research Institute, an agriculture policy think tank based in Washington DC, noted {{that there was an}} absence of data relating to [...] "numbers on the actual share of farmers committing suicide who cultivated cotton, let alone Bt cotton." [...] In order to evaluate the [...] "possible (and hypothetical)" [...] existence of a connection the study employed a [...] "second-best" [...] <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> relating to farmer suicides firstly, and to the effects of Bt cotton secondly. The analysis revealed that there was no [...] "clear general relationship between Bt cotton and farmer suicides" [...] but also stated that it could not reject the [...] "potential role of Bt cotton varieties in the observed discrete increase in farmer suicides in certain states and years, especially during the peak of 2004 in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra." [...] The report also noted that farmer suicides predate the official commercial introduction of Bt cotton by Monsanto Mahyco in 2002 (and its unofficial introduction by Navbharat Seeds in 2001) and that such suicides were a fairly constant portion of the overall national suicide rate since 1997. The report noted that while Bt cotton may have been a factor in specific suicides, the contribution was likely marginal compared to socio-economic factors. Elsewhere, Gruere et al. discuss the introduction and increase in use of Bt cotton in the state of Madhya Pradesh since 2002, and the observed drop in total suicides among that state's farmers in 2006. They then question whether the impact of the increase in use of Bt cotton on farmers suicide in Madhya Pradesh has been to improve or worsen the situation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} possible {{differences in}} auditors’ performance {{when they make}} belief-based versus probability-based risk assessments by focusing on two phases of the financial statement audit process: the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> two attributes <b>of</b> audit <b>evidence</b> (‘strength’ and ‘direction’) and the aggregation <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> Based on an experiment in which 48 experienced auditors participated, three important findings were observed. First, {{there was no significant}} difference in the mean <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> measured using the likelihood ratio. However, the difference in the assessed direction <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> that is whether the evidence is interpreted as being confirming or disconfirming, is significant for one of the cases examined. This result shows that auditors making belief-based assessments are able to assess the direction <b>of</b> the <b>evidence</b> more accurately than auditors making probability-based assessments. Third, the auditors’ aggregation <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> was not in accordance with ‘AND’ logic for either auditors making belief-based or probability-based assessments. These empirical results raise issues which need to be addressed in practice and in future research...|$|R

5000|$|Before {{psychological}} {{research on}} confirmation bias, the phenomenon had been observed throughout history. Beginning with the Greek historian Thucydides (c. 460 BC - c. 395 BC), who wrote of misguided treason in The Peloponnesian War; [...] "... {{for it is}} a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy". Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), noted it in his famous work, the Divine Comedy, in which St. Thomas Aquinas cautions Dante upon meeting in Paradise, [...] "opinion—hasty—often can incline to the wrong side, and then affection for one's own opinion binds, confines the mind". Ibn Khaldun noticed the same effect in his Muqaddimah: [...] "Untruth naturally afflicts historical information. There are various reasons that make this unavoidable. One of them is partisanship for opinions and schools. ... if the soul is infected with partisanship for a particular opinion or sect, it accepts without a moment's hesitation the information that is agreeable to it. Prejudice and partisanship obscure the critical faculty and preclude critical investigation. The result is that falsehoods are accepted and transmitted." [...] English philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon (1561-1626), in the Novum Organum noted that biased <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> drove [...] "all superstitions, whether in astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments or the like". He wrote: The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion ... draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to {{be found on the}} other side, yet these it either neglects or despises, or else by some distinction sets aside or rejects. In the second volume of his The World as Will and Representation (1844), German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer observed that [...] "An adopted hypothesis gives us lynx-eyes for everything that confirms it and makes us blind to everything that contradicts it."In his essay (1897) [...] "What Is Art?" [...] Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote, [...] I know that most men—not only those considered clever, but even those who are very clever, and capable of understanding most difficult scientific, mathematical, or philosophic problems—can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed, perhaps with much difficulty—conclusions of which they are proud, which they have taught to others, and on which they have built their lives.|$|E
