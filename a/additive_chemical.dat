The hydration behaviors of mixtures demonstrated that exploded WFS had strong retarding effects on cement hydration and completely prevented mixtures from setting. The analysis of sugar revealed that the sugar contents of exploded WFS were much higher than those in unexploded wood and increased to about 20 -fold (air-dried) and 10 -fold (water-soaked), respectively.

International audienceMost machining operations require the presence of a cutting fluid in order to ensure their success due to the intensity of thermal and mechanical conditions generated on the cutting tools. In some cases of severe machining, the fluid contributes to lubrication in a physicochemical way thanks to the additives it contains. This study aims to analyze the tribochemical mechanisms of lubrication during milling operations and subsequently at optimizing the lubricant formulation. The objective of this study is also to identify and to compare, the performance of various Extreme Pressure (EP) sulfur-containing additives, and to understand their action mechanisms in metal cutting. Physico-chemical analyses are carried out by means of Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) with the purpose of detecting the nature of additive reaction products on the surfaces involved in cutting and correlating them with the milling results.

This organic chemical is present in water samples collected from areas where gasoline wastes are abundant. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the possibility of MTBE removal from drinking water at the point of use (POU) by using an Iranian granulated active carbon (GAC) bed. Materials and Methods: Adsorption of MTBE from drinking water at POU was studied by using an Iranian GAC bed. The water samples treated by this filter adsorber were prepared synthetically at two concentrations (50 ppb and 100 ppb). In addition, the effects of residual chlorine at concentrations of 0. 2 and 0. 5 mg/L and of chloroform at a concentration of 100 ppb on removal of MTBE were determined. Results: It was found that this filter adsorber could treat 375 liters of water containing 50 ppb MTBE, 100 ppb chloroform and 0. 2 ppm residual chorine. If the residual chlorine content was increased to 0. 5 ppb, the volume of water treated would be 335 liters. The filter could t eat 195 liters of water containing 100 ppb MTBE, 100 ppb chloroform and 0. 2 ppm residual chlorine to acceptable levels for drinking, provided the amount of MTBE is below the respective standard. Conclusion: Both residual chlorine and chloroform reduced the MTBE adsorption capacity on GAC due to occupation of adsorption sites. In addition, to the tendency of GAC to adsorb chloroform and chlorine was greater than that of MTBE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} computational {{studies of}} both the static and dynamic parameters of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of gaseous xenon. First, state-of-the-art static magnetic resonance parameters are computed in small xenon clusters by using methods of quantum chemistry, and second, time-dependent relaxation phenomena are investigated via molecular dynamics simulations at different experimental conditions. Based on the underlying quantum and classical mechanics concepts, computational methods represent a procedure complementary to experiments for investigating the properties of atoms, molecules, clusters and solids. Static NMR spectral parameters, chemical shift, shielding anisotropy and asymmetry parameter, nuclear quadrupole coupling, and spin-rotation coupling, are calculated using different electronic structure methods ranging from the uncorrelated Hartree-Fock method to correlated second-order Møller-Plesset many-body perturbation, complete/restricted active space multiconfiguration self-consistent field, and to coupled-cluster approaches. The bond length dependence of these properties is investigated in the xenon dimer (Xe 2). A well-characterized property in experimental NMR, the second virial coefficient of nuclear shielding, is theoretically calculated {{by a variety of}} methods and convincingly verified against experimental findings. Here, it is mandatory to include effects from special relativity as well as electron correlation. As a side result, a purely theoretical potential energy curve for Xe 2, comparable to best experimental ones, is calculated. A pairwise additive scheme is established to approximate the NMR properties in differently coordinated sites of xenon clusters Xen (n = 2 - 12). Especially the pairwise <b>additive</b> <b>chemical</b> shift values are found to be in close agreement with quantum-chemical results and only a small scaling factor close to unity is needed for the correct behavior. Finally, a dynamical magnetic resonance property, the experimental nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate R 1 of monoatomic Xe gas due to the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) mechanism is validated from first principles. This approach is based on molecular dynamics simulations over a large range of temperatures and densities, combined with the pairwise additive approximation for the shielding tensor. Therein, the shielding time correlation function is seen to reflect the characteristic time scales related to both interatomic collisions and cluster formation. For the first time, the physics of gaseous xenon is detailed in full in the context of CSA relaxation...|$|E
