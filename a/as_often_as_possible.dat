This paper argues that in the field of usability, debates about number of users, the use of statistics, etc. in the abstract are pointless and even counter-productive. We propose that the answers depend on the research questions and business objectives of each project and thus cannot be discussed in absolute terms. Sometimes usability testing is done with an implicit or explicit hypothesis in mind. At other times the purpose of testing is to guide iterative design. These two approaches call for different study designs and treatment of data. We apply control systems theory to the topic of usability to highlight and frame the value of iterative usability testing in the design lifecycle.

50|$|Geophysical {{methods used}} in {{archaeology}} are largely adapted from {{those used in}} mineral exploration, engineering, and geology. Archaeological mapping presents unique challenges, however, which have spurred a separate development of methods and equipment. In general, geological applications are concerned with detecting relatively large structures, <b>often</b> <b>as</b> deeply <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> In contrast, most archaeological sites are relatively near the surface, often within the top meter of earth. Instruments are often configured to limit the depth of response to better resolve the near-surface phenomena {{that are likely to}} be of interest. Another challenge is to detect subtle and often very small features - which may be as ephemeral as organic staining from decayed wooden posts - and distinguish them from rocks, roots, and other natural “clutter.” To accomplish this requires not only sensitivity, but also high density of data points, usually at least one and sometimes dozens of readings per square meter.|$|R

The avalanche of data will continue throughout this decade, culminating with Gaia and LSST.

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of frying are fairly simple. Hot oil {{serves as a}} heat exchange medium in which heat is transferred to the food being fried. As a result, the heat converts water within the food to steam and melts the fat within the food. The steam and fat then migrate from {{the interior of the}} food through the exterior and into the oil. Conversely, some of the frying oil is absorbed into the food being fried. The chemistry occurring in the frying oil and in the food being fried includes a myriad of thermal and oxidative reactions involving lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and minor food constituents. Decomposition products by autoxidation above 100 °C, polimerization without oxigen between 200 - 300 °C and thermal oxidation at 200 °C, can be produced in frying oil and their amounts are related to different chemical and physical parameters such as temperature, heating time, type of oil used and food being fried, oil turnover rate, management of the oil and finally type of equipment used. Different studies have remarked as the toxicity of these by-products, is due to their chemistry and concentration. Since the prime requirement in food quality is the safety of the products, attainable through preventive analysis of the risks and total control through all frying processes, in this work the critical points of particular importance are identify and showed: Oil composition, and in particular its antioxidant capacity. Proper fryer design. Food/oil ratio. Good manufactured practice. Beside the quality screening has to be direct towards the chemical quality evaluation by easy and rapid analysis of oil (colour, polar compounds, free fatty acids and antioxidant capacity) and food fried (panel test and/or consumer test). Conclusion, to maintain high quality in the frying medium, choose efficient equipment, select a fat with desirable flavour and good antioxidant capacity, eliminate crackling <b>as</b> soon and <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> choose better components with minimal but desirable browning tendencies, and monitor the quality of the fat being used...|$|R

Thereafter, {{through the end of}} the year, she made voyages across the Black Sea to various Russian ports in conjunction with the relief operation. She stopped at numerous other foreign ports on the voyages, including Samsun, Trebizond, and Mudanya, Turkey. From July-October, she made a round-trip voyage back to the U.S., during which she was overhauled at the New York Navy Yard and exercised out of Yorktown, Virginia. On 1 October, Sturtevant was ordered back to the eastern Mediterranean and, the following day, got underway for Gibraltar. She arrived there on the 14th and continued on to Turkey, reaching Mudania on the 27th. For the next seven months, the destroyer visited the ports of the eastern Mediterranean and those along the coast of the Black Sea. In addition to ports of call of the previous cruises, she visited Varna, Bulgaria; Mersina and Smyrna, Turkey; Piraeus, Greece; and Naples, Italy. From the latter port, she sailed for Gibraltar in late May 1923, and by 12 June was back at the Navy Yard in New York. She operated along the Atlantic seaboard {{through the end of the}} year, conducting gunnery exercises in October at the southern drill grounds off Virginia.

40|$|Background and problem: This study {{investigates the}} effects of the {{financial}} crisis of 2007 - 2008, a crisis partly caused by mortgage backed securities. Banks had a large part in the developments taking place in the years after the outbreak of the crisis in 2007, as many banks had an excessively low capital base, involving too much risk in its businesses. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and other crises of American banks caused the ripples of the crisis to spread throughout the market, and in 2009 difficulties hit the international banking sector. Changes {{can be seen in the}} management of banks; however there are still questions regarding the stability of the banking sector. This study will investigate the changes in capital structure and liquidity that can be found throughout and after the financial crisis. Aim of study: The aim of the study is to understand what the changes made in capital structure and liquidity of banks would mean for the stability and trust. This is seen through the perspective of the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008, investigating the changes that have been made and the motivation behind them. Methodology: The study was done with a qualitative method, using two techniques; interviews and source analysis. In this study, the largest four banks in Sweden have been investigated, Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB and Swedbank. From each of these banks, a representative have been selected from the Investor Relation section, as an individual in this position have the appropriate overview and knowledge of the bank to provide the information needed for this study. In the source analysis financial reports from 2007 - 2008 have been utilised. Analysis and conclusion: The financial crisis affected the banks differently, depending on the markets of expansion. Excessive risk-taking has been found, where one bank expanded aggressively into new markets and did not appreciate the risks on these new markets.
