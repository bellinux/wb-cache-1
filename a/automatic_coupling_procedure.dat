40|$|Use of {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) to model the complex, 3 D disk cavity flow and heat transfer in conjunction with an industrial finite element analysis (FEA) of turbine disk thermomechanical response during a full transient cycle is demonstrated. The FEA and CFD solutions were coupled using a previously proposed efficient coupling procedure. This iterates between FEA and CFD calculations at each time step of the transient solution to ensure consistency of temperature and heat flux on the appropriate component surfaces. The FEA model is a 2 D representation of high pressure and intermediate pressure (IP) turbine disks with surrounding structures. The front IP disk cavity flow is calculated using 45 deg sector CFD models with up to 2. 8 million mesh cells. Three CFD models were initially defined for idle, maximum take-off, and cruise conditions, and these are updated by the <b>automatic</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure</b> through the 13, 000 s full transient cycle from stand-still to idle, maximum take-off, and cruise conditions. The obtained disk temperatures and displacements are compared with an earlier standalone FEA model that used established methods for convective heat transfer modeling. It was demonstrated that the coupling could be completed using a computer cluster with 60 cores within about 2 weeks. This turn around time is considered fast enough to meet design phase requirements, and in validation, it also compares favorably to that required to hand-match a FEA model to engine test data, which is typically several months.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, an <b>automatic</b> {{adaptive}} <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is proposed}} for the finite element method (FEM) and the element-free Galerkin method (EFGM) for linear elasticity and for problems with both material and geometrical nonlinearities. In this new procedure, initially {{the whole of the}} problem domain is modelled using the FEM. During an analysis, those finite elements which violate a predefined error measure are automatically converted to an {EFG} zone. This {EFG} zone can be further refined by adding nodes, thus avoiding computationally expensive {FE} remeshing. Local maximum entropy shape functions are used in the {EFG} zone of the problem domain for two reasons: their weak Kronecker delta property at the boundaries allows straightforward imposition of essential boundary conditions and also provides a natural way to couple the {EFG} and {FE} regions compared to the use of moving least squares basis functions. The Zienkiewicz and Zhu error estimation procedure with the superconvergent patch method for strains and stresses recovery is used in the {FE} region of the problem domain, while the Chung and Belytschko error estimation procedure is used in the {EFG} region...|$|R

40|$|Fluid–structure {{interaction}} computations in geometries where different chambers {{are almost}} completely separated {{from each other}} by a movable rigid body but connected through very small gaps can encounter stability problems when a standard explicit <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is used for the}} coupling of the fluid flow and the movement of the rigid body. An example of such kind of flows is the opening and closing of valves, when the valve motion is driven by the flow. A stability analysis is performed for the <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure</b> of the movement of a cylinder in a cylindrical tube, filled with fluid. Between the moving cylinder and the tube, a small gap is present, so that two chambers are formed. It is shown that a standard explicit <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure</b> or an implicit <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure</b> with explicit <b>coupling</b> in the subiterations steps can lead to unstable motion {{depending on the size of}} the gaps, the density of the rigid body, and the density of the fluid. It is proven that a reduction of the time-step size cannot stabilize the <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure.</b> An implicit <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure</b> with implicit <b>coupling</b> in the subiterations has to be used. An illustration is given on how such a <b>coupling</b> <b>procedure</b> can be implemented in a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package.
