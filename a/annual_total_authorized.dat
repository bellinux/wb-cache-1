40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain a better {{understanding}} of the land cover distributions, land cover changes and the differences in ecosystem service provisions resulting from distinctive indicators based on various CORINE land cover classes. By analyzing the land cover dynamics and the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), Carbon Storage (CS), and a qualitative indicator derived from the ecosystem service matrix method (GCR), this study measures the land cover distributions. The land-cover-based global climate regulation potential is assessed to improve global climate regulation. This study uses spatial and statistical analysis tools referring to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the statistical package R and the software of SPSS are used to estimate the land cover and ecosystem services dynamics in Schleswig-Holstein. The study has found that “non-irrigated arable land” and “pastures” are the dominating land cover classes in Schleswig-Holstein, and the significant land cover changes are among them. “Non-irrigated arable land” and “pastures” have higher <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP values than the other land cover classes. Geest has the largest <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP even though the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP and NPP are less than the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP and NPP in Marsch. Simultaneously, Dithmarschen and Rendsburg-Eckernförde hold larger <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP amounts than the other districts. The outcome of the comparison of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the global climate regulation service, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> NPP, SOC, Carbon Stocks and GCR is that all of them show significant correlations. The interrelations among the different indicators, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> NPP, and the statistical data of average harvest, the harvests of grain, green corn, root crops and winter rape evaluated based on districts also correlate significantly...|$|R

40|$|District {{heating systems}} have the {{potential}} to contribute to the UK renewable energy targets. However, {{there are a number of}} economic barriers which would have to be addressed in order to make district heating competitive in comparison with alternative heating technologies. The objective of this research was to model and analyse a district heating network and develop an optimisation method to calculate the minimum capital investment, heat losses and pump energy consumption. Firstly, modelling and analysis of a district heating network was conducted to obtain district heating design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption and annualised cost. Then through the analysis, a two-stage programming model was developed which synthesised design and optimal operation of a district heating network. The optimisation was used to minimise <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption or annualised cost of the heat network by selecting suitable pump and pipe sizes, taking into account different parameters such as target pressure loss, temperature regime and operating strategy. The optimisation technique was used to investigate two different case studies, with high and low heat density. In all cases, a variable flow and variable supply temperature operating method was found to be beneficial. Design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption and annualised cost used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. To achieve the minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption a design case with larger pipe diameters and smaller pressure loss was found to be desirable. It was observed that by reducing the water temperature and increasing temperature difference between supply and return pipes, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption and the annualised cost were reduced. It was also shown that district heating in an area with high heat density is more energy efficient and cost effective...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 20002 This study {{looked at}} early height growth of planted white spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss around the Fairbanks area. The effort focused on two Levels-of-Growing-Stock (LOGS) {{experimental}} plantations {{located in the}} Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest that incorporated an espacement study. <b>Annual</b> <b>total</b> height was also measured on 16 operational plantations and then compared to LOGS plantations. Average <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height at Site 2 of the LOGS plantations was significantly greater than at Site 1. A significant difference in height growth between these sites was attributed to differences in aspect. Results showed significant <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height differences among the espacement plots within the LOGS plantation. The narrowest spacing 1. 2 X 1. 2 m and widest spacing 3. 7 X 3. 7 showed a lower <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height while spacings 1. 8 X 1. 8 m, 2. 4 X 2. 4 m, and 3. 0 X 3. 0 m showed a greater <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height at age ten. The range of <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height found at the LOGS sites was not significantly different than the range of <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height found at the 16 operational plantations. Additionally, path {{analysis was used to}} quantify the direct and indirect effects of multiple environmental variables (i. e., percent slope, slope position, competition, aspect, and soil moisture) on growth rate at the operational plantations. It was found that slope position, percent slope, and competition had significant direct effects on growth rate. These results provide insight for resource managers when predicting the height growth of planted white spruce...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to minimise capital costs and energy usage in a district heating network is presented. The method comprises a two-stage programming model, which synthesises design and the optimal operation of a district heating network. Two different optimisation approaches—(a) minimising the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage, and (b) minimising the equivalent annual cost of the heat network installation and operation—were examined and high and low temperatures district heating were investigated. For each optimisation approach, the minimum optimal <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage and minimum optimal equivalent annual cost were calculated and suitable pipe and pump sizes, taking into account different supply and return temperature regimes, target pressure losses and operating strategies within a district heating network were found. Design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage and minimum equivalent annual cost used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. This in turn reduced the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage and the equivalent annual cost and the suitable pipe and pump sizes were selected. In addition, {{it was observed that}} by reducing the water temperature, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage and the equivalent annual cost could be reduced further. However, the obtained design cases based on a low temperature had relatively larger pipe sizes and smaller pressure drops compared with design cases obtained for the high temperature district heating...|$|R
