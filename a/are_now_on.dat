5|$|Because of Monitors {{advanced}} state of deterioration, timely recovery of remaining significant artifacts and ship components became critical. Numerous fragile artifacts, including the innovative turret and its two Dahlgren guns, an anchor, steam engine, and propeller, have been recovered. They were transported back to Hampton Roads to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia, {{where they were}} treated in special tanks to stabilize the metal. It is reported {{that it will take}} about ten years for the metal to completely stabilize. The new USS Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum officially opened on March 9, 2007, and a full-scale copy of USS Monitor, the original recovered turret, and artifacts and related items <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> display.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur was {{considered}} {{as the source}} of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent.

These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> display in the Java Art room in The National Museum in Bangkok.|$|E

In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved. Episodes can now also be purchased in HD on iTunes for $2.99.

5|$|Indicated by {{artifacts}} recovered {{close to}} the road in Milan and in other areas along the Hudson River, the earliest inhabitants of the northern Dutchess County region were the Mohicans, a Native American nation, about 3,000years ago. The range of the Mohicans extended from northern Dutchess County to {{the southern tip of}} Lake Champlain, and from the Catskill Mountains to the Berkshires in Massachusetts. The total population of the Mohicans was estimated at 8,000 during the time of first contact with the Europeans, although only 800 remained after the American Revolution. Artifacts were also recovered along the shore of Lake Sepasco—a small lake NY308 passes near its ending terminus. Those artifacts recovered included ancient arrowheads, and <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> display at the Museum of Rhinebeck History.|$|E

Carr Astronomical Observatory in Blue Mountain, Ontario and at David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill, Ontario. The original Zeiss-Jena projector was bought as a museum piece by York University for the sum of $1, subsequently dismantled, and placed into storage. More recently, the University has offered the mothballed projector to other planetaria seeking parts to repair their existing electro-mechanical planetarium projectors.|$|E

Beads and bracelets made of fayence and carnelian and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king Hor Aha and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib.

5|$|In 1971, {{with support}} from UNESCO, Syria appealed to the {{international}} community to participate in the efforts to salvage as many archaeological remains as possible before the area would disappear under the rising water of Lake Assad. To stimulate foreign participation, the Syrian antiquities law was modified so that foreign missions had the right to claim a part of the artefacts that were found during excavation. As a result, between 1971 and 1974, numerous excavations were carried out in the Lake Assad area by Syrian as well as foreign missions. Syrian archaeologists worked at the sites of Tell al-'Abd, 'Anab al-Safinah, Tell Sheikh Hassan, Qal'at Ja'bar, Dibsi Faraj and Tell Fray. There were missions from the United States on Dibsi Faraj, Tell Fray and Shams ed-Din-Tannira; from France on Mureybet and Emar; from Italy on Tell Fray; from the Netherlands on Tell Ta'as, Hadidi, Jebel 'Aruda and Selenkahiye; from Switzerland on Tell al-Hajj; from Great Britain on Abu Hureyra and Tell es-Sweyhat; and from Japan on Tell Roumeila. In addition, the minarets of Mureybet and Meskene were moved to higher locations, and Qal'at Ja'bar was further reinforced and restored. Many finds from the excavations <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> display in the National Museum of Aleppo, where a special permanent exhibition is devoted to the finds from the Lake Assad region.|$|E
