500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the 1960s, Copland turned {{increasingly}} to conducting. Though not enamored with the prospect, {{he found himself}} without new ideas for composition, saying, [...] "It was exactly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> simply turned off a faucet." [...] He became a frequent guest conductor in the United States and the United Kingdom and {{made a series of}} recordings of his music, primarily for Columbia Records. In 1960, RCA Victor released Copland's recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra of the orchestral suites from Appalachian Spring and The Tender Land; these recordings were later reissued on CD, as were most of Copland's Columbia recordings (by Sony).|$|E

500|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the name [...] "antlion" [...] is uncertain. It has been thought to refer to ants forming a large {{percentage}} of the prey of the insect, the suffix [...] "lion" [...] merely suggesting destroyer or hunter. In any case, the term seems to go back to classical antiquity. The antlion larva is often called a [...] "doodlebug" [...] in North America because of the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while relocating, which look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> been doodling.|$|R
50|$|Dunja and Zvonko soon begin noticing {{suspicious}} {{strangers in}} the vicinity, and mysterious envelopes with substantial amounts of cash start to appear in their mailbox. Since the envelopes are addressed to them, they decide to spend the money, although {{they are unable to}} identify the sender. Soon after that, they discover signs of an apparent intrusion, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> the third key - the one they were supposed to receive with the apartment but never did - and is using it to enter their home while they're away.|$|R

"Under the Milky Way" [...] {{features}} a 12-string acoustic guitar melody {{along with a}} solo composed with an EBow on a Fender Jazzmaster, and recorded [...] on a Synclavier, leading to a sound reminiscent of bagpipes. In October 1990 Jansson told John Tingwell of Drum Media about songwriting with Kilbey [...] "it's a very spontaneous thing. It's not <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> put us together to write a hit song. It's more like sometimes when we write together, a song comes knocking on the door". While in September 2008 Kilbey discussed the track with Iain Shedden of The Australian.|$|R

She later confesses to Beth while under diazepam during a dental exam. Beth kills her and stages her death as a suicide, though Dalton is not fooled, as her wrists are cut so deep it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> cut off her hands.

5000|$|Two mysterious {{stones were}} visible the wall {{opposite}} the church entrance {{as late as}} the 1970s. These were just part of the wall and without closer inspection no different from their neighbours. One, at ground level, had a faint inscription [...] "A Black Man Died Here". A nearby stone had a visible hand print in it <b>as</b> clear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> pressed their hand in clay - though this was limestone. Local children connected the two into a story of a man falling from the church tower centuries earlier. Sadly neither the inscription or the hand are visible now, presumably due to weathering.|$|R

50|$|Usually, the Imam {{would accept}} disciples in the Qadri order. However, if a disciple desired to enter some other Sufi order, the Imam would oblige the disciple.

6000|$|Was it a coward's part to {{run away}} like this? The {{question}} came to her suddenly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>had</b> asked it. She thought of the shambles of the Flanders front--she thought of her brother and her playmate helping to hold those fire-swept trenches. What would they think of her if she shirked her little duty here--the humble duty of carrying the programme through for her Red Cross? But she couldn't stay--she couldn't--yet what was it mother had said when Jem went: [...] "When our women fail in courage shall our men be fearless still?" [...] But this--this was unbearable.|$|R

50|$|Some {{variants}} use the epaulettes <b>as</b> scoring points. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> a six <b>as</b> an epaulette, {{the opponents}} must next score against them using a seven, {{and so on}} until someone receives an ace as an epaulette.

50|$|Among other differences, in {{literary}} works {{a very specific}} concept of attribution is {{a critical part of}} the work itself - works tend to become markedly less valued or more valued based upon who originated or created it, which is simply not the case for inventions or brand names. Also, most countries recognize moral rights that are not alienable from the work, that is, a purchaser of rights in the work does {{not have the right to}} relabel it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>had</b> written it. While the USA does not recognize moral rights, it does have complex de facto standards such as the WGA screenwriting credit system which are actually more demanding and rigorous in specific industries.|$|R

60|$|It was, {{as he had}} said, {{obvious that}} someone had been at work upon it.

5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> would <b>have</b> powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|R

5000|$|Ryan Tubridy was {{announced}} {{as the new}} host of The Late Late Show on 11 May 2009, weeks before Pat Kenny's reign came to an end. Tubridy spoke before his first episode of his plans for his tenure as host of The Late Late Show. He declared that the owl was [...] "not dead". He spoke of his delight at securing an Irish sponsor, Quinn Group, which he described as [...] "a nice honest Cavan business", saying {{he would not be}} [...] "really happy" [...] if his sponsor was [...] "a big British conglomerate". He also confirmed {{that there would be a}} houseband which would feature some of the same members as the Camembert Quartet from Tubridy Tonight. A new version of the theme tune was arranged by Brian Byrne. Terry Prone later commented in the Evening Herald that [...] "the updated signature tune sounded <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> who <b>had</b> heard the original once was trying to remember it through a hangover". The set, which features a desk of walnut, leather chairs and a backdrop with a pink/purple theme, was designed by Darragh Treacy. The opening of ticket applications {{was announced}} on 28 August 2009. Bookmakers began to offer bets for the identity of Tubridy's first guest, with actor Denzel Washington being reported as one of the favourites. Irish Independent television critic John Boland offered Tubridy some tips on being a good chat show host; these included a ban on C-list celebrities, a sense of humour and plenty of surprises.|$|R

2500|$|On October 31, 1983, about 2:00p.m., {{five members}} of a {{construction}} crew saw a 100-foot-long sea serpent off Stinson Beach, which is just north of San Francisco, California. A flagman named Gary saw it first swimming towards the cliffside road which the work crew was repairing. He radioed {{another member of the}} work crew, Matt Ratto, and told him to grab the binoculars. Ratto began looking at the sea serpent when it was 100 yards offshore and {{less than a quarter of}} a mile away. Ratto said, [...] "The body came out of the water first." [...] He added, [...] "It was black with three humps." [...] He continued, [...] "There were three bends. like humps and they rose straight up." [...] He further described it as a [...] "humpy, flat-backed thing". He also made a sketch of the animal which appeared to be a round headed, blunt nosed, snake-like creature followed by 3 vertical arches or coils sticking out of the water. Another eyewitness, Steve Bjora, said [...] "The sucker was going 45 to 50 miles an hour." [...] He also described the animal saying, [...] "It was clipping. It was boogying. It looked like a long eel." [...] Marlene Martin, the Caltran safety engineer who was over seeing the work crew also saw the animal. She said, [...] "It shocked the hell out of me" [...] adding, [...] "That thing's so big he deserves front page coverage." [...] She went on to say, [...] "It was hard to describe how big it was. I have no creative imagination. It was a snake-like thing that arched itself up and was so long it made humps above the water." [...] Martin first saw it near Bolinas and saw it swim the whole way to Stinson beach then watched it turn around and head towards the Farallon Islands. Martin said, [...] "It had a wake as big as a power boat's and it was going about 65 miles an hour. It looked like a great big rubber hose <b>as</b> it moved. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>had</b> gotten in its way it would have plowed right though them." [...] Before it went underwater Martin saw it lift its head and a portion of its body directly behind its head out of the water then open its mouth. Martin said, [...] "It was like it was playing." [...] She described the animal as a [...] "giant snake or a dragon, with a mouth like an alligator's." [...] She continued, [...] "It was at least 15 or 20 feet in circumference, but it was hard to tell how long it was. I mean, how long is a snake?
