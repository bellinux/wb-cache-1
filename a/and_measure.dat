Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> 225–325 by 15–22.5µm. Paraphyses are septate, and cylindrical with tips that are rounded to club-shaped, <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> 150–275 by 7–15µm.

5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are white. Spores are cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> 9–12 by 3–3.5µm. Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of {{generative}} hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to thick-walled, frequently branched, <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> 2–10µm in diameter, while those of the pores are roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their walls that gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> 7–9µm in diameter. They are cylindrical, thin-walled to moderately thick-walled, hyaline, have a septum at the base, <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> 60–120 by 5–10µm.

The sterigmata (the narrow horns {{on the end of}} the basidia which hold the spores) are 4 to 5μm long. It lacks pleurocystidia. The species leaves a snuff-brown spore print. The spores themselves are smooth and bean shaped; they have a yellow-brown to rusty brown colouration, <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> from 9 to 11μm by 4.5 to 5.5μm.

25|$|Under the Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> Act of 1824 {{custody of}} the {{standard}} yard and pound and {{custody of the}} administration of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> was entrusted to the Exchequer but verification was administered locally. The 1835 Act formally described the office and duties of Inspectors of Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> <b>and</b> required every borough to appoint such officers and the 1866 Act passed responsibility for weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> to the Board of Trade.

5|$|Leccinum holopus {{produces}} a brown spore print. Spores are somewhat fusoid (spindle-shaped) <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> 14–20 by 5–6.5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored <b>and</b> <b>measure</b> 28.5–36.5 by 11.5–12.5µm. Cystidia on the pores are flask-shaped (lageniform) to fusiform, and 39.0–45.5 by 7.5–9.0µm, while {{those of the}} stipe (caulocystidia) are fusiform, club-shaped, or cylindrical, measuring 39.0–54.5 x 9.1–13.5µm.

40|$|The {{education}} of inspector of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> at the Delft School of Engineering (1843 - 1963)   The Kingdom of the United Netherlands {{was the first}} state in the world which introduced the Metric System in 1820 through the 1816 Act of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures.</b> At first education for the weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> inspectors was not available. After King William II founded the Royal Academy engineering school in Delft in 1842, the school's first director, Antoine Lipkens, who {{took an interest in}} weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> himself, seized the opportunity to establish a course for inspectors of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> in his school. In this two-year course students were trained to become the highest officials in the national Service of Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures.</b> The programme was of high quality and continuously adapted to the current state of technology and to the various weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> Acts. The weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> inspectors were qualified and all-round experts. Nevertheless, after the Second World War their work became so complex that specialists from different fields in technical colleges and universities took over their tasks. The occupation of inspector of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> became redundant. Attempts to create a university level education for the inspectors failed. In 1963 the Delft engineering school closed the doors to this programme, which was the end of a unique type of education for a unique occupation. 79...|$|R

5|$|The {{spore print}} has been {{reported}} as ranging in color from pinkish, to pinkish-brown, to rosy brown, to vinaceous-fawn.
