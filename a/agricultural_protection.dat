6000|$|Mr. Gladstone kept pretty {{closely in}} step with his leader. From Sir Robert he slowly learned lessons of {{circumspection}} that may not seem congenial to his temperament, though for that matter we should remember all through that his temperament was double. He was of opinion, as he told the House of Commons, that a sliding-scale, a fixed duty, and free trade were all three open to serious objection. He regarded the defects of the existing law as greatly exaggerated, and he refused {{to admit that the}} defects of the law, whatever they might be, were fatal to every law with a sliding-scale. He wished to relieve the consumer, to steady the trade, to augment foreign commerce, and the demand for labour connected with commerce. On the other hand he desired to keep clear of the countervailing evils of disturbing either vast capitals invested in land, or the immense masses of labour employed in agriculture.[162] He noted with some complacency, that during the great controversy of 1846 and following years, he never saw any parliamentary speech of his own quoted in proof of the inconsistency of the Peelites. Here are a couple of entries from Lord Broughton's diary for 1844:--'June 17. Brougham said [...] "Gladstone was a d----d fellow, a prig, and did much mischief to the government," [...] alluding to his speech about keeping sugar duties. June 27. Gladstone made a decided <b>agricultural</b> <b>protection</b> speech, and was lauded therefor by Miles--so the rebels were returning to their allegiance.' Gladstone's arguments, somebody said, were in favour of free trade, and his parentheses were in favour of protection.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the equilibrium {{degree of protection}} as {{the outcome of the}} interaction of demands for protection and the demand for a liberal international trading order.

On one hand, the nature of technical progress, the institution of the Uruguay Round, the mounting costs of <b>agricultural</b> <b>protections</b> and the increasingly high costs of protection as the world economy integrates all conduce toward a more liberal trading order. Demands for protection will intensify to the extent that growth decelerates, that trade negotiators fail to find mechanism to deal with nontariff barriers and that the United States fails to assume this leadership role that was earlier taken. ...|$|R

50|$|The move to {{form the}} group was largely a {{response}} to spiralling trade subsidies of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy and the United States' Export Enhancement Program.
