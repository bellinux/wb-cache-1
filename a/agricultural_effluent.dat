The {{use of pesticides}} for an effective control of plant diseases has become crucial in the last decades in the agriculture system since {{it is estimated that}} pest infections cause yield reductions of almost 20 % of crops worldwide. In the last decades, the use of pesticides in agriculture for disease control has become crucial. As known, fungicides, pesticides and other chemicals can enter to water bodies through rain water, food, irrigation water or rivers in many cases and may be hazardous for living systems. These chemicals influence metabolism at very low concentrations by altering enzyme activities and disrupting physiological balances. Moreover, they are known to interfere with a number of processes as they have neurotoxic, hematotoxic, genotoxic, hepatic and renal effects on vertebrates. In our present study, behavioral changes and responses of the fish Cyprinus carpio to the Monocrotophos, <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluent</b> was observed. Fish were exposed to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluent</b> for 96 hrs. Effluent was added to the aquarium with different dilutions. Control fish showed normal behaviour and swimming in contrast the effluent exposed fish showed abnormal swimming, loss of equilibrium, fading of colour, coughing and opercular movements.

Various techniques such as physical, chemical, biological, advanced oxidation and electrochemical processes were used for the treatment of domestic, industrial and <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents.</b> The commonly used conventional biological treatments processes are not only time consuming but also need large operational area. Accordingly, it seems that these methods are not cost-effective for effluent containing toxic elements. Advanced oxidation techniques result in high treatment cost and are generally used to obtain high purity grade water. The chemical coagulation technique is slow and generates large amount of sludge. Electrocoagulation is an electrochemical technique with many applications. This process has recently attracted attention as a potential technique for treating industrial wastewater due to its versatility and environmental compatibility. This process has been applied for the treatment of many kinds of wastewater such as landfill leachate, restaurant, carwash, slaughterhouse, textile, laundry, tannery, petroleum refinery wastewater and for removal of bacteria, arsenic, fluoride, pesticides and heavy metals from aqueous environments. The objective of the present manuscript is to review the potential of electrocoagulation process for the treatment of domestic, industrial and <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents,</b> especially removal of heavy metals from aqueous environments.

40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the efficiency of Kermanshah wastewater treatment plant (conventional activated sludge) and Gilan-e-Gharb wastewater treatment plant (stabilization ponds) in removal of organic matters (BOD 5 and COD), suspended solids, total coliform, protozoan cyst, and parasitic eggs in order to reuse their effluent for agriculture. Materials and Methods: In this study, the samples were taken every five days from both inlet and outlet of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for five months. Identification and counting of the protozoa cysts and parasitic eggs was carried out using McMaster slide according to Bailenger method. Other parameters were determined according to standard methods. Appropriate statistical techniques (T-test, Kolmogorov Smirnov test, and Mann-Whitney U test, Using SPSS ver. 16) were applied to interpret data. Results: The efficiencies of Kermanshah wastewater treatment plant in removing BOD 5, COD, TSS, total coliform, parasitic eggs, and protozoan cyst were 82 ± 4 %, 83 ± 2 %, 78 ± 5 %, 66. 2 ± 4. 2 %, 97 - 99 %, and 99 - 100 %, respectively.

40|$|AbstractDenitrification walls {{have been}} proven as an effective, {{long-term}} method for remediating nitrogen in groundwater underneath agricultural lands. Utilizing walls to provide large N load reductions requires targeting {{a significant portion of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluent.</b> One approach for more efficient application of walls is to locate them adjacent to zones with high groundwater flow, although treatment efficacy in these conditions is uncertain. In this study, a large wall (168 m 3) receiving high N loads was assessed using a well transect array for hydraulic and water quality evaluations and media were collected from within the wall to evaluate enzyme activity with flow distance. Porewater velocity through the wall was rapid (1. 7 mday− 1) with short detention times (1. 7 – 1. 9 days), yet the wall treated 100 ± 28 m 3 of groundwater per day, effectively removing 228 ± 155 kg of total N per year. Maximum nitrate-N removal rates per media volume (4. 9 – 5. 5 g-Nm− 3 d− 1) were at the upper end of published values. Rapid reduction of potential denitrification rates in media samples from 4. 89 gNm− 3 d− 1 to undetectable within a quarter of the wall length suggests that nitrate-N depletion drove a rapid reduction in denitrifying enzymes. Based on a carbon mass balance, dissolved organic C leaching was initially the largest C export process and the longevity of total bioavailable C was estimated as 23 ± 5. 9 years.

40|$|At present, recycle of {{resources}} from agricultural waste is in priority. In order to mitigate impacts cause {{by the high}} nutrient loads (N and P) in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluent,</b> the utilization of nutrient loads from the effluent is essential. Two South Australian species of zooplankton, Daphnia carinata and Moina australiensis are commonly found in <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluent</b> ponds in the Roseworthy district of South Australia. These studies compared the ability of both zooplankton species to utilise nutrients when cultured in anaerobically digested piggery effluent and their subsequent suitability for use as live feed for aquaculture. In {{order to understand the}} start-up and maintenance of both species in culture, their reproduction was investigated. The study was carried out from Mar 2007 to Dec 2009 and designed to; a. determine the optimal culture conditions for asexual reproduction, based on nutrient tolerance (LC 50 of un-ionized ammonia level), optimal culture temperature and photoperiod effects; b. identify conditions suited for sexual reproduction by focusing on stimuli to induce and hatch ephippia (resting egg), storage conditions for ephippia, sex ratio and embryonic development of the resting egg; c. determine the nutrient utilization efficacy of both zooplankton species; and d. quantify the nutritional profile of both species raised on effluentgrown algae to used be as live feed in aquaculture. M. australiensis had greater (P< 0. 05) tolerance at higher levels of un-ionized ammonia (NH₃-N) than D. carinata. Moreover, older neonates (< 48 hrs old) could survive at higher concentrations of un-ionized ammonia nitrogen than younger neonates. Maximum reproductive performance for D. carinata and M. australiensis occurred at 0. 5 and 4. 5 mg/l NH₃-N respectively. Both species had an optimum reproductive performance at 23 ºC. M. australiensis had a remarkably higher net reproductive rate (112. 05) and intrinsic rate (0. 62) than D. carinata. Hence M. australiensis is a faster growing species compared to D. carinata. M. australiensis had a higher percentage of induced ephippial brood and cumulative hatching of ephippia compared to D. carinata under multiple stimuli of photoperiod, temperature and density. However, the survival percentage of M. australiensis was lower and the time to resume asexual reproduction was longer after release of ephippia. The male to female ratio of 5 : 5 (1 : 1) or 4 : 5 maximized the induction of ephippial brood of both species. The ephippia of both species preferred storage in wet conditions. The zooplankton candidates (non-fed with algae) utilized higher levels of nutrients (TN and SP) compared to the fed group. In the case of D. carinata (non-fed), the reduction of TN, SP and BOD₅ was 18. 8 %, 18 % and 60 %, while in the case of M. australiensis (non-fed), the reduction of TN, SP and BOD 5 was 16. 9 %, 12. 3 % and 64. 5 %. The mean reduction in BOD₅ provided further evidence that both species could utilize nutrients. Both species contained an appreciable quantity of protein and lipid after being fed with effluent-grown algae. The essential amino acid content of M. australiensis met the requirements of both omnivorous and carnivorous fish fry, but D. carinata only met the requirements of omnivorous fish fry. Both species had over 50 % unsaturated fatty acids which were mainly (n- 6) poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Both zooplankton species have the capability of converting mono-unsaturated fatty acids (n- 6) to poly-unsaturated fatty acids. The nutritional profile analysis showed that D. carinata and M. australiensis could be used as live food for freshwater fish larvae. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Agronomic {{research}} documents {{a strong}} correlation between the level of irrigation water applied and the level of farm chemicals leached into water bodies. Consequently, policies that cause farmers to alter irrigation water management practices are likely to influence water quality. Water markets are a potentially attractive method of addressing agriculturally induced water quality concerns because they provide an economic incentive to reduce <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluent</b> which is less costly to farmers and society than command and control or tax policies. This research focuses on quantifying key economic and environmental implications of changes in institutional rules defining terms of water trade. At the heart of this dissertation is an empirical hydrologic-economic simulation model of the Treasure Valley area of eastern Oregon. The economic component of the model consists of 8 subregional mathematical programming models. The models vary across subregions with differences in soil productivity, production technology and irrigation cost specification. The hydrologic component of the model consist of two parts. A nitrate leaching model describes how changes in crop choice, irrigation and nitrogen input influence the level of nitrate leaving the root zone. A finite difference model describes the process of nitrate dilution in the aquifer. Five impacts of water trade are predicted: 1) water supplied to water markets, 2) profits from water market participation, 3) local groundwater quality effects, 4) local economic effects of water markets, and 5) effects of water markets on third party water rights holders. Significant conclusions drawn from the study include: 1) in large portions of the study area, the annual returns to selling water rights exceeds returns to continued irrigated crop production, even at very moderate water prices (20 an acre foot); 2) at current water prices, the parts of the study area most likely to supply water to markets are areas used for extensive cultivation of hay, pasture and grain which contribute little to the loading of the underlying aquifer with nitrates; 3) a well developed water market in the area would not likely lead to full compliance with EPA groundwater quality standards; 4) the Oregon Statute allowing sale of conserved water is unlikely to induce much trade in conserved water in the Treasure Valley...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding {{the impact of}} fossil fuel use upon {{the environment and the}} cost of production have led to a growth in the interest of obtaining energy from biomass. 1 st and 2 nd generation biomass types, however, are often criticised for their high energy requirements and environmental impacts. Algal biomass is considered a 3 rd generation biomass which does not require arable land for cultivation, typically has a high productivity and can be converted {{to a wide variety of}} energy carriers. Despite research on the concept of producing energy from algal biomass dating back to the 1960 s there has been limited commercial development and the environmental advantages are still in doubt. This thesis investigated the potential of algal biomass as a source of bioenergy feedstock by considering the cultivation and processing of localised species of algae and applying life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to algal biofuel production systems. Experiments were conducted to examine the productivity of a wild algal species in wastewater and the potential recoverable bioenergy yields. The LCA studies drew together data from external studies, commercial databases, industrial reports and experimental work to assess the environmental impacts and the energy balance for each system considered. The thesis investigated the generation of biofuel from both freshwater algal biomass and marine algal biomass. For both cases, the current state of research was examined and the gaps determined. Existing studies suggest the high intensity of microalgal biomass production (fertiliser requirements, high energy harvesting) greatly reduces the overall sustainability. Part of this thesis therefore investigated the possibility of a low input system of microalgal cultivation. A recommended approach was suggested using local species cultivated in wastewater as the nutrient source and a conversion strategy based on the characteristics of the dominant species. The practicality and effectiveness of cultivating and processing locally grown algal biomass under low input conditions was determined by experiments that were conducted in the laboratory. Algal biomass was collected locally and cultivated in the laboratory using <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluent</b> as the nutrient source.

The flow rate was adjusted to match the rise and decay of a typical drainage hydrograph. Effluent was sampled after hydraulic residence times (HRT) of 1. 5, 8, 12, and 24 h. The laboratory experiment was conducted at 15 °C for 14 weeks, 5 °C for 13 weeks, and 15 °C again for 7 weeks in a temperature controlled chamber, designated the warm run, cold run and rewarm run, respectively. Nitrate-N load reductions ranged from 24 % to 96 % in the warm and rewarm runs and from 4 % to 80 % in the cold run. Nitrate-N load reduction performance at all temperatures was in the order of: WC+A > CC+MC > CC > CC+MC+MBC > WC > WC+BC. The nitrate removal rate (NRR) was highest at the 1. 5 h HRT for the WC+A treatment at all temperatures. Cumulative DRP load reductions in the warm and rewarm runs were statistically higher in the CC, CC+MC, and CC+MC+MBC treatments, with DRP load reductions of 74 %, 81 %, and 67 %, respectively. The WC+A treatment had the highest DRP load reduction in the cold run, with a 45 % reduction. The CC, CC+MC, and CC+MC+MBC treatments had both high NRR and high DRP percent concentration removal in the warm and rewarm runs, but the WC+A treatment had higher removal of both nutrients in the cold run and specifically at lower HRTs. For both nitrate-N and DRP load reductions during high flows and cold temperatures, WC+A would be the recommended treatment. Future work should focus on the addition of carbon such as sodium acetate to enhance bioreactor performance during high drainage and cold temperature conditions...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the level}} of heavy metals (Zn, Mn, Fe, Pb, Co, Ni, Cd) and characteristics of their transportation through the water of minor rivers in Rivne region, Ukraine. The levels of Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co {{in the waters of}} these fisheries exceeded the maximum permissible concentration limit in different months. We found that the concentration of Pb and Cd did not exceed the permissible concentration limit in the waters of the fisheries during the year of research, while {{the level of}} other metals exceeded the permissible levels by 1. 1 to 151. 0 times. This research confirms that the surface waters of Rivne region are characterized by high concentrations of iron, manganese, zinc, and nickel. The level of iron exceeded the maximum permissible concentration limit by 1. 1 to 5. 0 times, the level of zinc by 1. 5 to 15. 0 times, that of manganese by 1. 3 to 6. 7 times and the nickel level by 1. 3 to 151. 0 times in the fishery waters. In principle, the increase in the level of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co) is connected with the lithological composition of reservoirs in the water-collecting areas of the investigated rivers, and besides with the significant influence of the anthropogenic load (fuel combustion, aqueous wastes of factory units, <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluent,</b> etc.), and with the increase in aquatic vegetation, pH balance, temperature change and so on. The appearance of iron-manganese compounds can be explained by natural causes such as reformation of the source minerals into secondary minerals in the conditions of pH level recession in water, which causes the release of these molecular entities; leaching of iron from the iron-manganese septarian nodules, a substantial amount of which is contained in the illuvial horizon. The increase in the level of zinc and nickel in the river water is connected with the leaching of these elements from subsurface rocks, soil and forest leaf litter. Atmospheric condensation is a significant source of the presence of nickel in the surface water. For the investigated rivers, the most significant factors in the water’s chemical composition are physiographic (foremost, the character of the soil cover, intensivity of erosion, extent of forest and swamp cover) and anthropogenous impact. In the rivers of Rivne region high concentrations of heavy metals are the consequence of the long-term aggradation of abiotic and biotic substances of the water ecosystem. There is a tendency for a reduction in the concentration of most metals in the abiotic substances of the water reservoir during the vegetative season and an increase after the end of this season. This research shows that the high level of contamination of the water of Rivne region’s minor rivers by the investigated heavy metal components is caused primarily by anthropogenic factors...|$|E
40|$|Surfactants {{can be used}} {{to alter}} {{wettability}} of reservoir rock, increasing spontaneous imbibition and thus improving oil yields. Commercial synthetic surfactants are often prohibitively expensive and so a crude preparation of the anionic biosurfactant, surfactin, from Bacillus subtilis grown on high-starch industrial and <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents</b> has been proposed as an economical alternative. To assess the effectiveness of the surfactin, it is compared to commercially available surfactants. In selecting a suitable benchmark surfactant, two metrics are examined: the ability of the surfactants to alter wettability at low concentrations, {{and the degree to which}} they are absorbed onto reservoir matrix. We review the literature to survey the adsorption models that have been developed to describe surfactant adsorption in porous media. These models are evaluated using the experimental data from this study. Crushed carbonate rock samples are cleaned and aged in crude oil. The wettability change mediated by dilute solutions of commercial anionic surfactants and surfactin is assessed using a two-phase separation; and surfactant loss due to retention and adsorption the rock is determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{aromatic}} amine 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA) {{is a model}} environmental contaminant, precursor for synthesis and degradation product of several herbicides, which is commonly found in European estuarine ecosystems. In this work, {{the possibility of using}} biochemical and histological markers to assess sub-lethal effects of DCA in natural populations of Pomatoschistus microps juveniles was investigated. Alterations on the activities of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and histological alterations on spleen were investigated after 96 h of exposure to sublethal concentrations of DCA (0. 50 - 1. 49 mg/l). At the concentrations tested, DCA had no effect on AChE activity. LDH and GST activities were significant altered in treated animals when compared to control groups. As already described for mammals, DCA induced splenic histological alterations in P. microps, including expansion of red pulp and deposition of hemosiderin granules in a concentration-dependent manner. This suggests that DCA is a xenobiotic of concern in estuaries receiving <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The Caribbean Sea hosts twenty-seven {{small island}} {{developing}} states (SIDS), {{some of which}} utilise their marine resources found in the Caribbean Sea for economic gains. Many of the economic activities such as tourism, shipping and industrial development are currently incompatible with a healthy and sustainable marine environment. Sewage, <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents</b> and hydrocarbon pollution resulting from these economic activities have led to degradation of this large marine ecosystem. In an effort to address these issues; policies, programmes and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) were initiated in order to regionalise the response efforts. These include efforts such the Cartagena Convention, the integrated watershed and coastal area management (IWCAM) initiative and pollution assessment among others. This paper reviews the regional responses by the SIDS and other agencies in dealing with pollution from land and marine-based activities and biodiversity loss via these initiatives. The findings showed that the region lack the commitment needed {{as demonstrated by the}} poor ratification rate of major MEAs, disjointed programmes and strong political influences.

30|$|Frequent {{usage of}} {{herbicides}} (i.e. atrazine) at the home, farm land, school field, etc., and discharge of its wastewater from the producing industries into surface water bodies have become endangered to our ecosystem (i.e. aquatic organism and human). The {{major sources of}} atrazine in surface and underground water system are industrial <b>effluents,</b> domestic wastewaters, <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents</b> and spillage of chemicals from anthropogenic activities (Kolpin et al. 1997; Miller et al. 2000). Continuous exposure to atrazine in water may cause cancer, endocrine disrupter and mammary gland tumour. Humans and living organisms can also suffer mutagenesis and carcinogenesis {{as a result of}} atrazine contamination (EPA 1990). Although it has been banned in most European countries, it {{is still one of the}} most widely used herbicides in the USA and also registered in more than 70 countries worldwide (Kauffmann et al. 2000). It has been in use since 1958 as a pre- and post-emergent herbicide to control broad-leaved weeds in production of corn and sorghum (Jone et al. 1982). Atrazine is a probable human carcinogen, and its current maximum contaminant level in drinking water established by the environmental protection agency is 3.0  µg/L.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{risks for}} cancer {{and the case}} for a cause–effect relationship in five successive cohorts of naval commando divers (n = 682) with prolonged underwater exposures (skin, gastrointestinal tract, and airways) to many toxic compounds in the Kishon River, Israel’s most polluted waterway, from 1948 to 1995. Releases of industrial, ship, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents</b> in the river increased substantially, fish yields decreased, and toxic damage to marine organisms increased. Among the divers (16, 343 person-years follow-up from 18 years of age to year 2000), the observed/expected ratio for all tumors was 2. 29 (p < 0. 01). Risks increased in cohorts first diving after 1960 compared to risks in earlier cohorts, notably for hematolymphopoietic, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and skin cancer; induction periods were often brief. The findings suggest that the increases in risk for cancer and short induction periods resulted from direct contact with and absorption of multiple toxic compounds. Early toxic effects in marine life predicted later risks for cancer in divers.

40|$|Concentrations and {{distributions}} of trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in surficial sediments of the Cochin backwaters were studied during both monsoon and pre-monsoon periods. Spatial variations were {{in accordance with}} textural charaterstics and organic matter content. A principal component analysis distinguished three zones with different metal accumulation capacity: (i) highest levels in north estuary, (ii) moderate levels in central zone, and (iii) lowest levels in southern part. Trace metal enrichments are mainly due to anthropogenic contribution of industrial, domestic, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents,</b> whose effect is enhanced by settling of metals due to organic flocculation and inorganic precipitation associated with salinity changes. Enrichments factors using Fe as a normalizer showed that metal contamination was the product of anthropogenic activities. An assessment of degree of pollution-categorized sediments as moderately polluted with Cu and Pb, moderately-to-heavily polluted with Zn, and heavily-to-extremely polluted with Cd. Concentrations at many sites largely exceed NOAA ERL (e. g., Cu, Cr, and Pb) or ERM (e. g., Cd, Ni, and Zn). This means that adverse effects for benthic organisms are possible or even highly probable...|$|R
40|$|Some <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents</b> are {{unsuitable}} for discharge into standard sewage-treatment plants: their pretreatment {{is necessary to}} avoid clogging of the filtering devices by colloidal matter. The colloidal stability of the effluents is mainly due to mutual repulsive forces that keep charged particles in suspension. Pretreatment processes are based on two separate stages: (a) neutralization of the charges (“coagulation”) and (b) bridging between several small particles to form larger aggregates that sink, leaving clarified effluent (“flocculation”). The consequent destabilization of the colloidal suspension lowers total suspended solids (TSSs), turbidity, and other environmental quality parameters, making the treatments that follow more efficient. Clay-based materials {{have been widely used}} for effluent pretreatment and pollutant removal. This study presents the use of nanocomposites, comprised of an anchoring particle and a polymer, as “coagoflocculants” for the efficient and rapid reduction of TSS and turbidity in wastewater with a high organic load. The use of such particles combines the advantages of coagulant and flocculant by neutralizing the charge of the suspended particles while bridging between them and anchoring them to a denser particle (the clay mineral), enhancing their precipitation. Very rapid and efficient pretreatment is achieved in one single treatment step...|$|R
40|$|Located in {{southern}} Brazil, the Pampa biome {{has been under}} constant threat due to improper management of human effluents and use of pesticides. These contaminants accumulate mainly in water resources resulting in chronic poisoning of aquatic biota. Up to date, no studies on the assessment of environmental quality in the Brazilian portion of Pampa biome have been undertaken. Thereby, our main goal {{in this study was}} to investigate the ecotoxicological risks caused by human activity in the Santa Maria River, a major water course in the Brazilian Pampa biome. Brain and muscle tissues were used for determining oxidative stress and cholinesterase biomarkers in fish (Astyanax sp.) exposed to urban and <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents.</b> A substantial decrease in fish muscle acetylcholinesterase activity was observed in exposed animals, compared to controls (kept under laboratory conditions). In parallel, increased lipid peroxidation and significant changes in stress-responsive antioxidant enzymes (GST, CAT, GPx, and TrxR) were detected. In the fish brain, a significant increase in GST activity is reported. In conclusion, our results showed significant changes in biomarkers of water contamination in Astyanax captured in Santa Maria River, pointing to important levels of water pollution in the region and validating the use of Astyanax in biomonitoring programs within the Pampa biome borders...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{arc furnace}} (EAF) steel slag filters were {{investigated}} for their efficiency at reducing {{the concentration of}} phosphorus (P) from dairy farm wastewater in Vermont. The primary objective {{for this study was}} to examine the use of in series design on filters’ performance in P removal from dairy farm wastewater at subzero temperatures. Other research objectives were to investigate operational parameters such as the effects of total suspended solids (TSS) daily mass loading rates and of alternating feeding and resting periods on EAF steel slag filters’ TSS, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiencies and filter system life-span. The utilization of in series filter design increased filter DRP removal efficiency by 35 %. In series design also allows for alternating feeding and resting periods, which resulted in a 16 %, 57 % and 74 % increase in TSS, DRP and TP removal efficiencies, respectively, by the first filter in series over a single period. Additionally, the system life span was extended 3. 25 fold (from 52 to 169 day). Based on this research, we recommend alternate feeding and resting cycles and in series design to be integrated in the design of EAF steel slag filter systems for highly concentrated <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents</b> in cold climates...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in preserving the quality of water for distribution processes {{in order to maximize}} the fulfillment of various sectors has considerably increased. Be it domestic sources, industrial or <b>agricultural</b> <b>effluents,</b> the massive increase of industrial productions accompanied by high growth of large urban populations has led ti severe water population problems. Various chemical and biological treatments are available for degradation of water pollutions but most of them are not environmental friendly. However, effective microorganism (EM) technology is able to restore and clean water pollutions at low cost. Therefore, mathematical model for water pollutions has been implemented and the effect of EM on degradation of pollutants in river is considered. The model equations which consist of system of three one dimensional non-linear partial differential equations (ODE) has been simulated to describe the degradation of pollutants in river. Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) is used to solve the system of non-linear PDE. The effect of EM's addition on river pollution is seen from the three cases involving three different initial bacterial concentrations (25 mhL- 1, 50 mgL- 1 and 100 mgL- 1). Based on the results, high bacterial concentrations applied will increase the degradation rate as well as shortening the distance required for pollutant removal...|$|R
