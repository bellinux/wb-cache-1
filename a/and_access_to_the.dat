It was expanded in 1991 and in 1993 Exmoor was designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area. The Quantock Hills were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1956, the first such designation in England under the National Parks <b>and</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Countryside Act 1949. The Mendip Hills followed with AONB designation in 1972.|$|E

5|$|As their landscapes {{have similar}} scenic qualities, AONBs may be {{compared}} to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks, the National Parks <b>and</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Countryside Act 1949. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties are imposed on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E

A complimentary Japanese tea service greets each guest upon check-in, featuring green tea and special rice crackers. As a security feature, the elevators must be operated from the outside with a room key. There are no buttons inside the elevators themselves.

5|$|Conditions in Yosemite Valley <b>and</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park {{steadily}} improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite {{to breach}} a recessional moraine {{in the valley}} to drain a swamp behind it. Tourism significantly increased after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872.|$|E

5|$|In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove {{of giant}} sequoia trees were {{transferred}} from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable to people <b>and</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park was improved {{in the late}} 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove {{were added to the}} national park in 1906.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits <b>and</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's {{geographical}} {{location in the}} Midwest, its large population, and its agricultural production made the state's wartime support critical to the Union's success. Indiana, with the fifth-largest population of the states that remained in the Union, could supply much-needed manpower for the war effort, its railroad network <b>and</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ohio River and the Great Lakes could transport troops and supplies, and its agricultural yield, which became even more valuable to the Union after {{the loss of the}} rich farmland of the South, could provide grain and livestock.|$|E
5|$|Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) are {{designated}} by local authorities under the National Parks <b>and</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Countryside Act 1949. The local authority {{must have a}} legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having {{an agreement with the}} owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically, and local authorities have a duty to care for them. They can apply local bye-laws to manage and protect LNRs.|$|E
5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory <b>and</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{exported}} grain left Poland through Danzig (Gdańsk), {{which became}} the wealthiest, most highly developed, and most autonomous of the Polish cities because of its location {{at the mouth of}} the Vistula River <b>and</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Sea. It was also by far the largest center for manufacturing. Other towns were negatively affected by Danzig's near-monopoly in foreign trade, but profitably participated in transit and export activities. The largest of those were Kraków (Cracow), Poznań, Lwów (Lviv), and Warszawa (Warsaw), and outside of the Crown, Breslau (Wrocław). Thorn (Toruń) and Elbing (Elbląg) were the main cities in Royal Prussia after Danzig.|$|E
5|$|National nature {{reserves}} in England (NNR) are designated under Part III of the National Parks <b>and</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Countryside Act 1949 that are {{deemed to be}} of national importance by Natural England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England using section 35(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed {{on behalf of the}} nation, many by Natural England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including Avon Wildlife Trust or the Somerset Wildlife Trust, the National Trust, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E

5|$|The Blackdown Hills have, since 1991, been {{designated}} as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks: the National Parks <b>and</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Countryside Act 1949. However, National Parks, unlike AONBs, have their own authorities and have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development.

5|$|The Chickasaw Turnpike takes a southwest-to-northeast route, {{passing through}} only two counties, Murray and Pontotoc. The turnpike begins in Murray County at U.S. Highway177 (US-177) north of Sulphur; west of this interchange, the road becomes State Highway 7 Spur (SH-7 Spur). The turnpike {{continues}} northeast into Pontotoc County. Just {{north of the}} county line is a barrier toll plaza, the only plaza along the route. Beyond the tollbooth lies an interchange serving the town of Roff. This is a partial interchange, providing access to Roff for eastbound travelers <b>and</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> westbound lanes from Roff. The Chickasaw Turnpike then ends at SH-1.|$|E
5|$|The National Park, 71% {{of which}} is in Somerset and 29% in Devon, has a {{resident}} population of 10,600. It was designated a National Park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks <b>and</b> <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Countryside Act. About {{three quarters of the}} park is privately owned, made up of numerous private estates. The largest landowners are the National Trust, which owns over 10% of the land, and the National Park Authority, which owns about 7%. Other areas are owned by the Forestry Commission, Crown Estate and Water Companies. The largest private landowner is the Badgworthy Land Company, which represents hunting interests.|$|E
