5|$|Construction {{activities}} {{were taken in}} hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, {{and some of the}} buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and <b>avgas</b> dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the <b>avgas</b> tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 May, both sides located each other {{at about the same}} time and began {{launching}} their aircraft about 09:00. The American dive bombers disabled Shōkakus flight deck with three hits, but the carrier was able to evade all of the torpedoes. Hidden by a rain squall, Zuikaku escaped detection and was not attacked. In return, the Japanese aircraft badly damaged Lexington with two torpedo and two bomb hits and scored a single bomb hit on Yorktown. The torpedo hits on Lexington cracked one of her <b>avgas</b> tanks, and leaking vapor caused a series of large explosions that caused her to be scuttled.|$|E
5|$|Fuel was pumped {{from the}} port storage tanks to the {{starboard}} side to correct the list and Lexington began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were low on fuel at 11:39. The Japanese had shot down three of Lexingtons Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port <b>avgas</b> tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage control station. The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low on fuel landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning's air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally was three Wildcats shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch.|$|E
25|$|All the AA-1s, AA-1As and AA-1Bs were {{powered by}} the Lycoming O-235-C2C low-compression engine {{designed}} for 80/87 <b>avgas,</b> which produced 108hp.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{aviation}} gasoline (<b>avgas)</b> is dyed to identify its octane rating and to {{distinguish it from}} kerosene-based jet fuel, which is clear.|$|E
25|$|This {{system was}} given this name {{following}} an accident in which Hoover was seriously injured, when both engines on his Shrike Commander failed during takeoff. Investigators {{found that the}} plane had just been fueled by line personnel who mistook the piston-engine Shrike for a similar turboprop model, filling the tanks with jet fuel instead of <b>avgas</b> (aviation gasoline). There was enough <b>avgas</b> in the fuel system to taxi to the runway and take off, but then the jet fuel was drawn into the engines, causing them to stop.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the basic}} formula {{remained}} unchanged in 1958, races were shortened from around 500km/300miles to 300km/200 miles and cars {{had to use}} <b>Avgas</b> instead of various fuel mixtures using methanol as the primary component.|$|E
25|$|The {{octane rating}} became {{important}} as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s. A higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output. Some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power. In 1943, the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower (984kW) using 100 RON fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement. By the time of Operation Overlord during World War II both the RAF and USAAF were conducting some operations in Europe using 150 RON fuel (100/150 <b>avgas),</b> obtained by adding 2.5% aniline to 100 octane <b>avgas.</b> By this time the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 was developing 2,000hp using this fuel.|$|E

Empire Dickens {{was a member}} of Convoy ON 270, which departed from Southend on 3 December and arrived at New York on 22 December.|$|E
25|$|The -A, -C and -E {{variants}} of the carbureted O-320, {{but none of}} the high compression or fuel-injected versions, have available STCs that allow the use of automotive fuel as a replacement for more expensive <b>avgas.</b> However, in some cases the D series engine, with a fuel-pump modification, is allowed to use minimum 91 octane automotive gas as part of an STC for the Piper aircraft to which it is attached.|$|E
25|$|The IO-233 was {{announced}} by the company at AirVenture on 28 July 2008 as a new engine for light sport aircraft. The engine was conceived as a lightened version of the Lycoming O-235 by company engineers who were building their own kit LSAs and {{found that there was}} no powerplant that met their requirements for power output and weight, with the ability to burn either 100LL <b>avgas</b> or unleaded automotive fuel.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses {{aboard the}} DC-6 saw the Swift {{fly into the}} No. 4 propeller, the {{outermost}} propeller on the right wing. The collision severed most of the left wing of the Swift, threw the small plane over the fuselage of the DC-6, thus damaging the airliner's antenna, and sent the craft spiraling into a northwest Dallas street. A nearby resident, Leo Zeock, heard the crash from inside his home and ran to render aid, but he found Brower and Walker already dead. The wreck subsequently caught fire {{and had to be}} extinguished by Dallas firefighters; however, the blaze was attributed to leaking <b>avgas</b> ignited by a cigarette discarded by a spectator, not to the crash itself.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 2013, it was {{announced}} that the company had been purchased by Soaring America Corporation, a new California-based company headed by President Cheng Yuan (Jerry Chen) of Taiwan, for an undisclosed amount. Chen heads a group of Chinese investors that some reports indicate include the Meijing Group, a Chinese real-estate developer. Chen indicated his priorities included resuming production of the Acclaim and the Ovation, while continuing to supply parts for the existing fleet. Chen stated the company would remain in Kerrville, and concentrate on supplying new aircraft for the Chinese market. Paul Bertorelli, AVweb's Editorial Director, Aviation Publications, questioned whether the outdated and expensive-to-produce Mooney models, that use engines burning <b>avgas,</b> can succeed in the Chinese market.|$|E

25|$|It was the Nakajima firm's own-designed 35.8 litre displacement, Ha-45 Homare ("Praise or Honor") {{air-cooled}} eighteen-cylinder radial engine, first {{accepted for}} military use in 1941, {{that gave the}} Hayate its high speed and prowess in combat. Derived from the Nakajima Homare engines common to many Japanese aircraft, the Hayate used the Homare 21 direct-injection version of the engine, using water injection to aid the supercharger in giving the Ki-84 a rated 1,491kW (2,000hp) at takeoff. This combination theoretically gave it a climb rate and top speed roughly competitive with the top Allied fighters. Initial Hayate testing at Tachikawa in early summer 1943 saw test pilot Lieutenant Funabashi reach a maximum level airspeed of 624km/h (387mph) in the second prototype. After the war a captured late-production example was tested in the US and achieved a speed of 680km/h (422mph) using 92 octane <b>AvGas,</b> plus methanol injection.|$|E

Therefore, the IJN thought it prudent to fill the empty spaces between the tanks and the cofferdam with [...] of concrete to prevent any fumes from escaping.|$|E
500|$|When the {{aircraft}} were ready, they flew to Iwo Jima and stopped for the night. There they were loaded {{with as much}} fuel as they could hold. It was known that the intended air base in Hokkaidō {{did not have enough}} <b>avgas</b> to fill all three B-29s for the long-distance flight, meaning that at Hokkaidō they could only top off the fuel tanks {{to make up for the}} amount used to fly from Iwo Jima. On September 15, the three aircraft left Iwo Jima, flying north past Okinawa, where the typhoon had blown itself out. They continued to Hokkaidō where the approach involved some apprehension. The Japanese air base had been judged by Colonel William [...] "Butch" [...] Blanchard as suitable for B-29s, with a runway that was long enough and was near sea level for maximum lift in the densest possible air, but it was not known whether it could hold such heavily laden bombers without the concrete cracking. LeMay sent Douglas C-54 Skymasters filled with 55-gallon (210L) drums of <b>avgas</b> to Sapporo—the crewmen would have to top off their tanks by hand.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} torpedo plane attacks, American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese {{carriers}} almost undetected and began their dives. At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from Enterprise, led by C. Wade McClusky, hit Kaga with one [...] bomb {{and at least}} three [...] bombs. The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire, and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar, setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. Captain Okada {{and most of the}} ship's senior officers were killed by the third bomb, which hit the bridge. The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar. The explosions ruptured the ship's <b>avgas</b> lines, damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the emergency generator powering her fire pumps, as well as knocking out the carbon dioxide fire suppression system. Fueled by the <b>avgas</b> pouring onto the hangar deck, the fires detonated the [...] of bombs and torpedoes strewn across the hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple fuel-air explosions that blew out the hangar sides. At nearly the same time, dive bombers hit and fatally damaged Akagi and Sōryū.|$|E
