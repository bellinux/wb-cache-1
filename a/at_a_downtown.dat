5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who {{was in and out}} of her life as a child and teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus up to go to a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how it seemed like a vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death of a heart attack in June 2007.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to revitalize}} the {{downtown}} {{were made in the}} 1970s with the construction of a pedestrian mall and a ten thousand-seat multipurpose arena. The former sectioned off Rockford's Main Street, impeding vehicle traffic, to the criticism of nearby business owners. The latter, the MetroCentre, opened in 1981 to performances by Dionne Warwick and The Rolling Stones. State grants were also consulted to reverse the trend, such as those that funded an Alexander Liberman sculpture placed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> intersection in 1978. However, further decay occurred in the 1980s, such as the end of Amtrak service on the Black Hawk rail route from Chicago in 1981 and the closure of the Coronado Theatre due to declining revenues in 1984.|$|E

500|$|On April 3, 2014, Kane {{was accused}} of assault, after an {{incident}} in Vancouver, and sued for financial damages. On April 5, 2014, Kane was a healthy scratch under new head coach Paul Maurice, {{in a game against}} the Toronto Maple Leafs. After the game, Maurice said it was a coach's decision, and that if Kane wanted back in the lineup, all he needed to do was [...] "probably just come to the rink." [...] On February 3, 2015 Kane was a healthy scratch against the Vancouver Canucks. It was later determined that he was scratched because of an incident with his teammates. Kane revealed in an October 2015 interview that he felt the Jets did not [...] "have his back" [...] throughout his legal and behavioral issues but instead felt that they traded away their problem. On August 1, Kane plead not guilty to charges alleging he grabbed three women during an altercation <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> Buffalo bar in June 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Non-violent {{action against}} {{segregation}} began in Rock Hill in 1961, when nine black Friendship Junior College students took {{seats at the}} whites-only lunch counter <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> McCrory's and refused to leave. When police arrested them, the students were given the choice of paying $200 fines or serving 30 days of hard labor in the York County jail. The Friendship Nine, as they became known, chose the latter, gaining national attention in the Civil Rights Movement because of their decision to use the [...] "jail, no bail" [...] strategy.|$|E
2500|$|Among the [...] "firsts" [...] by Marshall Field's was {{the concept}} of the {{department}} store tea room. In the 19th century, ladies shopping downtown returned home for lunch; having lunch <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> restaurant unescorted by a gentleman was not considered ladylike. But after a Marshall Field's clerk shared her lunch (a chicken pot pie) with a tired shopper, Field's hit on the idea of opening a department store tea room, so that women shoppers would not feel the need to make two trips to complete their shopping. To this day, the Walnut Room serves the traditional Mrs. Herring's chicken pot pie.|$|E

2500|$|The war {{also was}} {{responsible}} for the first city integration ordinance, which passed the Board of Aldermen in March 1944 and allowed African-Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private [...] ) lunch counters. In May 1944, a black sailor in uniform was refused service <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> lunch counter; in response, members of the Citizens Civil Rights Committee of St. Louis organized a sit-in on May 18, 1944 at a drugstore lunch counter in downtown. The peaceful protesters were carried out, and subsequent sit-ins at Stix, Baer, Fuller department store lunch counters also ended with the removal of protesters. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch counters resulted; however, Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in the fall of 1944.|$|E

Lou Dog was often allowed to wander around the stage during the band's concert performances.

The group met in front of the Surratt boarding house at 2:00p.m. to receive instructions from Booth. Booth sent Herold out to the Surratt tavern with equipment, and informed the others that they should wait at a local saloon while he rode out to the Soldier's Home to scout the area. When Booth arrived at the Soldier's Home, he learned that Lincoln had decided to address a group of Indiana soldiers <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> hotel instead.

On the following day, Double Trouble made an appearance at a record store in Greenwich Village, where they signed autographs for fans. In late October 1984, the band toured Australia and New Zealand, which included one of their first appearances on Australian television—on Hey Hey It's Saturday—where they performed [...] "Texas Flood", and an interview on Sounds. On November 5 and 9, they played sold-out concerts at the Sydney Opera House. Upon returning to the US, Double Trouble went on a brief tour in California. Soon afterward, Vaughan and Lenny went to the island of Saint Croix, on the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea, where they had spent some time vacationing in December. The next month, Double Trouble flew to Japan, where they appeared for five performances, including at Kosei Nenkin Kaikan in Osaka.|$|E
2500|$|On September 6, 2000, the NFL's 32nd {{franchise}} {{was officially}} christened the Houston Texans before thousands <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>downtown</b> rally in Houston.

[...] The nickname [...] "Texans" [...] was more recently used by the now-defunct Canadian Football League franchise in San Antonio; the Texans had previously been {{the name of a}} former World Football League franchise in Houston, which moved to Louisiana to become the Shreveport Steamer; the Dallas Texans of the NFL which only played in the 1952 season; and the nickname was also used by the precursor of the present-day Kansas City Chiefs, when they were the Dallas Texans of the American Football League (AFL).

He said that he woke up from the coma on May 3 with his rifle missing and heard about a suspect matching his description. He then hitch-hiked to Los Angeles feeling like he was running from murder. Baumann said that he was discharged from the AAF for being a psychoneurotic in 1945. The chief of police said, [...] "I feel that the man is certainly a mental case. The Texarkana killings could have been the work of a mental case and so far as we know this man could have done it. But we have absolutely no facts. They will have to be developed, if they exist."
