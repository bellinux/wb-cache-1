5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (<b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>butadiene</b> styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E

40|$|While vinyl-terminated <b>butadiene</b> <b>acrylonitrile</b> is {{frequently}} {{used for the}} toughening of vinylester and polyester, very limited {{research has been conducted}} on modification of epoxy with this oligomer. Herein, the effect of vinyl-terminated <b>butadiene</b> <b>acrylonitrile</b> addition to epoxy in bulk and glass reinforced composite is systematically investigated. Thermo-physical behavior and mechanical characteristics of the samples are determined. To interpret the test results, the void content of reinforced samples is measured and fracture surface of the specimens is investigated. It is found that vinyl-terminated <b>butadiene</b> <b>acrylonitrile</b> improves the toughness with slight negligible effects on other characteristics. Incorporation of 15 phr of vinyl-terminated <b>butadiene</b> <b>acrylonitrile</b> increases the KIC of epoxy from 0. 6 MPa to 2. 3 MPam 0. 5. Similarly, addition of 15 phr vinyl-terminated <b>butadiene</b> <b>acrylonitrile</b> leads to 67 % enhancement in the interlaminar fracture toughness of composites.

As some examples this polymer is applied in fabrication of prostheses, dental applications, scaffolds, manufacturing glass reinforced pipelines (GRP) etc [...] Herein, the toughness improvement of an epoxy resin was investigated systematically. For this purpose, we have utilized “Vinyl-terminated <b>butadiene</b> <b>acrylonitrile</b> (VTBN) ” should be modified to “Vinyl butadiene (VB) ” reactive oligomer that {{is known as a}} toughening agent for epoxy-based thermoset polymers. In order to evaluate the fracture resistance of the final composition, we have used several mechanical tests i. e. Fracture toughness test, Impact resistance test and unidirectional compression test. Moreover, in order to interpret the mechanical test data, damaged surfaces of fractured samples were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. It is found that VB improves fracture toughness of the epoxy resin more than twice. However this improvement fails by adding more than 25 % VB. Moreover the impact strength of epoxy has been substantially improved. This is attributed to the high cavitations of VB particles. However, these improvements are accompanied with a slight reduction in compressive characteristics of modified samples. This is the result of low modulus of VB.
