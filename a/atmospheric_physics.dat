2500|$|Meteorology is {{a branch}} of the {{atmospheric}} sciences which includes atmospheric chemistry and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>physics,</b> with a major focus on weather forecasting. [...] The study of meteorology dates back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century. The 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions. Prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data. It wasn't until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and, more particularly, the development of the computer, allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather, {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved.|$|E

[...] From his knowledge of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>physics,</b> Ney realized that, during its cold winters, the air above Minnesota was as free of water as that above a high mountain. [...] Armed with this insight, he approached Nancy Boggess, who had just taken responsibility for NASA's infrared astronomy programs, and who quickly authorized funding for a Minnesota observatory. [...] Ney persuaded Thomond [...] "Tomy" [...] O'Brien to donate a site on the hills above Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota, which is about 22 miles northeast of Minneapolis.
