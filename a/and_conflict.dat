5|$|Soon after Urban VI {{had been}} elected pope in 1378, Robert of Geneva was elected as a rival pope, taking the name Pope Clement VII and {{removing}} himself to Avignon. The so-called Western Schism subsequently caused a great crisis in the Church and created rivalry <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> throughout Christian Europe. It was eventually resolved {{as a result of}} the Council of Constance (1414–1418).|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that being in a romantic {{relationship}} has related negatively with work-family conflict. Using social exchange theory, the investment model, and role theory, {{this study examined the}} relationships among the dimensions of perceived partner support, romantic relationship interdependence, <b>and</b> work-family <b>conflict.</b> A sample of 192 adults in paid employment, currently involved in a romantic relationship, were recruited from SurveyMonkey Contribute. Study participants completed online a demographic survey, the revised Support in Intimate Relationships Rating Scale (SIRRS), the Investment Model Scale, <b>and</b> work-family <b>conflict</b> scales. Correlation analyses showed that work-to-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> family-to-work <b>conflict</b> correlated negatively with commitment and positively with quality of alternatives as hypothesized. As hypothesized, regression analyses showed that quality of alternatives and informational support explained unique variance in work-to-family <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> family-to-work <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> that commitment explained unique variance in family-to-work conflict. PROCESS mediation analyses showed partial support for the hypothesis of mediation. Quality of alternatives and commitment mediated the relationships between esteem/emotional support <b>and</b> family-to-work <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> instrumental/tangible support <b>and</b> family-to-work <b>conflict.</b> Quality of alternatives mediated the relationships between informational support <b>and</b> work-to-family <b>conflict,</b> informational support <b>and</b> family-to-work <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> instrumental/tangible support <b>and</b> work-to-family <b>conflict.</b> The findings contribute to positive social change by offering added knowledge about the occurrence of work-family issues in the lives of employees representing {{a large percentage of the}} workforce...|$|R

5|$|Themes {{of class}} {{consciousness}} <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> are {{also present in}} the book. Critics interpreted the stance the novel took against French class-based discrimination and hypocrisy as quite radical, although some French critics found that this made the novel an unsubtle satire of fading social stereotypes. There are also literary allusions in the novel, referencing comic books, movies, music, and paintings.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the book, the third-person {{narration}} switches from {{following the}} human characters to following the fairy characters to present underlying themes of greed <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> The book received a mostly favourable critical response and several awards.

5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989.

The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation.

Some customers have direct access to their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|Among Sophocles' {{earliest}} innovations was {{the addition}} of a third actor, which further reduced the role of the chorus and created greater opportunity for character development <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> between characters. Aeschylus, who dominated Athenian playwriting during Sophocles' early career, followed suit and adopted the third character into his own work towards the end of his life. Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of skenographia, or scenery-painting. It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the pre-eminent playwright in Athens.|$|E

5|$|As autumn approaches, Teran takes {{advantage}} of Sea Mither's exhaustion to break free, <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> between the two starts again. The power struggles cause the weather to change with darkening skies and howling winds. This time, Teran triumphs in the conflict termed the Gore vellye. Control {{of the ocean and}} weather is returned to Teran and Sea Mither is forced to leave. No details are given as to where she spends the winter, but during the storms caused by Teran the fishermen were consoled that Sea Mither would return refreshed and powerful in the spring, to again oust Teran from his malevolent grip over the seas.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} climate in New South Wales became more volatile after Lang's attempts to abolish the Legislative Council <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the Nationalist Party) amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new party Leader.|$|E
5|$|Following {{years of}} {{disruption}} <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> stability was {{restored to the}} opera house and its two companies after the appointment in May 2001 of a new chief executive, Tony Hall, formerly a senior executive at the BBC. The following year Antonio Pappano succeeded Haitink as music director of The Royal Opera. Following the redevelopment, a second, smaller auditorium, the Linbury Studio Theatre has been made available for small-scale productions by The Royal Opera and The Royal Ballet, for visiting companies, and for work produced in the ROH2 programme, which supports new work and developing artists. The Royal Opera encourages young singers {{at the start of}} their careers with the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme; participants are salaried members of the company and receive daily coaching in all aspects of opera.|$|E

5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was a {{participant}} in the November 1960 Congo Crisis, a period of political upheaval <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> in Congo-Kinshasa. The Ivorian leader supported President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, an opponent of Lumumba, and followed France in supporting the controversial Congolese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe. Tshombe, disliked by much of Africa, was passionately defended by Houphouët-Boigny and was even invited into OCAM in May 1965. After the overthrow of Kasa-Vubu by General Mobutu in November 1965, the Ivorian president supported, in 1967, a plan proposed by the French secret service which aimed to bring the deposed Congolese leader back into power. The operation was a failure. In response, Houphouët-Boigny decided to boycott the fourth annual summit of the OAU held in September 1967 in Kinshasa.|$|E
5|$|Kotarou becomes {{disillusioned with}} Guardian's tactics {{and returns to}} Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again. She tells him she must {{initiate}} re-evolution, but since this {{would lead to a}} dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to bad memories caused by war <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> Kotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side. Kazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to stop this from occurring. As a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude for showing her satisfactory memories. Kotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.|$|E
5|$|Lenin {{expected}} Russia's aristocracy and bourgeoisie {{to oppose}} his government, but {{he believed that}} the numerical superiority of the lower classes, coupled with the Bolsheviks' ability to effectively organise them, guaranteed a swift victory in any conflict. In this, he failed to anticipate the intensity of the violent opposition to Bolshevik rule in Russia. The ensuing Russian Civil War pitted the pro-Bolshevik Reds against the anti-Bolshevik Whites, but also encompassed ethnic conflicts on Russia's borders <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> between both Red and White armies and local peasant groups, the Green armies, throughout the former Empire. Accordingly, various historians have seen the civil war as representing two distinct conflicts: one between the revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.|$|E
