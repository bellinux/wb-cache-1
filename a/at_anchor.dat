5|$|The Ascension Island guns saw action only once, on 9 December 1941, {{when they}} fired on the German U-boat , as it {{approached}} Georgetown {{on the surface}} to shell the cable station or sink any ships <b>at</b> <b>anchor.</b> No hits were scored, but the submarine crash-dived.|$|E
5|$|As Caroline neared Batavia, Phoenix {{entered the}} well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, lying <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> in Batavia Roads, {{accompanied}} {{only by the}} 14-gun corvette William, the elusive brig Zee-Ploeg, and the 18-gun ship Patriot {{that belonged to the}} Dutch East India Company. Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36-gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than Caroline, and could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations for battle, Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables, giving his ship the ability to easily turn <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen.|$|E

5|$|In early October, UB-42 had {{returned}} to the Black Sea, when she was ordered to deliver five Georgians with gold to finance a Georgian independence movement. While remaining in the Black Sea, UB-42 sank the sailing ships Agios Georgios on 10 October, and Francesco Patrino in November. On 22 November, she torpedoed the 1,086-ton Siracusy while the latter was <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> off the Georgian coast. UB-46 also shelled Tuapse while in the northern Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that the}} plains Indians {{would have no}} {{experience}} on water, the townspeople fled prudently from the Comanche raiders {{to the safety of}} the water. They were saved by remaining aboard small boats and a schooner captained by William G. Marshall, which was <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> in the bay. While safe in the water, the refugees witnessed the destruction and looting of their town, unable to do a thing except curse them.|$|E
5|$|The French had {{embarked}} on a complex land and naval campaign in the Mediterranean, with the ultimate aim of launching an invasion and occupation of Egypt. The British were aware that the French had amassed a large army, led by General Napoleon Bonaparte, but their destination was unknown. Rendezvousing with Troubridge's squadron on 7 June, Nelson now had a sufficient force to engage the French, and began to comb the Mediterranean. The search lasted nearly two months, with the British force tracking westwards, and then back east, sometimes missing the French force by days. The French force, after invading and capturing Malta, arrived off Alexandria on 1 July and began landing troops. It was not until 25 July that news reached Nelson, by then <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> off Sicily, that the French fleet had appeared off Egypt. He took his fleet to sea, and arrived off Alexandria on 1 August, but found the harbour empty. Heading east, he discovered the French fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, four frigates {{and a number of}} gunboats, <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> in Abu Qir Bay.|$|E

5|$|After riding <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved out of {{the water}} on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} August, Watrin {{learned that}} Phoenix was alone off the port and {{sent a message to}} Leghorn, where the {{remainder}} of the French squadron still lay <b>at</b> <b>anchor,</b> instructing them to attack the isolated British warship. Succès and Bravoure sailed on 31 August and arrived off Piombino at 06:30 on 2 September to discover that the frigates Pomone and , under Captain George Cockburn, had joined Phoenix. Halsted had received an intelligence report detailing Watrin's demand that the French ships sail from Leghorn and had summoned reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E

5|$|Discovered <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> off Pointe-Noire on 22 January by the British brig HMS Hazard, Topaze was {{isolated}} and attacked by two British frigates, led by Captain Samuel Pechell in HMS Cleopatra. In the ensuing engagement, the British ships outnumbered and overwhelmed their opponent, capturing {{the ship and}} her cargo, despite heavy fire from a French gun battery that overlooked the anchorage. The British ships were drawn from a force gathered for the impending invasion of Martinique, which was launched six days after Topaze had been captured and successfully completed in a campaign lasting just over three weeks.|$|E
5|$|French Admiral Pierre André de Suffren with a {{fleet of}} fifteen ships sailed from Trincomalee to support the besieged city on 10June. Arriving on 13June, the French found the British {{reluctant}} to fight, moving away and anchoring some five miles off. As {{the success of the}} siege would probably be decided by naval action, 1200 troops were embarked onto Suffren's ships to increase his gunnery complement. Having been frustrated by contrary winds, the French fleet was able to close with the British ships on 17June. Hughes, not wishing to be caught <b>at</b> <b>anchor,</b> weighed, and the two fleets began manoeuvring for advantage.|$|E
5|$|In 1809 the Royal Navy was {{dominant}} in the Atlantic, the French Atlantic fleet trapped by close blockade in the French Biscay ports by the British Channel Fleet. The largest French base was at Brest in Brittany, where {{the main body of}} the French fleet lay <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> under the command of Contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, with smaller French detachments stationed at Lorient and Rochefort. The squadron at Lorient comprised three ships of the line and five frigates under Commodore Amable Troude, watched by its own blockade squadron of four ships of the line under Captain John Poo Beresford.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, the Norwegian Troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied), No. 12, and No. 14 (Arctic) Commandos {{assisted}} the Royal Navy {{in carrying out}} anti–shipping raids in Norwegian coastal waters. The Commandos provided extra firepower for the navy Motor Torpedo Boats when they were at sea and acted as a guard force when they were <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> in the Norwegian fjords. In April 1943, seven men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando {{took part in a}} raid on German shipping near Haugesund code named Operation Checkmate. They managed to sink several ships using limpet mines, but were captured and eventually taken to Sachsenhausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where they were executed.|$|E

Over {{the next few days}} thousands of sailors and marines participated in relief activities. Kinkaid convinced the captain to allow homeless families of crew members to stay on the ship, and erected tarpaulins on the quayside to create family areas. He sent medical and relief supplies ashore from Colorado.|$|E

She arrived on 29September at New York. On her sixth eastward crossing, between 6 and 15October, an influenza epidemic broke out among the troops, killing a number of soldiers.

5|$|The German naval {{contingent}} (numbering four, {{compared to}} the United Kingdom's eight) followed the British lead in operational terms. On 11 December 1902, the Gazelle boarded the old gunboat Restaurador in the port of Guanta. The gunboat was towed <b>at</b> <b>anchor</b> and put into service by the German Captain-Lieutenant Titus Türk with crew members of the Gazelle as SMS Restaurador.

While a Japanese naval operation aimed at capturing Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May, elsewhere American forces in the Philippines capitulated, and Japanese forces advanced towards India through Burma.|$|E
