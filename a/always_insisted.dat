5|$|During her premiership Thatcher had the second-lowest average {{approval}} rating (40%) of any post-war Prime Minister. Since {{the resignation of}} Nigel Lawson as Chancellor in 1989, polls consistently showed that she was less popular than her party. A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> {{that she did not}} care about her poll ratings and pointed instead to her unbeaten election record.|$|E
5|$|Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. Mary Surratt was {{the first}} woman {{executed}} by the United States government. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. Spangler, who died in 1875, <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to hold his horse.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Aphrodite Jones, Patrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, stated {{that he would have}} known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any drugs in the house. He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.|$|E

5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> {{to him that he}} was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Servetus, Calvin was {{acclaimed}} a defender of Christianity, but his ultimate triumph over the libertines was still two years away. He had <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> that the Consistory retain the power of excommunication, despite the council's past decision to take it away. During Servetus's trial, Philibert Berthelier asked the council for permission to take communion, {{as he had been}} excommunicated the previous year for insulting a minister. Calvin protested that the council did not have the legal authority to overturn Berthelier's excommunication. Unsure of how the council would rule, he hinted in a sermon on 3 September 1553 that he might be dismissed by the authorities. The council decided to re-examine the Ordonnances and on 18 September it voted in support of Calvin—excommunication was within the jurisdiction of the Consistory. Berthelier applied for reinstatement to another Genevan administrative assembly, the Deux Cents (Two Hundred), in November. This body reversed the council's decision and stated that the final arbiter concerning excommunication should be the council. The ministers continued to protest, and {{as in the case of}} Servetus, the opinions of the Swiss churches were sought. The affair dragged on through 1554. Finally, on 22 January 1555, the council announced the decision of the Swiss churches: the original Ordonnances were to be kept and the Consistory was to regain its official powers.|$|E

25|$|The {{aim of the}} {{campaign}} was {{for the government to}} allow controlled access to the sex offender registry, so parents with young children could know if a child sex-offender was living in their area.

25|$|South Africa won both ‘Test’ series 1-0, both ‘ODI’ {{series and}} a ‘day-night’ series. Yet the on-field action could never escape {{the shadow of}} apartheid. Newspaper revelations in January 1986 {{revealed}} what non-white leaders in South Africa and anti-apartheid campaigners worldwide had been claiming for years: the tours were not funded by business, as Ali Bacher and SACU had <b>always</b> <b>insisted,</b> but by the apartheid government through enormous tax breaks.|$|E
25|$|His Art Nouveau {{style was}} often imitated. The Art Nouveau style, however, {{was one that}} Mucha {{attempted}} to disassociate himself from throughout his life; he <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> that rather than maintaining any fashionable stylistic form, his paintings were entirely a product of himself and Czech art. He declared that art existed only to communicate a spiritual message, and nothing more; hence his frustration at the fame he gained by his commercial art, when he most wanted to concentrate on more artistic projects.|$|E

25|$|An early fictional {{reference}} to ball lightning {{appears in a}} children's book set in the 19th century by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The books are considered historical fiction, but the author <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> they were descriptive of actual events in her life. In Wilder's description, three separate balls of lightning appear during a winter blizzard near a cast iron stove in the family's kitchen. They are described as appearing near the stovepipe, then rolling across the floor, only to disappear as the mother (Caroline Ingalls) chases them with a willow-branch broom.|$|E
25|$|In shaping legislation, Rayburn {{preferred}} working {{quietly in}} the background to being in the public spotlight. As Speaker, he won a reputation for fairness and integrity. In his years in Congress, Rayburn <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> on paying his own expenses, even {{going so far as}} to pay for his own travel expenses when inspecting the Panama Canal when his committee was considering legislation concerning it, rather than exercising his right to have the government pay for it. After he died his estate was valued at just under $300,000, which was mostly land he owned, and the amount of cash he had in various checking accounts was just over $26,000.|$|E
25|$|Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College has {{its share}} of ghostly and urban legends. The most famous is the Faceless Nun. It is said that one of the Sisters had a talent for {{painting}} portraits. Her method of painting was to always paint every detail of the portrait, taking her time for days and weeks, and saving the face for last. She <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> that the face was the most important part and required the most attention. She would spend countless hours working on every detail of the face of her subject. Once she started on the portrait's face, she would devote her entire time to it until perfection was reached.|$|E

25|$|With Cyril Connolly and Peter Watson Spender co-founded Horizon {{magazine}} {{and served as}} its editor from 1939 to 1941. From 1947 till 1949 {{he went to the}} USA several times and saw his friends Auden and Isherwood. He was editor of Encounter magazine from 1953 to 1966, but resigned after it emerged that the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which published the magazine, was being covertly funded by the CIA. Spender <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> that he was unaware of the ultimate source of Encounters funds. Spender taught at various American institutions, accepting the Elliston Chair of Poetry at the University of Cincinnati in 1954. In 1961 he became professor of rhetoric at Gresham College, London.|$|E
25|$|The offence {{for which}} Mardian was convicted, but later cleared, {{occurred}} on June 17, 1972. Mardian was with other campaign officials in California {{preparing for a}} fundraising dinner. Having learnt of the arrest of the five men in the Watergate complex, Jeb Stuart Magruder testified that at John N. Mitchell's suggestion Mardian telephoned G. Gordon Liddy and told Liddy to contact Attorney General Kleindienst, with an order that James W. McCord, Jr. should be released before his identity was discovered. Liddy insisted that the call had come from Magruder. Mardian <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> on his innocence and since the trial has said that John Dean had the idea of calling Kleindienst. Mardian stated {{that he could have}} played no role in getting the burglars released, given his location and the difference in time zones.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} {{weeks of the}} war, Japan conquered the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. The Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway. American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly {{progress}} called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands, {{with the objective of}} gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded. In contrast to Hitler, Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations, though he approved strategic decisions. Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan; he <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> on Germany first. The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific.|$|E

500|$|Though he <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> on the {{importance}} of time and [...] "swing", Manne's concept of his own drumming style typically pointed to his melody-based approach.

500|$|Teller <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> {{that his}} {{testimony}} had not significantly harmed Oppenheimer. In 2002, Teller contended that Oppenheimer was [...] "not destroyed" [...] {{by the security}} hearing but [...] "no longer asked to assist in policy matters." [...] He claimed his words were an overreaction, because he had only just learned of Oppenheimer's failure to immediately report an approach by Haakon Chevalier, who had approached Oppenheimer to help the Russians. Teller said that, in hindsight, he would have responded differently.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Journalist Joshua Prager {{published}} {{that the}} Giants secretly learned opponents' finger signals, when several players told the Wall Street Journal that beginning on July 20, 1951, the team used a telescope and buzzer wire {{to steal the}} finger signals of opposing catchers careless enough to leave their signs unprotected. Giants catcher Sal Yvars told Prager that he relayed to Thomson the stolen sign for Branca's fastball. Thomson <b>always</b> <b>insisted</b> {{that he had no}} foreknowledge of Branca's pitch. Branca had been aware of the rumors and was skeptical of Thomson's denial, but later told The New York Times in 2001, [...] "I didn't want to diminish a legendary moment in baseball. And even if Bobby knew what was coming, he had to hit it.... Knowing the pitch doesn't always help." ...|$|E
