5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 21 dorsal scales rows (rarely 19, 20, 22, or 23). These are {{strongly}} keeled scales, {{except for those}} bordering the ventral scales. These scales seem loosely attached to the skin and lower rows become increasingly wide; those closest to the ventral scales <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> wide as the ones along the midline. The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E

5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid is a small, soft-bodied insect that has {{specialised}} {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts which are used to suck the juice from plants. This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E

25|$|Gender: Women <b>are</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> {{susceptible}} to alcohol-related liver disease, and may develop alcoholic liver disease with shorter durations and doses of chronic consumption.

"Now," [...] {{continued}} his father, [...] "if {{a strong man}} had a cylinder like this, with a piston fitted to it, and a strong handle {{across the top of}} the piston rod, perhaps he might press the air into one half the space which it occupied before. That is, if the cylinder was full of air when he put the piston in, perhaps he could get the piston down half way to the bottom. Then the air would <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> dense as it was before; that is, there would <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> much of it in the same space as there was before. It would <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> compact and heavy. This is called condensing air. The philosophers have ingenious instruments for condensing air.|$|R

Peer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling into the whole new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life.
