5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> retainer became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it was}} paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> retainers in Illinois.|$|E

Disney refused, and as Universal owned the rights to Oswald rather than Disney, Mintz set up his own animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons. Most of Disney's staff was hired away by Mintz to move over, once Disney's Oswald contract was done in mid-1928.|$|E

With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians {{became convinced that}} {{it would be impossible to}} take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E

Hackett attempts to persuade his book publisher that he has almost finished writing his latest novel, while in actuality he has already depleted his <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> prior to coming {{up with an idea}} for a story. Hackett's publisher pressures him and he rapidly decides to place his friend Mike as the central character in his story.|$|E
5|$|David told Scott-James {{that she}} planned to publish the {{articles}} as a book, and was allowed to retain the copyright by the magazine. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called A Book of Mediterranean Food; many of the recipes ignored the restrictions of rationing in favour of authenticity, and several cases the ingredients were not available in British shops. David submitted her manuscript {{to a series of}} publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took this advice, but conscious of her inexperience as a writer she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery; he accepted it and agreed to an <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> of £100. A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in June 1950.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- While {{obligatory}} <b>advance</b> tax <b>payments</b> do {{not interfere}} with the taxpayer’s evasion decision under expected utility theory, they do affect the decision to evade under prospect theory. The present paper applies prospect theory to a simple model of tax evasion, exploring the role that <b>advance</b> tax <b>payments</b> may play in enforcing tax laws. The paper demonstrates, as empirically found in the United States, that <b>advance</b> tax <b>payments</b> may substitute for costly detection efforts in enhancing compliance. However, contrary to a recent claim in the tax evasion literature, deliberate high <b>advance</b> tax <b>payments</b> are unlikely to eliminate the incentives for noncompliance...|$|R

But if a person with a contract for 600 lessons canceled after taking only 100 classes, Nova would apply the fee of 2,300 yen per lesson, and the student would receive a refund of 490,000 yen. Such students say the contract for 1,200 yen per lesson should have applied in these cases, which would result in a refund of 600,000 yen.|$|E

25|$|Having {{agreed on}} {{the scope of the}} {{publication}} and the formats, the parties in a book agreement must then agree on royalty rates, the percentage of the gross retail price that will be paid to the author, and the <b>advance</b> <b>payment.</b> The publisher must estimate the potential sales in each market and balance projected revenue against production costs. Royalties usually range between 10–12% of recommended retail price. An advance is usually 1/3 of the first print run total royalties. For example, if a book has a print run of 5000 copies and will be sold at $14.95 and the author is to receive 10% royalties, the total sum payable to the author if all copies are sold is $7475 (10% x $14.95 x 5000). The advance in this instance would roughly be $2490. Advances vary greatly between books, with established authors commanding larger advances.|$|E
