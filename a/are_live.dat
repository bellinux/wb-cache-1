30|$|A PN {{is said to}} <b>be</b> <b>live</b> if {{and only}} if, from any node in its {{reachability}} graph, {{it is possible to}} find a directed path having this node as origin. In other words, the PN <b>is</b> <b>live</b> when each node of its directed graph is the origin of at least one arc. If we consider the coverability graph of Figure 7, we notice that each node contains at least one arc as origin; thus, this coverability graph <b>is</b> <b>live.</b> Likewise, for the proposed PN model of Figure 6, we can clearly see that each transition contains at least one arc to reach its next state until the spectrum sharing process arrives to its end. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed PN <b>is</b> <b>live.</b>|$|R

25|$|C/F International's {{rights to}} later Tom Jones {{material}} were also disputed.

It was contended that any rights that C/F International had to license the Tom Jones show {{did not include the}} right to make and license separate recordings of the performances on the show, and that any rights that C/F International had in the Tom Jones show no longer existed because of numerous breaches of contract. Examples of contentious CDs <b>are</b> <b>Live</b> on the Tom Jones Show, released in 2006, and Greatest Hits Live, originally issued by C/F International in 1981 and later licensed to and issued by Prism Leisure Corporation as 30 Greatest Hits – Live in Concert.|$|E

25|$|In Worcester {{skittles}} all pins <b>are</b> <b>live</b> {{until they}} {{land in the}} pit behind the diamond, or leave the alley on an open side. They can rebound off a side wall back into the diamond taking down other pin(s). In some alleys, such as the Saracens Head in Worcester, the Diamond is flanked by two side walls making {{the possibility of a}} spare, achieved by bouncing pins off the wall more of a possibility. It is more than common to hear the cries of 'let it roll' go out in the alleys of the city to stop an over enthusiastic 'sticker up' (a young lad or girl employed to put the pins back up after they have been knocked down) removing a pin from the alley before it has finished knocking down the others. However, if a ball hits the cush, or wall or passes through the diamond and bounces back out of the pit before felling pins the frame must be reset.|$|E

25|$|The {{levels of}} the game are {{accessed}} through a world map, in which players can explore to find hidden secrets or access bonus areas to earn more items or coins.

They are used to race against and sometimes hold gift prizes such as coins or extra lives. Additional Green Stars can be earned in Captain Toad levels, where players control Captain Toad, who cannot jump, as he navigates puzzle-like stages using the GamePad's functionality, and Mystery Houses, where players must clear a series of challenges with short time limits, as well as challenge levels, that have the player complete quick challenges in fast succession.|$|E
