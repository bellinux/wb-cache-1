40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{identify}} the differential expression of candidate gluconeogenic genes which may initiate hepatitis C virus (HCV) related metabolic disorder during {{early stages of}} disease. MethodsPatients of diverse age and sex, with positive HCV genotype 3 (HCV- 3) RNA in serum and with no history of other related infections, co-infections, alcoholism, diabetes or chemotherapeutic treatments were considered for this study. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis and quantitative fold change analysis of the fresh liver biopsies of eight chronically infected HCV- 3 patients and six healthy individuals were evaluated for three potential biomarkers involved in glucose homeostasis induction, namely mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK 2), glucose- 6 -phosphatase catalytic subunit (G 6 PC) and associated forkhead box protein 01 (FOXO 1). ResultsSymptomatic evaluation, clinical history and blood test were conducted <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>general</b> disease prognosis <b>procedures</b> and reported here. Significantly upregulated expression of PCK 2 independent of age, sex and viral infectivity levels in all HCV patients was observed, whereas no {{significant changes in the}} expression of G 6 PC and FOXO 1 were found. ConclusionsPCK 2 triggers initial gluconeogenic reactions which ultimately result in the accumulation of glycogen in the liver hepatocytes. We therefore suggest that the overproduction of PCK 2 has important physiological role in the onset of metabolic disorder in the HCV- 3 patients...|$|R

Treatment of a solution of 198 with isobutyric anhydride in the presence of sodium acetate and sodium sulfite afforded 5, 7 -diisobutyramido- 8 -isobutyroxy- 2 -methylquinoline (212). Partial hydrolysis of 212 in boiling methanol-water mixture gave 5, 7 -diisobutyramido- 8 -hydroxy- 2 methylquinoline (211). Oxidation of 211 by a solution of potassium dichromate in acetic acid-water mixture afforded product 200. 7 -amino- 2 -methylquinoline- 5, 8 -dione (210) was prepared from alcoholysis of 7 -acylamino- 2 -methylquinoline- 5, 8 -diones 6, 199,and 200 with methanol and sulfuric acid. 7 -Alkoxy- 2 -methylquinoline- 5, 8 -diones 214, 215, and 216 were prepared from reaction of 7 -acetamido compound 6 with alcohols in the presence of sulfuric acid. Reaction of 7 -acylamino compounds 6, 199, and 200 with methanol in the presence of hydrogen chloride gas at 60 Â°C afforded 7 -amino- 6 -chloro- 2 -methylquinoline- 5, 8 -dione (213). Reaction of compound 210 with diethylaluminum cyanide gave 7 -amino- 5 -ethyl- 5 hydroxy- 2 -methylquinoline- 8 -one (218). The same reaction was carried out on compound 6 to give 7 -acetamido- 5 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxy- 2 -methylquinoline- 8 -one (220). 1 -[(tert-Butyldimethylsilyl) oxy]- 2 -methyl-l-aza- 1, 3 -butadiene (4) was prepared from treatment of methyl vinyl ketone (210) and t-butylmethylsilylhydroxylamine (202) in dichloromethane in the presence of molecular sieves. Cycloaddition reaction of a solution of 4 in dichloromethane with 2, 6 -dichloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (221) in sealed tube afforded 7 -chloro- 2 -methylquinoline- 5, 8 -dione (222).
