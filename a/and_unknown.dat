5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious <b>and</b> <b>unknown.</b>|$|E
5|$|Being very small, <b>and</b> <b>unknown</b> {{until the}} {{invention}} of the microscope, microbes do not feature directly in art or literature before Early Modern times (though they appear indirectly in works about brewing and baking), when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed microbes in water in 1676; his results were soon confirmed by Robert Hooke.

5|$|On September 9, 2012, {{some players}} found on-disc data for six hidden {{characters}} (Dr. Bosconovitch, Miharu Hirano, Sebastian, Slim Bob, Violet <b>and</b> <b>Unknown)</b> {{and a few}} hidden stages. Namco announced them on September 12, 2012, stating that starting on October 9, 2012, these six characters, in addition to four new stages (Extravagant Underground, Moai Excavation, Modern Oasis and Odeum of Illusions) to be available for download. The content was announced to be staggered across several free updates, rather than in one major update. The characters Miharu Hirano, Sebastian and Slim Bob, {{as well as all}} four new stages, Online World Arena mode and decals for customization, were released on October 9, 2012 as a free update. Dr. Bosconovitch, Violet <b>and</b> <b>Unknown,</b> as well as the four pre-order characters, were released on November 13. In addition to the extra DLC characters, a patch was released which drastically altered the difficulty of Arcade mode.|$|E

5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, <b>and</b> <b>unknown</b> environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect <b>and</b> <b>unknown</b> transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen <b>and</b> <b>unknown</b> caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the many}} {{different}} <b>and</b> <b>unknown</b> radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best radiochemists {{in the world at}} the time and supporters of Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series. This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the group 7 elements, including manganese and rhenium. Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much weaker, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the f-block, the actinide series was firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Threats to Bridgeoporus nobilissimus include {{extirpation}} {{of known}} <b>and</b> <b>unknown</b> habitats by logging, fire, or other disturbances, and forestry practices {{that lead to}} the loss of large-diameter Abies procera and Abies amabilis trees and large-diameter stumps and snags in managed forests. Due to the scarcity of its mature tree hosts, B.nobilissimus was listed in 1995 as an endangered species by the Oregon Natural Heritage Program, making it the first of the fungi to be listed as endangered by any private or public agency in the United States. It is the sole fungus in category A of the survey and management guidelines for fungi under the Northwest Forest Plan, meaning pre-disturbance surveys and site management are needed before developing areas known to harbor the fungus. There were 13 known sites with the fungus before 1998; extensive surveying in the Pacific Northwest increased this number to 103 sites by 2006. Although it is infrequently observed, the fungus is more abundant than fruit body appearance indicates. Using genetic markers to detect the fungus mycelium in hosts, researchers found that B.nobilissimus was present at low to moderate levels and widespread in forest stands containing at least a single visible fruit body. It was detected in trees of all sizes, and in species not previously thought to harbor the fungus. B.nobilissimus may require decades of mycelial growth in its host before fruit body production is initiated. The fungus has not been successively grown in vitro despite several attempts.|$|E
