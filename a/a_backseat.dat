5|$|Agriculture, {{which was}} once a major {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} Dakshina Kannada, has taken <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> because of the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields are being converted into residential plots and commercial (shopping) complexes. Horticulture, though, has made some strides, and measures have been taken to improve the fruit plantation sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, Cashew and Cocoa. Rubber, Banana and Vanilla crops are also cultivated in the Sullia taluk. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, Karthika or Yenel (May–October), Suggi (October to January) and Kolake (January to April). Urad (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a milk processing plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore. This plant processes milk procured from the cattle owned by farmers of the district.|$|E

25|$|Fired: Hayley - For {{continuing}} to take <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> on the tasks despite Lord Sugar warning her two weeks previously, and for raising concerns {{she was too}} quiet and polite.|$|E
25|$|Fired: Tuan - For not {{managing}} to let out any properties, taking <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> as project manager despite being warned {{in the previous}} boardroom, and for lacking the passion and drive that both Syed and Ruth had demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|As Tim took <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> on all tasks, Lord Sugar {{initially}} {{intended to}} fire him for this, but {{changed his mind and}} instead appointed him to be the PM on the next task, after Tim promised to take on the role regardless of what that task would be.|$|E
5000|$|Molteno was an {{exceptionally}} skilled debater and public speaker. In parliament however, he quickly {{gained a reputation}} as a jovial tease, with an uncanny ability to both foment and soothe disagreements in the house - while all the time taking <b>an</b> amused <b>backseat.</b> His friends and colleagues in parliament gave him the nickname [...] "Baby Molteno", as he was the youngest of his extended family to be politically active at the time.|$|R
2500|$|One of the teams, in particular, subtly {{honors the}} accomplishments of the less-heralded William Clark.

However, in 2001, president Bill Clinton promoted Clark to the military rank of Captain of the Regular Army; posthumously placing Clark on equal standing as Lewis. [...] Recognizing this important gesture, the LCBL has a team called the Captains, fittingly in the Clark Conference.|$|R
50|$|As CSEs {{were now}} extinct, the old CSE boards {{effectively}} {{ceased to exist}} outside their GCSE examining groups. The NEA took this opportunity to rationalise and the JMB merged with the four other NEA members to form the Northern Examinations and Assessment Board (NEAB) in 1992. It {{was at this point}} that the universities behind the JMB took <b>a</b> more <b>backseat</b> role, with the NEAB becoming a charity and the universities remaining only as board members.|$|R
25|$|Cabernet d'Anjou AOC The first rosé wine {{to be made}} {{entirely from}} Cabernet grapes was in 1905 {{but for most of}} the 20th century, this style of rosé took <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> to the {{popularity}} of Rosé d'Anjou made predominantly from Grolleau. Made entirely from Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon, these rosés tend to be drier than Rosé d'Anjou with higher alcohol and potentially more character.|$|E
25|$|Helene came {{perilously close}} to being fired due to her failure to make any sales, along with suspicions by Sir Alan and his {{advisers}} (particularly Margaret) that she had consciously decided to take <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> due to her having the least sales experience of the three members of Renaissance, but was saved {{by the fact that}} Sir Alan felt she {{had been one of the}} strongest candidates prior to her three-week losing run, and decided to give her a chance in the interviews. The You're Fired panel, while agreeing with Michael's dismissal, felt that firing Helene would have also been justifiable.|$|E
25|$|The Revolt of the Three Feudatories {{broke out}} in 1673 when Wu Sangui's forces overran most of {{southwest}} China {{and he tried to}} ally himself with local generals such as Wang Fuchen. The Kangxi Emperor employed generals including Zhou Peigong and Tuhai to suppress the rebellion, and also granted clemency to common people caught up in the war. He intended to personally lead the armies to crush the rebels but his subjects advised him against it. The Kangxi Emperor used mainly Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers to crush the rebels while the Manchu Banners took <b>a</b> <b>backseat.</b> The revolt ended with victory for Qing forces in 1681.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1967 model year, American Motors {{produced}} {{a total of}} 1,686 Rambler Rebel convertibles; all in the top-trim SST model. Automatic power operation of top was standard. The new convertible top design featured a [...] "streamlined" [...] look blending smoothly with the lower body with the top up.

25|$|The 1971 Mujib regime {{pursued a}} pro-socialist agenda. In 1972, the {{government}} decided to nationalise all banks to channel {{funds to the}} public sector and to prioritise credit to those sectors that sought to reconstruct the war-torn country – mainly industry and agriculture. However, government control of the wrong sectors prevented these banks from functioning well. This was {{compounded by the fact}} that loans were handed out to the public sector without commercial considerations; banks had poor capital lease, provided poor customer service and lacked all market-based monetary instruments. Because loans were given out without commercial considerations, and because they took a long time to call a non-performing loan, and once they did, recovery under the erstwhile judicial system was so expensive, loan recovery was abysmally poor. While the government made a point of intervening everywhere, it didn't set up a proper regulatory system to diagnose such problems and correct them. Hence, banking concepts like profitability and liquidity were alien to bank managers, and capital adequacy took <b>a</b> <b>backseat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carpentier, who was 36 {{years old}} at the time, became the {{full-time}} driver for 2008, part of a unique rookie class stacked with open wheel veterans all trying to emulate the success found by Juan Pablo Montoya the previous year. This included IndyCar Series Champions Dario Franchitti and Sam Hornish, Jr., and CART and Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve, as well as DEI development drivers Regan Smith and Aric Almirola. With Valvoline taking <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> role in 2008 and Stanley Tools moving to the No. 19 car, GEM signed LifeLock for eight races, an identity security company making a large entrance investment into NASCAR. Charter Communications and Auto Value/Bumper to Bumper also sponsored several races. Carpentier won the pole at Loudon but otherwise struggled, as did his fellow open-wheel counterparts. He had no Top 10s, missed five races — including the Daytona 500 — and was out of the Top 35 in points when he was released after Kansas. Second-year driver A. J. Allmendinger replaced Carpentier, after being released from Red Bull Racing in favor of Scott Speed. In his five races for GEM, Allmendinger was impressive, posting three Top 15's and often outrunning his teammates. Allmendinger was initially rewarded with a full-time ride in the No. 19 car, replacing Elliott Sadler. This was derailed when Sadler intended to sue the team and Allmendinger to keep his job, when Reed Sorenson was signed as a third driver, and when several sponsors threatened to leave the team in response to the recent moves.|$|E
500|$|Hed PE left Jive Records, {{releasing}} {{their fourth}} studio album, Only in Amerika, on Koch Records on October 19, 2004. It peaked at No.20 on the Top Independent Albums chart and at No.186 on the Billboard 200. In {{his review of}} the album, Johnny Loftus wrote [...] "It {{wants to be a}} confrontational megaphone in the ear of conservatives, but Jahred's torrential rhetoric is too messy and blatantly offensive to incite anything but superficial anger, and the music -- though occasionally explosive -- takes <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> to the ranting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Particularly in the Sayan-Altai stones, a {{multitude}} of other animals are present in deer stone imagery. [...] One can see depictions of tigers, pigs, cows, horse-like creatures, frogs and birds. Unlike the reindeer, however, these animals are depicted in a more natural style. This lack of ornate detailing indicates the lack of supernatural importance of such animals, taking <b>an</b> obvious <b>backseat</b> against the reindeer. The animals are often paired off {{with one another in}} confrontation, e.g. a tiger confronting a horse in a much more earthly activity.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{strongly}} implied that Majid or Noorul would have likely {{have been fired}} because of their performance on the task {{if they had been}} brought back. On his appearance on Youre Fired, Rocky stated when questioned about this that Majid didnt deserve the blame despite his poor theme, but that he should have brought back Noorul for taking <b>a</b> complete <b>backseat</b> on the task. In his exit interview posted on The Apprentice website, he later changed his mind on Majid, saying that the two men did [...] "nothing all task", but hinted that they werent the only ones.|$|R
5000|$|Lesser {{known among}} Metallica's music video catalog, the [...] "Mama Said" [...] video focuses on James Hetfield {{sitting in the}} <b>backseat</b> of <b>a</b> car while playing the song on an {{acoustic}} guitar. The vehicle appears to be driving along a Southwestern highway, {{and at one point}} the other members of Metallica are seen outside looking into the window. As the song comes to an end, the view pulls back to reveal that Hetfield has been sitting in <b>a</b> stationary <b>backseat</b> inside <b>a</b> studio. He then walks over to a horse, takes its bridle, and walks off screen. Directed by Anton Corbijn.|$|R
500|$|The {{themes of}} unrequited love and selfacceptance {{are central to}} Loev, and as noted by such {{commentators}} as [...] Aseem Chhabra, Zack Ford, and Subhash K. Jha the theme of sexuality takes <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> to the aforementioned subjects. Chhabra, a New York-based film writer and director noted that the film beautifully, [...] "present an emotional journey by characters who are gay but seem to be comfortable with themselves”. Also, as expressed by Saria himself, the film {{was intended as a}} [...] "universal story about attraction". He did not want to conform to a single definition for the film or the relationship between two lead characters.|$|E
500|$|World War II further {{reduced the}} Social Credit Board's importance, as {{implementation}} of social credit took <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> {{to the war}} effort. Instead of proposing new policy, the board devoted itself to propaganda; its members spoke across the province about social credit, and it distributed vast numbers of pamphlets and leaflets (272,900 in 1939). [...] When Aberhart died in 1943, he was replaced by Ernest Manning, who was by this time considerably less open to radical social credit proposals than Aberhart had been. [...] He soon transferred many of the Social Credit Board's responsibilities to the new department of Economic Affairs, of which L. D. Byrne was the deputy minister.|$|E

Channel 4 {{publicity}} describe Zoe as [...] "the bubbly student" [...] and make note of her many bad choices in life and failed relationships. Discussing these failed relationships, Lister commented during an interview in June 2009 that she believed her character was having a break from men in order to sort out her problems: [...] "I think she's {{been in and out}} of so many relationships and her life is at a bit of a juncture; she probably needs to sort her head out, sort her career, knuckle down really and not get bogged down into a relationship because everything takes <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> when you're in one." ...|$|E
50|$|Cars are an {{important}} part of the subculture, especially V8-powered cars and other large cars from the USA. Statistically, the most common raggare car (Swe raggarbil) is the 1960s Pontiac Bonneville. They are plentiful, classic, relatively cheap, and have <b>a</b> huge <b>backseat</b> so the Raggare can pile in all of their friends. Raggare have been described as closely related to the hot rod culture, but while hotrodders in the US have to do extensive modifications to their cars to stand out, raggare can use stock US cars and still standout compared to the more sober Swedish cars. Some raggare also drive European cars from the 50's, 60's and the 70's.|$|R
2500|$|The base 550 two-door sedan {{featured}} the identical [...] "semi-fastback" [...] roofline {{as the more}} expensive pillar-less hardtops, but had slim B-pillars that gave them a more [...] "sporty"coupe appearance. The convertible featured a new [...] "split stack" [...] folding mechanism design that allowed <b>a</b> full-width <b>backseat</b> with room for three passengers. The four-door sedans continued a traditional notchback form, albeit smoothed from the previously sharp angled roofline. The Cross Country station wagons featured a standard roof rack, all vinyl upholstery, and a drop down tailgate for carrying long loads. A third, rear-facing seat was optional with a side hinged tailgate for easier access. The Rebel 770 wagon was available after mid-year production with 3M's DI-NOC simulated wood-grain body side panels trimmed in a slim stainless steel frame.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} mixes {{made of the}} song; the {{generally}} more well-known album version (4:48) and the edited single version (4:18). Differences between the two are somewhat subtle, but the single version tends {{to have more of}} a [...] "collapsed" [...] or [...] "mono" [...] sound to it and the electronic drum programs are mixed, rather dry and flattened, especially in the song's intro bars; whereas the drum tracks on the album version are accentuated by a generous amount of reverb effect and harder compression. Acoustic drums were given <b>a</b> more <b>backseat</b> role on [...] "Stand Back". There is a further 'polished' version of the track, with crisper percussion and louder foreground synth, featured on Nicks' 1991 compilation album Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks, remixed by Chris Lord-Alge and running at 4:59.|$|R
500|$|The New York {{newspaper}} industry came to {{an abrupt}} halt on Dec. 8 1962 when the local of the International Typographical Union, led by Bert Powers, walked off the job, leading to the 114-day 1962-63 New York City newspaper strike. The ITU, known as [...] "Big Six," [...] represented 3,800 printers, as well as workers at 600 printshops and 28 publications in the city but, like other newspaper unions, had taken <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> to the Newspaper Guild (which had the largest membership among the unions) in contract negotiations. This arrangement began to fray in the 1950s, as the craft unions felt the Guild was too inclined to accept publishers' offers without concern for those who did the manual work of printing. [...] Powers wanted to call a strike to challenge the Guild's leadership and thrust ITU to the fore.|$|E
500|$|The pre-eminence of the Great Southern Hotel as an {{entertainment}} destination did not last. In 1956, the Cathay Organization bought the adjacent Majestic Theatre and transformed {{it into an}} attraction that drew film stars from Hong Kong. Changing entertainment preferences, a depressed economy, and socio-political unrest {{also contributed to the}} decline of Chinese opera and dances at the hotel. The popularity of Chinese opera declined throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and by 1959, even famous wayang theatres just one block down the street, such as Heng Seng Peng and Heng Wai Sun were closed (People's Park Complex was built over that spot). [...] "Taxi dancers", so-named because these dancers-for-hire would hang around cabarets like waiting taxis, were also falling out of fashion with the introduction of rock ’n’ roll at dance clubs, a genre of music that was then becoming increasingly popular with youths. By the 1960s, these dances were the most popular form of entertainment for Singaporean youth, and the hotel's cabaret took <b>a</b> <b>backseat.</b>|$|E
500|$|Killebrew {{was first}} {{eligible}} for the Hall of Fame in 1981 and received 239 votes, or 59.6% of the vote; 75% of the vote is required for induction. While he did hit 573 home runs (5th all-time {{when he left the}} game), he amassed a relatively low hit total (2086), given the years he played, combined with a high number of strikeouts (1699), and a [...]256 batting average. In 1982, Killebrew received 59.3% of the vote, taking <b>a</b> <b>backseat</b> to Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson, who made it in their first year of eligibility. After receiving 71.9% of the vote in 1983, Killebrew said that not getting in that year was more difficult to accept than the previous two times, and asked [...] "Why do the writers feel there only has to be a certain number inducted each time?"

2500|$|Robinson {{answered}} his critics {{the following year}} with A Quiet Storm, released in 1975. The album launched three singles – the number-one R hit [...] "Baby That's Backatcha", [...] "The Agony & The Ecstasy" [...] and [...] "Quiet Storm". However, Robinson's solo career suffered from his work as Motown's vice president, and his own music took the <b>backseat.</b> <b>As</b> a result, several albums including Smokey's Family Robinson, Deep in My Soul, Love Breeze and Smokin, saw poor promotion and received bad reviews. At this point Robinson relied on other writers and producers {{to help him with}} his albums.|$|R
50|$|Hong and {{her husband}} Liu Xiaodong are often {{compared}} as having similar approaches to their work and as Liu’s work has grown more famous, Hong’s work took <b>a</b> slight <b>backseat</b> to his. However, in recent years she has begun to explore different approaches to her work, distinguishing herself {{from the work of}} her husband without abandoning her usual subject matter.  ‘Golden Horizon’ displayed works created before 2011 that displayed the application of gold foil that is connected to ancient traditional Chinese painting and religious painting. ‘Golden Sky’, 2009, features four works exhibited on the ceiling of the gallery so one must look up as if in a cathedral or a palace. This was done to maintain a certain distance from the audience to the paintings. This method was chosen to reproduce the atmosphere around traditional religious paintings as the piece works in tandem with the environment to create an overall feeling in those who view it.  Each work is a spin on a preexisting and already famous work of art; two with Western ties and two with Chinese ties.|$|R
5000|$|In Turin 1986, {{the longer}} 990 was {{presented}} [...] - [...] this version had a wheelbase which was extended by 16 cm and was available {{with either the}} naturally aspirated petrol or diesel 1 L engines. In addition to <b>a</b> more useful <b>backseat,</b> the 990 also had a more sloped windscreen for somewhat better aerodynamics. Classified as a five-seater, even two adults would still find the rear seat uncomfortable. A well balanced design, the longer wheelbase version {{can be hard to}} identify, if it wasn't for the missing pillar in the glass of the door, and the forward placement of the mirrors. The luggage space also increased somewhat, with 295 L rather than 280 L.|$|R
