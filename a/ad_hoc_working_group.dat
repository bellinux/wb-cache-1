25|$|Delegates from 183 {{countries}} met in Bonn from 1 to 12 June 2009. The {{purpose was}} to discuss key negotiating texts. These served {{as the basis for}} the international climate change agreement at Copenhagen. At the conclusion the <b>Ad</b> <b>Hoc</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) negotiating group was still far away from the emission reduction range that has been set out by science to avoid the worst ravages of climate change: a minus 25% to minus 40% reduction below 1990 levels by 2020. The AWG-KP still needs to decide on the aggregate emission reduction target for industrialised countries, along with individual targets for each country. Progress was made in gaining clarification of the issues of concern to parties and including these concerns in the updated draft of the negotiating text.|$|E

5000|$|The EMF was {{convened in}} 1976 over {{concerns}} that the insights that large-scale energy models could provide policymakers were being overshadowed by the [...] "plethora of detailed quantitative results" [...] being disseminated and discussed. As a result, the EMF sought to bring energy modelers together to provide a proper context for their work. Indeed, the EMF was [...] "formed to foster better communication between the builders and users of energy models in energy planning and policy analysis". The EMF periodically establishes <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>working</b> <b>groups</b> to conduct studies on selected energy topics. A <b>working</b> <b>group</b> then identifies relevant existing models and sets {{a series of tests}} to illuminate the basic structure and behavior of each model.

A number of key themes from the Workshop discussion are reported [...] themes which deal with the specific details of, for instance, the modeling of temperature profiles and eutrophication, and themes which are concerned with more general techniques of model development {{and the application of}} systems analysis. The concluding statements of several <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>working</b> <b>groups</b> from the Workshop are included. These statements refer primarily to water quality modeling research in the context of collaboration with and through the medium of IIASA. A selected bibliography is provided for a small number of the informal presentations of Workshop participants. Among other conclusions, the following deserve special mention: the need for a better understanding of sediment/water column interactions in both estuarine and shallow lake systems; the problem of model verification and the constraints of field data; and the requirements for comparative studies and critical appraisal of already existing models by reference to well-documented case studies...|$|R

The Workshop was held as an initial activity within IIASA's research Task on Models for Environmental Quality Control and Management.

They were also encouraged to speculate on future directions for the subject and to make recommendations for the ways in which such research could be organized in collaboration with IIASA.
