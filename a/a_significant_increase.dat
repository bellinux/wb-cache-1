40|$|Polymorphisms {{of genes}} {{encoding}} {{components of the}} vitamin D pathway including vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) have been widely investigated because of the complex role played by vitamin D in cancer tumorogenesis. In this study, we investigated the association between VDR and DBP gene polymorphisms and HBV-related HCC risk in a Chinese population. Study subjects were divided into three groups: 184 HBV patients with HCC, 296 HBV patients without HCC, and 180 healthy controls. The VDR rs 2228570, and rs 3782905 and the DBP rs 7041 polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR-RFLP and the VDR rs 11568820 polymorphism was genotyped by PCR-SSP, respectively. DNA sequencing was performed to validate the genotype results. We {{found that there were}} significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of the VDR rs 2228570 and DBP rs 7041 polymorphisms between HBV patients with HCC and healthy controls. The rs 2228570 T allele was associated with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increased</b> HBV-related HCC risk as compared with the C allele. The rs 2228570 TT and TT/TC genotypes were correlated with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increased</b> HBV-related HCC risk when compared with the wild-type CC homozygote. Similarly, the rs 7041 G allele was associated with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increased</b> HBV-related HCC risk as compared with the T allele. The rs 7041 GG and GG/TG genotypes were correlated with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increased</b> HBV-related HCC risk when compared with the wild-type TT homozygote. However, we did not observe any significant effect of VDR rs 11568820, and rs 3782905 polymorphisms on HBV-related HCC risk in this population. In haplotype analysis, we also did not find any significant differences in haplotype frequencies of the VDR gene between HBV patients with HCC and the healthy controls. We conclude that the VDR rs 2228570 and DBP rs 7041 polymorphisms may contribute to increased susceptibility to HBV-related HCC in the Chinese population. Due to the marginal significance, further large and well-designed studies in diverse ethnic populations are needed to confirm our results...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundShort and long-acting beta 2 -agonists (SABA and LABA) have {{a crucial}} role in asthma {{management}} during pregnancy, as stated in the current guidelines. ObjectiveTo systematically review the evidence on beta 2 -agonists use during pregnancy and adverse perinatal outcomes. Data sources and study selectionSix databases were searched before January 1, 2013 for beta 2 -agonists use during pregnancy and congenital malformations, small for gestational age, mean and low birth weight, gestational age and preterm delivery. Original English language articles were included with no cut-off date. Quality assessment and post-hoc power calculations were performed. ResultsTwenty-one original studies were identified. Four studies reported <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increased</b> risk of congenital malformations with SABA, while one study reported <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> decreased risk with high doses of SABA. One study reported <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increased</b> risk of congenital malformations with LABA and four studies reported <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increased</b> risk of congenital malformations with beta 2 -agonists (SABA and/or LABA). One study reported a decrease in birth weight centiles among LABA users. LimitationsAll studies reporting significant results, except two, used non-asthmatic women as reference group, making it difficult to differentiate between the effect of the disease from the one of the beta 2 -agonists. Non-significant results should be interpreted with caution due to the low statistical power of several studies. ConclusionMethodological limitations and lack of power of several studies prevent us to conclude on the perinatal safety of beta 2 -agonists. Until further evidence is available, physicians should continue prescribing them as recommended in the guidelines whenever needed to attain asthma control...|$|R
