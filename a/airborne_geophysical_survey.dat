The airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data was typically acquired at four frequencies and the highest frequency provides information on the bulk electrical conductivities of near-surface formations.

40|$|The {{area around}} Syowa Station, the Japanese Antarctic {{wintering}} Station in Lützow-Holm Bay, {{is a key}} area to investigate the formation of Gondwana, because this area {{is considered to be}} a junction of Africa, India, Madagascar, and Antarctic continents from the reconstruction model of Gondwana. However, the tectonic evolution is still speculative because geological evidence is limited to a few isolated outcrops and the coverage with <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> in this area is poor. Joint Japanese-German <b>airborne</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> around Syowa Station had been conducted in January 2006 during the 47 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition to reveal the tectonic evolution related to Gondwana formation and breakup in this area. Ice radar, magnetic, and gravity data are obtained using the AWI owned, Dornier aircraft (Polar- 2). The <b>airborne</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> had been made along almost N-S observation lines with spacing of about 20 km. Several characteristic features possibly related to the tectonic evolution of Gondwana are inferred from magnetic and gravity anomaly maps as well as bedrock topography. Large negative gravity anomalies are observed along the Shirase Glacier and those almost correspond to deep bed rock topography. This structure most likely delineate southwestern boundary of the Lützow-Holm Complex. Northeastern boundary of the Lützow-Holm Complex is also deduced from magnetic and gravity anomalies. Moreover, Lützow-Holm Complex seems to be divided into three segments by the boundaries with almost ENE-WSW strike. These structures may reflect tectonic movements of the post collision. Positive magnetic anomalies surrounded by negative ones are also observed around Cape Hinode within the Lützow-Holm Complex. These data will provide new constraints for constructing tectonic evolution model in this area...|$|R

The lack of modern, multi-sensor (magnetic, radiometric and electromagnetic) data {{represents one of the}} most serious gaps in the geoscience knowledge base of the UK, and a national, high resolution airborne survey has been a stated corporate objective for many years. In 1999, the fixed-wing, frequency domain, airborne EM (AEM) system developed and operated by the Geological Survey of Finland was used in a series of trials to acquire detailed EM data sets in addition to magnetic gradiometer (wing-tip) and radiometric information. The purpose of the trials was, in part, to assess the case for the inclusion of AEM in future strategic <b>airborne</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveying.</b> The limited data acquired (3324 line km in 5 days’ flying) constitute the first high resolution AEM survey information to address specific environmental issues in the UK.

The occurrence of freshwater lenses in saline aquifers adjoining gaining rivers has recently been demonstrated as being theoretically possible by way of analytical solution. However, physical evidence for freshwater lenses near gaining rivers is limited largely to <b>airborne</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveys.</b> This paper presents the first direct observations of freshwater lenses adjacent to gaining rivers, albeit at the laboratory-scale, as validation of their plausibility. The experimental conditions {{are consistent with the}} available analytical solution, which is compared with laboratory observations of lens extent and the saltwater flow rate, for various hydraulic gradients. Numerical simulation shows that dispersion can account for the small amount of mismatch between the sharp-interface analytical solution and laboratory measurements. Calibration and uncertainty analysis demonstrate that accurate mathematical predictions require calibration to laboratory measurements of the lens. The results provide unequivocal proof that freshwater lenses can persist despite gaining river conditions concordant with theoretical lenses predicted by the analytical solution, at least within the constraints of the experimental setup...|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the HiRES- 1 <b>airborne</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>survey</b> of Central England. The BGS and World Geoscience (UK) Ltd. carried out the survey jointly in 1998. The three main survey data sets acquired were magnetic, radiometric (gamma ray spectrometry) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) electromagnetic. The main aim of the report is to provide information on the acquisition, processing and storage of the final data and map products produced by the HiRES- 1 project. Additional descriptions of ground truthing activities, data licensing and dissemination are also provided. A significant aspect of the project was the assessment of the potential of, and issues raised by, modern, multi-parameter, regional-scale airborne geophysical surveys in the UK context. Some of the main issues outlined in the report are: • The practical difficulties of conducting extensive low level, fixed-wing geophysical surveying in the UK. Issues discussed include CAA regulatory permissions, flight height adjustments above conurbations and surveying near areas with dense air traffic. • The processing challenges introduced by cultural (nongeological) influences on high resolution airborne magnetic data sets in the UK. • The significant amounts of detailed geological and environmental information contained within the radiometric data. • The weak application potential provided by passive (i. e. VLF) measurements, in contrast to active airborne electromagnetic techniques. The future prospects for regional-scale, airborne geophysical surveys in the UK are considered. Such prospects are also influenced by a further set of trial airborne data, obtained in 1999, but not described here.

The extensive cover of peat and glacial overburden, particularly over the softer lithologies of the formation, hinders geological mapping and near-surface leaching has destroyed most of the sulphide.

To invert these large data sets in a fast and robust manner we have developed “LC 1 DINV”, a laterally constrained one­dimensional inversion algorithm. This algorithm inverts simultaneously for all observation points along a profile and regularises the inverse problem by requiring that differences between model parameters at adjacent points be small. We use the conjugate gradient method for minimising the data misfit subject to the lateral constraints and a priori model terms. We have inverted 4 ­frequency data obtained over Suurpelto, a test area in southern Finland, characterised by conductive clays overlying a highly resistive granitic shield. The results show that LC 1 DINV can successfully locate the depth extent and variations of the clays. Comparison of these results with those obtained with two other types of inversion shows that LC 1 DINV produces well­defined layer boundaries and laterally smooth cross­sections...|$|R

Multispectral and SAR satellite imagery, aerial photos, data and maps of <b>airborne</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>surveys</b> (magnetic and radiometric), gravity-filtered anomaly maps, geochemical (soil and stream sediment Au, As, Sb, Hg) concentration distribution maps and the K/Ar dating of 132 samples from 80 paleomagnetic measurements were also used.
