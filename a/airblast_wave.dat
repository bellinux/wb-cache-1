40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure the airblast environment generated by the detonation of buried HE charges. Spherical 0. 5 -g charges of Nitropenta were used as the HE source. Three ground materials were used: (1) a porous, crushable grout (dry YTONG); (2) a water-saturated grout (wet YTONG); (3) a clay-loam material. Diagnostics consisted of 16 flush-mounted pressure gauges, and single-frame schlieren photography. Analysis of the pressure measurements resulted in an experimental definition of the airblast environment {{as a function of}} ground range (GR) and depth of burst (DOB). Synthesis of these results allowed one to construct airblast DOB curves. As in field tests, we found that <b>airblast</b> <b>wave</b> forms changed character with increasing DOB: for small DOBs, the wave forms had a classical blast wave character; for intermediate DOBs, a "front-porch" waveform was observed; while for deeper bursts, only compressional waveforms were found. The cube-root-scaled crater characteri stics (e. g., depth and volume) were in qualitative agreement with data from field tests. We conclude that the present experimental technique provides a useful tool for parametric investigations of explosion effects in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{propagation}} of <b>airblast</b> or pressure <b>waves</b> in air produced by bench blasting (i. e. detonation of the explosive {{in a row of}} blastholes, breaking the burden of rock towards the free vertical face of the block). Peak overpressure is calculated as a function of blasting parameters (explosive mass per delay and velocity at which the detonation sequence proceeds along the bench) and the polar coordinates of the position of interest (distance to the source and azimuth with respect to the free face). The model has been fitted to empirical data using linear least squares. The data set is composed of 122 airblast records monitored at distances less than 400 m in 41 production blasts carried out in two quarries. The model is statistically significant and has a determination coefficient of 0. 87. The formula is validated from 12 airblast measurements gathered in five additional blasts...|$|R
