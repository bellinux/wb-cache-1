5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of protest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> Many union members practiced {{this method of}} civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E

5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>company,</b> alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Lescher was a {{business}} partner and friend of Thomas S. Hinde. Both men invested in the Wabash Navigation Company. Lescher later joined Hinde's children in a lawsuit <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> Not long {{after the death of}} Hinde, his son James and his son-in-law Charles H. Constable joined with Lescher and sued the company for entering their land and taking timber and other materials for the construction of dam. But, the company's charter permitted them to enter the land and take construction material without the owner's consent, forcing the owner to seek legal redress. The court ordered compensation.|$|E

5|$|The Wayne Sewerage Company was {{incorporated}} on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek {{to build a}} sewer system and built an engine house with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the water would be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed no threat to human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, the State Board of Health filed a lawsuit <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the Board of Health and a new plant was constructed.|$|E

The first court hearing was held on November 4, but the judge put the case on hold until the strike could be resolved. The case was later annulled on November 7 when the same judge ruled that Pearson had no standing to bring such a suit before the court.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Yelp {{launched}} {{a series of}} town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities {{in an effort to}} address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues. A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews. The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014, most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise. According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b>|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, Hershey Creamery Company {{became the}} first company {{in the nation to}} be prosecuted and fined for failing to {{implement}} a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act. The charges were brought by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, the EPA issued a civil compliance order <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>company,</b> ordering the company to come into compliance. Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation.|$|E
5|$|The Compilation titles act as continuations and {{expansions}} on {{the core}} narrative, with them focusing on various characters. Advent Children begins {{two years after}} VII, when people across the world are succumbing to a disease called Geostigma and Cloud, suffering from guilt, is forced to confront Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo, avatars of Sephiroth's will. Before Crisis begins six {{years prior to the}} events of VII, and follows the confrontations between the Turks and the original incarnation of AVALANCHE. Crisis Core takes place in a similar time period, but follows events {{from the point of view}} of Zack, a SOLDIER who befriended Cloud and was killed by Shinra troops after turning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> Among the characters who interact with Zack is Genesis Rhapsodos, a member of SOLDIER who successfully rebels and eventually decides to protect the Planet. Dirge of Cerberus is set a year after Advent Children, and focuses on Vincent's conflict against Deepground, a sect of SOLDIER that was trapped beneath Midgar during Meteor's descent. Last Order takes place during the events at Nibelheim, where Jenova was originally stored and Sephiroth first found out about himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} oversaw the {{construction}} of a ten-storey expansion to the property. This added a further 200 rooms to the lodge, for which permission was given although the Nevada State Park Advisory Committee opposed the move. They sought to re-open the Cal Neva on July 1, 1969, but instead it partly opened in May of that year with the new expansion opening the following month. The Ohio Real Estate Investment Trust purchased the lodge in 1970 for $6 million, with the aim to lease it to the U.S. Capital Corporation, who in turn sought to sublease it to Tahoe Crystal Bay Inc. The stockholders of the Ohio Real Estate Investment Trust filed a lawsuit <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> in 1973, which resulted in the Cal Neva being placed into federal receivership. After opening year round since Sinatra purchased the lodge, it closed for the winter season in 1974 due to a drop in visitors blamed on the 1973 oil crisis.|$|E
