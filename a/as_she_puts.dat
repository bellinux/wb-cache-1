5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E
25|$|When Alford {{asks his}} own mother, Ann, and step-father, Will, {{to reflect on}} what they've learned from their own experiences, he is the {{inadvertent}} catalyst to the couple's divorce. The book then follows Ann <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> her wisdom on practical display, choosing {{to open a new}} chapter late in her life.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> it, “The {{problem with}} 'whiteshamans' {{is one of}} {{integrity}} and intent, not of topic, style, interest, or experimentation.” Rose has no problem with other races writing about Native Americans and their history, {{so long as it}} is written from their perspective and not from a falsely manufactured “whiteshaman” persona who simply asserts that they have the authority to talk about and understand the Native American experience.|$|E

25|$|In her {{introduction}} to Bone Dance, she tells us, “I {{have often been}} identified as a ‘protest poet,’ and although something in me frowns at being so neatly categorized, that is largely the truth.” A huge element of her poetry is political, which is also unsurprising knowing her involvement in AIM and other Native American movements. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> it, “because the political is personal” it becomes a part of the poetry, whether intentionally so or not.|$|E
25|$|In her day-to-day life, {{when things}} are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where she imagines the {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E

500|$|... 'Dance for You' puts [...] in the bedroom. Clocking in at over 6 minutes, {{the song}} of {{seduction}} plays {{as if it was}} being undressed, much like [...] is, piece by piece, lyric for lyric. As with'Speechless' and 'Cater 2 U', [...] often forgoes the independent woman anthems and beautiful power ballads to remind us that she is a real sexual being rather than a formulated sex symbol. It is breathy, but not boring. It does not chronicle innocent lovemaking with sugarcoated terms, but the grittier things that really go down when you are completely comfortable (and overly confident) with, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> it, the person 'you'd like to thank, in case you don't thank them enough'.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Immortal" [...] begins with Lee {{sitting on a}} fountain. Her legs and arms are covered with bandage <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> them in the water. She is wearing a long white dress and is seen walking around the fountain, {{surrounded}} by children and other people {{that appear to be}} unaware or indifferent to her presence and wearabouts. Shots of Moody follow, who appears to be sullen and withdrawn. He is wearing a suit and his feet are bare. His shoulders sag and his head slumps forward as he delicately plays piano, and he later picks up his jacket as if he is about to leave. When the bridge starts, the band is shot performing in one room while Moody is in another, playing on the piano. Throughout the video, Lee is never filmed on ground level. She walks along the ledge of a fountain, sits in a tree and sings lying on top of a building. She also lies atop scaffolding and on the hood of a car surrounded with leaves.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children. [...] In so doing, Nellie fails {{to live up to}} the American ideal that [...] "all men are created equal", which Emile had earlier affirmed. This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, {{initially}} unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word [...] "Polynesian", responds with [...] "colored". [...] This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production. [...] As Frank Rich of The New York Times commented, [...] "it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype– she's lovable... But how can we love a racist?" [...] Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor– Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> it, [...] "French planters stingy bastards!" ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{insisted that}} her replies are not rants, rather a passionate {{education}} {{for the people who}} write and comment about transgender people in public domain. Her process of [...] "education" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> it, can sometimes end up in heated arguments and war of words with her fans.|$|E
2500|$|Rand {{argues that}} {{consciousness}} is [...] "the faculty of perceiving that which exists." [...] <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> it, [...] "to be conscious {{is to be}} conscious of something", that is consciousness itself cannot be distinguished or grasped except in relation to an independent reality. [...] "It cannot be aware only of itself—there is no 'itself' until it is aware of something." [...] Thus, Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality, but rather, it {{is a means of}} discovering reality. Expressed differently, existence has [...] "primacy" [...] over consciousness, which must conform to it. Any other approach Rand termed [...] "the primacy of consciousness", including any variant of metaphysical subjectivism or theism.|$|E
2500|$|T. M. Bettcher, {{based on}} her own {{experience}} as a trans woman, has critiqued the notion of [...] "autogynephilia," [...] and [...] "target errors" [...] generally, within a framework of [...] "erotic structuralism," [...] arguing that the notion conflates essential distinctions between [...] "source of attraction" [...] and [...] "erotic content," [...] and [...] "(erotic) interest" [...] and [...] "(erotic) attraction," [...] thus misinterpreting what she prefers to call, following Serano, [...] "female embodiment eroticism." [...] She maintains {{that not only is}} [...] "an erotic interest in oneself as a gendered being," [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> it, a non-pathological and indeed necessary component of regular sexual attraction to others, but within the framework of erotic structuralism, a [...] "misdirected" [...] attraction to oneself as postulated by Blanchard is outright nonsensical.|$|E

2500|$|The video's concept shows Rihanna {{travelling}} around {{various locations}} [...] "looking {{for a male}} partner who will please her". The video begins with a shot of flowing water {{which appears to be}} set in a dark swamp-like area. Rihanna's head is then shown hovering above the water as she begins the first verse. She is then presented as a reptilian creature as part of her back is lifted above the water. Rihanna then exits the water, showing a scale ensemble, much like a reptile, which covers her breasts. As the bridge begins, a close up of Rihanna's face is shown, half covered in a shawl, identical to the single cover. Choreography then begins as the singer is shown with a group of male dancers behind her, wearing tribal costumes in what appears to be an Egyptian desert. Rihanna dons a zebra-print outfit with oversized red trousers <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> on a fast-paced routine against the backdrop of pyramids. Empty tree branches are shown, as well as a fire and a starry sky. Scenes of a nude Rihanna are intercut, holding a whip made of hair, while simultaneously covering her breasts.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{behaviour}} continues, Arfwedson {{observed the}} character [...] "spiral out of control" [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> patients lives at risk, takes drugs and nearly burned down her flat. Zosia's mental state causes real concern {{for her father}} Guy. Zosia keeps a video diary where she discusses her thoughts and state of mind. He realises that she needs help and sends her to a rehab clinic. While there she is told that she has bipolar disorder but Guy refuses to believe it. Arfwedson stated that [...] "mentally unstable" [...] Zosia is [...] "terrified of her ability to lose control, but she doesn't want to admit she's got this problem; that scares her more." [...] She fears that her career is ruined and her dreams of being a psychiatrist herself will be unattainable. The actress add [...] "It leaves her wondering: 'How can I understand other people, if I can't understand myself?'" [...] When she is discharged he ignores a psychiatrist's advice that Zosia undergoes more intense treatment. Zosia insists that she is of sound mind to return to work. As the CEO, Guy is able to let her return and even invites her to work alongside him in the operating theatre. But while in there he notices that Zosia is still unwell. She behaves in a [...] "frenzied and disruptive" [...] manner and Guy struggles {{to concentrate on the}} procedure and has her removed from the theatre. The actress described her character as having [...] "waves of clarity where she feels almost super-human and everything makes sense". But then she start talking really fast, no one can understand her and she cannot understand why. At this point Guy accepts that he has been in denial and Zosia is ill. He lets Zosia remain at the hospital under the agreement that she takes her medication to control the health.|$|E

60|$|If the {{doctrine}} be true, that in wedlock contraries attract, by how cogent a fatality must I {{have been drawn}} to my wife!
