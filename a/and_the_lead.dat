5|$|Prost {{attacked}} Heidfeld but {{collided with}} the rear-end of his car at turn eight, send him spinning {{into the path of}} his teammate Rosenqvist, who was unable to swerve to avoid him, and ploughed into his vehicle. It came after Rosenqvist was sent airborne following contact with Evans's rear wheel. Despite his vehicle's back-end sustaining damage, Evans told his team over the radio that he could continue, but Rosenqvist was forced to retire. Prost however was delayed long enough to allow Evans move ahead of him for fifth place. Heidfeld was unhurt and was able to rejoin the race. On lap 44, D'Ambrosio lost third position to Bird who passed him around the outside at turn three. D'Ambrosio then ran out of electrical energy, allowing Gutiérrez into tenth. Di Grassi conserved his electrical energy usage and crossed the start/finish line after 45 laps to win the race. Vergne finished second, 1.966 seconds behind with Bird in third, Evans fourth and Prost fifth. López recovered from his lap 35 spin to secure sixth place, and Abt took seventh. Carroll, Piquet and Gutiérrez completed the top-ten points-scoring positions.
