5|$|I {{have been}} {{thinking}} how very gently I have always been dealt with. I {{have never had a}} violent shove <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers. In <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I have never heard {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E

6000|$|There seems, to my memory, {{an entire}} {{darkness}} and distraction in some certain minutes I then passed alone--a grief inexpressible over a loss unendurable. What should I do; oh! what should I do; when <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life's</b> hope was thus torn by the roots {{out of my}} riven, outraged heart? ...|$|R
25|$|Public service {{broadcasting}} {{is one of}} {{the things}} that distinguishes this country and makes me want to live here. I have spent <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> in it. I would be very distressed if public service broadcasting was weakened. I have been at the BBC since 1952, and know the BBC is constantly being battered. It is today.|$|E
25|$|His {{work has}} become valued {{not only for}} its {{information}} but also as works of art. Although Diego Rivera called him an excellent artist, Garcia did not like the title, considering himself a photojournalist. What I've done practically <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> is to be a witness and to make graphic testimonies of the movements and struggles of the social classes in Mexico. This continues {{to be the most important}} motive I have to do photography.|$|E
25|$|Mashinini played several {{important}} roles in the transition to ANC rule in the 1980s and 1990s. She served on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission {{and went on to}} become a Commissioner for Restitution of Land Rights.

25|$|The band came to {{prominence}} in 2010 {{with the release}} of their debut album, Becoming a Jackal.

In May 2016 Darling Arithmetic won the Ivor Novello award for Best Album.|$|E
25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} I have been a Socialist <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E

"I have no {{tongue to}} speak to thee, Pierre, my brother. <b>My</b> whole being, <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life's</b> {{thoughts}} and longings are in endless arrears to thee; then how can I speak to thee? Were it God's will, Pierre, my utmost blessing now, were to lie down and die. Then should I be at peace. Bear with me, Pierre." ...|$|R

500|$|Deacon {{considered}} his songwriting {{to be of}} equal importance to his musical skills in Queen. He later said [...] "If I'd just been a bass player <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> with the band, I wouldn't be as satisfied... I only consider {{that as part of}} what I do".|$|E
500|$|Twenty {{years of}} hard work, twenty years of fun and frolic and jolly companionship, twenty years of living in an {{atmosphere}} of tuneful nonsense, with the glare of the footlights in my eyes and the thunders of applause in my ears. [...] How terribly I should miss it all! [...] And domesticity, that <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I had fled from, had caught me at last.|$|E
500|$|Pankhurst {{began to}} read books when she was very young – {{according}} to one source, {{at the age of}} three. She read the Odyssey at the age of nine and enjoyed the works of John Bunyan, especially his 1678 story The Pilgrim's Progress. Another of her favourite books was Thomas Carlyle's three-volume treatise she later said the work [...] "remained <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> a source of inspiration." ...|$|E

500|$|Platten {{opens the}} song by singing the line, [...] "I'll {{tell the world}} / I'll sing a song". She {{continues}} by a couple's mutual love for each other, [...] "I see the whole in your eyes / It's like I've known you <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> / We just feel so right". Platten stated that the song's lyrics revolve around finding positivity and optimism in everyday situations.|$|E
500|$|The same profile quoted Morell's catholic {{approach}} to stage assignments: [...] "If a part {{is a good}} part and I feel I can enjoy playing it, it doesn't matter whether it's Shakespeare or modern farce … I'd hate to be bogged down in Shakespeare or classic theatre <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It's {{a good thing for}} an actor to do many different kinds of theatre, because it keeps his imagination stimulated." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{had just}} retired from touring {{after one of}} the most {{difficult}} periods of their career, including the [...] "more popular than Jesus" [...] controversy and the band's unintentional snubbing of Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos. Lennon talked about the song in 1980: [...] "I was different <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The second verse goes, 'No one I think is in my tree.' Well, I was too shy and self-doubting. Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what I was saying. Therefore, I must be crazy or a genius – 'I mean it must be high or low'", and explaining that the song was [...] "psycho-analysis set to music".|$|E
50|$|In 1972 she {{published}} her memoirs as : Days {{and years}} past. In the preface she wrote: «I Think … i am happy. Perhaps, not <b>all</b> of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> were executed.
