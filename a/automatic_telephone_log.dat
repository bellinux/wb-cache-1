50|$|In 1889, Almon Strowger, of Kansas City, Missouri, was {{inspired}} by the idea of manufacturing <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges that would not require switchboard operators. He founded the Strowger <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Exchange Company in 1891, which held the first patents for the <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange. Subsequently, in 1901, Strowger helped form the Automatic Electric Company to which he leased his patents exclusively.|$|R
