40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to present the results of {{comparative}} evaluation of the usefulness of PCR and microscopic methods for the detection of Processed Animal Protein (PAP) in feedingstuffs. In the validation study, the limit of the detection for PCR was determined on 0. 05 % for beef, 0. 1 % for pork and 0. 2 % for poultry meat and bone meal (MBM). Among 62 doubtful samples of feedingstuffs examined by microscopic method 41 (66. 13 %) were found as positive. Based on the results obtained with the use of the microscopic and PCR methods it is possible to state that the molecular biology methods can, at present, be used as a supplementary method in PAP detection.

40|$|The European {{strategy}} for dioxin {{monitoring of the}} food chain has defined high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) method as the confirmatory method that can provide reliable and comparable results at sub-parts per trillion (ppt) level. This paper describes the first inter-laboratory study on dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs by HRGC/HRMS method in <b>animal</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Two different statistical approaches (ISO 5725 and Cofino's statistics) were used for the statistical evaluation. For this particular study, the performances of the HRGC/HRMS method seem to be congener-independent in repeatability and reproducibility conditions over a concentration range covering more than four orders of magnitude. Results clearly show the effect of precision loss below 0. 1 ppt level per congener in repeatability conditions and below 0. 2 ppt level per congener in reproducibility conditions. LODs reported by the laboratories give median values of 0. 02 ng/kg for most of the toxic congeners. Relative standard deviation between the laboratories' mean values using upper-bound approach for TEQ calculation is 6. 2 %, more than twice the maximum level set at 0. 75 ng TEQ/kg of produc...|$|R
40|$|A {{novel and}} {{suitable}} clean-up method that allows, {{for the first}} time, the simultaneous determination of a rather large number of macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, rosamicin, spiramycin, tylosin, kitasamycin and josamycin in feedingstuffs by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) is presented in this work. The effectiveness of the developed clean-up method allows the quantification of the target macrolides in poultry feed using standard calibration curves instead of matrix matched standards, which overcomes the general problem of finding representative blanks. Furthermore an additional back extraction included in the sample preparation procedure allows the determination of an additional macrolide (oleandomycin) with detection limits, expressed as apparent concentration in poultry feed, ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 22 mg kg- 1 and relative standard deviation values ranging from 3. 6 to 10. 1 % depending on the target analyte. Moreover, this additional step has been proven to enlarge {{the scope of the}} method by the extension of its applicability, at the target level of concentration, to other <b>animal</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> such as pig and cattle. The analysis of real feedingstuffs containing macrolides demonstrated the fitness for purpose of the whole analytical procedure as well as a good fitting between real and spiked samples. The proposed methods appeared therefore as a sound alternative in the frame of control (e. g. for post-screening purposes) and/or monitoring surveillance programmes at the target level of 1. 0 mg kg- 1 established according to the reported lowest dosage of additive needed to lead a growth promoting effect.

40|$|A novel liquid {{chromatography}} single quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC¿MS) method for {{the determination of}} the feed additive semduramicin, in poultry feed, was developed and single-laboratory validated. This work was selected as a real case scenario to outline the different steps that may be needed whenever the standardisation of an analytical method in the field of methods of analysis for <b>animal</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> is attempted. In this manuscript the main achievements reached within the development and the singlelaboratory validation of an analytical method for the determination of semduramicin in feedingstuffs are detailed. Semduramicin is extracted from the feedingstuffs with acetonitrile. The obtained extracts are then filtered and diluted appropriately. The separation has been carried out in a reverse phase C 18 column using isocratic elution with a mixture of methanol and 20 mM ammonium formate solution as mobile phase. The ammonium adducts have been selected for monitoring the coccidiostats signals in the mass spectrometry detector. The method has been successfully validated for the determination of semduramicin concentrations ranging between half of the minimum authorized concentration (10 mgkg- 1) to twice of the maximum authorized concentration (50 mgkg- 1). Agood relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) varying from 2. 8 to 3. 2 % has been obtained whereas the relative standard deviation for intermediate precision (RSDInt.) ranged from 3. 7 to 7. 3 %. The obtained analytical performance characteristics of the method demonstrated its fitness for the purpose, making thus the proposed method suitable to be submitted for the last phase within the standardisation procedure, i. e. the inter-laboratory study.

40|$|Introduction: The article {{presents}} a rapid and simple analytical procedure for determination of four tetracyclines (oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, and doxycycline) in <b>animal</b> medicated <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Material and Methods: Two-gramme samples were extracted by a Na 2 EDTA-McIlvaine buffer (pH 4) /methanol mixtures (40 / 60, v/v). The determination {{was achieved by}} liquid chromatography using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C 18 analytical column with mass spectrometer detection (LC-MS). Results: Recoveries of the antibiotics from spiked feed samples ranged from 78. 2 % to 113. 5 %. The LOD and LOQ for tetracyclines in feeds ranged from 2. 8 to 4. 2 and from 4. 3 to 5. 7 mg/kg, respectively.

40|$|The European Union Reference Laboratory for the {{detection}} of <b>animal</b> proteins in <b>feedingstuffs</b> (EURL-AP) has developed an online micrographs collection supporting its network activities within the European Union for {{the detection}} of prohibited animal by-products in feed. So far, the only official method for detecting these by-products is light microscopy, which is highly dependent on the skills of a microscopist because it relies on particle recognition. In order to help the microscopist network to achieve high proficiency levels, it was necessary to create an online reference tool based on micrographs and accessible via an Intranet platform. Members of the National Reference Laboratories for <b>animal</b> proteins in <b>feedingstuffs</b> (NRL-AP) and the International Association for Feedingstuff Analysis – Section Feedingstuff Microscopy (IAG) have access to this micrographs collection. This paper describes how the online collection was created and what conditions had {{to be taken into account}} in creating such a tool. It also describes how information are periodically updated and managed within the context of the large amount of information included in each micrograph. The need for a robust back-office system as the foundation for all the research activities in this project is also covered, and the evaluation of the use of the online collection is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Directive 2003 / 126 /EC {{defines the}} method for the {{determination}} of constituents of animal origin for official control of feedingstuffs. One of the hardest problems for microscopist is the differentiation between mammalian and poultry bones {{on the basis of}} some characteristics as colour and borders of the fragments, shape and density of osteocyte lacunae. The shape of osteocyte lacuna in poultry and mammals is often described in different way, elliptic or roundish according with the Author(s). The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the characteristics of lacunae in chicken bones of different type. For this purpose, smashed fragments and histological sections of the same bone were compared in order to evaluate the microscopic aspect of lacunae in different breaking and trimming planes. According to the observations carried out, it was possible to infer that chicken osteocyte has a biconvex lens shape; however the different arrangement and some size variation of the osteocytes in the several bone segments influence the microscopic features of corresponding lacunae. Chicken bone is made of a parallel-fibered tissue, without osteons. This structure probably determines the plane fracture of the bone and consequently the different aspect of lacunae (from spindle-shaped to elliptic-roundish) we can see in chicken derived PAP (processed animal protein). For example, in the fragments obtained from smashed diaphysis, the prevalence of spindle-shaped lacunae is depending on the preferential breaking of the bone along longitudinal plane. Likewise, for the epiphysis, being made mostly by bone trabeculae with strange directions, the breaking happens along different planes, creating lacunae of various shape. Performing the official check of <b>animal</b> <b>feedingstuffs,</b> the presence of bone fragments with roundish or elliptic osteocyte lacunae induces the analyst to thinking that the meat and bone meal comes respectively from mammals and poultry or vice versa depending to the reference Author(s); apart from the final evaluation (also based on some other features of the fragments), it is important to consider that the chicken bones could show lacunae of different shapes (spindle, elliptic and roundish), in accordance with the type and the breaking of the involved skeleton segments...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the suitability of the FeedCheck test for the detection of processed animal protein (PAP) in comparison to the microscopic reference method. Among 72 examined samples of feedingstuffs there were raw plant materials, meat-and-bone meal (MBM), samples found as positive and negative after the microscopic method and samples with known levels of MBM’s. In all feed and feed material samples which contained mammalian and fish origin PAP positive results by microscopic and FeedCheck methods were obtained. It should be pointed out that although fish meal is classified as PAP, the producer of the test did not declare this material as detectable by the FeedCheck test.

The {{goals of}} the study were (i) to evaluate the performance of the NRLs to apply the microscopic method for qualitative purpose indicated in Commission Directive 2003 / 126 /EC § and (ii) to investigate the robustness of the EC 126 / 2003 directive method regarding the quantitative evaluation of <b>animal</b> constituents in <b>feedingstuffs.</b> The number of participants was 23 and each participant received 19 blind samples of materials adulterated by mammalian meat and bone meal and/or fish meal at different levels of concentration. Blank materials were also sent in order to check for possible cross-contamination. Instructions were the following ones: applying strictly the EC 126 / 2003 directive for both qualitative detection of animal particles and quantification. Participants had to quantify only when fish (and not terrestrial) particles were detected by the qualitative analysis. In this respect each participant had 10 quantifications to realise.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} near infrared microscopy (NIRM) method, when applied to the detection of <b>animal</b> products in <b>feedingstuffs,</b> were determined via a collaborative study. The method delivers qualitative results {{in terms of the}} presence or absence of animal particles in feed and differentiates animal from vegetable feed ingredients on the basis of the evaluation of near infrared spectra obtained from individual particles present in the sample. The specificity ranged from 86 % to 100 %. The limit of detection obtained on the analysis of the sediment fraction, prepared as for the European official method, was 0. 1 % processed animal proteins (PAPs) in feed, since all laboratories correctly identified the positive samples. This limit has to be increased up to 2 % for the analysis of samples which are not sedimented. The required sensitivity for the official control is therefore achieved in the analysis of the sediment fraction of the samples where the method can be applied for the detection of the presence of animal meal. Criteria for the classification of samples, when fewer than five spectra are found, as being of animal origin needs to be set up in order to harmonise the approach taken by the laboratories when applying NIRM for the detection of the presence of animal meal in feed.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European project STRATFEED, the building of a sample bank was a key point into development and validation of analytical methods for the detection of <b>animal</b> meals in <b>feedingstuffs.</b> To manage all the samples, another main objective was the building of a database to store all the data in a specific structure that allows the easy retrieval of specified parts of the data via the applications. The MS Access platform has been selected to implement the database and to manage both numbers and text as well as figures and files. In order to have maximum flexibility for development, updating and dissemination, different tables have been created to suit each topic in the project. The formulae of samples gathered in the sample bank have been described according to the EC guidelines of the Commission Directive 98 / 67 /EC which amended Council Directive 96 / 25 /EC. The incorporation of data and the updating of the database, is facilitated by the STRATFEED manager which is a management tool dedicated to the database administrator. In order to valorise this first reference database gathering so much information on feed samples adulterated or not with animal tissue, an internet based data explorer was developed to give to each lab or manufacturer working in the feed sector the opportunity to request the database. The development of this tool is based on client-server architecture using the Internet to provide the linkage between the two sides.

40|$|The {{prohibition}} of using <b>animal</b> by-products in <b>feedingstuffs</b> depends on two factors: their nature {{defined by the}} tissue/cell type and the species of origin, and on their destination (pets, fur animals or other farmed animals). Proteomics is particularly well-suited {{to the purpose of}} PAPs detection as it is a tissue and species-specific method. The aim of this study was the identification and the selection of specific peptide biomarkers using tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of bovine blood products and blood meals in animal feed. Twenty-nine samples of blood meals and blood products (plasma or haemoglobin powder) of porcine, poultry and bovine origin as well as three milk products and two fish meals were analysed using a Q TOF mass spectrometer. Vegetal feed samples adulterated with 1 % or 10 % of bovine plasma powder, haemoglobin powder or blood meal were also analysed to evaluate the applicability of the method. Four proteins of interest were highlighted: Alpha- 2 -macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A- 1, serotransferrin and haemoglobin (α and β chains). From these proteins, sixteen peptides were identified as potential bovine blood biomarkers in feedingstuffs. Nine of them could be used for the detection of plasma powder and seven of them for haemoglobin powder or blood meal. The evaluation of these peptides by a search against NCBInr database revealed that some of them could also be used to detect other ruminant bloods such as ovine or caprine ones. These preliminary results are promising. Efforts are now focused to improve the protocol in order to increase the sensitivity of the method as regards the selected proteins. Peer reviewe...|$|R
