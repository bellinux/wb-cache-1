5000|$|Filipino-American Art {{includes}} art {{and music}} forms done by Filipino Americans. It has been growing in number in 2016. Filipino Americans are starting to be known for <b>art,</b> <b>singing</b> and even dancing. As we go back in history like Americans, Filipinos have been using the form of art to express themselves, {{to tell a story}} about their ancestors, to give a voice to those who feel like {{they do not have a}} voice or the right to speak up. Filipino American Artist also uses all types of art to have this sense of belonging and identity. Going back to history the Philippines was taken over by America and Spain, and since then some believe they do not know who they exactly are. Filipino Americans struggle to find their own identity, because like all Asian Americans they are looked down upon because there would be people who categorize them as only “Filipino” but there are other people who can also categorize them as only [...] "American". This stigma results in identity loss, not being able to know where you belong and how to fit in. But with the help of different forms of art it gives the opportunity for Filipino Americans to be in touch with their Filipino roots as well as their American roots.|$|E

After graduating from school, Perroni already had in mind what she wanted to achieve in her life and career, so as soon as she graduated from high school she signed up for the Centro de Educación Artística (CEA), an acting school run by Televisa, and signed up for a three-year course, though it only took her two. She graduated and landed the role Guadalupe [...] "Lupita" [...] Fernandez, in the Mexican telenovela Rebelde.

50|$|Born in Mexico City in 1917, Amalia Hernandez {{grew up in}} {{a wealthy}} home as her father was a {{prominent}} business man with military and political involvement. Amalia has been known to credit her mother for her interest in the arts, explaining a childhood full of <b>art,</b> <b>singing,</b> and music lessons. Her parents encouraged her interest in dance, her father {{going so far as to}} build a studio in their home. Her father was quoted as saying, “... there is no other alternative but to accept the career Amalia was born to have”. At the age of 17, she entered the National School of Dance directed by Nellie Campobello, which marked the beginning of Amalia’s serious involvement in dance. After some conflicts with the director of the school, however, Amalia dropped out and consequently married, effectively putting her career on hold for a short while. Ultimately, the call of dance was too strong, for she began to work at the Fine Arts National Institute as a teacher and choreographer of modern dance. She was unsatisfied and unfulfilled with her dancing, however, unable to connect with modern and European dance: “her cross-breed feeling, her contemporary mexicanism, vibrated with the half - breed’s resonance, already defined and on the surface of the colorful México”. She turned to traditional, cultural dances of Mexico, and thus began her involvement with baile folklorico.|$|E
50|$|In {{the latter}} part of the nineteenth century there was no {{reasonable}} secondary education in Barnes and Richmond for miles around except for those who could afford private tuition or send their children many miles to school. In the most populous areas of Surrey, (e.g. Sutton, Wimbledon and Richmond) parents were for the most part obliged to be content to give their children an Elementary education. Richmond County was to be one of a series of new Technical Buildings erected or being erected by the County Council in the seven principal towns of the county. The school was opened on 2 July 1895 on land in Kew Road, Richmond and was fee paying. The buildings occupied a prominent site on the Kew Road at the corner of Selwyn Avenue. This building housed both the Technical Institute and secondary school. Pupils residing in Surrey paid £6 per year, whilst those from outside the county paid £10. The school began with a headmaster and five assistant masters, with visiting staff for the teaching of <b>Art,</b> <b>Singing,</b> French and German. Originally there were 50 boys between 11 and 16 and by 1901, when the new south wing was added, numbers had increased. An extension comprising an assembly hall, four classrooms a gymnasium/drill hall and two workshops was opened in 1902. The first headmaster, A E Buckhurst, was succeeded in 1912 by T W Beasley who continued in office until the school's amalgamation with East Sheen County School for Boys in 1939. When the school merged with East Sheen County School for Boys in 1939 the school moved out of the Kew Road premises leaving the Technical Institute as sole occupants of the Kew Road site. The Technical Institute continued up to the Second World War when it was put on a war-time basis and used as an A.R.P and ambulance depot. It was revived as the Technical Institute and School of Art for Richmond and Barnes in 1947 and in 1954 renamed as The Richmond Institute of Further Education. In 1970 it became the Richmond Adult College and in 1978 transferred to the Parkshot site, vacant with the closure of Richmond County School for Girls and as the Richmond Adult & Community College remains at that site.|$|E

Study questions concerned how reading and writing were practiced and what learning opportunities were afforded for them during an intergenerational program that united 13 kindergarten children with 7 elders to work through a chain of multimodal projects. Data were collected through ethnographic tools in the Rest Home where the projects were completed and in the children’s classroom where project content and tools were introduced and extended by the classroom teacher. Themes were identified through the juxtaposition of field texts in a multimodal analysis. Results indicated that the ensembles afforded children opportunities to improvise and refine their print literacy practices {{through a process of}} rehearsal. The study is designed to contribute to the nascent, yet growing body of knowledge concerning print literacy practices and learning opportunities as conceptualized within multimodal literacy...|$|E

40|$|Automatic note-level {{transcription}} {{is considered}} one of the most challenging tasks in music information retrieval. The specific case of flamenco singing transcription poses a particular challenge due to its complex melodic progressions, intonation inaccuracies, the use of a high degree of ornamentation and the presence of guitar accompaniment. In this study, we explore the limitations of existing state of the art transcription systems for the case of flamenco singing and propose a specific solution for this genre: We first extract the predominant melody and apply a novel contour filtering process to eliminate segments of the pitch contour which originate from the guitar accompaniment. We formulate a set of onset detection functions based on volume and pitch characteristics to segment the resulting vocal pitch contour into discrete note events. A quantised pitch label is assigned to each note event by combining global pitch class probabilities with local pitch contour statistics. The proposed system outperforms state of the <b>art</b> <b>singing</b> transcription systems with respect to voicing accuracy, onset detection and overall performance when evaluated on flamenco singing datasets.

40|$|The {{research}} {{begins by}} establishing Winnipeg, {{as a city}} comprised of many different European immigrant communities where the dominant British-Canadian culture reflected the Canadian national consciousness of the early 20 th century. After an outline of early musical life in the city, four case studies demonstrate how the solo vocal and choral culture in Winnipeg represents a realization of the constitutive, continuously forming and mutable relationships between peoples of differing identities. In all of these case studies, I investigate how this culture has been shaped by social and political actions through transnational connections over the 20 th century. The first two case studies are underpinned by the theories of cultural capital and gender. The first focuses on the Women’s Musical Club of Winnipeg (1900 - 1920 s), an elite group of Brito-Canadian women who shaped the reception of high <b>art</b> <b>singing</b> among their peers primarily through their American connections. The second investigates the Men’s Musical Club of Winnipeg (1920 s- 1950 s), a dynamic group of businessmen and musicians who sought to reinforce Brito-Canadian cultural supremacy by developing a choral culture and establishing a music competition festival based on British models and enforced by British musical associations. The third and fourth case studies are examined {{through the lens of}} diaspora and identity, underpinned by social capital. One examines the changing perspectives towards vocal repertoire and its performance in the urban Mennonite community from the 1950 s {{until the end of the}} century, and how this has shaped high art vocal culture in Winnipeg. The final case study investigates the mutable political and social transnational relationships between diaspora Poles and those in the homeland, as reflected through the activities of the choir of Winnipeg’s Sokół Polish Ensemble. This thesis contributes to the knowledge on transnational musical relationships that shape urban and diaspora musical cultures in Canada. ...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{story so}} often told that it has {{achieved}} {{the quality of a}} myth: how one country – Italy, the ‘land of song’ – in a process beginning {{towards the end of the}} sixteenth century, harnessed its native people’s apparently inborn, uniquely irresistible and extraordinarily perfectable singing style and so successfully exported it, that what Michael Praetorius in 1619 called the ‘Newen Italienischen Manier zur guten Art im singen’ had, by the mid seventeenth century, already achieved a European-wide hegemony which remained largely unchallenged until well into the twentieth century. Behind the myth lies a considerable amount of hard fact, testified to by a rich historiography that traces the colonisation by Italian vocality of vast swathes of European music culture, ranging from compositional genres (opera, cantata, oratorio, etc.) and human ‘diasporas’ both out of and into Italy of singers, composers, teachers and consumers, to the meta-discourses of various specifically vocal ‘Italian-nesses’ in constructions of different national musical identities, local performance styles and even hierarchies of taste. However, attempts to pinpoint exactly the defining ‘technical’ substance of Italian singing that so quickly established itself as the epitome of good singing (for example in the training of German choirboys in the seventeenth century) and also the reasons why those particular features should have been equated with ‘expressive refinement’ in <b>art</b> <b>singing,</b> both within and beyond Italy, has proved notoriously elusive. This paper focuses attention right down onto the physical minutiae of one critical element of the ‘Italienischen Manier’, indeed of the ‘bel canto myth’ itself: throat articulation (cantar alla gorgia) and its manifestation in the so-called ‘coloraturen’, of which the most famous example is the talismanic trillo. The ability to control very precisely – and display in sound – fine articulations of the vocal folds, turns out to be at the heart of a complex cultural discourse that is rooted, finally, in the integers of class. The almost magical execution of the trillo exemplifies a wider discourse of vocality which locates the singing larynx at the meeting point of virtù and virtuosity. This essay traces its history as both ‘technique’ and perennial marker of ‘noble’ singing...|$|E
