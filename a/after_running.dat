40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} is to choose and {{investigate}} the best oil replacement time by oil condition monitoring for crane Liebherr model D 9408 diesel engine. This is achieved by investigating different oil sample analyses of crane Liebherr model D 9408 diesel engine. According to the majority indices results of the oil analysis, But not for all of them, they had an acceptable function <b>after</b> 160 <b>running</b> hours. The variation percent of plumb in wear debris analysis was above 50 percent. According to the Total Base Number (TBN) analysis, the oil had an acceptable function until 150 running hours. Additive depletion results showed that the oil had an acceptable function <b>after</b> 150 <b>running</b> hours, and absolute variation percent of each additive material <b>after</b> 160 <b>running</b> hours were not more 50 percent. Pollutant materials results of this table showed that the variation percent of each pollutant material <b>after</b> 160 <b>running</b> hours was not more than 50 percent. Also the Particle Quantifier (PQ) results showed that the variation percent of PQ <b>after</b> 160 <b>running</b> hours was not more than 50 percent. Results of oils analysis for viscosity didn't give us a reliable consequence. Right now, the oil of the diesel engine is replacing every 125 hours, but overall the best time for replacing the oil for this engine has been calculated as 150 running hours. [Journal o...|$|R
