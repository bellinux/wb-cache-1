40|$|To ensure {{uninterrupted}} {{communication in}} a mobile ad-hoc network, efficient route discovery is crucial when nodes move and/or fail. Hence, protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) precompute <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> before a node moves and/or fails. In this paper, we modify {{the way these}} <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> are maintained and used in DSR, and show that these modifications permit more efficient route discovery when nodes move and/or fail. Our routing protocol also does load balancing among the number of <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> that are available. Our simulation results show that maintenance of these <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> (without affecting the route cache size at each router) increases the packet delivery ratio. We also show that our approach enables us to provide QoS guarantees by ensuring that appropriate bandwidth {{will be available for}} a flow even when nodes move. Towards this end, we show how reservations can be made on the <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> while maximizing the bandwidth usage in situations where nodes do not move. We also show how the load of the traffic generated due to node movement is shared among several <b>alternate</b> <b>routes.</b> In addition, we adaptively use Forward Error Correction techniques with our protocol and show how it can improve the packet delivery ratio...|$|R

5|$|US Highway 25A (US25A) was an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> near Port Huron that {{provided}} {{a connection to the}} Blue Water Bridge to Canada. The highway split from its parent north of Port Huron and followed 24th Avenue south to connect to M-51 (Pine Grove Avenue) while US25 followed Lakeshore Road and Gratiot Avenue into Port Huron. The parent highway crossed under the approaches to the Blue Water Bridge, and the <b>alternate</b> <b>route,</b> along with M-51, provided a signed path between US25 and the bridge. The designation was created in early 1940 and was deleted when US25 was rerouted in 1963 through Port Huron and over the <b>alternate</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1890, an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> through Glenwood Springs {{had been}} {{completed}} and the route through the Black Canyon, being more difficult to operate, lost importance for through trains. The route was finally abandoned in 1955.|$|E
5|$|NY3 has had 14 suffixed routes {{over the}} years; however, {{all of them}} except for one only existed during the 1930s. The only active {{designation}} is NY3A, which is currently assigned to an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of NY3 in Jefferson County.|$|E

5|$|NY3G was {{initially}} a connector between Deferiet and Carthage; {{it was later}} reassigned to a northerly <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of NY3 between Deferiet and Fargo. The designation was removed in the mid-1940s.|$|E
5|$|NY63A was an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of NY63 between Angelica, Allegany County, and Nunda, Livingston County. The route was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering and redesignated as NY408A in the early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} NY10A was an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of NY10 between Long Lake and North Creek. It {{was assigned}} {{in the late}} 1920s and removed {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E

5|$|The {{segment of}} NY92 between Manlius and Cazenovia gained another {{designation}} in 1937 {{when it became}} part of NY20N, a northerly <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of US20 that was concurrent with other state routes for its entire length. In the early 1950s, the portions of NY92 west of DeWitt and from Manlius to Cazenovia also became part of NY20SY, another <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of US20 that veered even farther north than NY20N in order to serve downtown Syracuse. NY20SY was realigned slightly between 1952 and 1954 to follow NY5 through eastern Syracuse instead.|$|E
5|$|An <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> between Los Angeles and Bakersfield {{followed}} the southern {{approach to the}} Ridge Route to Saugus, but took a longer route between Saugus and Gorman, heading northeast through the San Francisquito Canyon to the Antelope Valley and west to Gorman. The rest of the route, from Gorman toward Bakersfield via the Tejon Pass, {{followed the}} same path as the Ridge Route.|$|E
5|$|Delaware Route 54 Alternate (DE 54 Alt.) is an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of DE 54 between Bunting and DE 26 in Bethany Beach. The <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> heads {{northeast}} from DE 54 on two-lane undivided Johnson Road, {{passing through}} a mix of farmland and woodland. Upon crossing DE 20, DE 54 Alt. continues north along Bayard Road through more rural areas, passing through the community of Bayard. The route turns east onto Double Bridges Road and continues northeast through forested areas {{along with a few}} residential subdivisions. DE 54 Alt. turns east onto Kent Avenue and crosses the Assawoman Canal, where it curves north and passes residential development before ending at DE 26 at Bethany Beach. DE 54 Alt. was designated by 2006.|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} reason for imposing tolls on roadways is to help reduce traffic congestion by giving an incentive to drivers to carpool, drive at non-toll times, or to seek <b>alternate</b> <b>routes.</b> While there are correlations between traffic volumes and toll rates, many other factors also influence driver decisions, including gas prices, availability of <b>alternate</b> <b>routes,</b> road construction, family income...|$|R

5|$|In the 1930 {{state highway}} renumbering, NY5 was {{truncated}} even further {{to begin in}} downtown Buffalo. The portion between Buffalo and Athol Springs was assigned as part of NY62. Southwest of Buffalo, Southwestern Boulevard, an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of US20 between Irving and Big Tree (east of Athol Springs) became NY20B. Further southwest, another <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of US20 between the Pennsylvania line and Silver Creek, running along the shore of Lake Erie, was designated as NY20A. The NY20A and NY20B designations proved to be short-lived. US62 was extended into New York , causing NY62 to be renumbered. Around the same time, US20 was realigned to follow NY20B from Irving to Big Tree. NY5 was extended along part of old NY62 to Athol Springs, from where it continued to the Pennsylvania state line by way of US20's old routing to Irving and all of NY20A.|$|E
5|$|Since 1924, {{there have}} been 14 suffixed routes of NY3, all {{designated}} between NY3A and NY3G. Of these, all but one only existed during the 1930s. The only active designation is NY3A, which was assigned in the 1950s to an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of NY3 in Jefferson County.|$|E
5|$|The second NY3A was an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of NY3 west of Lockport along modern NY425 and Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads (the latter three {{then also}} part of NY93). The {{designation}} was removed , leaving NY425 and NY93 as the sole routes on the alignment.|$|E
