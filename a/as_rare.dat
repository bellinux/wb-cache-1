5|$|Of the 374 species {{included}} here, 63 are classed <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> and 94 as {{very rare}} as defined below. Thirteen {{have been introduced}} to North America and two have been extirpated.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of rumination syndrome within {{the general population}} has not been defined. Rumination is sometimes described <b>as</b> <b>rare,</b> but has also been described as not rare, but rather rarely recognized.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 review, {{there have}} been few studies on the {{efficacy}} of Proactiv. A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two less expensive types of benzoyl peroxide, AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can cause severe irritation, as well <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> but life-threatening allergic reactions.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} {{inhabited}} by many native bird {{species such as}} kereru, tui, bellbirds, fantails, morepork, and silver-eyes, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>rarer</b> birds such <b>as</b> grey warblers, tomtits, and the occasional kaka.|$|R

50|$|Like the original, {{the game}} was rated M by the ESRB and carried {{warnings}} about its content <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>Rare's</b> promotional spoof warnings that advertised {{the fact that the}} content of {{the game was}} explicitly 'adult'.|$|R
5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small and severely fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{widespread}} and often abundant in north and north-east Australia, especially north-east Queensland, and are common {{as far south}} as Victoria. They are also found in southern New Guinea and <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> vagrants in New Zealand and the northern part of Western Australia. The population in northern Australia is estimated at between 20,000 and 100,000 birds and in southern Australia, 1,000 birds. The numbers of individuals in New Guinea are unknown. Until 1961, Brolgas were thought to be the only species of crane in Australia, until the Sarus Crane showed up.|$|E

5000|$|The Sand Aloe {{is part of}} a {{group of}} very closely related [...] "Creeping Aloes" [...] (Mitriformes), {{including}} the widespread and variable Aloe perfoliata, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>rarer</b> species such <b>as</b> the unusual Aloe pearsonii and the rock-hanging Aloe meyeri and Aloe dabernorisana.|$|R
5|$|Fish steaks are {{generally}} cooked {{for a short}} time, as the flesh cooks quickly, especially when grilled. Fish steaks, such as tuna, can also be cooked to various temperatures, such <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> and medium-rare.

5|$|In Mexico, the {{hurricane}} resulted in $3million in damage (1992USD, $4.7million 2011USD). It also left 5,000people homeless, and {{was responsible for}} three fatalities. The remnants of Lester also produced moderate rainfall and minor flooding across southern California, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, as well <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> August snow in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{smallest}} species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species. Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism. N. cyclamineus has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected. The IUCN Red List describes five species as 'Endangered' (Narcissus alcaracensis, Narcissus bujei, Narcissus longispathus, Narcissus nevadensis, Narcissus radinganorum). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six <b>as</b> <b>rare.</b>|$|E

5|$|The OBRC Checklist {{divides the}} {{province}} into the Lowlands, Central, and South review zones and requests documentation of sightings of birds which are rare or accidental in one, two, {{or all of}} the zones. Of the 496 species on the list, 167 are noted <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> anywhere in the province and another 108 are rare in {{one or two of the}} zones. Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be.|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, as well <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised {{to stop using}} the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E

The plant species reported are 28 listed in the Mongolian Red Book, 15 very rare species, and 28 species listed <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> species. The species listed in the IUCN Red List are found here: two critically endangered species, four endangered species, and eight vulnerable species.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{conservation status}} of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction. Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The great white shark is further listed as Threatened in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Famicom's owner, Nintendo, once {{claimed that}} it would be {{impossible}} for their console to be decoded. Using the information the Ultimate Play the Game team learnt from Rare, the team prepared several tech demos and showed them to the Nintendo executive Minoru Arakawa in Kyoto. Impressed with their efforts, Nintendo decided to grant the Ultimate Play the Game team an unlimited budget for them to work on games for the Famicom platform. After they returned to England, they moved from Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Twycross, and established a new studio through Rare. They set their headquarters in a Manor Farmhouse. Rare also set up another company known <b>as</b> <b>Rare,</b> Inc., in Miami, Florida. Headed by Joel Hochberg, the American company was involved in maintaining Rare's operation in the US and contacting major US publishers. Famicom was eventually released in the UK under the name Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).|$|E
50|$|St Andrew's School House is of {{architectural}} and historical {{significance to the}} State of Victoria {{as one of the}} few surviving examples of Charles Webb's distinctive institutional buildings, <b>as</b> a <b>rare</b> example of a building constructed of local ironstone and <b>as</b> a <b>rare</b> surviving example of a substantial early denominational school building.|$|R

5|$|Glacier National Park {{has almost}} all its {{original}} native {{plant and animal}} species. Large mammals such as Grizzly bears, moose, and mountain goats, as well <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> or endangered species like wolverines and Canadian lynxes, inhabit the park. Hundreds of species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species, and a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented. The park has numerous ecosystems ranging from prairie to tundra. Notably, the easternmost forests of western redcedar and hemlock grow in the southwest portion of the park. Large forest fires are uncommon in the park. However, in 2003 over 13% of the park burned.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be <b>as</b> <b>rare</b> as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the African hunting dog) that was as large as the dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them <b>as</b> <b>rare,</b> and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, Smilodon, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the modern cougar (Puma concolor), the Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.|$|E
