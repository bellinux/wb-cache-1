50|$|<b>Alaproclate</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} GEA-654) {{is a drug}} that was being {{developed}} as an antidepressant by the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra AB (now AstraZeneca) in the 1970s. It acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and along with zimelidine and indalpine, {{was one of the}} first of its kind. Development was discontinued due to the observation of liver complications in rodent studies. In addition to its SSRI properties, <b>alaproclate</b> has been found to act as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, but does not have discriminative stimulus properties similar to phencyclidine.|$|E
50|$|Bartfai {{has been}} {{involved}} as a consultant at almost all large pharmaceutical companies, including Astra, Roche, Novartis and Pfizer, and co-launched several biotech companies. His accomplishments are seemingly unmatched; {{it is hard to}} develop a safe drug. As an executive or consultant he has consulted on, directed or co-directed the development of at least eight approved drugs. Five of these were “first-in-class” drugs: as a consultant to Astra, the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for depression (zimelidine, and later <b>alaproclate),</b> the first proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazol/Losec-Prilosec - the most successful drug of all time) for ‘heartburn’, as a consultant to Roche, the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor (Tasmar-tolcapone) used in Parkinson’s Disease, the first benzodiazepine-antagonist (flunitrazepam) for treatment of benzodiazepine overdoses, and as a consultant to Novartis the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) agonist Gilenya-fingolimod as the first oral multiple sclerosis (MS) drug. Additionally he has worked on four current drug candidates that are still, at the time of writing, in clinical trials phase 2 and 3. One of the most promising ones is the amyloid Αβ antibody that the Banner Alzheimer's Institute, Roche and the U.S. government are testing in Colombia for prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a large cohort with familial AD.|$|E
40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) is {{generally}} inhibitory to masculine sexual behavior. It {{has been suggested}} that 5 -HT released after ejaculation may promote the sexual quiescence of the postejaculatory interval (PEI). The following experiments were conducted to test (1) whether extracellular 5 -HT increases in either the anterior lateral hypothalamic area (LHA A) or the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of male rats after ejaculation; (2) whether increasing 5 -HT in these sites, by microinjecting the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor <b>alaproclate,</b> could inhibit copulatory abilities; and (3) whether copulation deficits produced by <b>alaproclate</b> were attributable to locomotor impairments. The effects of local application of <b>alaproclate</b> on extracellular 5 -HT levels in the LHA A and the MPOA were also tested. Extracellular serotonin was measured in all experiments using in vivo microdialysis. Ejaculation was correlated with enhanced 5 -HT release fro...|$|E
40|$|The {{ventilatory}} {{response to}} carbon dioxide was determined in six healthy volunteers given alaprodate alone and combined with morphine. A rebreathing technique was {{used and the}} slope of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide was plotted. A comparison of these responses after alaprodate or a placebo showed no significant difference. Following the administration of morphine i. v., respiration was depressed, but there was no enhancement of the depression of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide in subjects pretreated with alaprodate. Although morphine {{is still one of the}} most widely used analgesics its effectiveness is limited in many patients by respiratory depression, and this is par-ticularly so in patients with pulmonary or thoracic disease. Although other agents such as chlor-promazine potentiate opiate analgesia, they also further depress ventilation (Moore and Dundee, 1961). <b>Alaproclate</b> (fig. 1) is a new antddepressant agent with a specific action in blocking serotonin re-uptake and little or no effect upon noradrenaline (Lindberg, Thorberg and Bengtsson, 1978). It has been shown to enhance opiate-induced analgesia in nnimal studies (Ogren and Holm, 1980). However, before investigating the clinical usefulness of this interaction in man, it appeared necessary to deter-mine whether <b>alaproclate</b> potentiated the respirat-ory depression of morphine. Moreover, it is impor-tant to know whether patients receiving <b>alaproclate</b> for the treatment of depression would react adverse-ly to opiates given for intercurrent disease. There-fore, we have investigated the effect of <b>alaproclate</b> on ventilation in man before and after the administ-ration of morphine...|$|E
40|$|The {{ejaculatory}} {{response and}} the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) behavioural syndrome induced by 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeODMT) (3 mg kg- 1 i. p.) were studied following acute and repeated treatment of rats with the selective uptake inhibitors of 5 -HT, fluoxetine, zimeldine, <b>alaproclate,</b> and citalopram. The oral doses used {{were based on}} the respective ED 50 values for uptake inhibition. Acute doses of fluoxetine and zimeldine significantly reduced the ejaculatory response when given 48 h before 5 -MeODMT. This blockade was prevented by treatment of the rats with the postsynaptic 5 -HT receptor antagonist methergoline. An acute dose of fluoxetine given 7 and 14 days before 5 -MeODMT significantly enhanced the ejaculatory response. On day 24, the response returned to the control level. Repeated treatment every second day (5 times over 9 days and 10 times over 19 days) with fluoxetine caused a longer blockade of the ejaculatory response and the sensitization of the response came later than after an acute dose. Parallel with the ejaculatory response three other components of the 5 -HT behavioural syndrome also decreased significantly. Acute doses of <b>alaproclate</b> and citalopram significantly blocked the ejaculatory response at 1 h, but they failed to affect the response at any other time point after either acute or repeated treatment. Neither did these drugs attentuate the 5 -HT syndrome. It is concluded that acute and repeated treatment of rats with different selective 5 -HT uptake inhibitors does not produce a common alteration in 5 -HT 2 -receptor functions...|$|E
40|$|Preclinical {{studies have}} {{documented}} that serotonin (5 -HT) can modulate the behavioral effects of cocaine. The present {{study examined the}} ability of 5 -HT to attenuate the reinforcing and neurochemical effects of cocaine in nonhuman primates. In squirrel monkeys trained to self-administer cocaine (0. 1 and 0. 3 mg/injection) under a second-order schedule of i. v. drug delivery, the 5 -HT uptake inhibitor <b>alaproclate</b> (3. 0 and 10. 0 mg/kg) and the 5 -HT direct agonist quipazine (0. 3 – 1. 0 mg/kg) decreased response rates at doses that had no significant effect on behavior maintained by an identical schedule of stimulus termination. The neurochemical bases of the observed drug interactions on behavior were investigated further using in vivo microdialysis techniques in a separate group of awake monkeys to monitor drug-induced changes in extracellular dopamin...|$|E
40|$|Endogenous amines and {{peptides}} continuously modulate {{the activity}} of neuronal networks and are required even for their normal operation. The respiratory rhythm generator, localized in the pre-Bötzinger complex, is not an exception. This network is modulated by various neurotransmitters, including serotonin (5 -HT). In this study, we isolated the respiratory network in brainstem slices and demonstrate that the endogenous activation of 5 -HT 2 A {{is required for the}} generation of the respiratory rhythm in vitro. At the network level, activation of 5 -HT 2 A receptors with 4 -iodo- 2, 5 -dimethoxyamphetamine or the 5 -HT uptake blocker <b>alaproclate</b> increased the frequency of respiratory activity. Blockade of endogenously activated 5 -HT 2 A receptors with three different antagonists decreased the frequency, amplitude, and regularity of respiratory population activity, an effect that was blocked by protein kinase C (PKC...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{effects of}} cocaine (0. 03 - 3. 0 mg/kg) and several selective serotonin (5 HT) uptake inhibitors, direct agonists and antagonists were determined in squirrel monkeys trained to respond under a fixed-interval (Fl) schedule of stimulus termi-nation and a second-order schedule of i. v. drug self-adminis-tration. Intermediate doses of cocaine increased fixed-interval response rate markedly, and higher doses decreased response rate below control (nondrug) values. The i. v. self-administration of cocaine (0. 025 - 1. 0 mg/injection) maintained schedule-ap-propriate responding over {{a range of}} doses, and response rate under the second-order schedule was a function of drug dose. In contrast, none of the 5 HT uptake inhibitors (<b>alaproclate,</b> clomipramine and fluoxetine) or direct agonists ((±) - 1 -(4 -iodo- 2, 5 -dimethoxyphenyl) - 2 -aminopropane, (±) - 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-N-propylamino) tetralin and quipazine) increased fixed-interva...|$|E
