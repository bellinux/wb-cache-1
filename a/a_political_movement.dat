5|$|Already in 1878, voices sounded for Reitz {{to run for}} the presidency, but President Brand's {{position}} was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high in the Orange Free State. The annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo-Boer War of 1880–1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments in the Orange Free State. On the one hand there were those who propagated caution in the relationship with the British, on the other there developed <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>movement</b> that strongly propagated a (reawakened) Afrikaner national consciousness. Reitz was part of the latter, and together with C.L.F. Borckenhagen, editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper, he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond (Afrikaner Union), a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony, like Rev S.J. du Toit and his Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners ('Society of True Afrikaners') and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging ('South African Boer Protection Association'). Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism in the Orange Free State was also Reitz's successor, M.T. Steyn, then still a young lawyer. The constitution was presented in April 1881, and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond. His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British. It is obvious, however, that a wind of change was blowing through the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony, which was to change Anglo-Boer relations drastically.|$|E

25|$|Peronism is a {{political}} phenomenon that draws support from both the political left and political right. Peronism is not considered a traditional party, but <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>movement,</b> because of {{the wide variety of}} people who call themselves Peronists, and there is great controversy surrounding his personality. The following Argentinian presidents were Peronist: Hector Campora, Isabel Perón, Carlos Menem, Eduardo Duhalde, Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Kirchner.|$|E
25|$|The new government's {{spokesman}} in the United States {{said that while}} religious minorities would retain their religious rights emphasized that the Bahá'ís would not receive the same treatment, since {{they believed that the}} Bahá'ís were a political rather than religious movement. Bazargan, the provisional prime-minister, while being emphatic that all Iranians would enjoy the same rights, insisted that the Bahá'ís were <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>movement</b> and would not be tolerated.|$|E
25|$|It is, however, a {{generally}} ill-defined ideology; different, and sometimes contradictory sentiments {{are expressed in}} the name of Peronism. Today, the legacy and thought of Perón have transcended the confines of any single political party and bled into the broader political landscape of Argentina, therefore Peronists are usually described as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>movement.</b> Traditionally the Peronist movement has drawn its strongest support from the working class and sympathetic unions, and has been characterized as proletarian in nature.|$|E

25|$|In January 1980 {{with the}} {{election}} of President Bani Sadr and the continuing anti-Bahá'í sentiment, the Bahá'í Faith was officially described by the government as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>movement</b> against the Iranian revolution and Islam. Before the revolution, Bani Sadr had connected the universal message of the Bahá'í Faith with Western colonialism. In February 1980, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations stated that Bahá'ís were SAVAK agents and repeated the cleric's charges; only later when he broke with the regime in 1982 did he recant his previous statements.|$|E

25|$|In {{arranging}} {{the acceptance of}} Aung San and his forces as Allied combatants, Force 136 was in direct conflict with the more staid Civil Affairs Service Officers at South East Asia Command's headquarters, who feared the postwar implications of handing out large numbers of weapons to irregular and potentially anti-British forces, and of promoting the political careers of Aung San or the communist leaders. The AFO {{at the time of}} the uprising represented itself as the provisional government of Burma. It was eventually persuaded to drop this claim after negotiations with South East Asia Command, in return for recognition as <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>movement</b> (the AFPFL).|$|E
25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} took the first steps into {{constructing}} <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>movement</b> of their own. In the 1950s, a group of male homosexuals created a group called, The Mattachine Society in Los Angeles. Their mission was to first create an analysis of homosexuals as an oppressed minority, then start to build a large movement of the homosexual community working towards full sovereignty. As the group became larger, the branch moved itself to San Francisco and started its own newspaper called, Mattachine Review. In San Francisco, they began educating professionals-doctors, lawyers, teachers-who heavily influenced public opinion. In teaching homosexuality as an issue of prejudice and discrimination, they hoped to change anti-gay attitudes on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|The Zealots were <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>movement</b> in 1st century Judaism {{that sought}} to incite the people of Judaea Province to rebel against the Roman Empire and expel it from the Holy Land by force of arms.

However, by the year 68, Jewish resistance in the North had been crushed and the Roman General Vespasian had established his headquarters at Caesarea Maritima. The leaders of the collapsed Northern revolt, John of Giscala and Simon Bar Giora, managed to escape to Jerusalem, but brutal civil war erupted as the Zealots and the fanatical Sicarii executed anyone advocating surrender.|$|E
