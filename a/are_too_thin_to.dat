30|$|The Mulussa F {{sequence}} facies are characterised by a sub-parallel, parallel reflection pattern, poor {{to moderate}} continuity and medium amplitude. The amplitude is typically {{in the range}} of 70 – 80  %. This facies pattern is interpreted as a thick sand bed with interbedding shales deposited in a low-medium energy deltaic shelf margin. This pattern is typical of a fluvial environment (Sangree and Widmier 1978). Low-amplitude zones on a seismic section indicate that either the beds <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> be resolved by seismic methods or the deposits are uniform. Good reflection amplitudes may represent interbedding of the relatively thick sandstones with the shales and siltstones.

40|$|Radiative {{efficiency}} of highly luminescent bulk InP wafers severely degrades upon heat treatment involved in epitaxial growth of quaternary layers and fabrication of photodiodes on the surface.

40|$|After characterizing Taylor’s general {{approach}} {{to the problems of}} solidarity, we distinguish and reconstruct three contexts of solidarity in which this approach is developed: the civic, the socio-economic, and the moral. We argue that Taylor’s distinctive move in each of these contexts of solidarity is to claim that the relationship at stake poses normatively justified demands, which are motivationally demanding, but insufficiently motivating on their own. On Taylor’s conception, we need some understanding of extra motivational sources which explain why people do (or would) live up to the exacting demands. Taylor accepts that our self-understanding as members of either particular communities or humanity at large has some motivational power, but he suspects that in many cases the memberships <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> resonate deeply and enduringly within us. In Taylor’s view, a realistic picture of what moves people to solidarity has to account for the extra motivation, when it happens. We propose an alternative view in which morality, democracy and socio-economic cooperation can be seen as separate spheres or relations which are normatively justified, motivationally demanding, but also sufficiently motivating on their own. 23 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Surface-subsurface {{exchange}} fluxes {{are receiving}} increasing interest {{because of their}} importance in the fate of contaminants, nutrients, and other ecologically relevant substances {{in a variety of}} aquatic systems. Solutions have previously been developed for pore water flows induced by geometrical irregularities such as bed forms for the cases of homogeneous sediment beds and idealized heterogeneous beds, but these solutions have not accounted for the fact that streambed sediments are subject to sorting processes that often produce well-defined subsurface structures. Sediments at the streambed surface are often coarser than the underlying material because of size-selective sediment transport, producing relatively thin armor layers. Episodic erosional and depositional processes also create thick layers of different composition within the porous medium, forming stratified beds. A series of experiments were conducted to observe conservative solute transport in armored and stratified beds. An analytical solution was developed for advective exchange with stratified beds and provides appropriate scaling of the physical variables that control exchange flows. The results show that armor layers <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> significantly alter the advective pumping process but provide significant solute storage at short time scales. Stratified beds with layers of significant thickness favor development of horizontal flow paths within the bed and change the rate of solute transfer across the stream-subsurface interface compared to homogeneous beds...|$|E
40|$|Heterostructure based {{interface}} engineering {{has been}} proved an effective method for finding new superconducting systems and raising superconductivity transition temperature (TC). In previous work on one unit-cell (UC) thick FeSe films on SrTiO 3 (STO) substrate, a superconducting-like energy gap as large as 20 meV, was revealed by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) further revealed a nearly isotropic gap of above 15 meV, which closes at a temperature of ~ 65 K. If this transition is indeed the superconducting transition, then the 1 -UC FeSe represents the thinnest high TC superconductor discovered so far. However, up to date direct transport measurement of the 1 -UC FeSe films has not been reported, mainly because growth of large scale 1 -UC FeSe films is challenging and the 1 -UC FeSe films <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> survive in atmosphere. In this work, we successfully prepared 1 -UC FeSe films on insulating STO substrates with non-superconducting FeTe protection layers.

40|$|Migration of CO 2 through storage {{reservoirs}} can {{be monitored}} using time lapse seismic reﬂection surveys. At the Sleipner Field, injected CO 2 is distributed throughout nine layers within the reservoir. These layers <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> be seismically resolvable by direct {{measurement of the}} separation between reﬂections from {{the top and bottom}} of each layer. Here we develop and apply an inverse method for measuring thick ness changes of the shallowest layer. Our approach combines diﬀerences in traveltime down to a speciﬁc reﬂection together with amplitude measurements to determine layer thicknesses from time lapse surveys. A series of synthetic forward models were used to test the robustness of our inverse approach and to quantify uncertainties. In the absence of ambient noise, this approach can unambiguously resolve layer thickness. If a realistic ambient noise distribution is included, layer thicknesses of 1 – 6 m are accurately retrieved with an uncertainty of ± 0. 5 m. We used this approach to generate a thickness map of the shallowest layer. The ﬁdelity of this result was tested using measurements of layer thickness determined from the 2010 broadband seismic survey. The calculated volume of CO 2 within the shallowest layer increases at a rate that is quadratic in time, despite an approximately constant injection rate into the base of the reser voir. This result is consistent with a diminished growth rate of the areal extent of underlying layers. Finally, the relationship between caprock topography and layer thickness is explored and potential migration pathways that charge this layer are identiﬁed...|$|E
40|$|New originalism” {{presents}} a profound challenge to originalist determinacy – that is, {{to the notion}} that original constitutional meanings alone can resolve most constitutional controversies. While new originalists purport to seek out and adhere to original meanings of constitutional provisions, they acknowledge that some original meanings <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> fully resolve many constitutional questions. Such acknowledgment stands in sharp tension with traditional claims of originalist determinacy. While new originalism improves on “old originalism” in important ways, the former’s break from determinacy is not clean enough. New originalists are correct that it is neither epistemologically defensible nor normatively preferable to attribute complete answers to constitutional controversies to original textual meanings alone. This Article bolsters that point, responding to old originalists’ newest defenses of determinacy. Yet the Article criticizes new originalists for their own, more limited determinacy. While new originalists maintain that original meanings alone often are insufficient to resolve constitutional controversies, they overlook the epistemic uncertainties intrinsic in ascertaining original meanings themselves. This Article offers an “all the way down” critique of originalist determinacy. It challenges originalism’s ability not only to answer all constitutional questions, but also to settle reliably on single original meanings in the first place. The Article proposes to build on two of new originalism’s tools – its embrace of thin original meanings and its distinction between interpretation and construction – and to build as well on historicist critiques of originalism to create a new approach to epistemic uncertainty in constitutional interpretation. The approach is called “interpretive modesty. ...|$|E
40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track I: Power GenerationThe {{need for}} enhanced natural gas production is made evident by the increasingly {{large percentage of}} the electrical power that is produced from this source (at present 25 %). While this resource can be extracted from a number of sources, many of the new fields have a high decline rate, and thus increasingly unconventional sources must be developed. One such source is the natural gas found within coal beds. This Coal Bed Methane (CBM) provides only a limited reserve if the wells sunk down to the coal are drilled completely vertically, since production {{is a function of the}} length of the well that is exposed to the producing formation, since the seams of coal are often relatively thin. Where horizontal wells are drilled along the coal seam, and providing that the drill remains in the coal during the entire length of the well, much higher production levels can be achieved. Missouri S&T, in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory, pioneered the use of high pressure water-jets for drilling such holes, and collaborated with the University of Queensland in demonstrating that wells could be drilled out to at least a kilometer in distance. Such wells also provide a path for the subsequent injection of steam and air with controlling bounding of the site, to allow the in-situ combustion of those shallow coal seams that <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> be mined conventionally.
