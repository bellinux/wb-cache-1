5|$|Another {{cause of}} concern for the censors was that Marion was shown {{flushing}} <b>a</b> <b>toilet,</b> with its contents (torn-up note paper) fully visible. No flushing toilet had appeared in mainstream film and television in the United States at that time.|$|E
5|$|The Corn Store {{adjacent}} to the Chapel may originally {{have been used as}} accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp. Five oak-framed bins inside may have held barley for the Brew-house, which is now used as <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> block.|$|E
5|$|The civil {{leadership}} of the resistance, represented by lawyer Sven Arntzen, demanded Quisling be treated like any other murder suspect and, on 9 May, Quisling and his ministers turned themselves in to police. Quisling was transferred to Cell 12 in Møllergata 19, the main police station in Oslo. The cell was equipped with a tiny table, a basin, and {{a hole in the}} wall for <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> bucket.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> vault <b>toilet</b> is <b>a</b> non-flush <b>toilet</b> with <b>a</b> sealed {{container}} {{buried in the}} ground to receive the waste, {{all of which is}} contained underground until it is purposely removed by pumping. <b>A</b> vault <b>toilet</b> is distinguished from <b>a</b> pit <b>toilet</b> because the waste accumulates in the vault instead of seeping into the underlying soil. <b>A</b> vault <b>toilet</b> has similarities to a septic tank.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{different}} types of dry toilets exist. For example, from simple to more complex: <b>a</b> bucket <b>toilet</b> (honey bucket), <b>a</b> tree bog or arborloo (two simple systems for converting excrement to direct fertiliser for trees), <b>a</b> pit <b>toilet</b> (<b>a</b> deep hole in the ground), <b>a</b> vault <b>toilet</b> (which keeps all the waste underground until it is pumped out), <b>a</b> container-based <b>toilet,</b> <b>a</b> composting <b>toilet</b> (which mixes excreta with carbon-rich materials for faster decomposition), <b>a</b> urine-diverting dry <b>toilet</b> (which keeps urine separate from feces), and incinerating and freezing toilets. Dry toilets use no, or very little, water. They do not depend on flushing, and so do not produce wastewater. Some of these devices are high-tech, {{all the way to}} the space toilet on the International Space Station, but many are extremely basic.|$|R

5|$|Mulder and a {{group of}} police search for Lewton's remains. Scully sees blood {{dripping}} on Mulder's face from above and, upon looking up, they see a portion of Lewton's intestine hanging from a tree. Scully, about to perform an autopsy on the intestine, is interrupted when Mona suddenly calls and reports that Bilac was under the influence of Yaje. At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> lid, she sees rats forcing {{their way out of the}} sewer. When the two agents arrive, they discover Bilac crying beside one of the toilets, saying that Mona is dead.|$|E
5|$|This match {{featured}} the longest ever first set (and the longest ever tiebreak) in a men's championship match; the 87-minute first set, won by Murray, included four breaks of {{serve in the}} first four games of the match, a 54-shot rally in the sixth game, and the 24-minute tiebreak which lasted up until 12–10; additionally, the tiebreak included two 30-shot rallies. Murray required six set points to win the first set, and required five sets to win the match. Murray said that <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> break {{at the end of the}} fourth set helped him to restore his concentration after Djokovic took the third and fourth sets.|$|E
5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> {{combination}} squat/Western <b>toilet</b> also exists, where a seat can be flipped {{down over}} <b>a</b> squat <b>toilet,</b> and the toilet {{can be used}} essentially {{the same way as}} the Western style. This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters that sit on top of the Japanese toilet to convert it to <b>a</b> functional sit-down <b>toilet</b> are much more common. There are also permanently installed extensions available to convert <b>a</b> squat <b>toilet</b> into <b>a</b> Western-style washlet. Inversely, there also exists a conversion platform available, that allows someone who prefers <b>a</b> squat <b>toilet</b> to raise himself up to the level of <b>a</b> Western <b>toilet.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Many {{types of}} <b>toilets</b> without <b>a</b> water seal (also called dry toilets or [...] "non-flush toilets") exist. These types of toilets {{do not use}} water as an odor seal or to move excreta along. For example, from simple to more complex: <b>a</b> bucket <b>toilet</b> (honey bucket), <b>a</b> tree bog or arborloo (two simple systems for {{converting}} excrement to direct fertiliser for trees), a pit latrine (a deep hole in the ground), <b>a</b> vault <b>toilet</b> (which keeps all the waste underground until it is pumped out), <b>a</b> container-based <b>toilet,</b> <b>a</b> composting <b>toilet</b> (which mixes excreta with carbon-rich materials for faster decomposition), <b>a</b> urine-diverting dry <b>toilet</b> (which keeps urine separate from feces), and incinerating and freezing toilets.|$|R
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like <b>a</b> <b>toilet.</b> With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E
5|$|Tripura {{has high}} {{incidence}} of open defecation, especially in the interior hilly and forest areas. The state has extensively implemented Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan and currently the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and convergence with MGNREGS to address this problem. Schools and Anganwadi Center are focussed to provide with urinals and latrines, separate {{for boys and girls}} aling with baby friendly toilets in Anganwadi Centers to inculcate the habit of using sanitary latrines in young age. However many toilets lie dysfuncational due to lack of maintenance and damage. Earlier schemes of providing plastic squatting plates, free of cost to people, has not produced results as most of them lie unused as many people cannot afford to construct <b>a</b> <b>toilet.</b> Open defecation has created problems of diarrhoea and vulnerability to malaria. The Chief Minister of Tripura has envisioned to make the state Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2017.|$|E
5|$|Will, Neil and Jay's girlfriends {{have all}} {{broken up with}} them since {{the events of the}} last film, and Simon is unhappy with his girlfriend Lucy, who has become obsessive and abusive. Simon and Will are {{depressed}} and ostracised at university; Neil is working in a bank; and Jay is taking a gap year in Australia. He emails Neil, claiming that he is now a top DJ at a popular night club, lives in a luxury mansion, and has daily sex with multiple partners. This convinces them to visit him in Australia for their Easter holidays. Once they arrive at the club they find that Jay in fact only works as <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> attendant and lives in a tent in his Uncle's front garden, while Will meets Katie, an old friend from his private school days, who is backpacking, and she persuades him to join her.|$|E

5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was <b>a</b> <b>toilet,</b> and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

5|$|Metallica {{began by}} playing shows in local clubs in Los Angeles. They {{recorded}} several demos to gain attention from club owners, and eventually relocated to San Francisco {{to secure the}} services of bassist Cliff Burton. The group's No Life 'til Leather demo (1982) was noticed by Megaforce label head Jon Zazula, who signed them and provided a small budget of $15,000 for recording. The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in Rochester, New York. It was originally intended to be titled Metal Up Your Ass, with cover art featuring a hand clutching a dagger emerging from <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> bowl. The band was asked to change the name because distributors feared that releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success. Metallica promoted the album on the two-month co-headlining Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven in the U.S. Although the initial shipment was 15,000 copies in the U.S., the album sold 60,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} Metallica's Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go to the}} Shipley {{house and}} find the {{bathroom}} door barricaded shut, no sign of any people. The two have a brief run-in with Deputy Greer who believes they are burglars until Mulder disarms the man and Scully shows him her FBI ID. They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on <b>a</b> <b>toilet.</b> Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Donna, {{neither one}} {{aware of the}} other's involvement, both {{investigate}} Adipose Industries, which is marketing a special diet pill {{to the people of}} London. They find that the pill's slogan, The Fat Just Walks Away, is literal. The pills use latent body fat to parthenogenetically create small white aliens called Adipose that spawn at night and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of Adipose Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in <b>a</b> <b>toilet</b> cubicle until they close, the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, they suddenly encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the Adipose babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna around the building, finally catching them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the Adipose lost their breeding planet and hired Miss Foster to find a replacement. The Doctor uses Miss Foster's sonic pen and his sonic screwdriver to create a diversion and escape.|$|E

They came into use in the United States in the 1990s, in response to water conservation concerns. Low-flush toilets include single-flush models and dual-flush toilets, which typically use 1.6 USgpf for the full flush and 1.28 US for a reduced flush.|$|R
