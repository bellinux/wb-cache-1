In requirements on such systems in The Netherlands, privacy laws demand separation between the financial transaction and the registration; the system should not be usable for tracking citizens. There are also very strict demands on performance, with error rates {{of the order of}} 10 - 5 to minimize the number of incorrect enforcements. Both demands combined require complex ADS systems.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a Modelling and Simulation platform for technical evaluation of Electronic Toll Collection on Motor Highways. This platform is used in a project of the Dutch government to assess the technical feasibility of Toll Collection systems proposed by industry. Motivated by this work we introduce the concept of High Performance Discrete Event Simulations to evaluate the performance of Complex Industrial Systems. We assume that the elements have well-known behaviour, and demand that {{the interaction between the}} elements is well-known and their state changes at pre-definable time intervals. As a result we can model the total complex system as a discrete event model. We present the case of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Debiting</b> <b>Systems</b> for Electronic Toll Collection and introduce the modelling approach, the simulation environment (ADS-SIM), and discuss the need for HPC to carry out such simulations. 1. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews in}} outline the {{principal}} developments in traffic signal control since its inception, and explains the current interest in decentralised {{systems and the}} discrete time, rolling horizon approaches to real time control. It is argued that signal control alone is insufficient to solve growing problems of urban congestion, and that recent technological advances in Road Transport Informatics are making integrated systems more attractive. One potential area of integration is <b>automatic</b> <b>debiting</b> and signal control. Through <b>automatic</b> <b>debiting</b> for road use and parking {{it is possible to}} confront the motorist with the full marginal cost of his activity, inclusive of the environmental impact, leading to more socially efficient decision-making behaviour. Signal control could then be oriented to cost minimisation. A second area of integration is in-vehicle information and signal control. Efficient decision-making requires well-informed drivers. The systems have shared information requirements and interact with each other strongly. A third area of integration is public transport management and signal control. In general, priority is required for public transport and the emergency services on designated lanes and at junctions, without disadvantaging other road users unnecessarily. As with the other two areas of integration, there is considerable scope for information exchange, leading to improved state estimation, and joint optimisation. ...|$|R

With the passage of time, people changed their understanding of economic systems, and switched from barter to paper money. In the contemporary world, when IT becomes a big part of common life, the electronic money, e-purses, pay pall and other payment systems are used more commonly and have become more important. The payment systems differ one from each other and we can talk about payment instruments market. But what if this market does not work well? The aim of this article is to determine the rules and conditions on the market of payment instruments. The author attempts to recognize the problems on the demand and supply sides.

Half of her rent was being automatically paid to Metropolitan Housing Trust by benefits agencies, leading officials to believe that she was still alive. However, over two years, £2,400 in unpaid rent accrued, and housing officials decided to repossess the property. Her corpse was discovered on 25 January 2006 when the bailiffs broke in. The television and heating were still running due to her bills being continually paid for by <b>automatic</b> <b>debit</b> payments and debt forgiveness.|$|R
5000|$|Major {{problems}} {{continue to}} beset the repayments system, leading to {{many thousands of}} graduates overpaying on their loans. The issue is that although repayments are processed by the SLC, under a specialist department headed by Kevin O'Connor, they are actually collected by HMRC. The payments collected by HMRC are passed across annually, and only then is the amount left on the student loan calculated. If the SLC notice an overpayment, then the money should be returned with interest. However, long delays in this process have been noticed - and in addition, the SLC have on occasion neglected to inform HMRC to stop taking payments, so a further year of repayments even when the loan has been acknowledged as cleared is not unusual. In 2011/12, the money wrongly taken because of these practices amounted to £36.5 million. In 2009, a new direct <b>debit</b> <b>system</b> was introduced to try and address this problem for graduates who were estimated to have fewer than two years' repayments left to make. [...] However, poor administration has bedevilled this system from the start, and inadequate record keeping means the SLC have great difficulty identifying how much is owed by individuals, meaning that occasionally they either miss the time when repayments should be switched to the direct <b>debit</b> <b>system,</b> or worse, send demand notices to graduates who have already paid off their loan.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a prototype of an automated cash register system for a cafeteria-type setting using digital-image processing techniques. The idea is to take an image of a cafeteria food tray containing food items, identify all the food items on the tray, and display the total food cost. The analysis method uses shape and size analysis to identify food items that are served on distinct types of dishes, and color analysis for those items that are served in similar dishes. This article explains the prototype of a developed system, and cites the experiment results for 10 types of meals served at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University Cafeteria to justify the validity of this approach. The article also discusses the feasibility of developing a fully automated system, which will incorporate biometric technology for identification of the customer for <b>automatic</b> <b>debiting</b> of the food’s cost from the client’s pre-registered account for a wider application of the system, e. g. in military settings...|$|R

The market of credit cards and direct <b>debit</b> <b>system</b> is 4 side business, where the Interchange fee plays very important role. Methodology/methods: In this paper was applied secondary research. The secondary research was based on analysis of papers and literature published about Interchange fee including European Commission together with polemic about payment instruments market competitiveness. Scientific aim: The aim {{of this article is}} to identify the rules, conditions on the market of payment instruments - the system of credit cards and direct <b>debit</b> <b>system.</b> The authors try to recognize the problems on the demand and supply side. The authors focus on defying the cost-benefit approach, contributed with Tourist test. The Interchange Fee plays the key role. Findings: The approach of the scientific literature pays attention to costs and benefits, its equilibrium, also talking about social utility and social welfare the author is missing the whole impact on end consumer welfare and satisfaction. The dilemma is even more complicated due to the fact that the end consumer does not know he or she is not maximizing his or her utility, apart from the merchant, who is under pressure of margin squeeze. Conclusions: It is needed to start to measure the effectiveness and influence which the existence of Interchange Fee brings. Of course, confront the effectiveness and influence with benefits the Interchange Fee has...|$|R

A framework for the introduction of dynamic traffic management in the Netherlands includes basic instruments such as monitoring and signaling.
