25|$|Dharana as {{the sixth}} limb of yoga, is holding one's mind onto a {{particular}} inner state, subject or topic of one's mind. The mind (not sensory organ) is fixed on <b>a</b> <b>mantra,</b> or one's breath/navel/tip of tongue/any place, or an object {{one wants to}} observe, or a concept/idea in one's mind. Fixing the mind means one-pointed focus, without drifting of mind, and without jumping from one topic to another.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{long history}} of oral {{transmission}} of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. Oral transmissions by lineage holders traditionally can take place in small groups or mass gatherings of listeners and may last for seconds (in the case of <b>a</b> <b>mantra,</b> for example) or months (as {{in the case of a}} section of the Tibetan Buddhist canon). It is held that a transmission can even occur without actually hearing, as in Asanga's visions of Maitreya.|$|E
25|$|The sadhaka {{may also}} meditate on a deity. Offerings to the deity {{are put in}} the corpse's mouth. The {{practitioner}} may perform pranayama and meditate on his guru and the deity in his mind. He can also practice japa (repetition of <b>a</b> <b>mantra</b> or a deity's names or epithets), till the corpse promises him to grant his wish. He may encounter an Akashavani (a voice from the skies) which may try to tempt him with material things. He will experience terrifying visions and sounds as well as temptations; however the practitioner should remain untouched and concentrate on the meditation. On conducting the rite successfully, the sadhaka would be blessed with mantra-siddhi (a supernatural power to use <b>a</b> <b>mantra)</b> or become one with Shiva. Uniting with Shiva is said to lead to detachment, a characteristic of the ascetic god. Shiva is himself equated with shava, the corpse. As the vessel of Shiva, the adept becomes an avadhuta, a mystic who is beyond egoic-consciousness, duality and common worldly concerns. The Tantrasara says that a voice may ask for more offerings or bless the practitioner by granting his wishes.|$|E

25|$|New Age {{meditation}} as practised by {{the early}} hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking.

25|$|Many {{practitioners}} {{say that}} the scrying medium initially serves to focus attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind {{in much the same}} way as repetition of <b>a</b> <b>mantra,</b> concentration on a mandala, inducing the relaxation response, or possibly by hypnosis. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer may begin free association with the perceived images. The technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, attempts to deepen the trance state. In this state some scryers hear their own disassociated voices affirming what they see, in a mental feedback loop.|$|E

25|$|In Ultima, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the Avatar, who embodies eight virtues. First {{introduced}} in , the Three Principles and the Eight Virtues marked a reinvention of the game focus from a traditional role-playing model into an ethically framed one.

25|$|The Jivamukti Yoga {{method of}} {{meditation}} is <b>a</b> <b>mantra</b> form of meditation, and follows a three-step procedure: choose a seat, be still, and focus.

The Jivamukti method holds realization of the supreme self or enlightenment {{to be the ultimate}} goal of yoga. The class usually begins with Sanskrit chanting; this is followed by detailed meditation instruction and then about 20 minutes of actual sitting practice. Afterwards there is a Q session with the teacher, and a final closing.|$|E
