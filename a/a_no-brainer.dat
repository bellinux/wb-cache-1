Angelina leaves town and Chloe and Kevin finally marry. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe have financial troubles which Kevin thinks can be solved through criminal acts; Hendrickson said, [...] "Money is usually a common issue between couples.

I think there are some very positive attributes associated with this social networking tool, but I wonder about the negatives.

Therefore, they translate these emotions through menial tasks, even Facebook browsing. Males, on the other hand, don't take the site as seriously or emotionally and use it as a tool for funny or interesting information, not to spur emotional activity...|$|R
