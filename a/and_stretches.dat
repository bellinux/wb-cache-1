5|$|The Gulf Stream, {{together}} with its northern extension the North Atlantic Drift, is {{a warm and}} swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> {{to the tip of}} Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America.

5|$|The Marcellus {{natural gas}} trend, which {{encompasses}} 104,000 square miles <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, {{is the largest}} source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus {{is an example of}} shale gas, natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of hydraulic fracturing to allow the gas to flow to the well bore. The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E

5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal {{accessory}} nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the spinal cord.

The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E

5|$|The summer {{breeding}} range stretches across North America {{from coast to}} coast. It is bounded on the north by Saskatchewan <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> south across North America to North Carolina on the east coast, and northern California on the west coast. The American goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact flocks, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|Olivia McKoy {{represented}} Jamaica as {{its only}} javelin thrower at the Beijing Olympics. She {{was born in}} Clarendon Parish, which lies in central Jamaica <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> southwards to the island's southernmost point, and debuted at the 2000 Sydney Olympics by participating in the same event for the same country at age 26. Although McKoy did not compete in Athens in 2004, she returned in Beijing {{at the age of}} 34. During the August 18 qualifying round, McKoy participated in the second heat. 26 other athletes competed in her group, and she ranked 17th of them after throwing the javelin 55.51meters. Overall, McKoy ranked 34th out of the 52 athletes who finished the event. She did not advance to the final round.|$|E

5|$|Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area has trails for {{hiking and}} horseback riding. A short, half mile (800m) trail leads to Silver Springs near the park's east entrance. A longer, four mile (6.4km) trail follows {{the course of}} the Fox River through the park's wooded areas. The equestrian trail is located in the {{wildlife}} management area of the park <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> seven miles (11km). A one-mile (1.6km) path travels through the prairie restoration area as well. During the winter, much of the park's trail system is open to cross-country skiing, and a four-mile (6km) trail is open to snowmobiling, weather permitting. When ice thickness permits, the lakes are opened to ice skating and ice fishing. Sledding is another popular activity; Toboggan Hill is located inside the park's east entrance.|$|E
5|$|The Huon Peninsula is {{situated}} along the north-east coast of Papua New Guinea, <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> from Lae {{in the south}} on the Huon Gulf to Sio in the north along the Vitiaz Strait. Along the coast, between these two points, numerous rivers and streams cut the terrain. Of these, the most prominent are the Song, Bumi, and Mape Rivers. These waterways flow from the mountainous interior, which is formed through the conglomeration of the Rawlinson Range in the south, with the Cromwell Mountains in the east. These meet in {{the centre of the}} peninsula to form the Saruwaged Range massif, which joins the Finisterre Range further west. Apart from a thin, flat coastal strip, {{at the time of the}} campaign, the area was thickly covered with dense jungle, through which very few tracks had been cut.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{section of}} the highway, from Great Northern Highway to Port Hedland, was made part of Great Northern Highway in early 1996. Over a ten-year period from 1996 to 2006, {{numerous}} improvements {{were made to the}} highway, with sections widened, reconstructed, and realigned. Intersections <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> through townsites were also redesigned, existing bridges were strengthened, and new bridges replaced older bridges or floodways. Additional work was necessary to repair damage from natural events. Sections washed away by floods in January 2003 were rebuilt, and opened in October of that year, and repairs to the damage from Cyclone Monty in March 2004 were completed that November.|$|E

5|$|The text classifies {{three levels}} of breath regulation, namely Puraka (पूरक, satisfying), Kumbhaka (कुम्भक, prominent) and Rechaka (रेचक, purging). The Puraka {{exercise}} is shortest and counts twelve moments (matras, music beats); the Kumbhaka is medium <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> over twenty-four moments, while the Rechaka is highest lasting thirty-six moments. The text then describes various combinations of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka in various asanas {{for the purposes of}} energizing the Nadis and cleansing the body, asserting that, when mastered, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana and other vital airs help gain endurance, calmness, measured speed, ascension and inner healing. The text says that Pranayama exercises have therapeutic powers. Yajnavalkya describes Sanmukhi mudra, Kevaka kumbhaka and Sahita kumbhaka in chapter 6, asserting that the best exercises are those that make one feel lightness in the body and relaxation in the mind.|$|E
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings – the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures. CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum. There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of the Bath Road is Prospect Park, a large urban park {{surrounding}} the Mansion House. Development to the south of Southcote is restricted by the Holy Brook and the Great Western Main Line, and although the land is used for recreation, proposals are occasionally put forward to build housing on the floodplains. The land south of the railway line is subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO). This land is defined by Reading Borough Council as Southcote Meadows, <b>and</b> <b>stretches</b> from the Burghfield Road (near to the western boundary of Southcote) to Milkmaid's Bridge at the foot of Southcote Lock. Other parts of Southcote are subject to similar restrictions, including areas adjacent to (but north of) the railway embankment, trees lining the Kennet and Avon Canal west of Southcote Lock, and various individual sites.|$|E
