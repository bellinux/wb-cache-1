40|$|Abstract: In this paper, an <b>automatic</b> {{parameter}} <b>configuration</b> {{mechanism for}} GridFTP is proposed. This mechanism optimizes {{the number of}} parallel TCP connections by utilizing the analytic result of GridFTP throughput. The proposed mechanism first measures the network status (e. g., the goodput and the round-trip time of GridFTP data channels) at the GridFTP client. Based on these measurement results, it adjusts the number of parallel TCP connections for maximizing the GridFTP goodput. Three operational modes, MI (Multiplicative Increase), MI+ (Multiplicative Increase Plus), and AIMD (Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease) are proposed in this paper, each of which takes a different strategy for adjusting the number of parallel TCP connections. Performance of the proposed <b>automatic</b> parameter <b>configuration</b> mechanism is evaluated through simulation experiments.

40|$|Automated {{algorithm}} configuration {{methods have}} proven to be instrumental in deriving high-performing algorithms and such methods are increasingly often used to configure evolutionary algorithms. One major challenge in devising <b>automatic</b> algorithm <b>configuration</b> techniques is to handle the inherent stochasticity in the configuration problems. This article analyses a post-selection mechanism that can also be used for this task. The central idea of the post-selection mechanism is to generate in a first phase a set of high-quality candidate algorithm configurations and then to select in a second phase from this candidate set the (statistically) best configuration. Our analysis of this mechanism indicates its high potential and suggests that it may be helpful to improve <b>automatic</b> algorithm <b>configuration</b> methods...|$|R
40|$|Bayesian {{optimization}} {{techniques have}} been successfully applied to robotics, planning, sensor placement, recommendation, advertising, intelligent user interfaces and <b>automatic</b> algorithm <b>configuration.</b> Despite these successes, the approach is restricted to problems of moderate dimension, and several workshops on Bayesian optimization have identified its scaling to high dimensions {{as one of the}} holy grails of the field. In this paper, we introduce a novel random embedding idea to attack this problem. The resulting Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) algorithm is very simple and applies to domains with both categorical and continuous variables. The experiments demonstrate that REMBO can effectively solve high-dimensional problems, including <b>automatic</b> parameter <b>configuration</b> of a popular mixed integer linear programming solver...|$|R

50|$|Also, {{although}} some later ISA devices {{were capable of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>configuration,</b> it was common for PC ISA expansion cards to limit themselves to {{a very small number}} of choices for interrupt request lines.
