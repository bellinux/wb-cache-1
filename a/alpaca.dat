5|$|In 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} phylogenetic study of the {{evolutionary}} relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini – consisting of the three Camelus species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) – and Lamini, which consists of the <b>alpaca</b> (Vicugna pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the llama (L. glama) and the vicuña (V. vicugna). The study showed the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} universally agreed {{definition}} of which species are livestock. Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as horses, while poultry birds are sometimes excluded. In {{some parts of the}} world, livestock includes species such as buffalo, and the South American camelids, the <b>alpaca</b> and llama. Some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|It is {{told that}} an Indian boy named Mariano Mayta {{used to watch}} over his father's herd of <b>alpaca</b> {{on the slopes of}} the mountain. He wandered into the snowfields of the glacier, where he {{encountered}} a mestizo boy named Manuel. They became good friends, and Manuel provided Mariano with food. When the boy did not return home for meals, Mariano's father went looking for his son. He was surprised to find his herd had increased. As a reward, he sent Mariano to Cusco to get new clothes. Mariano asked to buy some also for Manuel, who wore the same outfit everyday. His father agreed, so Mariano asked Manuel for a sample in order to buy the same kind of cloth in Cusco.|$|E

40|$|Reports of bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) {{infections in}} <b>alpacas</b> have been increasing {{in recent years}} but much is still unknown about the mechanisms of disease in this species. This report characterizes the transmission of BVDV from persistently infected (PI) <b>alpacas</b> to BVDV naïve <b>alpacas,</b> documents shedding patterns, and characterizes the disease effects in both PI and transiently infected <b>alpacas.</b> Two PI <b>alpacas</b> shed BVDV Type 1 b virus in most body fluids, and commonly available diagnostic tests verified their status. Bovine viral diarrhea virus Type 1 b transient infections produced only mild signs of disease in BVDV naïve <b>alpacas.</b> Viremia was detected in whole blood, but viral shedding during the acute phase was not detected and antibody appeared to be protective upon re-exposure to the virus...|$|R

5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and <b>alpaca.</b> In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mycoplasma haemolamae is a hemotropic {{mycoplasma}} {{that affects}} {{red blood cells}} of llamas (Lama glama) and <b>alpacas</b> (Lama pacos). It is variably associated with anemia, and most infections are subclinical. Development of a polymerase chain reaction assay has facilitated detection of this infection in llamas and <b>alpacas</b> in the United States and other countries. Whether the infection occurs in camelids in South America has previously been unknown. The current study documents a 15. 8 % infection rate among 76 Peruvian llamas, a 19. 3 % infection rate among Peruvian <b>alpacas</b> at one site, and a 9. 26 % infection rate in 108 Chilean <b>alpacas</b> from selected herds. All of the camelids tested appeared to be clinically healthy. No gender or species predilection was found. Only 1 positive camelid younger than 18 months was found. Infection is not associated with anemia, and the mean packed cell volume (PCV) in positive Peruvian camelids was slightly higher than the mean PCV in negative Peruvian camelids. In the Chilean <b>alpacas,</b> the positive <b>alpacas</b> had a slightly lower PCV than the negative <b>alpacas,</b> although the mean PCV {{was not in the}} anemic range in any of the groups...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with low vitamin D status of <b>alpacas</b> at pasture in southern Australia. Design A 2 -year survey of <b>alpacas</b> from two farms in South Australia and three in Victoria. Blood samples were collected from 20 to 30 <b>alpacas</b> on each farm on five occasions each year. Breed, gender, age and fleece colour of animals were recorded. Method Blood samples were assayed for plasma 2. 5 -hydroxycholecalciferol (25 -OH D 3) and plasma inorganic phosphorus (Pi). Data sets from 802 animal samples were analysed by multiple regression to determine variables associated with low vitamin D status of <b>alpacas.</b> The relationship between plasma 25 -OH D 3 and plasma Pi was also investigated. Results Vitamin D status was significantly affected by month of sampling, with low values in late winter and high values in summer. Plasma vitamin D concentrations increased with age, were higher in <b>alpacas</b> with light fleeces than in those with dark fleeces and were also higher in the Suri than in the Huacaya breed. Plasma Pi concentrations were generally lower in <b>alpacas</b> with plasma 25 -OH D 3 values < 25 nmol/L. Conclusions Young <b>alpacas</b> with dark fleeces are most at risk from vitamin D insufficiency in late winter in southern Australia. The present study indicates that plasma Pi values are not a reliable indicator of vitamin D status of <b>alpacas</b> as assessed by plasma 25 -OH D 3 concentrations. <br /...|$|R

50|$|Similar to ruminants, such as {{cattle and}} sheep, <b>alpacas</b> have only lower teeth {{at the front}} of their mouths; therefore, they do not pull grass up by the roots. Rotating {{pastures}} is still important, though, as <b>alpacas</b> have a tendency to regraze an area repeatedly. <b>Alpacas</b> are fiber-producing animals; they {{do not need to be}} slaughtered to reap their product, and their fiber is a renewable resource that grows yearly.|$|R
25|$|As {{with all}} fleece-producing animals, quality varies from animal to animal, and some <b>alpacas</b> produce fiber {{which is less}} than ideal. Fiber and {{conformation}} {{are the two most}} important factors in determining an <b>alpaca's</b> value.|$|R
25|$|Fatal {{infection}} of an <b>alpaca</b> (Lama pacos) with an unnamed species has been reported. Findings included disseminated eosinophilic myositis, abortion and haemoabdomen.

Their aggression towards members of the canid family (coyotes, foxes, dogs etc.) is exploited when <b>alpacas</b> are used as guard llamas for guarding sheep.|$|R
50|$|Llamas and <b>alpacas</b> {{were also}} used frequently. Llamas and <b>alpacas</b> are {{lightweight}} animals. They cannot carry much, but they are incredibly nimble. When transporting large amounts of goods across the empire it was more efficient for the Incas to use herds of llamas or <b>alpacas</b> and {{have two or three}} herdsmen. The herdsmen would herd the animals up the steep mountain roads without having to risk peoples' lives and while still being able to carry larger amounts of resources.|$|R
