40|$|In the paper, {{the design}} {{optimisation}} of a heat exchanger is discussed, using a thermoeconomic approach. The investigation {{is referred to}} the tube-in-tube condenser of a conventional vapour-compression heat pump, with a twophase refrigerant flowing in the inner tube and a single-phase fluid flowing in the annulus. A cost function to be minimised is introduced, defined as the sum of two contributions: (i) the <b>amortisation</b> <b>cost</b> of the condenser, related to the heat exchange area;(ii) the operating cost of the electric-driven heat pump in which the heat exchanger will work, depending on the overall exergy destruction rate in the system. In the paper, this latter contribution {{is related to the}} local irreversibility rate in the condenser, using the so-called structural approach. The optimal trade-off between <b>amortisation</b> and operating <b>cost</b> is therefore investigated, by minimising the above-mentioned cost function. A numerical example is discussed, in which, for a commercial heat exchanger, the design improvements needed to obtain a cost-optimal configuration are investigated. The analysis is carried out for three different refrigerants: R 22, R 134 a and R 410 A...|$|R

The financial situation of the club was deteriorated, which the club raised the short term profit by player exchange, but also raised the long term <b>amortisation</b> <b>cost.</b> The club had swapped Stefano Mondini with Christian Jidayi on 30 June 2008 in co-ownership deal for €750,000, made the clubs had player selling revenue of €1.5 million. June 2009 also saw Jidayi return to Cesena and Mondini back to Mantova; 50% of both players' rights were valued at €750,000. However, it became a financial burden for both clubs, which Mantova had to amortise Mondini's value (€1.5 million) in instalments as amortisation. In June 2008 Mantova also swapped Valerio Di Cesare (€1M) and Simone Calori (€0.5M) with Riccardo Fissore (€0.5M) and Mattia Marchesetti (€1M). Again, Mantova had to amortise €0.5M in for 3 seasons for Fissore (€166,667) and Marchesetti (€333,333).|$|R

Time- and space-behaviour of lazy functional languages {{can be hard to}} predict, creating a significant barrier to their broader acceptance. This paper applies a type-based analysis employing <b>amortisation</b> and <b>cost</b> effects to statically determine upper bounds on evaluation <b>costs.</b> While <b>amortisation</b> performs well with finite recursive data, we significantly improve the precision of our analysis for co-recursive programs (i. e. dealing with potentially infinite data structures) by tracking self-references. Combining these two approaches gives the first automatic static analysis for both recursive and co-recursive definitions. Furthermore, we generalize the analysis to determine cost bounds for an arbitrary measure assigned to syntactic constructs (e. g. evaluation steps, applications, allocations, etc.).

40|$|This master's thesis {{discusses}} the financial aspect of drinkable water supply distribution. Unlike {{in the case}} of the Črnomelj municipality, particular emphasis is placed here on the real cost by including the amortisation of water supply infrastructure in determining the actual cost of drinkable water distribution for households. The chosen methodology to arrive at the drinkable water distribution price setting is based on the principle of regulating the relationship between the actual costs in the process of drinkable water distribution (with the emphasis on the <b>amortisation</b> <b>costs)</b> and the amounts of drinkable water sold to the inhabitants in a certain area of the municipality and in the lower spatial units of the local communities. The empirical part of this thesis determines the price for the drinkable water distribution in each individual local community of the municipality; considerable differences in distribution costs are shown and evaluated as a consequence of different lengths of water supply networks and different consumer density in each individual local community. The fees established in this manner have also been placed in the context of a broader time period. The calculating framework of the simulation presents an analytical model that demonstrates the influence of changes in the infrastructure costs, network lengths and consumer density on the modification of fees for the distribution of drinkable water. Municipalities can evaluate the conditions in different areas for the drinkable water cost distribution. The core thesis of this paper is based on the presupposition that the <b>costs</b> of real <b>amortisation</b> of water supply network in the rural areas should be included in the price of the drinkable water distribution. Inclusion of all of the costs will have a positive effect in achieving the requirements for the operative programs for state environmental and infrastructure standards of drinkable water supply: reduction of water loss, lowering maintenance costs, maintaining a steady water supply for households and raising the health standards of drinkable water. An additional positive effect from inclusion of all costs will be understanding the real costs for providing water supply infrastructure for reconstructions and newly constructed buildings in the rural areas. A research of average consumer household habits has been conducted on state level (currently, 2011); in addition, the established fee structures for services in the field of drinkable water distribution have been studied in some comparable public organisations. On the basis of quantification, comparison of statistical data and the results from the empirical part of the thesis we have reached the conclusion that the possibility for the rise in prices of drinkable water distribution is realistic and professionally justified in the rural areas of Slovenian municipalities that are presently confronted with the problems of old and deteriorated water supply infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{boards in}} {{strategic}} goal setting and, in particular, {{the level of}} board involvement in strategic goal setting has not been extensively researched, {{primarily because of the}} difficulty of gaining access to empirical data. Therefore, boards of directors of companies listed on the Alternative Exchange (AltX) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) were targeted for this research by means of a survey questionnaire administered via email. The aim of the research was firstly to understand the level of board involvement in strategic goal setting, secondly to establish the common strategic goals set by AltX companies and how often these goals are reviewed, thirdly to determine whether there is a relationship between independent variables such as organisational size, board size and number of non-executive directors and the level of board involvement, and finally to determine whether the level of board involvement varies between executive and non-executive directors. The research found that the level of board involvement was at mid-level being ‘sometimes involved’ while the board’s involvement is significantly lower in strategic goal formation processes. The most common goal was found to be EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and <b>amortisation)</b> with <b>Cost</b> being the strategic goal most frequently reviewed. No statistically significant correlation was established between the independent variables and the level of board involvement in strategic goal setting. Finally, non-executive directors prefer to take on more of an ‘agency’ role by not becoming involved in ‘prescribing’ strategy. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to {{investigate}} the impact of reactiviting the category of communal property on the position of communal public utility enterprises. This impact is analyzed both in legal {{as well as in}} economic contexts. It manifests itself especially in economic, financial, legal and organizational systems of the said enterprises. Since a commune is the owner of public utilities, the task of managing communal property is vested in the commune office. A public utility enterprise is only the usufructary. The tariffs of payments for public utility services should cover the exploitation <b>costs,</b> <b>amortisation</b> rates and interest. Amortisation rates should be kept by the enterprise and should be spent on financing the replacement of decapitalised elements of its property, while interest should be transferred to the commune office and should be used as a source of financing the growth of communal property. A prevailing organizational structure of communal public utility enterprises should the public-law management in the form of enterprises not isolated from local administration (small towns) or isolated from local administration (medium and big towns). The private-law management, such as a joint-stock company, should be an exceptional form. The public-law enterprises should operate under the direct suprevision of the commune office or under the control of specially appointed supervisory boards. The presence of the employee self-government in such enterprises is not justified.

Bunun yanında su emme değerlerine, arşimed yoğunluklarına, XRD faz analizlerine ve mikro sertlik değerlerine bakılmıştır.   Yapılan bu toz karakterizasyon ve sinterlenmiş numunelerin karakterizasyonu işlemleriyle elde edilen sonuçlar irdelenmiştir. Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark plugs, tap washers, pump seals, electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of monolithic and brick refractories. It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), special alloys, fertilizers, fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and dry screening processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering casettes,  reducing <b>amortisation</b> <b>costs</b> of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.
