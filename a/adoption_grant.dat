40|$|The article {{intends to}} be a {{screening}} of family benefits in the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU) and {{to contribute to the}} research of shared trends with respect to family approach in these countries. Four types of family benefits including eight distinctive categories are analysed: child-benefit, child care allowances, child-raising allowances, and other benefits (birth and <b>adoption</b> <b>grants,</b> allowance for single parents, special allowances for children with disabilities, advance payments for maintenance and other allowances). The paper is based on primary and secondary analysis of 28 sets of national data provided through the European Union's Mutual Information System on Social Protection (MISSOC). Three categories of member states are considered: founder member states of the EU, other “old” member states, and the new Central and Eastern ones. Chronological development of national regulations with impact on family benefits is analysed in connection with the moment of becoming a member state. Various forms of family benefits legislation and their main subjects of interest are further researched. The last part of the article looks at the coverage of family benefits. Seven member states operate in this respect based on regulations adopted before EU accession. Belgium, Finland, and Lithuania have the “most preserved” family regulations per category of member states. The first three topics of family regulations are: child, family, and allowance / benefit. The most frequently provided family benefits are: birth and <b>adoption</b> <b>grants,</b> and special allowance for children with disabilities. All eight family benefits are provided in France, Finland, Hungary, and Slovenia. Only two types of family benefits are available in Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus...|$|R

5000|$|Pro-transracial {{adoption}} advocates {{argue that}} there are more white families seeking to adopt than there are minority families; conversely, there are more minority children available for adoption. For example, in 2009, 41% of children available for adoption were African American, 40% were white children, and 15% were Hispanic children. This disparity often results in a lower cost to adopt children from ethnic minorities - usually through special <b>adoption</b> <b>grants</b> rather than fee discrimination. Many critics decry the exchange of money for children, whether as [...] "fees for service" [...] or otherwise, arguing that no children of any race should ever be for sale. Proponents point out practicality in the current systems. This situation is morally difficult because the adoptive families see adoption as a great benefit to trans-racially adopted children, while some minorities see it as an assault on their culture. In 2004, 26 percent of African-American children adopted from foster care were adopted trans-racially. [...] Government agencies have varied over time in their willingness to facilitate trans-racial adoptions. [...] "Since 1994, white prospective parents have filed, and largely won, more than two dozen discrimination lawsuits, according to state and federal court records." [...] There is also a great need to place these children; in 2004 more than 45,000 African-American children were waiting to be adopted from foster care.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Family, twin and {{adoption}} {{studies suggest that}} genetic susceptibility contributes to familial aggregation of infectious diseases or to death from infections. We estimated genetic and shared environmental influences separately on the risk of acquiring an infection (incidence) and on dying from it (case fatality). METHODS: Genetic influences were estimated by the association between rates of hospitalization for infections and between case-fatality rates of adoptees and their biological full- and half- siblings. Familial environmental influences were investigated in adoptees and their adoptive siblings. Among 14, 425 non-familial <b>adoptions,</b> <b>granted</b> in Denmark during the period 1924 - 47, we selected 1, 603 adoptees, who had been hospitalized for infections and/or died with infection between 1977 and 1993. Their siblings were considered predisposed to infection, and compared with non-predisposed siblings of randomly selected 1, 348 adoptees alive in 1993 and not hospitalized for infections in the observation period. The risk ratios presented {{were based on a}} Cox regression model. RESULTS: Among 9971 identified siblings, 2829 had been hospitalised for infections. The risk of infectious disease was increased among predisposed compared with non-predisposed in both biological (1. 18; 95 % confidence limits 1. 03 - 1. 36) and adoptive siblings (1. 23; 0. 98 - 1. 53). The risk of a fatal outcome of the infections was strongly increased (9. 36; 2. 94 - 29. 8) in biological full siblings, but such associations were not observed for the biological half siblings or for the adoptive siblings. CONCLUSION: Risk of getting infections appears to be weakly influenced by both genetically determined susceptibility to infection and by family environment, whereas {{there appears to be a}} strong non-additive genetic influence on risk of fatal outcome...|$|R
