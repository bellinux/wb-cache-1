40|$|Trust-management systems {{address the}} <b>authorization</b> problem <b>in</b> {{distributed}} systems by defining a formal language for expressing authorization and access-control policies, and relying on an algorithm {{to determine when}} a specific request can be granted. For <b>authorization</b> <b>in</b> distributed systems, trustmanagement systems offer several advantages over other approaches, such as support for delegation and making <b>authorization</b> decisions <b>in</b> a decentralized manner. This paper focuses on a popular trustmanagement system SPKI/SDSI. Although SPKI/SDSI is an attractive system for <b>authorization</b> <b>in</b> distributed systems, it has seen limited deployment. One of the major hurdles in deploying SPKI/SDSI {{is that it is}} PKI-based, i. e., every principal is required to have a public-private key pair. We present an approach that combines SPKI/SDSI with a widely-deployed authentication system, Kerberos, to reduce reliance of SPKI/SDSI on PKI. In our approach, only sites need public-private key pairs. We believe that reducing the reliance of SPKI/SDSI on PKI will facilitate its wider deployment. We also have implemented a prototype of our technique. ...|$|R
