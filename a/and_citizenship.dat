5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights <b>and</b> <b>citizenship</b> in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
