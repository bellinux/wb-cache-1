50|$|Like other realist {{philosophers}} of {{the period}} (such as Aquinas and Henry of Ghent) Scotus recognised the need for <b>an</b> intermediate <b>distinction</b> that was not merely conceptual but not fully real or mind-dependent either. Scotus argued for <b>a</b> formal <b>distinction</b> (distinctio formalis <b>a</b> parte rei), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality but whose definitions are not identical. For example, the personal properties of the Trinity are formally distinct from the Divine essence. Similarly, {{the distinction between the}} 'thisness' or haecceity of a thing is intermediate between a real and <b>a</b> conceptual <b>distinction.</b> There is also <b>a</b> formal <b>distinction</b> between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul.|$|R

Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still <b>a</b> <b>distinction.</b> Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E

5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E

Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).|$|E

While it is difficult to draw <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E
