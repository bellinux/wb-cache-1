5|$|A {{generally}} malevolent entity, the boobrie typically preys on livestock being transported on ships, {{but it is}} also fond of otters, {{of which}} it consumes a considerable number. In its manifestation as a water horse the creature is able to gallop <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of lochs as if on solid ground. During the summer months it is seen infrequently as a large insect, sucking the blood of horses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of {{the ravine}} from Cave 1 on the other Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which {{there is only one}} pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E
5|$|The terrier of {{this period}} was short of leg, built in a chunky fashion, and had a skull that was broad <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> Used in hunting packs and kept in kennels along with English Foxhounds, they were bred {{for their ability to}} drive the fox out of its den. Gradually the pace of the hunt became faster, and the terriers were bred with longer legs for more speed {{towards the end of the}} 18th century. However the {{increased}} size meant that the Fox Terrier became too big to be used for its original purpose, and its use in fox hunting began to decline.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, {{a total of five}} compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E

Variations on the exact design are plentiful; for example, the ribbons can be suspended either from a decorated knot, or held in the mouths of lions, or suspended <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of bucrania as in the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli.|$|R
5|$|Cupola furnace: American {{anthropologist}} Vincent C. Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the cupola furnace existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E
5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
60|$|They {{ran up the}} {{staysail}} and set the mizzen. Cayman leaped {{forward and}} the spray blew from her plunging bows. Her white wake trailed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> seas astern, and the water that bubbled through the scuppers crept up her lee deck. For all that, the captain was not satisfied and he looked to windward, knitting his brows.|$|R
5000|$|Circular in design, this {{royal blue}} patch is edged {{with a black}} border. The {{prominent}} feature is a lunging, silver, three-headed dog. Behind the dog are three red columns resting on a red pedestal. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> columns is a red lintel bearing the word [...] "Cerberus." [...] Silver bands edge the base and <b>the</b> <b>top</b> {{of each of the}} three columns. Behind the columns is a yellow fire accented with red.|$|R
5000|$|Resting on {{the columns}} is the entablature which {{itself can be}} split into three main parts. The architrave, the main {{spanning}} beam <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> pillars. Above the architrave is the frieze, the central patterned section. Then the cornice is the upper part which projects outwards. Finally, the pediments are the triangular facings {{at each end of}} the Monument. One of the pillars contains a spiral staircase to a walkway around <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> monument.|$|R
5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and leathery peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{can also}} be applied to all sides, {{including}} the vertical members, of a frame with mouldings around a door or window. The word architrave {{is also used to}} refer more generally to a style of mouldings (or other elements) framing <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of a door, window or other rectangular opening, where the horizontal [...] "head" [...] casing extends <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> vertical side casings where the elements join (creating a butt joint, as opposed to a miter joint).|$|R
50|$|Gutter guards (also called gutter covers, gutter {{protection}} or leaf guards) {{are primarily}} aimed at preventing damage caused from clogged gutters {{and reducing the}} need for regular gutter cleaning. They are a common add-on or included as an option for custom-built homes. Forms include wire mesh <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of guttering, lengths of spiked plastic, or reverse curves in the gutter design to catch water but not falling objects.|$|R

25|$|Severe winds squalls {{and heavy}} {{rainfall}} was recorded <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> End. Several trees were uprooted in Oenpelli which reported winds gusts {{in excess of}} 90km/h (56mph). Gusts near 90km/h (56mph) in Darwin overnight on 2 March brought down trees. Widespread flooding resulted in the Katherine, Daly and Victoria River regions. Water levels in the Katherine River came to within about 3metres (10ft) of those experienced in the 1998 floods but fortunately subsided without inundating the town. Rainfall <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> End, Victoria River region over a four-day period between 29 February to 4 March was between 200 and 400millimetres (8 to 16inches). Similar totals were recorded over four days in the Kimberley region. Numerous Northern Territory roads and highways were cut with many communities isolated.|$|E

25|$|Tetracycline use {{should be}} avoided in {{pregnant}} or lactating women, and in children with developing teeth because they may result in permanent staining (dark yellow-gray teeth with a darker horizontal band that goes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> and bottom rows of teeth), and possibly affect the growth of teeth and bones.|$|E
25|$|Horsemen in the Sassanid cavalry {{lacked a}} stirrup. Instead, {{they used a}} war saddle which had a cantle at the back and two guard clamps which curved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the rider's thighs. This allowed the {{horsemen}} {{to stay in the}} saddle at all times during the battle, especially during violent encounters.|$|E
