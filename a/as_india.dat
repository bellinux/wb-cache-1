5|$|Despite the {{downturn}} in his limited overs fortunes {{towards the end}} of the season, Kartik's form was enough to earn him selection in the Indian Board president's XI for the tour match against the visiting South Africans before the Tests. He had a match total of 2/122, which was enough for him to secure national selection, playing in both Tests against South Africa in early 2000 at Mumbai and Bangalore <b>as</b> <b>India</b> sought a second spinner to accompany Anil Kumble, after Harbhajan Singh's performance in the role in the previous season had been deemed inadequate. Kartik scored 14 before being bowled by Shaun Pollock <b>as</b> <b>India</b> batted first and made 225. He then took 2/28 from 18 overs as the Indians restricted the tourists to 176, before collapsing to be all out for 113 in the second innings, Kartik scoring only two before Pollock had him caught behind. Kartik took 1/50 in the second innings as South Africa ground their way to the target of 163 with four wickets in hand. In the Second Test, Kartik took 3/123 and scored a duck and two <b>as</b> <b>India</b> were crushed by an innings. Overall, Kartik performed steadily, taking six wickets at 33.50.|$|E
5|$|Despite these lean performances, Karthik was {{retained}} for the three-Test {{series at}} home to Pakistan in March. In a high-scoring draw in the First Test in Mohali, Karthik made only six <b>as</b> <b>India</b> amassed 516. Karthik then put on his best Test batting performance to this point, at Eden Gardens, Kolkata against Pakistan. India batted first and Karthik made a start and reached 28, before being run out. India made 407 and Pakistan almost broke even, replying with 393. In the second innings, Karthik scored, combining with Rahul Dravid in a 166-run partnership {{to set up a}} target of 422. This proved too much for the tourists on the deteriorating pitch and India won the match by 196 runs.

5|$|Despite these performances, Kartik was {{retained}} for the ODI tour of Pakistan with Harbhajan still injured, taking five wickets at 32.80 at {{an economy}} of 5.46. He played {{in three of}} the five matches and India won all of these. Kartik was also in the Test squad, but saw not action <b>as</b> <b>India</b> opted to field only Kumble and took the series 2–1.|$|E
5|$|He got {{a chance}} again in India's four match tour of West Indies where he {{replaced}} opener Sehwag, who was out with a shoulder injury. He scored 67, 4 and 47 as an opener which could help him claim a berth for the future, <b>as</b> <b>India</b> took the series 21.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} only one match against England at Lord's, where he got out after scoring one run. Despite {{dropping}} England captain Michael Vaughan from the bowling of Anil Kumble, he eventually stumped Vaughan down the legside and took another catch. He played another match in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy against Kenya, taking three catches <b>as</b> <b>India</b> persisted with Dravid's wicket-keeping {{for the majority of}} the English tour. Karthik was not required to bat <b>as</b> <b>India</b> only lost four wickets in their innings. He was subsequently replaced in the ODI team by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who took over the gloves from Dravid on a full-time basis; Karthik did not play another ODI until April 2006.|$|E

5|$|He showed further {{signs of}} {{returning}} to peak form in the Videocon Triangular Series in Zimbabwe, taking 10 wickets at 16.10 at an economy rate of 5.03 and scored 60 runs at 30.00 in four matches. This included a haul of 3/34 and then a score of 50 <b>as</b> <b>India</b> collapsed to 164 all out and a 51-run loss to New Zealand. In another match, he took his ODI career best of 5/27 against Zimbabwe in Harare as the hosts fell for 65. Despite his overall good form, Pathan was punished by the New Zealanders in the final, conceding 40 runs in five wicketless overs <b>as</b> <b>India</b> lost their second successive final. He was subsequently the leading wicket-taker <b>as</b> <b>India</b> took a 2–0 clean sweep of an away Test series against Zimbabwe. In the First Test in Bulawayo, Pathan took 5/58 and 4/53 as well as scoring 52 in {{a man of the}} match performance to help India to an innings victory. He followed this with a 7/59 haul, his Test career best innings haul, and 5/67 in the final Test in Harare, his second ten-wicket match haul to set up a ten wicket victory, having also scored 32 in the first innings. He was again named man of the match, and his 21 wickets at 11.29 runs saw him named man of the series.

5|$|Kartik {{started the}} 2004–05 season by scoring 56 and 16 and taking 2/42 and 2/49 as the Rest of India {{defeated}} Mumbai in the Irani Trophy, {{but it was}} not enough to prevent Harbhajan from resuming his position in the team for the home Test series against Australia. He got an opportunity in the Third Test in Nagpur, when Harbhajan was ill, taking 3/57 and 2/74 <b>as</b> <b>India</b> were 342 runs to lose their first home series to Australia since 1969–70. Kartik held his place when Harbhajan returned for the final Test in Mumbai <b>as</b> <b>India</b> fielded three spinners, and took 4/44 and 3/32 in a man of the match performance which saw India win by 13 runs. Both of these performances occurred under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid with Ganguly injured, in which Kartik netted his wickets at an average of 17.50 compared to 51.08 under Ganguly's leadership. Kartik played the last of his eight Tests in a subsequent opening match against South Africa in Kanpur, taking a total of 2/93 under Ganguly's command, being dropped after India chose to only use two spinners in subsequent matches. Kartik spent the next month watching from the sidelines as the reserve slow bowler, as only Kumble and Harbhajan played during the tour of Bangladesh. During this campaign, he was allowed to play in the second ODI, taking 2/43 <b>as</b> <b>India</b> lost to Bangladesh for the first time. Kartik returned to India and took seven wickets at 35.42 at an economy rate of 4.69 in the zonal one-dayers and Challenger Trophy, and then played four first-class matches to end the season, taking 10 wickets at 19.10. At the end of the season, he took 2/54 in a home ODI against Pakistan, who scored 7/319 to overhaul the target.|$|E
5|$|Pathan {{made his}} name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh. Swinging the ball both ways, Pathan took 5/45 and 6/51 {{including}} several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award <b>as</b> <b>India</b> claimed a commanding innings victory. He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series. India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, Pathan managed only five and four. He played in {{only one of the}} three ODIs against the hosts <b>as</b> <b>India</b> rotated their players, taking 1/45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win.|$|E

Pathan was then limited to sporadic ODI appearances on the late-2006 tour to South Africa. Playing in three of the five matches, he took a solitary wicket at 136.00, conceding 7.15 runs per over, the only bright spot being an unbeaten 47 <b>as</b> <b>India</b> were skittled for 163 in one match; they were whitewashed by the hosts.|$|E
