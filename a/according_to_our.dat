5|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> {{surviving}} narratives, {{the three}} kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a centurial army based on socio-economic class. This reformation is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, {{the second of}} the Etruscan kings. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens. Livy tells us that Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life {{as a result of this}} census. At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be a civic responsibility and a way of advancing one's status within society.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E

5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E

25|$|For the {{purposes}} of this definition it is irrelevant how the operations came to satisfy the laws, whether by fiat or proof. All concrete Boolean algebras satisfy the laws (by proof rather than fiat), whence every concrete Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> definitions. This axiomatic definition of a Boolean algebra as a set and certain operations satisfying certain laws or axioms by fiat is entirely analogous to the abstract definitions of group, ring, field etc. characteristic of modern or abstract algebra.|$|E
25|$|Although every {{concrete}} Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra, {{not every}} Boolean algebra need be concrete. Let n be a square-free positive integer, one not divisible by {{the square of}} an integer, for example 30 but not 12. The operations of greatest common divisor, least common multiple, and division into n (that is, ¬x = n/x), can be shown to satisfy all the Boolean laws when their arguments range over the positive divisors of n. Hence those divisors form a Boolean algebra. These divisors are not subsets of a set, making the divisors of n a Boolean algebra that is not concrete <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> definitions.|$|E

25|$|According to the X-Chromosome SNP analyses, {{the authors}} {{reported}} a high genetic homogeneity between berbers and Arabs in NW Africa, so {{they suggested that}} the Arabisation of this area was a cultural phenomenon, which did not imply a replacement of the ancestry population. Our results give support the hypothesis of an early settlement of northwest Africa. The original berber population seem to have received a low genetic influx from the surrounding areas. Different hypothesis have been suggested to explain the genetic differentiation of the Moroccan population. An initial genetic drift could have caused differences in allele frequency distribution {{that have not been}} re-established due to a certain level of geographic isolation. The Strait of Gibraltar has been described by several authors as an important genetic barrier. Even a certain level of genetic exchange probably occurred between NW Africa and the South of the Iberian Peninsula, sharp frequency changes have been described in this area. Also the Sahara desert has been suggested as responsible of the genetic isolation of NW African populations from Sub-Saharan populations. There is no consensus {{about the impact of the}} Neolithic demic diffusion in the Mediterranean area. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> results, a low impact of the Neolithic expansions and/or later migration events on NW African populations would have occurred.|$|E

500|$|The cantata {{is part of}} Bach's first cantata cycle, {{which he}} began when he took up office as Thomaskantor in May 1723. The topic {{is based on the}} {{prescribed}} reading from the gospel of Luke, Jesus announcing the destruction of Jerusalem and cleansing of the Temple. The librettist is unknown. The cantata is structured in six movements: two choral movements frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. The opening movement is based on a verse from the Book of Lamentations, a lament of the destructed Jerusalem, related to the announcement from the gospel. The text moves from reflecting God's wrath in the past to the situation of the contemporary Christian. The closing chorale, a stanza from Johann Matthäus Meyfart's hymn [...] "", is a prayer culminating in the thought [...] "do not repay us <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> sins".|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} the novella {{is that of a}} multigenerational voyage from Earth to a planet {{potentially}} habitable by humans.

In describing the {{setting of the}} story in her introduction to [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] in 2002, Le Guin described its universe as a frequently used one: [...] "the generic, shared, science fiction ‘future.’ In this version of it, Earth sends forth ships to the stars at speeds that are, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> present knowledge, more or less realistic, at least potentially attainable." [...] Le Guin identified Molly Gloss's novel The Dazzle of Day and Harry Martinson’s poem [...] "Aniara" [...] as exemplifying this future. Though occasionally described as such, the story {{is not part of the}} Hainish Cycle. The title is an allusion to John Milton's poem Paradise Lost.|$|E
500|$|Following Allen's {{failed attempt}} on St. John, {{many of his}} men drifted away, presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm.

Congress, for its part, at first not really wanting any part of the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts.

They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec. Allen, in one instance, wrote that [...] "I will lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, I will take Montreal". Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.|$|E
