40|$|Graduation date: 1992 With rapidly rising {{health care}} expenditures, health care cost {{containment}} {{has become a}} major issue facing this nation. A phenomenal growth in worksite health promotion has occurred with the recognition that these programs have the potential to reduce these costs. However, to be effective as a cost containment strategy, health promotion programs must successfully attract participants, particularly those whose health is most at-risk. Due to limited research on issues of participation, {{there is a need to}} investigate the characteristics of individuals attracted to worksite health promotion programs and the factors that influence their participation. The purpose of this study was to explore the characterization of participants and nonparticipants and to examine the factors that influence participation in health promotion programs. A self-selected participant group (n= 173) was compared to a nonparticipant group (n = 146) with respect to sociodemographic characteristics, health care costs, health status, and health risk behaviors. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from the employer's records and from a questionnaire designed to address specific components of the program. Results indicated that management/administrative staff were more likely to participate in the health promotion program than were classified or faculty staff. For the period of the survey, participants were also more likely to be nonsmokers and were less likely to be injured on-the-job during one of the survey years. The workers' compensation claims costs for nonparticipants were significantly higher in one survey year and over the two-year <b>average</b> <b>period</b> <b>considered.</b> However, the nonparticipant claims were strongly influenced by one costly claim in 1988. The two groups did not differ when the absenteeism data from the employer's records were analyzed. In addition, it was found that subjects with the highest levels of participation also had the fewest number of children living in the household. Time constraints as a result of job schedule, work/activity load, and meeting times of the activities were the most important factors limiting participation in the program. Further research is needed to assess program effectiveness and program impact upon employee health and health care costs. The analysis should be conducted over a longer period of time and comparisons should be made within as well as between groups...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of small-scale variability of raindrop size distributions (DSDs) {{has been carried out}} at Wallops Island, Virginia. Three Joss-Waldvogel disdrometers were operated at a distance of 0. 65, 1. 05, and 1. 70 km in a nearly straight line. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the variability of DSDs and its integral parameters of liquid water content, rainfall, and reflectivity within a 2 -km array: a typical size of Cartesian radar pixel. The composite DSD of rain events showed very good agreement among the disdrometers except where there were noticeable differences in midsize and large drops in a few events. For consideration of partial beam filling where the radar pixel was not completely covered by rain, a single disdrometer reported just over 10 % more rainy minutes than the rainy minutes when all three disdrometers reported rainfall. Similarly two out of three disdrometers reported 5 %more rainy minutes than when all three were reporting rainfall. These percentages were based on a 1 -min average, and were less for longer <b>averaging</b> <b>periods.</b> <b>Considering</b> only the minutes when all three disdrometers were reporting rainfall, just over one quarter of the observations showed an increase in the difference in rainfall with distance. This finding was based on a 15 -min average and was even less for shorter <b>averaging</b> <b>periods.</b> The probability and cumulative distributions of a gamma-fitted DSD and integral rain parameters between the three disdrometers had a very good agreement and no major variability. This was mainly due to the high percentage of light stratiform rain and to the number of storms that traveled along the track of the disdrometers. At a fixed time step, however, both DSDs and integral rain parameters showed substantial variability. The standard deviation (SD) of rain rate was near 3 mm/h, while the SD of reflectivity exceeded 3 dBZ at the longest separation distance. These standard deviations were at 6 -min average and were higher at shorter <b>averaging</b> <b>periods.</b> The correlations decreased with increasing separation distance. For rain rate, the correlations were higher than previous gauge-based studies. This was attributed to the differences in data processing and the difference in rainfall characteristics in different climate regions. It was also considered that the gauge sampling errors could be a factor. In this regard, gauge measurements were simulated employing existing disdrometer dataset. While a difference was noticed in cumulative distribution of rain occurrence between the simulated gauge and disdrometer observations, the correlations in simulated gauge measurements did not differ from the disdrometer measurements...|$|R

To get believable fluxes, it is necessary to correct the observations based on the different surface conditions and to determine relevant techinical parameters. The raw 10 Hz eddy covariance data observed in the Yucheng and Changbai Mountains stations were recalculated by various <b>averaging</b> <b>periods</b> (from 1 to 720 min) respectively, and the recalculated results were compared with the results calculated by the <b>averaging</b> <b>period</b> of 30 mins. Meanwhile, the distinctions of fluxes calculated by different <b>averaging</b> <b>periods</b> were analyzed. The continuous 15 days observations over wheat fields in the Yucheng station were mainly analyzed. The results are shown that: (i) In the Yucheng station, compared with the observations by 30 min, when the <b>averaging</b> <b>period</b> changes from 10 to 60 min, the variations of the eddy-covariance estimates of fluxes were less than 2 %; when the <b>averaging</b> <b>period</b> changes less than 10 min, the estimate of fluxes reduced obviously with the reduction of the <b>averaging</b> <b>period</b> (the max relative error was - 12 %); and when the <b>averaging</b> <b>period</b> exceeds 120 min, the eddy covariance estimates of fluxes will be increased and become unsteady (the max relative error is over 10 %); (ii) the eddy covariance estimates of fluxes over wheat field in the Yucheng station suggusted that it is much better to take 10 min as an <b>averaging</b> <b>period</b> in studying diurnal change of fluxes, and take 30 min for a long-term flux observation; and (iii) normalized ratio was put forward to determine the range of <b>averaging</b> <b>period</b> of eddy covariance measurements.

40|$|The {{logic of}} this paper is based on a {{modernisation}} of Austrian capital theory as applied to a closed economy growing in a steady state. Here the philosophy is this: capital is time embodied in produced goods. In steady states, this philosophy works well as an aggregation device for an arbitrary number of distinct produced goods. The basic theorem of this approach (Section VII) is this: in a capital market equilibrium without public debt and hence in a general equilibrium without public debt the <b>average</b> <b>period</b> of production equals the <b>average</b> waiting <b>period</b> of households. Calibration of the parameters of the production sector and the consumption sector then leads to the result that the equilibrium risk free real rate of interest (Wicksell´s "natural rate of interest") is negative for the OECD+China area. What distinguishes the twenty-first century from earlier times is the high life expectancy of people and the ensuing extensive <b>average</b> pension <b>period.</b> These characteristics are responsible for the high <b>average</b> waiting <b>period.</b> Only with a negative real rate of interest can the <b>average</b> <b>period</b> of production catch up with the high <b>average</b> waiting <b>period.</b> Under price stability the risk free real rate of interest cannot become negative. Public debt causes the equilibrium risk free rate of interest to rise: the public debt <b>period</b> () plus the <b>average</b> <b>period</b> of production (DT) equal the <b>average</b> waiting <b>period</b> (Z). Thus substantial public debt is required for the goal of price stability. We thus come to a different view of public debt: it is inconsistent with the goal of a zero public debt. This different view of public debt (even apart from "Keynesian" considerations) has been introduced by Samuelson already in the year 1958. My "Austrian" capital theoretic approach allows me to show that it is the relevant view for the 21 st century. ...|$|R
