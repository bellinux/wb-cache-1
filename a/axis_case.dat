5|$|The German–Yugoslav Partisan {{negotiations}} were held between German {{commanders in the}} Independent State of Croatia and the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisans in March 1943 during World War II. The negotiations – focused on obtaining a ceasefire and establishing a prisoner exchange – were conducted during the <b>Axis</b> <b>Case</b> White offensive. They were used by the Partisans to delay the Axis forces while the Partisans crossed the Neretva river, and to allow the Partisans to focus on attacking their Chetnik rivals led by Draža Mihailović. The {{negotiations were}} accompanied by an informal ceasefire that lasted about six weeks before being called off on orders from Adolf Hitler. The short-term advantage gained by the Partisans through the negotiations was lost when the <b>Axis</b> <b>Case</b> Black offensive was launched in mid-May 1943. Prisoner exchanges, which had been occurring between the Germans and Partisans for some months prior, re-commenced in late 1943 and continued {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|From 20 January 1943, the Partisans {{had been}} hard-pressed by the <b>Axis</b> <b>Case</b> White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in {{negotiations}} to gain time {{to cross the}} Neretva river. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation {{at this stage of}} Case White, and their need to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded that at this critical period, Tito was also concerned {{that by the end of}} the war the attrition to his Partisan forces would be such that Mihailović's Chetniks would be more powerful. They suggest that Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks.|$|E

A 79 -year-old woman with significant pulmonary comorbidity presented with a ruptured mycotic TAAA extending to the celiac axis. The aneurysm was excluded with a stent-graft soaked in rifampicin and deployed to deliberately occlude the celiac axis for effective distal sealing and fixation.

40|$|Introduction The use of topical {{corticosteroids}} {{in children}} and adults, especially in covered areas and for a prolonged duration, may result in Cushing’s syndrome and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal <b>axis.</b> <b>Case</b> Presentation The present report describes the cases of three children and a 25 -year-old man who presented with clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal insufficiency following prolonged use of clobetasol cream. Two of the children continued with hypertension even after discontinuation of clobetasol, and were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. One of these two children had developed acute renal failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, and permanent visual loss prior to admission. Conclusions Whenever a cushingoid appearance is accompanied by adrenal insufficiency, the exogenous use of steroids, especially topical creams, should be explored. Hypertension may persist even after cessation of use and may result in life threatening complications...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of orbital patterns in ferromagnetic layered ruthenates due to the competition of Coulomb interactions, compressive c axis and orthorhombic distortions {{in the presence of}} a polarizing orbital field coupled to the angular momentum. By means of the exact diagonalization on a 2 x 2 cluster and a cluster embedded analysis where inter-plaquette interaction is treated on mean field level, we determine the ground-state phase diagram. Specifically, we demonstrate that, via the activation of two or three of t_ 2 g local orbital configurations, an external field applied along different symmetry directions can lead to inequivalent orbital correlated states. Starting from an antiferro-orbital pattern, for the easy <b>axis</b> <b>case</b> an orbital ordered phase is induced, having strong next nearest neighbors ferro-orbital correlations. Otherwise, a field applied along the hard axis leads a reduction of local orbital moment in a way to suppress the orbital order. Comment: 11 page...|$|E

40|$|This {{proposal}} discusses a new nonlinear, nonparametric {{method for}} off-line modeling and on-line {{estimation of the}} deformation of a flexible structure undergoing rapid retargeting maneuvers. In these circumstances, the structural stiffness and damping coefficients depend on the angular acceleration omega(dot), the angular rate omega, and {{the square of the}} angular rate omega. In the single <b>axis</b> <b>case,</b> the excitation of the structure is represented by the vector u(exp T) = (omega(dot), omega(exp 2), 2 (omega)), to which the structural dynamics responds as a 'bilinear' (i. e., parametrically excited) system. A similar technique for multiaxial rotations yields a bilinear model with respect to matrix valued excitations. Three methods of estimation and modeling are described in this proposal to achieve deformation state determination: (1) a method based on a feedback linearized procedure which gives an estimate of the state by means of observers installed in the deformable body; (2) off-line modeling of the deformation state of the structure by means of topological interpolators; and (3) an on-line structural state estimation method based on {{a combination of the two}} previous techniques...|$|E
