30|$|Bamboo grows quickly, and it {{will grow}} into useful timber in a short time. So it becomes the most {{important}} resources that get {{a wide range of}} applications in industry. A large number of residues were produced in the process of bamboo timbers. According to the statistical analysis [1 – 6], bamboo utilization rate usually < 40  % in the process of bamboo floor, bamboo plywood, bamboo mat and so on. Therefore, more than 60  % of the bamboo in processing becomes residues. However, only a subsection of the residues are utilized, and the majority are burnt or discarded. Apart from wasting resource, it seriously pollutes the environment. Consequently, to make full use of resource, it is necessary to find a new method that can utilize the bamboo processing residues efficiently. Preparing activated carbons from bamboo is <b>a</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> utilize bamboo timbers efficiently and a direction for the industrial application of bamboo [7]. Also, the activated carbons were provided with the better porosity structure and the higher adsorption capacity for the toxic inorganic ion [8] from water.|$|R

I want to see in what way fiction is involved and why the teachers choose <b>to</b> work the <b>way</b> they are with fiction. I also want {{to see what kind of}} effects this work could have on the development of the pupils. I've done interviews with four teachers to find out about their opinions when it comes to involve fiction into the education. The teachers are all working with pupils between nine and eleven years old. All of the teachers had daily work with silent reading, and the teachers also were reading out loud every day. Reflecting and discussing the books together were very common in the four classrooms. This is giving the pupils empathy and understanding of the world around them. Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> work with fiction is to use it in different kinds of themes. This is <b>a</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> integrate subjects with each other and this work also gives the pupils space to control the education a bit for themselves. All of the teachers used fiction in subjects like geography and history, but the use of fiction was most common in the subject Swedish and certainly with reading. The reason why the teachers worked with fiction in education seemed to be that the all had a big interest in fiction themselves and that they wanted to transmit that feeling to the pupils. Working with fiction can be a great <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make the learning joyful and we can use it I many ways. It's just our own creativity that makes the boundaries...|$|R

In this project we sought to gain fundamental knowledge that is vital to computing phase behavior, and modeling and designing processes using CO 2 to separate organics and metal compounds from DOE mixed wastes. Our overall program was a comprehensive one to measure, model and compute the solubility of metal chelate complexes in supercritical CO 2 and CO 2 /cosolvent mixtures. One aspect of this work was the measurement of local solvation of metal chelates using UV-visible spectroscopy, which provided information on the solution microstructure. We also focused on the measurement of the solubility of met al chelates in supercritical CO 2 and CO 2 /cosolvent mixtures, as well as the phase behavior of the chelating agents themselves in CO 2. The purpose of these measurements was to provide information with which we could evaluate and develop thermodynamic models of the solubility behavior. Finally, we focused on the implementation of a more reliable computational technique, based on interval mathematics, to compute the phase equilibria using the thermodynamic models. These studies were undertaken because fundamental information about metal chelate solubility in supercritical CO 2 is important in the design of processes using CO 2 to extract components from mixed wastes and in determining the optimum operating conditions...|$|R

The overall program is a comprehensive one to measure local solvation of metal chelates and to determine metal chelate stability in supercritical fluid mixtures using UV-vis and FTIR spectroscopy. The spectroscopic studies provide information on the solution microstructure, which they are using in concert with their own and published solubility data to evaluate and develop thermodynamic models of the solubility behavior. Finally, they are implementing a more reliable computational technique, based on interval mathematics, to compute the phase equilibria using the thermodynamic modeIs.

However, fusion performance tends to easily overfit the hillclimb set used to learn fusion rules. In this paper, we perform fusion learning for multimedia streams using a greedy performance driven algorithm. In our fusion learning paradigm, fused output is a linear combination of multiple classifiers or ranked streams. The algorithm is inspired from Ensemble Learning [2] but takes that idea further for improving generalization capability. A key application of our fusion learning algorithm, described in this work, is semantics reinforcement using an ensemble of classifiers built using the same training dataset but groundtruth corresponding to different concepts.
