Whilst social pressures {{are evident in the}} push to more effectively utilise existing building stock, new building stock also has to meet the commercial requirements of the client, which often translates into maximum occupancy of the building. This is encouraging greater innovation in the design of new buildings to allow change of use throughout the structure’s lifetime. This paper describes the concepts surrounding an adaptable design for new buildings, along with a review of factors influencing the mode of use.

This evaluation process should take into account all costs, benefits and performance associated with a facility in its through life cycle. There {{are a number of}} techniques available for economic evaluation, however, the practical application is poor in most of the techniques. Whole Life Analysis (WLA) is identified as a comprehensive approach for economic evaluation. At present there is a growing trend towards designing buildings to be more adaptable within the UK property market. Hence, economic evaluation of <b>adaptable</b> <b>buildings</b> needs to be undertaken as early as possible for appropriate long term decisions.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the ability of “adaptable buildings” to respond to future {{potential}} built environment changes in sustainable way. Design/methodology/approach – A detailed literature review and a case study were undertaken to identify the life cycle changes of typical buildings over a period of more than 100 years. In total, 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted among construction industry professionals to identify how <b>adaptable</b> <b>buildings</b> enhance sustainability within the built environment. Case study data were analysed through a Morphological Analysis, and the interview data were analysed through discourse analysis. Findings – Out of the many adaptable features, the results revealed “change of use” as the dominant trend within the buildings of the selected urban cluster. More than 60 per cent of buildings have changed their original use during their life cycle. Around 10 per cent of them have changed their use frequently (every six year) during the last 20 years thereby signalling an increase in the rate of change. The positive contribution of <b>adaptable</b> <b>buildings</b> in achieving sustainability in terms of economic, social and environmental considerations, were confirmed through the analysis of semi-structured interviews. Originality/value – This paper reports a longitudinal study spanning over 100 years, exploring the extent of building adaptation within a selected cluster of Liverpool city centre, UK. The study further confirms the need to incorporate adaptability as a key criterion when designing buildings. The increased rate at which “change of use” has occurred further reinforces the need. Lack of a track record of designing for reuse makes this an interesting challenge for the construction industry, hence likely to have significant implications for policy/strategy formulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{building}} {{stock in the}} Netherlands is seriously out of balance, because {{the quality of the}} supplied stock does not satisfy the ever growing demand of users. Flexible use and transformation capacity are a possible solution to create buildings that can adapt to changing user requirements. A building can be divided into a hierarchy of layers: structure, envelope, services and infill. To provide a maximum of possibilities during the lifespan of a building, flexibility needs to be implemented in all layers, by applying building products which are developed for adaptability. However, {{this is not the case}} in the existing strategies for flexible design, where, generally, only the infill is considered to be adaptable. This research project questions flexibility-in-use provided by overcapacity in the structure, because it results in excessive use of resources while the extra capacity may remain unused during the lifespan of the building. Contrary to the building sector, in the industrial product development, it is common practice to apply changes to products and product platforms based on the user requirements. Therefore, in order to improve flexible use of building, we firstly need to research to what extent the user actually desires flexibility. This research project will show the relation between functional requirements and technical qualities and how this relation has been structured. The process of structuring the functional requirements and technical qualities is significant for adaptability performances of building elements. The same also holds for the aforementioned building layers. To find out whether this approach is satisfactory, a method has been developed to analyze the effect that an <b>adaptable</b> <b>building</b> element has on changing user requirements with regard to its spatial and functional demands. In addition, to research the practicability of this approach, an adaptable column will be developed through a predefined product development trajectory. The combination of both tracks will result in a design methodology for <b>adaptable</b> <b>building</b> elements and a solution for long term flexibility of the building structure. If effective, it may well bring new insights to integrated design strategies for flexibility and transformation...|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] that facilities managers can viably utilize building services components that have been designed to be more readily reused to satisfy growing client demands for <b>adaptable</b> <b>buildings.</b> In an increasingly dynamic business environment, many organizations seeking to remain competitive have focused on performing their core function in the short-term by shedding, among other functions, responsibility for their supporting buildings to external organizations. The growth of the facilities management support industry illustrates this trend. The increasing contribution of services installations to building complexity and value means that the greatest opportunity for facilities managers to improve their efficiency in satisfying constantly changing client space use demands lies in their management of this building element. By utilizing reusable services components, facilities managers may be able to increase the adaptability of both new and existing buildings and reduce the financial impact of change. It is concluded that a new industrial sector may emerge to support services component reuse. This sector will undertake the remanufacture (reconditioning) of such component to ensure their fitness for purpose for reuse...|$|R

40|$|Built {{environment}} comprises of {{a multitude}} of complex networks of buildings and processes in and between buildings. The paper looks at resilience design on three different levels: the building, the site, and the region. The building resilience design is studied using multi-objective optimization of a recently completed Passivhaus retrofit, under four different climate years: current, 2030, 2050, and 2080. The site resilience design is studied {{on the basis of}} a balance between incoming solar radiation and evaporative cooling from transpiration of plants to mitigate heat island effect. The regional resilience design is studied using a network model, taking into account connectivity, information capacity, and the ability to reconfigure. A common denominator found between these three aspects is a degree of system redundancy. Thus, a provision for <b>adaptable</b> <b>building</b> thermal insulation, a provision for adaptable green areas, and a provision for adaptable connectivity are the ingredients for resilient designs on these three respective levels.

40|$|Supported through {{technological}} advances, {{the concept}} of kinetic architecture is internationally increasingly acknowledged in the past years {{in the development of}} <b>adaptable</b> <b>buildings</b> as to differing functional requirements, or external loading conditions. Most decisive factor is the structure in terms of materials and geometrical configurations, and the control system integrated within. Based on general principles of tensegrity structures, a hybrid system has been developed that consists of continuous hinge connected compression members, strengthened by an internal system of struts and continuous cable diagonals with closed loop. The kinetic mechanism is achieved through alteration of the cables length and the respective relative inclination of any adjacent compression members. In this way the transformability of the system arises primarily from the inherent integrative composition and dual capabilities of its members. Following the construction design of the prototype structure, the interactive development, as regards geometric properties and structural configurations, is presented analytically, as based on a parametric-associative design approach applied. Along this line, the specific syntax of structural development and simulation through parametric design is suggested to support in real terms the control design of the innovative structure in an integrated interactive context...|$|R

As such, the role of the practice environment and culture in shaping design innovation is often downplayed in comparison to the designer's agency which is usually given primacy over other influences.

40|$|Many {{buildings}} {{around the}} world have undergone successive changes over their life cycles. Regardless of the type or size of a building there are usually requirements for change due to several unanticipated forces and emerging uncertainties that act upon them. These changes might be in the buildingis spatial, structural or service systems. This can be due to changes in the needs of occupants, the market demand or technological advances. Although buildings undergo change, current design practice does not address this and buildings are still designed as if they will remain static. This paper proposes an <b>Adaptable</b> <b>Buildings</b> Design (ABD) Framework {{to address the issue of}} adaptability in building design. Using this methodology uncertainties and future changes are first identified. To increase the buildingis longevity, flexibility options are embedded and design rules are formulated to trigger these options when necessary. The value of adaptability is then assessed by implementing several simulations using Real Options Analysis (ROA). To demonstrate the approach, the ABD is applied to a multi-use commercial building case study. Flexibility is embedded in the buildingis design across several systems allowing it to change and evolve over time based on a set of design rules. The buildings adaptability is then assessed using ROA. Positive results demonstrate the strength of the proposed methodology in addressing future change and uncertaintie...|$|R

However, although several assessment methods have been studied to quantifythe future value of buildings, more cases are needed to illustrate their usefulness. Commissioned by theVrijeUniversiteit Brussel's administration we studied the feasibility of the transformation of 352 student residences that have become obsolete. In order to compose a thorough advice, architectural explorations and life cycle assessments have been conducted. This paper reports on the result of Life Cycle Costingon this case in particular. Through Life Cycle Costing, the initial costs of distinct transformation strategies, conventional as well as adaptable, were put in a long term perspective. By combining assessments at element and building level,it was possible to detect the particular value of the residences’ load bearing structure and the conditions under which <b>adaptable</b> <b>building</b> can increase that value. These findings allowed us to formulate straightforward advises in an early project stage. They are useful to both the university's administration and the architectural designers that will be commissioned.

Annotation systems often sharesimilar functionality that can potentially be factored into reusablecomponents with the goal to speed up the creation of new annotationsystems. At the same time, however, VR-centered annotationsystems are not only subject to application-specific requirements,but also to those arising from differences between the various VRplatforms, like desktop VR setups or CAVEs.

Purpose Despite being a common {{term in the}} literature, there is little {{agreement}} about what the word ‘adaptability’ means {{in the context of}} the built environment and very little evidence regarding practitioners’ understanding of adaptability. This paper therefore examines what practitioners in the building industry mean when they talk about ‘adaptability’.

The interview transcripts were coded inductively in order to identify themes in the qualitative data. Findings The interview data revealed a wide range of perspectives on adaptability, particularly regarding terminology, the meanings practitioners associate with adaptability and the way in which these meanings are communicated to others in the industry. The applied meaning of adaptability varied depending on context.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{definitive}} version is freely available at: [URL] concerns regarding the increasing contribution of services installations to total project cost have highlighted {{the need to}} develop new methods of designing, procuring, constructing, utilising and disposing of services components. Additionally, the shift in operational focus of many industrial sectors towards short term requirements for built space to perform a particular function requires a new approach to the recovery of services components. The UK national health service is illustrative of a construction industry client whose operational need, in terms of supporting built estate, can be met with utilisation of reusable services components. The varied influences on the manner by which healthcare services are provided necessitate a short term approach to functional space provision and therefore frequency of change in the services requirements of internal space. Packaged reusable services components reduce the cost of services installation adaptation through recovery of residual un-depreciated capital and un-utilised physical life embodied in the functionally redundant components recovered from applications of short term duration.

Physical, functional, technological, economical, social and legal obsolescence are the principal factors driving the decommissioning, refurbishment, alteration and/or adaptation of a building. In the UK the Government promotes optimum use of the existing building stock through mixed use in urban centers and encourages conversion of redundant office and retail space into leisure, service and/or residential uses rather than demolition and renewal. There is therefore a growing need to design new <b>buildings</b> that are <b>adaptable</b> and flexible over their life span whilst at the same time improving user satisfaction. A constraint to the implementation of a policy of life span adaptability is the difficulty of understanding the economic considerations over long time scales. This paper investigates the issues surrounding the economics of the life span of <b>adaptable</b> <b>buildings,</b> and establishes a conceptual framework for their economic sustainability. The investigation is based on a case study of how the uses and function of the built environment and its supporting infrastructure have changed over a period of 100 years undertaken within a semi-rural Borough in England, UK. This case study includes a trend analysis identifying the life spans (of buildings), the evolving planning policies and associated social and cultural issues. A conceptual framework is developed and the economic impacts of the changes are evaluated through Whole Life Analysis. The validity and reliability of proposed framework is yet to be tested...|$|R
