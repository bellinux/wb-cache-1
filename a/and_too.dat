5|$|All these {{attempts}} {{to mount a}} combined offensive between the Franks and Mongols were too little <b>and</b> <b>too</b> late. In May 1291, the city of Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre. When Pope Nicholas IV learned of this, he wrote to Arghun, again asking him to be baptized and {{to fight against the}} Mamluks. But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E
5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic {{to be a good}} conductor <b>and</b> <b>too</b> impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described him as a man of great musical ability.|$|E
5|$|Forster's {{attitude}} {{brought him}} into conflict {{with the people of}} the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in his dealings with Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> insignificant politically and ignored while in France.|$|E
5000|$|Neshat was {{launched}} by Hamid Reza Jalaipour in February 1998 [...] after two other reformist papers, Jamee <b>and</b> <b>Toos,</b> were closed down. In addition, {{it was the}} successor of the latter. Neshat was based in Tehran. Latif Safari was the publisher {{and director of the}} daily. Mashallah Shamsolvaezin served as the editor-in-chief of the paper. Most of the editors were those who had written for Jamee <b>and</b> <b>Toos</b> newspapers.|$|R

5|$|However, {{some members}} of the Indian freedom {{struggle}} such as Nehru felt that Sastri was too sympathetic to the British rulers, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> co-operative with them. This was especially apparent at the Round table conferences where Sastri and his party member agreed to the unfair proposals of the British.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Fox {{cast her}} in two {{independent}} gangster films filmed in the United Kingdom: The Challenge <b>and</b> <b>Too</b> Hot to Handle. Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. Too Hot to Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and The Challenge in 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to a scene in Too Hot to Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her nipples, appeared nearly nude.|$|E
5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured <b>and</b> <b>too</b> few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay and straw.|$|E

5|$|One of Euler's {{more unusual}} {{interests}} was {{the application of}} mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the Tentamen novae theoriae musicae, hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians <b>and</b> <b>too</b> musical for mathematicians.|$|E
5|$|Out of sympathy, Gian Gastone befriended his unhappy sister-in-law, Duchess Violante Beatrice of Bavaria. Her husband, Grand Prince Ferdinando, {{thought her}} too ugly <b>and</b> <b>too</b> dull for him. At the same time, Gian Gastone sank {{into a state}} of melancholy. In an attempt to rouse him from this condition, Cardinal Francesco Maria often summoned Gian Gastone to festivities at his villa, Lappeggi. However, these soirées had no effect and Gian Gastone {{continued}} to weep unceasingly in his private rooms.|$|E

5|$|Sylvester James {{was born}} on September 6, 1947 in the Watts {{district}} of Los Angeles, California, into a middle-class family. His mother, Letha Weaver, had been raised near Palestine, Arkansas into a relatively wealthy African-American family who owned their own farmland. Letha's biological mother, Gertha Weaver, was unmarried <b>and</b> <b>too</b> sickly {{to care for her}} child, so Gertha's sister Julia, known to the family as JuJu, became Letha's adoptive mother. In the late 1930s, Julia and her husband took part in the Great Migration of African-Americans out of the Southern United States, relocating to Watts.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog was {{developed}} {{for its ability to}} encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs <b>and</b> <b>too</b> stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.|$|E
5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E

5|$|The War Office and the Army were concluding, at this point, {{that light}} tanks were a {{liability}} <b>and</b> <b>too</b> vulnerable {{for use in}} further combat, and the Tetrarch {{was considered to be}} obsolete. This decision may have marked the end for the Tetrarch in active service; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of coon hunting is sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, {{the animals are}} both climbers by nature, and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being too easy to hunt <b>and</b> <b>too</b> greasy to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{original}} ages was also a problem, as the rate of Kula-Farallon spreading over that time would produce a chain of seamounts much longer than observed, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> {{far away from the}} continent to explain the continentally derived sediments. This objection is attenuated somewhat in that the newer ages show a smaller range of ages.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{previous}} L7 albums, Slap-Happy {{features more}} varied and slower-paced songs, {{some of which}} borrowing elements from other genres like hip hop. Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews from music critics and suffered dismal sales {{partly due to the}} poor distribution and support by Bong Load. Some critics found the album predictable <b>and</b> <b>too</b> similar to previous L7 albums, but others highlighted certain songs for their nifty musical style.|$|E
5|$|Violante Beatrice of Bavaria (Violante Beatrix; 23 January 167330 May 1731) was Grand Princess of Tuscany as {{the wife}} of Grand Prince Ferdinando of Tuscany and Governor of Siena from 1717 until her death. Born a Duchess of Bavaria, the {{youngest}} child of Elector Ferdinand Maria, she married {{the heir to the}} Tuscan throne, Ferdinando de' Medici, in 1689.
