The first relevant text following, in chronological order, is a policy of valuation in 1517 of Bianca, his wife, which states she is already a widow.

Dingle was unable to play due to injury, missing a game that went against the odds.|$|E
5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>later</b> at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} in 1947, García Márquez {{stayed in}} Bogotá to study {{law at the}} Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he had a special dedication to reading. La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka «in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges» was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited {{with the idea of}} writing, not traditional literature, but a style similar to his grandfather's stories, in which «they inserted extraordinary events and anomalies as if they were simply an aspect of everyday life». His desire to be a writer grew. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> he published his first, La tercera resignación, which appeared in the September 13th, 1947 edition of the newspaper El Espectador.|$|E

5|$|As Aldenham {{was making}} a turn at a {{position}} north of the islet of Škrda, to sail between islands of Planik and Olib, she hit a mine that exploded under her engine room. The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly, followed by her stern <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> at 15:29. Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by Atherton and accompanying motor launches ML 238 and HDML 1162, and only 58 seamen and five officers, including Farrant, were {{pulled out of the}} sea. 126 crewmen died, as well as a wounded Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan liaison officer, Colonel Ivan Preradović. Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
5|$|In all 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were {{distributed}} {{of which the}} great majority were installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>later</b> at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's {{success in}} the United States came <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> when Michigan State University Press started {{publishing}} his books. His {{first visit to the}} country was on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and he lectured at various universities including Michigan State University and the University of California, Berkeley. Around this time, John Updike noticed his work and compared Narayan to Charles Dickens. In a review of Narayan's works published in The New Yorker, Updike called him a writer of a vanishing breed—the writer as a citizen; one who identifies completely with his subjects and with a belief in the significance of humanity.|$|E
5|$|The clarinet's {{place in}} the jazz {{ensemble}} was usurped by the saxophone, which projects a more powerful sound and uses a less complicated fingering system. The requirement for an increased speed of execution in modern jazz also did not favour the clarinet, but the clarinet did not entirely disappear. A few players such as Buddy DeFranco, Tony Scott, and Jimmy Giuffre emerged during the 1950s playing bebop or other styles. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> Eric Dolphy (on bass clarinet), Perry Robinson, John Carter, Theo Jörgensmann, and others used the clarinet in free jazz. The French composer and clarinetist Jean-Christian Michel initiated a jazz-classical cross-over on the clarinet with the drummer Kenny Clarke.|$|E
5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E
