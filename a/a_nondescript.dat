5|$|Belgrade has wildly varying {{architecture}}, {{from the}} center of Zemun, typical of a Central European town, to the more modern architecture and spacious layout of New Belgrade. The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions. The oldest public structure in Belgrade is <b>a</b> <b>nondescript</b> Turkish türbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dorćol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Neo-Byzantine architecture are present in buildings such as Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gračanica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through <b>a</b> <b>nondescript</b> entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to be polite and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select <b>a</b> <b>nondescript</b> address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|E

2500|$|The name 'Nondescripts Cricket Club' {{derives from}} a 19th-century London-based team. [...] The <b>Nondescripts</b> were <b>a</b> 'wandering' cricket club with no fixed ground {{and a team}} {{composed}} of players of all standards. [...] <b>A</b> New Zealand <b>Nondescripts</b> Club was established in 1962 to promote [...] "the principles of the game of Cricket, especially sportsmanship and high standards in dress, attitude and application." [...] It too is a 'wandering' club drawn mainly from Wellington and Lower Hutt players; eight NZ internationals have played for the club, including Ewen Chatfield, John Reid and Bob Blair. In the 1980s, <b>a</b> <b>Nondescripts</b> Cricket Club played in the Brunei cricket league. Consisting largely of Sri Lankan expatriates, both Sinhalese and Tamil, it later merged with another club and changed its name.|$|R

25|$|In superhero fiction, {{eyeglasses}} {{have become}} a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt <b>a</b> <b>nondescript</b> demeanor {{when they are not}} in their superhero persona: Superman is well known for wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as Clark Kent, while Wonder Woman wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style bug-eye glasses as Diana Prince. An example of the halo effect is seen in the stereotype that those who wear glasses are intelligent.|$|E
25|$|With You Only Live Twice and Licence to Kill being notable exceptions, James Bond {{is almost}} always seen at the HQ of MI6 (referred to as MI7 in Dr. No) in central London.

Prior to that it was <b>a</b> <b>nondescript</b> building near Whitehall, sometimes (e.g. Dr. No, OHMSS, The Living Daylights) ostensibly the HQ of Universal Exports, the Secret Service's front company.|$|E
25|$|Sylvia is {{generally}} considered a classical ballet. It features <b>a</b> <b>nondescript</b> mythical setting and a late nineteenth-century score, both of which give it an old-fashioned feel. In many ways, however, it was quite revolutionary for its time. The score {{was and still is}} recognized for its greatness. Delibes' work is certainly the best appreciated aspect of the ballet for its innovation, creativity, and maturity. Frederick Ashton's choreography complements the music very well in this respect, staying true to the spirit of the original production while incorporating modern techniques and adding his own unique touch.|$|E

Upon being disconnected from the Aperture Science facility, GLaDOS treats Chell with more civility. The player then learns that GLaDOS' personality was inherited from that of Caroline, the personal assistant of Aperture Science CEO Cave Johnson and is much warmer to Chell when under Caroline's influence.|$|E
25|$|Valthaty had <b>a</b> <b>nondescript</b> career till then, since {{making his}} way up the levels of age group cricket in Mumbai during the late 1990s. He made India's Under-19 squad to the 2002 World Cup in New Zealand with the likes of Irfan Pathan and Parthiv Patel where an injury to his eye in the game against Bangladesh halted his development. He couldn't make the {{breakthrough}} into senior cricket for years, and got just one opportunity for Mumbai, a one-dayer in 2006. There was no high-profile cricket for him for another few years, till Rajasthan Royals punted on him in the 2009 season, where he played a couple of matches. That earned him a place in Mumbai's Twenty20 side, and he turned in a few powerful performances for them, which led to a contract with Kings XI Punjab in 2011.|$|E
25|$|After {{passing over}} NY104 westbound, under NY590 and over NY104 eastbound, East Ridge Road becomes <b>a</b> <b>nondescript</b> {{residential}} street as {{it enters the}} Irondequoit neighborhood of Newport. The East Ridge Road name ends at a junction with Bay Shore Boulevard—the only through-traffic road that East Ridge Road intersects east of NY590—however, the street continues eastward as Binnacle Point to a cul-de-sac on a plateau overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Ridge Road itself does not traverse Irondequoit Bay; this task is accomplished by NY404 at {{the southern tip of}} the bay, NY104 via the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, and Culver and Lake Roads {{at the mouth of the}} bay via the Irondequoit Bay Outlet Bridge, a seasonal swing bridge that is open to traffic during the winter months only.

500|$|Medieval Muslim astronomers {{depicted}} Aries {{in various}} ways. Astronomers like al-Sufi saw the constellation as a ram, {{modeled on the}} precedent of Ptolemy.

Some early Bedouin observers saw a ram elsewhere in the sky; this constellation featured the Pleiades as the ram's tail. The generally accepted Arabic formation of Aries consisted of thirteen stars in a figure along with five [...] "unformed" [...] stars, four of which were over the animal's hindquarters and {{one of which was}} the disputed star over Aries's head. Al-Sufi's depiction differed from both other Arab astronomers' and Flamsteed's, in that his Aries was running and looking behind itself.|$|E
