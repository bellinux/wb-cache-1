It {{requires}} the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to propose a minimum wage level, which he will do {{for the first time}} in November 2010; the Legislative Council will either approve or reject the amount. The law does not give the Legislative Council the power to <b>amend</b> the <b>amount,</b> and it is not applicable to foreign domestic helpers, who, under legislation specifically governing the employment of foreign domestic helpers, earn a minimum of HK$3,580 per month. The wage level prevailing is essentially the result of interplay of supply and demand. Wages are usually calculated on hourly, daily, monthly, or piece rates. In September , the average monthly wage rate for the supervisory, technical, clerical and miscellaneous non-production workers was HK$11,712. Based on the wage indexes, the average wage rate for this group of workers rose by 1.8% per annum in 1995-2007, and by 1.5% per annum in real terms. The small difference is due to severe consumer price deflation. The overall average daily wage for the workers on public works construction projects was HK$565.60 at the end of 2007.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Arsenic is a known toxic element and its {{presence}} and toxicity in nature is a worldwide environmental problem. The use of microorganisms in bioremediation {{is a potential}} method to reduce as concentration in contaminated areas. Approach: In order to explore the possible bioremediation of this element, three filamentous fungi- Aspergillus niger, Serpula himantioides and Trametes versicolor were investigated for their potential abilities to accumulate (and possibly solubilize) arsenic from an agar environment consisting of non buffered mineral salts media amended with 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8 % (w/v) arsenopyrite (FeAsS). Growth rates, dry weights, arsenic accumulation and oxalate production by the fungi {{as well as the}} pH of the growth media were all assessed during this study. Results: There was no visible solubilization of FeAsS particles underneath any of the growing fungal colonies or elsewhere in the respective agar plates. No specific patterns of growth changes were observed from the growth ratios of the fungi on agar <b>amended</b> with different <b>amounts</b> of FeAsS although growth of all fungi was stimulated by the incorporation of varying amounts of FeAsS into the agar with the exception of A. niger on 0. 4 % (w/v) amended agar and T. versicolor on 0. 8 % (w/v) <b>amended</b> agar. The <b>amounts</b> of dry weights obtained for all three fungi also did not follow any specific patterns with different amounts of FeAsS and the quantities obtained were in the order A. niger > S. himantioides > T. versicolor. All fungi accumulated as in their biomasses with all amounts of FeAsS although to varying levels and T. versicolor was the most effective with all amounts of FeAsS while A. niger was the least effective. Conclusion: The accumulation of arsenic in the biomasses of the test fungi as shown in this study may suggested a role for fungi through their bioaccumulating capabilities as agents in the possible bioremediation of arsenic contaminated environments...|$|R

30|$|The present {{observation}} that potential degraders were diverse and {{very low in}} abundance, suggests that inferences about PAH degradation activity from bacterial classes alone cannot be reliably drawn. Causal relationships between {{the mere presence of}} certain classes and actual degradation activity mediated by them may not be apparent because the specialists (degrader communities in low abundance) are masked by generalists (high bacterial diversity without PAH degradation potential). The identification of specific in situ PAH degraders using PAH degradation experiments with soil <b>amended</b> with high <b>amounts</b> of organic material remains thus challenging. The complexity and low abundance of pyrene degrading communities together with limited label incorporation are preventing the use of other less sensitive techniques, like nucleic acid-SIP that give much more detailed information on the identity of individual degraders compared to PLFA-SIP but require much higher label incorporation into biomolecules. Complex degrader communities dilute the isotopic signal, which constrains their differentiation from a highly diverse microbial background.|$|R
40|$|Pinus taeda {{wood chips}} {{were treated with}} the biopulping fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora in calcium-or oxalic acid-amended cultures. The {{secretion}} of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes was inhibited only in the cultures having the highest concentration of calcium (1400 mg kg(- 1) wood). Calcium decreased the availability of free oxalic acid, inhibited fungal growth, and reduced lignin mineralization and transformations. Oxalic acid amendment in the cultures was found not to affect the lignin mineralization and transformations; however, it did inhibit the depolymerization reactions detectable in the residual lignin that was retained in the biotreated wood. C. subvermispora presented catabolic activity for oxalic acid in the cultures amended with 1660 mg acid kg(- 1) wood, whereas oxalic acid was synthesized when it was <b>amended</b> at low <b>amounts</b> or initially absent in the cultures. These data suggest one ideal ratio of oxalic acid in C. subvermispora cultures and indicate that its exogenous addition does not necessarily accompany the further degradation of lignin.

Soil samples were taken from 3 soil layers and subjected to leaching in packed soil column. Leachate was analyzed for total (P t), inorganic (P i) and organic P (P o). Inorganic P accounted for about 70 % of leachate P t. About 50 % of P t in leachate was lost within the first 5 pore-volume (PV). While 2 % of soil total P was lost in 20 PV of leachate from the control soil, 5 - 7 % was lost from the manure <b>amended</b> soil.

However, application of SIP to microbial populations with relatively minor buoyant density increases, such as populations that utilize compounds as a nitrogen source, results in reduced resolution of labeled populations. We therefore developed a tandem quantitative PCR (qPCR) –TRFLP (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) protocol that improves resolution of detection by quantifying specific taxonomic groups in gradient fractions. This method combines well-controlled amplification with TRFLP analysis to quantify relative taxon abundance in amplicon pools of FAM-labeled PCR products, using the intercalating dye EvaGreen to monitor amplification. Method accuracy was evaluated using mixtures of cloned 16 S rRNA genes, DNA extracted from low- and high-G+C bacterial isolates (Escherichia coli, Rhodococcus, Variovorax, and Microbacterium), and DNA from soil microcosms <b>amended</b> with known <b>amounts</b> of genomic DNA from bacterial isolates.

Nineteen fungal strains were isolated from soils irrigated with untreated municipal/industrial effluent using dilution technique and 10 prominent isolates were used for metal tolerance.

Microcosm DRP was monitored. Following incubation tiles were scraped and the periphyton analyzed for chlorophyll a. Microcosm DRP concentrations increased with increasing soil M 3 P and equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC 0). Relationships between M 3 P, EPC 0, and DRP were nonlinear and increases in soil M 3 P and/or DRP had a greater impact on biomass accumulation when these parameters were above threshold values of 30 mg/kg M 3 P and 0. 125 mg/L DRP.

Mycorrhizal colonization did not differ between annual and perennial species, but decreased more rapidly along the gradient of increasing C addition in plants with high Ellenberg N values than in plants with low Ellenberg N values. Soil C addition not only limits plant growth through a reduction in available nutrients, but also reduces mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots. The effect of C addition on mycorrhizal colonization varies among plant functional groups, with legumes experiencing an overproportional reduction in AM fungal colonization along the gradient of increasing C addition.

This work studies the effects of chemical additions on NOM biodegradation by biofilters. In this work, biofiltration of seawater with an empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 6 min and a hydraulic loading rate of 10 m h- 1 reduces the biological oxygen demand (BOD 7) by 8 %, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 6 % and the UV absorbance at 254 nm (A 254) by 7 %. Different amounts of ammonium chloride are added to the seawater (up to twice the total dissolved nitrogen in untreated seawater) to study its possible effect on the removal of NOM by a pilot-scale biofilter. Seawater is <b>amended</b> with different <b>amounts</b> of easily biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) supplied as sodium acetate (up to twice the DOC) for the same purpose. The results of this work reveal that the ammonium chloride additions do not significantly affect NOM removal and the sodium acetate is completely consumed by the biofiltration process. For both types of chemical additions, the BOD 7, DOC and A 254 in the outlet stream of the biofilter are similar to the values for the untreated control. These results indicate that this biofilter easily removes the BDOC from the seawater when the EBCT is not above 6 min. Furthermore, nitrogen does not limit the NOM biodegradation in seawater under these experimental conditions...|$|R

Two soils with organic and conventional management histories that had similar fertility levels were <b>amended</b> with equal <b>amounts</b> (100 kg/ ha) of nitrogen in organic (as lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.)) and mineral form (urea). Over 91 days, microbial biomass C and N, dehydrogenase enzyme activity, community structure of eubacteria and actinomycetes (by PCR-DGGE) and gross N mineralisation were measured. The addition of lupin stimulated the microbial community, resulting in an increase in microbial biomass and enzyme activity in both soils, while urea and control treatments were not significantly different from each other. Microbial community structure was more strongly influenced by substrate availability rather than by the form of fertiliser (lupin or urea); however, the effects were not sustained over time. No direct relationship existed between microbial structure, enzyme activities and N mineralisation, and that microbial community structure was more strongly influenced by inherent soil and environmental factors than by short-term management practices.

Soil amended with biochar (charcoal created by pyrolysis of biomass) has been demonstrated to increase crop yield, improve soil quality and affect greenhouse gas emissions, for example, reduce N 2 O emissions. Despite several studies on variations in the general microbial community structure due to soil biochar amendment, hitherto the specific role of the nitrogen cycling microbial community in mitigating soil N 2 O emissions has not been subject of systematic investigation.

Soil biochar amendment increased the relative gene and transcript copy numbers of the nosZ-encoded bacterial N 2 O reductase, suggesting a mechanistic link to the observed reduction in N 2 O emissions.

In this study,the water-only acute toxicity of three formulations based on glyphosate (Rodeo, Roundup Biactive, and Roundup) were compared using a water-column organism (cladoceran: Ceriodaphnia dubia) and a benthic organism (amphipod: Hyalella azteca). In addition, Roundup Biactive and Roundup were spiked into a clean sediment which was <b>amended</b> with appropriate <b>amounts</b> of peat moss to study the effect of different organic carbon levels (0, 0. 4, 1. 2, and 2. 1 %) on their sediment toxicity, with C dubia exposed to overlying Water or porewater prepared from the contaminated sediments. Results showed that the toxicity based on 48 -h LC 50 s for the three herbicides in the water-only tests was Roundup (1. 5 - 5. 7 mg L- 1) > Roundup Biactive (82 - 120 mg L- 1) > Rodeo (225 - 415 mg L- 1), and H. azteca was generally more sensitive than C dubia to these herbicides. Toxicity differences between formulations were due to the different surfactant components in these herbicides. From the porewater toxicity tests, Roundup Biactive (340 mg kg(- 1)) and Roundup (244 mg kg(- 1)) were similarly toxic in the sediment tests at 0 % organic carbon, indicating that the surfactants in Roundup were considerably more adsorptive than those in Roundup Biactive to the sediment of the same organic carbon.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of microbial amorphous Fe(III) oxide reduction {{was investigated}} in sediments from a freshwater wetland in north central Alabama, USA. Fe(III) oxide concentrations decreased exponentially with time during anaerobic incubation of sediment slurries and homogenized surface sediments. Rates of organic carbon mineralization (�CO 2 � CH 4 accumulation) did not change markedly {{during the course of}} Fe(III) oxide reduction, which indicated that the exponential decline in Fe(III) oxide concentration over time resulted primarily from Fe(III) limitation rather than a decrease in organic matter decay rate. Initial rates of Fe(III) oxide reduction were linearly correlated with initial Fe(III) oxide concentrations in experiments with mixtures of Fe(III) -rich and Fe(III) -depleted sediment slurries. Similar results were obtained in experiments with sediment from various depth intervals in the upper 3 cm of freshly collected cores. These findings provide explicit evidence that microbial Fe(III) oxide reduction rates are first order with respect to amorphous Fe(III) oxide concentration in the wetland sediment. The observed first-order relationship between Fe(III) oxide concentration and reduction rate is consistent with established models of surface area–controlled mineral transformation. An experiment in which Fe(III) oxide-rich sediment slurries were <b>amended</b> with different <b>amounts</b> of labile organic matter demonstrated a direct correlation between first-order Fe(III) reduction rate constants and initial rates of organic carbon mineralization.

The sewage sludge was obtained from sewage collection point located behind Jibril Aminu Hall of Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto and processed i. e. dried grounded and sterilized. A portion of land obtained in a botanical garden was divided into small portions 30 X 30 cm and the soil was excavated in-situ and sterilized in the laboratory. A polythene bag was subsequently used to demarcate between the sterilized soil and the garden soil. The sterilized soil plots were artificially contaminated with equal amount of used engine oil to represent a typical farmland oil spill.

40|$|The uptake of {{triclosan}} (TCS) and its metabolite methyl-triclosan (MTCS) by {{plants is}} poorly {{discussed in the}} current literature. The aim {{of this research was}} to analyze the extent of absorption of these compounds by the tissues of wheat plants by quantifying their bioconcentration factors (BCFs). Plants were grown for 30 days under controlled greenhouse conditions in two types of Chilean soil (Taqueral, TQ and Cuesta Vieja, CV) obtained from the metropolitan region of Santiago, Chile, that were <b>amended</b> with different <b>amounts</b> of biosolids containing indigenous and spiked TCS (10 mg kg(- 1)). Once the plants were harvested, both the root and the aerial parts of the plants were treated separately in each biomass sample. From the results, the extent of absorption of the compounds by the root was determined by measuring the BCF; the determined BCFs for the lowest and highest biosolid doses were 0. 64 and 0. 34 for TQ soil and 1. 06 and 0. 30 for CV soil, respectively. These decreases were significant (p value < 0. 05). In the case of plants grown in soils treated with biosolids spiked with an extra amount of TCS, a higher amount of TCS was available (labile fraction) and higher BCF values were obtained. The contributions of organic matter from biosolid doses and pH of the matrix as well as the additional loads of TCS from the biosolids were evaluated through a multi-factorial design. A mathematical expression was derived using this model, which was applied to predict BCFs using data reported in the literature. Predicted values showed great variability mainly due to variations in the plant species and harvest times, indicating that these factors should also be included {{for the development of a}} more complete model.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that degradation of pesticides in simple laboratory systems may differ from that in the field, {{but it is not}} clear which of the simplifications inherent in laboratory studies present serious shortcomings. Laboratory experiments evaluated several simplifying assumptions for a clay loam soil and contrasting pesticides. Degradation of cyanazine [2 -(4 -chloro- 6 -ethylamino- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -ylamino) 2 -methylpropiononitrile] and bentazone [3 -isopropyl- 1 H- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazin- 4 (3 H) -one 2, 2 -dioxide] at fluctuating temperature and moisture was predicted reasonably well based on parameters derived from degradation under constant conditions. There was a tendency for slower degradation of cyanazine and bentazone in soil aggregates of 3 to 5 mm in diameter (DT 50 at 15 degrees C and 40 % maximum water holding capacity of 25. 1 and 58. 2 d, where DT 50 is the time for 50 % decline of the initial pesticide concentration) than in soil sieved to < 3 mm (DT 50 of 19. 1 and 37. 6 d), but the differences were not significant for most datasets. Degradation of cyanazine, isoproturon [3 (4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea], and chlorotoluron [3 -(3 -chloro-p-tolyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea] was measured in soil <b>amended</b> with different <b>amounts</b> of lignin. The effect of lignin on degradation was small despite considerable differences in sorption. The DT 50 values of cyanazine, isoproturon, and chlorotoluron were 16. 2, 18. 6, and 33. 0 d, respectively, in soil without lignin and 19. 0, 23. 4, and 34. 6 d, respectively, in soil amended with 2 % lignin. Degradation of bentazone and cyanazine in repacked soil columns was similar under static and flow conditions with 50. 1 and 47. 2 % of applied bentazone and 74. 7 and 73. 6 % of applied cyanazine, respectively, degraded within 20 d of application. Thus, the assumptions underpinning laboratory to field extrapolation tested here were considered to hold for our experimental system.

40|$|Microbial {{activity}} is a potentially important yet poorly understood {{control on the}} fate and environmental impact of CO[subscript 2] that leaks into aquifers from deep storage reservoirs. In this study we examine how variation in CO[subscript 2] abundance affected competition between Fe(III) and SO[subscript 4]²ˉ-reducers in anoxic bioreactors inoculated with a mixed-microbial community from a freshwater aquifer. We performed two sets of experiments: one with low CO[subscript 2] partial pressure (~ 0. 02 atm) in the headspace of the reactors and one with high CO[subscript 2] partial pressure (~ 1 atm). A fluid residence time of 35 days was maintained in the reactors by replacing one-fifth of the aqueous volume with fresh medium every seven days. The aqueous medium was composed of groundwater <b>amended</b> with small <b>amounts</b> of acetate (250 μM), phosphate (1 μM), and ammonium (50 μM) to stimulate microbial activity. Synthetic goethite (1 mmol) andSO[subscript 4]²ˉ (500 μM influent concentration) were also available in each reactor to serve as electron acceptors. Results of this study show that higher CO[subscript 2] abundance increased the ability of Fe(III) reducers to compete with SO[subscript 4]²ˉ reducers, leading to significant shifts in CO[subscript 2] trapping and water quality. Mass-balance calculations and pyrosequencing results demonstrate that SO[subscript 4]²ˉ reducers were dominant in reactors with low CO[subscript 2] content. They consumed 85 % of the acetate after acetate consumption reached steady state while Fe(III) reducers consumed only 15 % on average. In contrast, Fe(III) reducers were dominant during that same interval in reactors with high CO[subscript 2] content, consuming at least 90 % of the acetate while SO[subscript 4]²ˉ reducers consumed a negligible amount (< 1 %). The higher rate of Fe(III) reduction in the high-CO[subscript 2] bioreactors enhanced CO[subscript 2] solubility trapping relative to the low-CO[subscript 2] bioreactors by increasing alkalinity generation (6 X). Hence, the shift in microbial activity we observed was a positive feedback on CO[subscript 2] trapping. More rapid Fe(III) reduction degraded water quality, however, by leading to high Fe(II) concentration...|$|R

However, {{the links between}} microbial diversity and ecosystem processes are not well understood. This {{study was designed to}} gain better understanding of the effects of short-term management practices on the microbial community and how changes in the microbial community affect key soil processes. The effects of different forms of nitrogen (N) on soil biology and N dynamics was determined in two soils with organic and conventional management histories that varied in soil microbial properties but had the same fertility. The soils were <b>amended</b> with equal <b>amounts</b> of N (100 kg ha⁻¹) in organic (lupin, Lupinus angustifolius L.) and mineral form (urea), respectively. Over a 91 -day period, microbial biomass C and N, dehydrogenase enzyme activity, community structure of pseudomondas (sensu stricto), actinomycetes and α proteobacteria (by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) following PCR amplification of 16 S rDNA fragments) and N mineralisation were measured. Lupin amendment resulted in a two- to five-fold increase in microbial biomass and enzyme activity, while these parameters did not differ significantly between the urea and control treatments. The PCR–DGGE analysis showed that the addition of mineral and organic compounds had an influence on the microbial community composition in the short term (up to 10 days) but the effects were not sustained over the 91 -day incubation period. Microbial community structure was strongly influenced by the presence or lack of substrate, while the type of amendment (organic or mineral) had an effect on microbial biomass size and activity. These findings show that the addition of green manures improved soil biology by increasing microbial biomass and activity irrespective of management history, that no direct relationship existed among microbial structure, enzyme activity and N mineralisation, and that microbial community structure (by PCR–DGGE) was more strongly influenced by inherent soil and environmental factors than by short-term management practices...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Ant- 300, a psychrophilic marine vibrio, was {{starved for}} periods {{in excess of}} one year. Cells starved at a high initial cell density {{increased}} in numbers from 100 to 800 % of the initial number of cells during the first week. Fifty {{percent of the population}} remained viable for six weeks while a portion of the population remained viable for more than one year. Cells starved at a low initial cell density increased in numbers over 400 fold during the first week and after 70 weeks of starvation over 15 times the original number of cells were still viable. Observation of cellular DNA with Feulgen staining prior to starvation showed that the average number of nuclear bodies per cell varied from 1. 44 to 4. 02 depending on the age of the culture. A linear relationship was found between the average number of nuclear bodies per cell and the increase in numbers upon starvation. The data indicate that DNA replication is not necessary for the increase in cell numbers and suggest that the cells divide by fragmentation under starvation conditions. Concomitant with the increase in cell numbers was a decrease in cell size and a change in shape from a rod to a coccus. After three weeks of starvation, 50 % of the viable cells were able to pass through a 0. 4 μm Nuclepore filter. Electron microscopy of thin sections of the small cells revealed normal cell structure except for an enlarged periplasmic space. When inoculated into a fresh medium, small starved cells grew without a significant lag and regained "normal" size and shape within 48 h. During the first two days of starvation, the endogenous respiration of the cells decreased over 80 %; after six weeks of starvation cellular DNA and protein had been reduced 46 and 43 %, respectively. Additions of nutrients to starving cell populations showed that phosphate or nitrate had little effect while glucose caused a highly accelerated cell death. The addition of glucose and nitrate or glutamate to starving cell suspensions resulted in recovery and growth of the cells with no detectable loss in viability. Cells starved in seawater or a starvation menstruum <b>amended</b> with small <b>amounts</b> of amino acids showed a slight increase in cell numbers but was otherwise characteristic of complete starvation...|$|R
40|$|Soil–bentonite slurry-trench cutoff walls using {{backfill}} {{consisting of}} on-site sandy soil and Na-bentonite are extensively used as engineering barriers {{for the purpose}} of achieving relatively low hydraulic conductivity. The amendments such as zeolite to backfill are considered to improve the contaminant sorptive capacity. At some sites, local clayey soil, Ca-bentonite and natural zeolite may be available for an alternate backfill. However, studies on the workability (in terms of slump), compressibility and hydraulic conductivity of such zeolite-amended clayey soil/Ca-bentonite backfills for the cutoff walls are very limited. This paper presents a comprehensive laboratory investigation on the workability, compressibility, and hydraulic conductivity of fine-grained zeolite-amended clayey soil/Ca-bentonite backfills using several series of slump and oedometer tests. Kaolin is used as the model clayey soil, and it is <b>amended</b> with various <b>amounts</b> of Ca-bentonite (7. 8 – 8. 4 %) and zeolite (10 – 40 %) to prepare zeolite-amended kaolin–bentonite backfills. The test results are compared with previous studies on zeolite-amended sandy soil/Na-bentonite backfills as well as compacted zeolite–bentonite liners to assess the effects of zeolite content and zeolite grain-size on the compressibility and hydraulic conductivity. The results indicate that the water content required to achieve a target slump (100 – 150 mm) for the backfills increases with increasing zeolite content. Liquid limit can be a useful index for a preliminary estimation of the water content required to achieve the target slump for the backfills presented in this study and zeolite-amended sandy soil/Na-bentonite backfills reported in previous studies. The results reveal that the hydraulic conductivity of the zeolite-amended clayey soil/Ca-bentonite backfills with void ratio ranging from 0. 54 to 1. 45 is generally lower than the typical regulatory limit (10 − 9 m/s). The addition of fine-grained zeolite has insignificant influence on the compressibility and hydraulic conductivity of both clayey soil/Ca-bentonite and sandy soil/Na-bentonite backfills. A proposed empirical method based on the framework of Kozeny–Carman equation can predict the hydraulic conductivity of zeolite-amended clayey soil/Ca-bentonite backfills values within the range of 1 / 3 to 3 times those calculated from the oedometer tests. The proposed method is also shown to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the compacted zeolite–bentonite liners from previous studies with reasonable accuracy. Additional research is recommended to evaluate the proposed zeolite-amended backfill using tap water and also by direct measurement of hydraulic conductivity using falling-head or constant-head testing method...|$|R
40|$|Contamination of {{terrestrial}} and aquatic ecosystems by arsenic {{is a very}} sensitive environmental issue due to its adverse impact on human health. Urgent action {{must be taken to}} reduce this impact by providing access to safe water as a basic human right. In the present work, researches have been carried out on novel arsenic sorbents at low cost, that can be easily synthesized, or even representing by-products from production processes and thus available for free or at very low price. In particular, this work describes the sorption of arsenate on Al-Mg and Fe-Mg layered double hydroxides as affected by pH and varying concentrations of inorganic and organic ligands, the effect of residence time on the arsenate desorption by ligands and the kinetics of arsenate desorption by phosphate. It was also studied the arsenate sorption by Fe- and Al-based drinking-Water Treatment Residual samples (by-products coming from drinking-water treatment plants) as a function of WTRs particles size at different initial As concentrations and solid:solution ratios (SSRs). The Fe-Mg-LDH sorbed nearly twice the amount of arsenate compared to the Al-Mg-LDH, due to its greater surface area and lower degree of crystallinity. Moreover, the Fe-Mg-LDH sorbed more arsenate than phosphate, in contrast to the Al-Mg-LDH, which adsorbed more phosphate than arsenate, probably because of the greater affinity of arsenate than phosphate for Fe sites and, vice versa, the greater affinity of phosphate than arsenate for Al sites. The capacity of ligands to inhibit the fixation of arsenate followed the sequence: nitrate < nitrite < sulphate < selenite < tartrate < oxalate << phosphate on Al-Mg-LDH and nitrate < sulphate ≈ nitrite < tartrate < oxalate < selenite << phosphate on Fe-Mg-LDH. The inhibition of arsenate sorption increased by increasing the initial ligand concentration. The longer the arsenate residence time on the LDH surfaces the less effective the competing ligands were in desorbing arsenate from sorbents. A greater percentage of arsenate was removed by phosphate from Al-Mg-LDH than from Fe-Mg-LDH during kinetics of arsenate desorption. Both WTR samples show a high affinity for arsenate. Anyway, the Al-WTR samples, characterized by a higher surface area, were able to sorb much greater amounts of arsenate than the Fe-WTR. The greater the SSR, the higher the amounts of arsenate sorbed on both WTR samples. The influence of Fe-WTR particles size on the arsenate sorption capacity was greatly pronounced when compared to that of the Al-WTRs. The smallest Fe-WTR particles were able to sorb much more arsenate than the bigger ones, whereas, surprisingly, the biggest Al-WTR particles showed the best arsenate sorption capacity with respect to that of smaller Al-WTR particles. The presence of As in soils and/or groundwaters used for agricultural purposes, causes a strong abiotic stress to the cultivated plants, which results in the reduction of biomasses and yields, and the abundance of non-tradable products. It is therefore desirable to identify and develop production techniques capable of limiting the mobility and phyto-availability of As in soil, through the stabilization of the metalloid on the more recalcitrant soil fractions. In the present work it was carried out an experiment on the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), irrigated with different solutions containing arsenite and grown in a As-uncontaminated soil <b>amended</b> by increasing <b>amounts</b> of stabilized compost. The aims of this experiment were to: i) study the influence of the compost application on the mobility and phyto-availability of As in soil; ii) study the influence of the compost on the growth of the bean plants and their uptake of As from contaminated systems. Bean plants growth was significantly affected by As and compost treatments. The higher the As concentration in the irrigation water, the lower was the plants biomass, {{as a consequence of the}} phytotoxic effect of As, whereas a higher application of the compost corresponded to a higher plant biomass, indicating the ability of the compost to alleviate the As phytotoxicity. In all treatments, arsenic concentration in roots was higher than in shoots and bean,. Moreover, the compost application reduced the As concentration in all tissues of the amended plants compared to those non-amended. A low As allocation in bean is definitely desirable, because a high content of As in the edible part of the plant could cause contamination of the human food-chain. The concentration of the free-fraction of As in soil decreased significantly by increasing the level of compost application, whereas the higher the compost application the higher was the concentration of specifically sorbed As by soil colloidal particles...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic is {{considered}} as being synonymous with toxicity. Alarming As concentrations in natural waters is a worldwide problem. With greater public concern of As poisoning on human health, the developing regulatory guidelines and remediation technologies for mitigating As-contaminated ecosystems {{is an important}} issue. Urgent steps {{must be taken to}} reduce these impacts by providing access to safe water as a basic human right. Delaying mitigation is increasing death and disease. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) show excellent capacity to sorb and exchange anions. Although arsenic (As) has a high affinity for sorbents containing Fe, only few studies have been carried out on the sorption of arsenite [As(III) ] onto a Fe-based LDH. In this work we studied the sorption of As(III) onto a LDH containing Mg and Fe (Mg–Fe-LDH), as affected by: (i) pH; (ii) the presence of increasing concentrations of organic [citrate (CIT) and oxalate (OX) ] and inorganic [phosphate (PO 4), selenite (SeO 3) and sulphate (SO 4) ] ligands, (iii) the effect of residence time on the desorption of As(III) by these ligands, and; (iv) the kinetics of desorption of As(III) by PO 4. The As(III) sorption isotherms, carried out at different pHs, indicated a good affinity of the harmful oxyanion for the sorption sites of the Mg–Fe-LDH. This material was able to remove efficiently As(III) from contaminated solutions over a wide range of pH, but more in acidic than in alkaline systems. Competing ligands differently prevented the As(III) sorption on Mg–Fe-LDH, according to the following order: SO 4 < OX << SeO 3 < CIT < PO 4. The desorption of As(III) by these anions decreased with increasing As(III) residence time on LDH surfaces. A comparison between the sorption/desorption of As(III) and As(V) on/from Mg–Fe-LDH in {{the presence or absence of}} anions highlights that less As(III) than As(V) is sorbed, whereas more As(III) than As(V) is desorbed by all the selected organic and inorganic ligands, but PO 4. In recent decades, Fe-(hydr) oxides (e. g., Ferrihydrite and Goethite) have attracted substantial attention for their potential use as As sorbents. The aim of the work was to study the As(III) removal from contaminated waters by Fe-based minerals, by using Ferrihydrite [non-crystalline Fe-(hydr) oxide) ] and Goethite [crystalline Fe-(hydr) oxide] as sorbent media in batch experiments. In particular, it was studied: i) the Langmuir isotherms of As(III) at pH 6. 0; ii) arsenite sorption at different pHs; iii) arsenite sorption in presence of selected competing ligands, such as citrate (CIT), molybdate (MoO 4), oxalate (OX), phosphate (PO 4), selenite (SeO 3), selenate (SeO 4), and sulphate (SO 4). Both Ferrihydrite and Goethite samples show a high affinity for As(III). However, the Ferrihydrite samples, characterized by a higher surface area (104. 9 m 2 g- 1), were able to sorb much greater amounts of As(III) than the Goethite, with a lower surface area (42. 3 m 2 g- 1). However, Ferrihydrite (Sm = 1245. 1 mmol kg- 1) adsorbed much more As(III) than Goethite (Sm = 327. 9 mmol kg- 1), essentially because of its greater surface area (178. 2 vs. 42. 3 m 2 g- 1) and, hence, lower degree of crystallinity, as well as to the greater affinity of As(III) for its surfaces. Probably, in our tests, Ferrihydrite adsorbed As(III) on their own external surfaces by forming a greater amounts of inner-sphere complexes vs. those formed by Goethite. The sorption of As(III) was lightly pH dependent. In fact, in the pH range of 4. 0 - 9. 0 the quantities of As(III) adsorbed resulted to be practically constant. The organic and inorganic ligands showed different capacities to compete with As(III) for the sorption sites of the Ferrihydrite and Goethite, according to the following increasing sequence: selenate< sulphate < oxalate < citrate < selenite ≈ molybdate< phosphate on Ferrihydrite, and sulphate ≈ selenate< oxalate < citrate <molybdate< selenite ≈ phosphate on Goethite. Carrot (Daucus carota L.) is widely consumed vegetable by humans. However, the study about influence of organic amendment (i. e. humic acid) and inorganic fertilizers (i. e. N, P, K) on As uptake, translocation, and its toxicity in carrot is limited. In this study carrot irrigated with different solutions containing As(III) and grown in a As-uncontaminated soil <b>amended</b> with increasing <b>amounts</b> of stabilized humic acid (half and full doses) and fertilized (half and full doses) with inorganic fertilizer. The aims of this experiment were to study: i) the influence of the humic acid application and inorganic fertilizer on the mobility and phyto-availability of As in soil; ii) the influence of the humic acids and inorganic fertilizer on the growth of the carrot plants and their uptake of As from contaminated systems. The carrot plants exposed to As showed typical phytotoxicity symptoms. Carrot plants growth was significantly affected by As and soil amended with humic acid and fertilization with inorganic fertilizer treatments. Carrot plants fertilized with inorganic fertilizer grew slightly more than those amended with commercial humic acids. Higher concentrations of As were found in carrot tissues when plants were irrigated with increasing levels of As. Most of the As taken up by edibleroots, while a lesser allocation of toxicant occurring in leaf biomass. In comparison to unfertilized control, plants amended with organic fertilizer exhibited a lower concentration of As in their own tissues, while the opposite was happened in fertilized with inorganic fertilizer. Here we observed the concentration of free-fraction As in soil samples after the amendment by humic acid and fertilization by inorganic fertilizer treatment. In soil, amended with humic acids and irrigated with As-contaminated water, there was a significant decrease of the nonspecifically sorbed As fraction and a contemporary increase of the specifically sorbed As fraction. This trend was due to partial immobilization of the As by the organic functional groups, either directly or through cation bridging. On the other hand, the fertilization with inorganic fertilizer determined a slight increase of the nonspecifically sorbed As and a consequent decrease of the specifically sorbed As. Hence, the addition of humic acid to soils could be used as an effective means to limit As accumulation in crops from As-contaminated waters...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{salinity}} is {{a serious}} land degradation problem which reduces plant growth and microbial activity due to (1) low osmotic potential which causes plant water stress, and (2) ion toxicity and ion imbalances (nutrient deficiencies) as result of high salt concentrations in the soil solution. Therefore, salinity affects organic matter turnover by influencing the amount of organic matter input in the soil and decomposition rate. Microbial activity and biomass in saline soils have been extensively studied, but a {{little is known about}} the effect of organic carbon (OC) addition on adaptation of soil microbes to salinity. The objective of this thesis was to determine the effect of OC availability on adaptation of soil microbial activity and biomass to salinity. In most experiments described in this thesis, one non-saline and four saline soils from the field with similar texture (sandy clay loam) and electrical conductivities in a 1 : 5 soil: water extract (EC₁﹕₅) of 0. 1, 1. 1, 3. 1 and 5. 2 dS m⁻¹ or electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECₑ) of 1, 11, 24 and 43 dS m⁻¹ were used. In other experiments a non-saline loamy sand was amended with NaCl to achieve a range of EC levels. The optimum water content for respiration was determined by incubating the soils amended with glucose at different water contents and measuring the respiration for 10 days at 25 ºC. Glucose, cellulose or pea residue was used as OC sources. Inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were added in experiments with glucose and cellulose to ensure that N and P availability did not limit microbial growth. Respiration (CO₂ release) was measured throughout the experiments; microbial biomass C (MBC) at selected sampling dates. Available N and P were measured in the first and second experiment. Microbial community structure was measured in the fifth experiment. The aim of the first experiment was to study the effect of increasing salinity on soil microbial biomass and activity at different addition rates of soluble organic C (glucose). One non-saline and three saline soils with EC₁﹕₅ of 0. 1, 1. 1, 3. 1 and 5. 2 dS m⁻¹ were amended with glucose to achieve five carbon concentrations (0, 0. 5, 1, 2. 5, 5 g C kg⁻¹). N and P were added to achieve a C/N ratio of 20 and a C/P ratio of 200. Soil respiration was measured continuously over 21 days; MBC and available N and P were determined on days 2, 5, 14 and 21. Cumulative respiration was significantly increased with addition of ≥ 0. 5 g C kg⁻¹ compared to unamended soils. Cumulative respiration decreased with increasing salinity with smaller relative decrease when C was added than in the soil without C addition. Cumulative respiration decreased with increasing salinity with the strongest decrease in the soils without C addition where, compared to EC 0. 1, it was 64 % lower at EC 1. 1 and 80 % lower at EC 5. 2. Addition of glucose reduced the negative impact of salinity; with 5 g C kg⁻¹ cumulative respiration decreased by 2 % at EC 1. 1 and 21 % at EC 5. 2. MBC concentration was negatively correlated with EC at all C rates and at each sampling date. Addition of C resulted in N and P immobilisation in the first 5 days. Biomass turnover released N and P after day 14, especially in the soils with low EC. It can be concluded that microbes are less affected by increasing EC when they are provided with easily available C. The second experiment was conducted to determine the response of soil microbes to salinity when supplied with different OC forms. One non-saline and three saline soils were amended with 2. 5 and 5 g C kg⁻¹ as glucose or cellulose, soluble N and P were added to achieve a C/N= 20 and C/P= 200. Microbial biomass C and available N and P were determined on days 2, 7, 14 and 21. Cumulative respiration decreased gradually with increasing EC when supplied with glucose, whereas with cellulose it decreased sharply from non-saline to saline soils but differed little among saline soils. Microbial biomass C and available N and P concentrations were highest in the non-saline soil but did not differ among the saline soils. Microbial biomass C concentration was higher and available N was lower with 5 g C kg⁻¹ than with 2. 5 g C kg⁻¹. With glucose, microbial biomass was highest on day 2 and then decreased, whereas available N was lowest on day 2 and then increased. With cellulose, microbial biomass C increased gradually over time and available N decreased gradually. It is concluded that salinity decreased the ability of microbes to utilise cellulose more than glucose utilisation. Two incubation experiments (Experiments 3 and 4) were conducted to investigate the effect of increasing EC on microbial biomass and activity when OC was added once in different proportions of glucose and cellulose or when the carbon form is changed over time. Experiment 3 was carried out using three sandy clay loam soils: a non-saline soil and two saline soils (ECe 11 and 43 dS m⁻¹) amended with 5 g C kg⁻¹ as different percentages of glucose and cellulose. The percentages of glucose (G) were 100 % and 0 - 20 % and those of cellulose (Ce) were 0 - 100 %. The fourth experiment was conducted with a non-saline loamy sandy soil which was adjusted to ECe 12. 5 and 37. 4 dS m⁻¹ by addition of NaCl. The form of organic C was maintained or changed over time by adding 1. 5 g C kg⁻¹ every two weeks (on days 0, 15 and 29) as glucose (G) or cellulose (Ce) : (Ce+Ce+Ce, G+G+G, Ce+Ce+G, G+Ce+Ce, G+Ce+G, Ce+G+Ce). Experiment 3 showed that compared to 100 % cellulose, cumulative respiration was increased by mixing small amounts of glucose with cellulose, but the impact of glucose proportion differed with soil EC. Cumulative respiration increased with increasing glucose proportion in the combined treatments when the proportion of glucose was > 2. 5 %. With 100 % G cumulative respiration was greater in the non-saline soil than in the soil EC 43, however with 100 % Ce and all combined treatments, cumulative respiration was significantly higher in the non-saline than in soils EC 11 and EC 43. There was no further decrease in cumulative respiration from EC 11 to EC 43 when amended by 100 % Ce but it decreased significantly from EC 11 to EC 43 in the combined treatments except with 10 % G. The MBC concentration was lower in saline soils than in the non- saline soil. In Experiment 4, the impact of salinity on cumulative respiration in the two weeks following OC addition depended on C form, treatment and period. Regardless of C form added, the effect of salinity was reduced when C was added repeatedly compared to the first addition indicating that high C availability increases microbial tolerance to salinity. Cumulative respiration increased when glucose was added after cellulose addition. Addition of glucose after cellulose alleviated the adverse effect of high salinity on cumulative respiration compared to the previous period with cellulose or when cellulose was added after glucose. It can be concluded that, mixing small amounts of glucose with cellulose increases activity and growth of soil microbes, but may make microbes more susceptible to salinity compared to cellulose alone. The study also indicated that irrespective of C form added, microbial activity and biomass were less influenced by salinity when C was added frequently compared to the first addition showing that high C availability decreases the negative impact of salinity on soil microbes. To investigate the effect of increasing EC on microbial biomass and activity with repeated addition of plant residues, the fifth experiment was carried out with a non-saline soil (loamy sand, ECe 1 dS m⁻¹) <b>amended</b> with different <b>amounts</b> of NaCl to achieve ECe 12. 5, 25 and 50 dS m⁻¹. Two rates of pea residue equivalent to 3. 9 and 7. 8 g C kg⁻¹ (3. 9 C and 7. 8 C) were added on days 0, 15 and 29. In the saline soils compared to the first addition, cumulative respiration per g C added was higher after the second and third addition except with 3. 9 C at EC 50. Compared to the first addition, the relative increase in cumulative respiration in the saline soils was greater with 7. 8 C than with 3. 9 C. At the end of experiment, the percentage of added C remaining was lowest at non-saline soil and increased with increasing salinity levels. The MBC concentration at the end of experiment was significantly lower than in the nonsaline soil at EC 25 and EC 50 with 3. 9 C, but only at EC 50 with 7. 8 C. Salinity changed the microbial community composition on day 42 assessed by phospholipid fatty acids, but only in the amended soils. It can be concluded that repeated residue addition reduced the adverse effect of salinity on cumulative respiration which indicates that limiting periods of low substrate availability can enhance the adaptation of soil microbes to salinity. This positive effect of residue addition was observed although salinity changed microbial community composition, suggesting that OC addition enables the development of a microbial community that can better adapt to salinity. The aim of the sixth experiment was to assess the response of soil microbes to increasing salinity in rhizosphere compared to non-rhizosphere (bulk) soil using the nonsaline soil (ECe 1 dS m⁻¹). The soil was adjusted to ECe 13 and 19 dS m⁻¹ by adding NaCl and placed in pots. Barley was planted in half of the pots to obtain rhizosphere soil whereas unplanted pots were used for generation of bulk soil. The pots were placed in a greenhouse and soil moisture was maintained throughout by weight. After 5 weeks the planted and unplanted pots were harvested to collect rhizosphere and bulk soils to be used for the following incubation experiment. The EC levels (EC 1, EC 13 and EC 19) from the pot experiment (referred to as original) were either maintained or adjusted to ECe 13, 19, 31 and 44 dS m⁻¹ by adding different amounts of NaCl. Cumulative respiration and microbial biomass C in rhizosphere and bulk soil decreased with increasing adjusted EC. Across the whole range of adjusted ECs, the decrease in cumulative respiration with increasing EC did not differ between rhizosphere and bulk soil. However, compared to the treatments where the EC was maintained, the percentage decrease in cumulative respiration when the EC was increased to EC 44 was smaller in rhizosphere than in bulk soil. The smaller decrease in microbial activity at the highest EC level in rhizosphere compared to bulk soil suggests that rhizosphere microbes may be less affected by high salinity than bulk soil microbes. Experiment 7 aimed to determine the response of soil microbial activity and biomass to drying and rewetting of non-saline and saline soils when the salinity levels were maintained or increased upon rewetting. A non- saline loamy sand (EC₁﹕₅ 0. 1 dS m⁻¹) was salinized with NaCl to achieve EC₁﹕₅ of 1. 5 and 3. 5 dS m⁻¹ (initial EC). The soils were amended pea straw at 20 g kg⁻¹ before the moisture treatments began. The soils were divided into two portions, one portion was dried for four days and the second portion was maintained at 40 % of water holding capacity (WHC). The soils were then wetted to 75 % WHC with either water to maintain the EC (EC 0. 1, EC 1. 5 or EC 3. 5) or amended with NaCl to achieve the following EC levels: EC 0. 1 was increased to 1. 5, 2. 5 and 3. 5 dS m⁻¹. EC 1. 5 was adjusted to 2. 5 and 3. 5 dS m⁻¹ and EC 3. 5 was increased to 4. 5 dS m⁻¹. A respiration flush upon rewetting only occurred in the initially non-saline soil when the EC was maintained, but not when the EC was increased. At the end of the experiment (day 25), cumulative respiration was higher in the dried and rewet (DRW) treatment compared to the treatment that was maintained moist (CM) only in the initially non-saline soil when the EC was not increased. Cumulative respiration decreased with increasing EC compared to the treatments where the EC was maintained only in treatments with initially EC 0. 1 where the reduction was greater in DRW compared to CM. The MBC concentration was higher in the treatments in which the EC was maintained compared to the treatments where the EC was increased in both moisture treatments. When the EC was increased, the MBC concentration at the end of the experiment was greater in DRW compared to CM only in soil with initial EC 0. 1. However, in the saline soils (EC 1. 5 and EC 3. 5) when the EC was maintained or increased; the MBC concentration did not differ between moisture treatments. The experiment showed that in the initial nonsaline soil, increasing the EC upon rewetting inhibits the ability of microbes to decompose substrates released after rewetting. Drying and rewetting did not consistently increase the sensitivity of soil microbes to salinity compared to constantly moist soil. Thesis (Ph. D.)
