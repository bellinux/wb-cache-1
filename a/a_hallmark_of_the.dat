5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, were also <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins {{in that they}} were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E

5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{curriculum}} {{in the earliest}} days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E
50|$|Another key {{distinguishing}} feature was <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> simulated channel surfing {{to switch from}} sketch to sketch, often in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> a sketch, sometimes after the punchline.

5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E
5|$|To further {{provide the}} fair and {{balanced}} view of the topic, script editor Karen Wilson furthered her research by consulting with a Muslim advisor throughout the scripting and filming stages, as well as consulting the Muslims who played extras in the episode. Although Wilson does not usually talk to cast members beforehand, {{it was the first}} time she became aware of the research and advice behind a storyline, and felt that the advice she was given was useful in staging the scenes. It was also based on real life instances, something that Brenton considered <b>a</b> <b>hallmark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, as many episodes are based on such events. News stories detailing similar instances to the plot came out sometime after the episode's broadcast, and the producers believed it justified the episode. The ending was written to be melancholic, in which there were no winners.|$|E

The episodic adventures strayed further and further from heroic fantasy, and the twenty five-issue graphic novel High Society segued the narrative into a complex political satire and drama.

25|$|When fetal {{hemoglobin}} production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin (HbA).
