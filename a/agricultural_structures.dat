The multiple linear regression analysis was conducted on the impact the changes in crop farming on farmers’ net income by using logarithmic demand model. The results show that the <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> has transformed from the dominant crop farming to the all-around developmental trend covering the dominant industry, animal husbandry and forestry, fishery and the other industries; the animal husbandry has greatest impact on famers’ income per capita and the impact of crop farming is slightly weaker than animal husbandry; the crop farming and animal husbandry develop fairly rapid simultaneously and the two all have great impact in farmers’ income; among animal husbandry, the meat and eggs have relatively great impact on farmers’ income, while in crop farming, grain plays the dominant role in affecting farmers’ income, followed by cash crop. Hence, the relevant countermeasures applied to increase farmers’ income are put forward in terms of optimizing the internal structure of agriculture, adjusting the internal structure of crop farming, adjusting the internal structure of animal husbandry and strengthening the support of farmers. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>structure,</b> Farmers’ net income, Contribution rate, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to define urban/rural systems in Lombardy and to analyse the rates of land uptake, increase in urbanisation and agricultural soil loss, and the characteristics of agriculture in these systems. In particular, the authors first identify the urban/rural systems using both traditional statistical techniques and spatial classification techniques. They then examine the different trends of land uptake and increase in urban areas by municipality in the different systems, by using the Land Use Database of the Lombardy Region for the years 1954, 1999 and 2007. They subsequently link these changes to {{the distribution of the}} socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, industrial and infrastructure development, employment and <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> (location and characteristics of farms) to analyse the causes and consequences of land use change in Lombardy, and to characterize the <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> in the urban/rural systems...|$|R

The correlation between variables of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> and human EHEC incidence was high, indicating a significant statistical association of cattle and farm density with human infection.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{expansion of}} large-scale Paddy field management entity and change of <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> in Japan. Paddy agriculture has changed. Mid-size agricultural management entities have decreased and large-scale management entities have increased. This factor {{is due to}} downturn in rice price and <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> policy. Those large-scale management entities have accumulated paddy fields {{more than half of}} agricultural commune. Sustainability and vison of such a farm management entities are vital for maintenance and development of regional agriculture. 　This paper takes up development of large-scale management. N Corporation, which manages 395 ha of farmland in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, has been analyzed as a case study. The findings of the analysis are as follows : The speed of increasing the workforce to accompany the enlargement of the managed area depends on, which is the reason why N Corporation became organization change from cooperative to corporation. The conversion in the latter case has changed the status of workers, who used to be members of the cooperative, to employees and the management of workers from a horizontal system to a more vertical and sectional structure. 　From the above, this paper can draw the following conclusion : Large-scale management entities was changed by field scale expansion. They are face a decrease in yield and decrease in earnings of the paddy fields agriculture. As a result, they need to organization change. And <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> policy is not only required to accumulate fields but also to overall management support...|$|R
