5|$|A {{shortage}} of engines {{was a major}} obstacle to mass production <b>and</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IK-3, so tests were conducted with more powerful engines, including the Daimler-Benz DB 601, Rolls-Royce Merlin II and Hispano-Suiza 12Y51. The tests were incomplete {{at the time of}} the Axis invasion, and the only prototype to be fitted with a non-production engine was destroyed by factory personnel along with the incomplete production aircraft. Development of a dual-control two-seat trainer variant of the IK-3 had commenced but pressure on the design team had delayed the completion of the project when the invasion intervened.|$|E
5|$|A stylized {{flower of}} a Hippeastrum {{cultivar}} (under its common name of amaryllis) is used internationally {{as a symbol}} for organizations associated with Huntington's disease, a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system.

The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease.

In Zululand, Clarke granted considerable authority and special judicial functions to the hereditary chiefs; and was commended by Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, for his action {{in the face of}} potential famine. He recommended to the Imperial Government the return from exile of Dinuzulu, the paramount chief.
