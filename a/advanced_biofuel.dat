5|$|Brazil’s {{production}} of ethanol fuel from sugarcane {{dates back to}} the 1970s, as a governmental response to the 1973 oil crisis. Brazil is considered the biofuel industry leader and the world's first sustainable biofuels economy. In 2010 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuel</b> due to EPA's estimated 61% reduction of total life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, including direct indirect land use change emissions.|$|E

25|$|UNICA, a Brazilian ethanol {{producers}} association, {{welcomed the}} ruling and commented {{that they hope}} the classification of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuel</b> will contribute to influence {{those who seek to}} lift the trade barriers imposed against clean energy, both in the U.S. {{and the rest of the}} world. EPA's final ruling is expected to benefit Brazilian producers, as the blending mandate requires an increasing quota of advanced biofuels, which is not likely to be fulfill with cellulosic ethanol, and then it would force blenders to import more Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, despite the existing 54¢ per gallon tariff on ethanol imported directly from Brazil.|$|E
40|$|<b>Advanced</b> <b>biofuels</b> such as {{cellulosic}} ethanol are {{of great}} interest for their potential to supply {{a significant portion of}} U. S. fuel needs plus advantages over corn grain-based ethanol. The sustainability of agriculture-based <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuels</b> depends on how farmers would respond in providing biomass feedstock, yet economic behavior by farmers has been under recognized by the science community. Focusing on markets and policy incentives, this research shows that farmers are unlikely to convert current grain cropland to grow a dedicated cellulosic biomass crop such as switchgrass. However, the financial incentives to harvest cellulosic biomass provided by the 2008 farm bill may stimulate corn production due to demand for corn grain for feed and ethanol and corn residues for <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuels.</b> The prospect of continuous, possibly expanding corn production for <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuels</b> raises the same environmental issues as for corn grain-based ethanol. To assure the environmental sustainability of <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuels</b> production, environmental policies are needed to complement existing bioenergy initiatives. biomass, energy, <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuels,</b> corn, land use, switchgrass, cellulosic ethanol, Environmental Economics and Policy, Production Economics, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q 42, Q 12,...|$|R

25|$|Also in late 2012, using systems {{metabolic}} engineering, a Korean {{research team}} at the former Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has succeeded in demonstrating an optimized process to increase butanol production by generating an engineered bacterium. Professor Sang Yup Lee at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, KAIST, Dr. Do Young Seung at GS Caltex, a large oil refining company in Korea, and Dr. Yu-Sin Jang at BioFuelChem, a startup butanol company in Korea, applied a systems metabolic engineering approach to improve the production of butanol through enhancing the performance of Clostridium acetobutylicum, {{one of the best}} known butanol-producing bacteria. In addition, the downstream process was optimized and an in situ recovery process was integrated to achieve higher butanol titer, yield, and productivity. The combination of systems metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization resulted {{in the development of a}} process capable of producing more than 585g of butanol from 1.8kg of glucose, which allows the production of this important industrial solvent and <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuel</b> to be cost competitive.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{relevant}} and controversial comments submitted to CARB as public letters, on June 24, 2008, {{a group of}} 27 scientists and researchers {{from a number of}} universities and national laboratories, expressed their concerns arguing that there [...] "is not enough hard empirical data to base any sound policy regulation in regards to the indirect impacts of renewable biofuels production. The field is relative new, especially when compared to the vast knowledge base present in fossil fuel production, and the limited analyses are driven by assumptions that sometimes lack robust empirical validation." [...] With a similar opposing position, on October 23, 2008, a letter submitted to CARB by the New Fuels Alliance, representing more than two-dozen <b>advanced</b> <b>biofuel</b> companies, researchers and investors, questioned the Board intention to include indirect land use change (ILUC). In another public letter just before the ruling meeting, more than 170 scientists and economists sent a letter to CARB, urging it to account for GHG emissions from indirect land use change for biofuels and all other transportation fuels. They argued that [...] "...there are uncertainties inherent in estimating the magnitude of indirect land use emissions from biofuels, but assigning a value of zero is clearly not supported by the science." ...|$|E

2500|$|Policies in the United States have {{included}} {{a decrease in}} the subsidies provided by the federal and state governments to the oil industry which have usually included $2.84 billion. This is more than what is actually set aside for the biofuel industry. The measure was discussed at the G20 in Pittsburgh where leaders agreed that [...] "inefficient fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, reduce our energy security, impede investment in clean sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change". If this commitment is followed through and subsidies are removed, a fairer market in which algae biofuels can compete will be created. In 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a legislation seeking to give algae-based biofuels parity with cellulose biofuels in federal tax credit programs. The algae-based renewable fuel promotion act (HR 4168) was implemented to give biofuel projects access to a $1.01 per gal production tax credit and 50% bonus depreciation for biofuel plant property. The U.S Government also introduced the domestic Fuel for Enhancing National Security Act implemented in 2011.
