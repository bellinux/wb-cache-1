In one design, the guns were placed in an armored casemate amidships: this <b>arrangement</b> <b>was</b> called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform {{to give them a}} broad field of fire; when fully armored, this <b>arrangement</b> <b>was</b> called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored, a barbette.|$|E

Lepidus was left with the province of Africa, stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.|$|E

5|$|After he had {{recorded}} his orchestration of the chorale prelude Christ lag in Todesbanden, BWV718, in 1931, Leopold Stokowski recorded his arrangement for symphonic orchestra of BWV4's fourth movement in 1937.

40|$|An <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> {{the complex}} {{generated}} in the real projective plane by a family of straight lines that do not form a pencil.

Simplicial <b>arrangements</b> <b>were</b> first introduced by E. Melchior in 1941; the only existing extensive account appeared in a paper published by Grunbaum in 1971.

5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The <b>arrangement</b> <b>was</b> revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was ordered}} to take the IX Corps back to the Eastern Theater, where he built {{it up to a}} {{strength}} of over 21,000 in Annapolis, Maryland. The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command, reporting initially to Grant; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, who had been a division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg. This cumbersome <b>arrangement</b> <b>was</b> rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna, when Burnside agreed to waive his precedence of rank and was placed under Meade's direct command.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this <b>arrangement</b> <b>was</b> unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E

Most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, including Karlsruhe, Emden, and Nürnberg, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Königsberg instead remained in Germany.|$|E

Although Kentucky law required that anyone taking the bar examination be at least twenty-one years old, Bradley was allowed by a special provision of the state legislature to take it at age eighteen. This <b>arrangement</b> <b>was</b> contingent on Bradley's being judged competent by two circuit judges.

A sensor arrangement (4) detects position and/or orientation of a defined sub section (5) of a spatially structured and/or time-varying light structure (3). The sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at a movable section. The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> designed {{such that the}} light structure is formed in a position space (O). The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at the section such that the light structure is formed relative to the section, and the sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> arranged in the position space. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for determining position and/or orientation of a handling unit. USE - Positioning determining system for calibrating and/or positioning and/or measuring position/orientation of handling unit such as robot, processing unit, mounting unit, machine tool, manufacturing system, coordinate measuring device and/or automated handling equipment (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The light generation <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> fixed at the movable section such that the light structure is formed relative to the section, and the sensor <b>arrangement</b> <b>is</b> arranged in the position space, thus measuring position/orientation of the handling unit in a simple and highly accurate manner without disturbing interferences...|$|R
