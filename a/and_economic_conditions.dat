The modularity of these works, such as the Dubiner House, provided an architectural precedent for the Habitat 67 project by Moshe Safdie.|$|E

5|$|With city jobs {{moved to}} the towns and villages around Utica during the {{suburbanization}} of the postwar period. This led {{to the expansion of}} the nearby Town of New Hartford and the village of Whitesboro. Utica's lack of quality academic and educational choices, when compared to Syracuse under an hour away, contributed to its decline in local businesses and jobs as some economic activity moved to Syracuse during the 1990s. Utica's population fell while population in the county increased, reflecting a statewide trend of decreasing urban populations outside New York City. Residents who remain in the city struggle to handle poverty issues stemming from social <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>conditions</b> caused partially by a smaller tax base; this adversely affects schools and public services.|$|E
