In late 2006 a group of community activists <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> living near the bridge created the Fremont Individuals and Employees Nonprofit to Decrease Suicides (FRIENDS), their primary focus being the installation of a suicide barrier on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{demands of}} the SA for more {{political}} and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders.</b> In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who—along {{with a number of}} Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher)—were rounded up, arrested and shot.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} United Nations headquarters, the Swiss Confederation is host to many UN agencies, like the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and about 200 other {{international}} organisations, including the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization. The annual {{meetings of the}} World Economic Forum in Davos bring together top international business <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> from Switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world, including health and the environment. Additionally {{the headquarters of the}} Bank for International Settlements (BIS) are located in Basel since 1930.|$|E

5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders.</b> Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt drew {{criticism}} {{in recent years}} for some of his business activities. In 2002, he lobbied business <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> to support Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Willamette Industries, Inc., then the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in Portland. In early 2004, he backed a purchase of Portland General Electric (PGE) by Texas Pacific Group which, though never consummated, put on hold city and county studies to acquire PGE by condemnation. Criticism of Goldschmidt's business activities peaked when, on November 13, 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski nominated him to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E

5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{names of}} Florida's {{counties}} reflect its diverse cultural heritage. Some are named for Confederate {{political leaders and}} Spanish explorers, marking the influence of Spanish sovereignty, while others are named for Spanish saints, Native American placenames used by the Spanish, <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> of the United States. Natural features of the region, including rivers, lakes, and flora, are also commonly used for county names. Florida has counties named for participants {{on both sides of}} Second Seminole War: Miami-Dade County is partially named for Francis L. Dade, a Major in the U.S. Army at the time; Osceola County is named for a Native American resistance leader during the war.|$|E
5|$|After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan {{formally}} went to war. When the Kuomintang and Communist Party {{declared a}} united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the united front should {{be used as a}} feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> at the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|As {{with various}} other ethnic {{minorities}} {{who lived in}} the Soviet Union under Stalin, tens of thousands of Armenians were executed or deported. In 1936, Beria and Stalin worked to deport Armenians to Siberia in an attempt to bring Armenia's population under 700,000 in order to justify an annexation into Georgia. Under Beria's command, police terror was used to strengthen the party's political hold on the population and suppress all expressions of nationalism. Many writers, artists, scientists <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders,</b> including the writer Axel Bakunts and the celebrated poet Yeghishe Charents, were executed or forced into exile. Additionally, in 1944, roughly 200,000Hamshenis (Sunni Muslim Armenians who live near the Black Sea coastal regions of Russia, Georgia and Turkey) were deported from Georgia to areas of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Further deportations of Armenians from the coastal region occurred in 1948, when 58,000 alleged supporters of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and Greeks were forced to move to Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} June, {{the other}} parties had been intimidated into disbanding. This {{included}} the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA's help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany. The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders.</b> In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along {{with a number of}} Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot. While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the murders, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipbuilding}} industry {{expanded by}} a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 {{and it did not}} fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions.

5|$|Subsequently, the {{legislature}} and local press started questioning {{the actions of the}} Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy, asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter's (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter’s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló’s and Civiletti’s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.|$|E
