5000|$|Unlike Coleridge's usual {{approach}} to his poetry, {{he did not}} mention the poem in letters to his friends. The first written record of the poem is in Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, October 1798. It is possible that the poem was recited to his friends during this time and was kept for private use instead of publication. However, the exact date of the poem is uncertain because Coleridge normally dated his poems but did not date Kubla Khan. Coleridge did write to John Thelwall, 14 October 1797, to describe his feelings related to those expressed in the poem:I should much wish, like the Indian Vishna, to float about along an infinite ocean cradled in the flower of the Lotos, & wake once in a million years for a few minutes - just to know I was going to sleep a million years more ... I can at times feel strong the beauties, you describe, in themselves, & for themselves - but more frequently all things appear little - all the knowledge, that can be acquired, child's play - the universe itself - what but an immense heap of little things? ...

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1797, Coleridge {{was fascinated}} {{with the idea of}} a river and it was used in {{multiple}} poems including [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and [...] "The Brook". In his Biographia Literaria (1817), he explained, [...] "I sought for a subject, that should give equal room and freedom for description, incident, and impassioned reflections on men, nature, and society, yet supply in itself a natural connection to the parts and unity to the whole. Such a subject I conceived myself to have found in a stream, traced from its source in the hills among the yellow-red moss and conical glass-shaped tufts of bent, to the first break or fall, where its drops become audible, and it begins to form a channel". It is possible that the imagery of Biographia Literaria followed the recovery of the [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] manuscript during the composition of the book. Water imagery permeated through many of his poems, and the coast that he witnessed on his journey to Linton appears in Osorio. Additionally, many of the images are connected to a broad use of <b>Ash</b> <b>Farm</b> and the Quantocks in Coleridge's poetry, and the mystical settings of both Osorio and [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] are based on his idealised version of the region. [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] was composed in the same year as This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, and both poems contained images that were used in the 14 October 1797 letter to Thelwall. However, the styles are very different as one is heavily structured and rhymed while the other tries to mimic conversational speech. What they do have in common is that they use scenery based on the same location, including repeated uses of dells, rocks, ferns, and a waterfall found in the Somerset region. The Preface uses water imagery to explain what happens when visions are lost by quoting a passage from his poem The Picture. When considering all of The Picture and not just the excerpt, Coleridge describes how inspiration is similar to a stream and that if an object is thrown into it the vision is interrupted.|$|R

While the Tilligerry Peninsula is geographically closer to major centres such as Sydney and Newcastle, it lacks the urban development that has occurred on the much larger (25 km2 vs 115 km2 respectively) Tomaree peninsula. Although Lemon Tree Passage, on the Tilligerry Peninsula, and Soldiers Point, on the Tomaree Peninsula, are only 2.9 km from each other, physical separation of the suburbs by Port Stephens and Tilligerry Creek results in them being almost 40 km from each other by road.|$|R

50|$|The {{source of}} the River Mun can be found next to Craft Lane, close to Furyhill {{plantation}} between Northrepps and the hamlet of Frogshall. It runs in a south easterly direction through a wooded valley and passes under Craft Lane close to Frogshall Farm House. From here it runs through woodland for a short distance and into a large pool called Little Broad. From Little Broad, still in woodland, the river falls over a weir and into some marshy woodland known as Osier Carr. Deep {{in the heart of}} Osier Carr Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) can be found. The mussels are filter feeders, removing phytoplankton and other suspended particulate matter from the river. This removal of suspended matter from the water is often considered ecologically desirable, as it reduces phytoplankton blooms and in the treatment of drinking water. The river now passes under another lane from Sidestrand. From here the river feeds a system of ponds and sluices in an area known as the Grove. Many drains feed into the river here. The river now turns almost south and passes under another lane called Cromer Road and crosses countryside towards <b>Ash</b> Tree <b>Farm</b> and <b>Ash</b> Plantation. The river now widens slightly and begins to cross open countryside, slowly turning south east again. Along this section the Mun runs adjacent to several small reservoirs and ponds and drains.|$|R

40|$|Intensification of agriculture, {{combined}} with poor agronomic practices {{have increased the}} incidence of plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) and other soil pathogens in East Africa, which consequently affects crop productivity in small holder farms. The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the effectiveness of farming systems in management of PPN and to recommend the best practice to farmers. Therefore, two field trials were established, one in farmer fields and one on-station, using maize (Zea mays L.), intercropped with beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and in rotation with beans as a sole crop. Organic farming (that received compost, Tithonia diversifolia and neem cake (Azadirachta indica)) was compared to conventional farming (that received fertilizer and nematicide), farmer practice (that received manure, Tithonia diversifolia and wood <b>ash),</b> and a <b>farm</b> with no input application (control). After three years of continuous cultivation, twelve genera of PPN were recovered from soil and/or root samples from the trials. Under inter- and sole-cropping at both sites, the abundance of PPN including Pratylenchus and Meloidogyne were significantly reduced in the organic system compared to the conventional, farmer practices and control. Organic farming was effective in reducing the genera of PPN below the control for a longer period (4 months) compared to conventional farming and farmer practice (2 months). The findings demonstrated the potential of organic farming in the suppression of PPN at the farmer level. Policy development and extension services can therefore consider organic farming as an alternative method in managing soil-borne nematodes in small holder farms in sub-Saharan Africa. However, further studies are required on other crops, in dry areas and the period to top-dress with organic amendments to assure effective suppression of PPN in organic farming.
