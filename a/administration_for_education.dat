40|$|Part 4 : What Educational Management Information Systems Are Already in Place?International audienceParents {{are able}} to choose the school their {{children}} will attend. Thus, a core task of the Berlin Senate <b>Administration</b> Office <b>for</b> <b>Education,</b> Youth and Science (SenBildJugWiss) is having optimally-resourced schools with the adequate number of teachers {{at the start of}} a school year. The project’s mission was to obtain accurate figures by efficiently processing data of approximately 320, 000 pupils from 700 schools. This processing included reporting on the various target groups of the SenBildJugWiss. The solution was to implement the OLAP-Database Palo as a management information system (MIS) tool. By doing so, it was important that an initial version was completed fairly swiftly to demonstrate main functions for future users, to highlight necessary adjustments for integration into the existing system, to define key performance indicators (KPIs) and their data sources, as well as creating the desired reports. One of the major challenges was creating a homogeneous data structure and harmonising the search and query language (SQL) tables. The outcome is a MIS that best fits the requirements, including meeting strict data protection regulations. The created reports provide, inter alia, the data delivery status required - the amount of pupils per class and schools eligible to gain certain levels of resources...|$|R
