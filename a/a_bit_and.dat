In short order, Gelsomina's naïve and antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches {{her to play}} the snare drum and trumpet, dance <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>and</b> clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E

I waited <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1989 and at {{the start}} of the 1990s, the {{popularity}} of synthpop was fading <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> losing fans to other momentum-gaining music genres at the time, such as hip hop, techno and alternative rock. After touring for the album finished, the band regained a five-man membership as guitarist Warren Cuccurullo and tour drummer Sterling Campbell were made full members of Duran Duran.|$|E

The first prototype was rebuilt this way, using a 94hp Cirrus III engine, receiving the markings: SP-AEE. In 1931, {{a series of}} 11 aircraft were built, for aeroclubs' orders. They received markings from SP-AFF to SP-AFP and SP-AGF. Most had Gipsy I engines. A price was 9,600 złoty (£380) for an airframe, plus 14,000 złoty (£560) for a Gipsy I engine.|$|E
25|$|The early Khrushchev era offered good {{opportunities}} for young film directors. Before 1953, annual film production {{was low and}} most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The Khrushchev Thaw relaxed Soviet social restrictions <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the Italian neorealists, French New Wave, and of directors such as Kurosawa, Buñuel, Bergman, Bresson, Andrzej Wajda (whose film Ashes and Diamonds influenced Tarkovsky) and Mizoguchi. Tarkovsky absorbed {{the idea of the}} auteur as a necessary condition for creativity.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of the East Greenland Current is the amount of sea ice it exports into the North Atlantic Ocean. It is a major pathway for sea ice to leave the Arctic. It is estimated that more than 90% of the Arctic Sea Ice exported from the Arctic takes place within the East Greenland Current. The volume of ice exported on an annual scale is a strong function of multiple atmospheric variables (wind, temperature, etc.) and oceanic variables and dynamics. There is a maximum of ice-flux export from October through December and a minimum from January to March. This interannual variability occurs because during the summer months the sea ice melts back quite <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>and</b> it results in a lot of drifting sea ice that can be easily exported through Fram Strait during the windy times of October through December. During the winter months, the sea ice refreezes together and thus the ability to have numerous sea ice drifts decreases due to the increase in overall sea ice extent. Essentially open water drifting decreases substantially during the winter months. The volume export ranges greatly from year to year. It can be as high as 5000nbsp&km3/year and as low as 1000nbsp&km3/year.|$|E

500|$|This story occurs {{some time}} after {{the events of the}} kinetic novel, as human civilization struggles in a losing battle against the {{poisonous}} rain.

Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. The two heavily criticized the episode for {{recycling}} story lines, writing, [...] "With the Syndicate destroyed, this episode was widely touted {{as the beginning of}} a fresh new mythology for the show. So why does watching it give such a strong sense of déjà vu?" [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris summarized the episode as [...] "if someone took the script to 'Anasazi'—one of the best X-Files episodes ever—changed the plot <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>and</b> then stripped it of virtually all human interest." ...|$|E

[...] Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com felt that [...] "...a visit from Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit", even an evil Tessa look-alike, is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan a moment or two to reflect on his recent lost love." ...|$|E

He is genuinely a nice guy and quite charming, so she could fall for him".|$|E
500|$|Rowntree {{stated that}} the band decided to give Coxon a much freer hand on Blur.

500|$|Ruby later becomes {{good friends}} with her music teacher Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead). They work closely {{together}} and Ruby develops feelings for him.

At this point Breeds said: [...] "She's matured <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> is exploring different parts of herself and love." [...] Through Liam she was [...] "realising something she's passionate about, and being encouraged in her creativity with her music." [...] It is the intoxication of the situation that has been misappropriated to Liam. Breeds opined they shared [...] "really strong chemistry emotionally and creatively." [...] She said Ruby is ignorant to the fact he is her teacher {{by virtue of the}} fact she is feeling [...] "headstrong and doesn't confine herself to boxes."

That same month, CBS released [...] "Remote Control" [...] as the debut LP's second single, defying the wishes of the band, who saw it as one of the album's weakest tracks. Headon's first recording with the band was the single [...] "Complete Control", which addressed the band's anger at their record label's behaviour. It was co-produced by famed reggae artist Lee [...] "Scratch" [...] Perry, though Foote was summoned to [...] "ground things" [...] <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> the result was pure punk rock.

500|$|Initially, {{the game}} had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark {{received}} many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton {{explained that they}} [...] "wanted {{to bring her back}} in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> make her more iconic." [...] However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, {{which was one of the}} first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, [...] "It was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest.

Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E

The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film".
