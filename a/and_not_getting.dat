25|$|The exact {{cause of}} {{narcolepsy}} is unknown with potentially several causes. In up to 10% of cases {{there is a}} family history of the disorder. Often those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide orexin which may be due to an autoimmune disorder. Trauma, infections, toxins, or psychological stress may also play a role. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies, after ruling out other potential causes. Excessive daytime sleepiness can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, major depressive disorder, anemia, heart failure, drinking alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> enough sleep. Cataplexy may be mistaken for seizures.|$|E
25|$|Barkley {{came under}} fire by some in 2006, due to his {{criticism}} of Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant. After Game 6 of the Lakers' first round series against the Phoenix Suns (when Bryant scored 50 points and the Lakers lost in overtime), Barkley criticized him for scoring too much <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> his teammates involved. After Game 7 of the same series (when Bryant did not score and hardly attempted any shots in the second half), Barkley ripped him for being unselfish. Some columnists thought that Barkley was being hypocritical. Bryant and Barkley exchanged several text messages about the issue, and during {{the second round of}} the playoffs, Bryant appeared on TNT's studio show. Bryant and Barkley had a mild debate about the issue, and some observers thought that Barkley was too easy on Bryant, considering his previous comments about him.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before his}} death in May 337, Constantine was baptised into Christianity. Up until this time he had been a catechuman for most of his adult life. He {{believed}} that if he waited to get baptized on his death bed he was in less danger of polluting his soul with sin <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> to heaven. He was baptized by his distant relative Arian Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia. During Eusebius of Nicomedia's time in the Imperial court, the Eastern court and the major positions in the Eastern Church were held by Arians or Arian sympathizers. With the exception of a short period of eclipse, Eusebius enjoyed the complete confidence both of Constantine and Constantius II and was the tutor of Emperor Julian the Apostate. After Constantine's death, his son and successor Constantius II was an Arian, as was Emperor Valens.|$|E

500|$|Later in 2004, McAdams starred {{opposite}} fellow Canadian Ryan Gosling in {{the romantic}} drama The Notebook, based on Nicholas Sparks' {{novel of the}} same name. She played Allie Hamilton, a wealthy southern belle who has a forbidden love affair with Gosling's poor labourer, Noah Calhoun. McAdams spent time in Charleston, South Carolina prior to filming to familiarize herself with the southern accent, and took ballet and etiquette classes. Filming took place from late 2002 to early 2003. Although McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked the film's director Nick Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was being uncooperative. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was won over by the [...] "beauty and clarity" [...] of McAdams's performance. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune declared her [...] "a real discovery" [...] who [...] "infuses young Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning ingénue grace and charm that breaks hearts". [...] The film grossed over $115million worldwide. McAdams won an MTV Movie Award and four Teen Choice Awards. Entertainment Weekly {{has said that the}} movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the Los Angeles Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses. The Notebook has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists. [...] "I'm so grateful to have a film that people respond to in that way", McAdams told Elle in 2011. [...] "It was a big deal." ...|$|E
500|$|Gosling {{came to the}} {{attention}} of a mainstream audience in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the romantic drama film The Notebook, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, directed by Nick Cassavetes. Gosling portrayed Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: [...] "It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative." [...] Gosling sought to imbue his character with [...] "quiet strength" [...] and was inspired by the performance of Sam Shepard in Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook. Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003. Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was uncooperative. The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads and noted that, [...] "against your better judgment, you root for the pair to beat the odds against them." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's [...] "beguiling unaffectedness" [...] and noted that [...] "it's hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together". The film grossed over $115 million worldwide. Gosling won four Teen Choice Awards and an MTV Movie Award.

The title's creative director, Chris Metzen, acknowledged that parts of Overwatch, such as maps, share [...] "continuity" [...] with Titan. Citing a desire to keep its game styles [...] "simple", and because it contradicted its emphasis on accomplishing goals as a team rather than trying to achieve large numbers of kills, Overwatch does not contain a traditional deathmatch mode. Metzen stated that [...] "we have a long legacy of developing multiplayer games, and it came down to 'is it even possible to build a shooter that doesn't feel cynical, that doesn't feel cruel, that doesn't feel nasty?

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Eagle Eye a {{score of}} two stars out of four, saying: [...] "The word 'preposterous' is too {{moderate}} to describe Eagle Eye. This film contains not a single plausible moment after the opening sequence, and that's borderline. It's not an assault on intelligence. It's an assault on consciousness." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of four, saying: [...] "This movie tests the viewing public's tolerance for enduring crass stupidity when the payoff is a series of repetitive, ADD-infected chase scenes. Director D.J. Caruso does a moderately good job of hiding how incredibly dumb this screenplay is by keeping things moving at such a whirlwind pace that a lot more seems to be happening than actually is. In reality, the chase scenes don't mean anything because they don't advance the plot—it's mice on a treadmill, running and running <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> anywhere."
