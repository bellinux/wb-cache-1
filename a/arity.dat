Introduction. In his seminal work [20] Lawvere constructed for every variety of algebras, defined by finitary operations and relations on sets, an algebraic theory whose n-ary operations are the elements of the free algebra on n elements. He showed that the variety of algebras is equivalent to the category of models of the associated algebrai...|$|R

40|$|Monads are of {{interest}} both in semantics and in higher dimensional algebra. It {{turns out that the}} idea behind usual notion finitary monads (whose values on all sets can be computed from their values on finite sets) extends to a more general class of monads called monads with <b>arities,</b> so that not only algebraic theories can be computed from a proper set of <b>arities,</b> but also more general structures like n-categories, the computing process being realized using Kan extensions. This Master thesis compiles the required material in order to understand this question of <b>arities</b> and reconstruction of monads, and tries to give some examples of relevant interest from both semantics and higher category theory. A discussion on the promising field of operads is then provided as appendix. Comment: 65 pages, this is a survey made for a Master thesi...|$|R
25|$|A {{family is}} indexed by an index set. In {{the case of}} a family of {{operations}} forming an algebra, the indices are called operation symbols, constituting the language of that algebra. The operation indexed by each symbol is called the denotation or interpretation of that symbol. Each operation symbol specifies the <b>arity</b> of its interpretation, whence all possible interpretations of a symbol have the same <b>arity.</b> In general it is possible for an algebra to interpret distinct symbols with the same operation, {{but this is not the}} case for the prototype, whose symbols are in one-one correspondence with its operations. The prototype therefore has 22n n-ary operation symbols, called the Boolean operation symbols and forming the language of Boolean algebra. Only a few operations have conventional symbols, such as ¬ for negation, ∧ for conjunction, and ∨ for disjunction. It is convenient to consider the i-th n-ary symbol to be n'f'i as done below in the section on truth tables.|$|E
25|$|Unlike propositional logic, first-order {{logic is}} {{undecidable}} (although semidecidable), {{provided that the}} language {{has at least one}} predicate of <b>arity</b> at least 2 (other than equality). This means that there is no decision procedure that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid. This result was established independently by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing in 1936 and 1937, respectively, giving a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Their proofs demonstrate a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first-order logic and the unsolvability of the halting problem.|$|E
25|$|Another infinitary class {{intermediate}} between Boolean algebras {{and complete}} Boolean algebras {{is the notion}} of a sigma-algebra. This is defined analogously to complete Boolean algebras, but with sups and infs limited to countable <b>arity.</b> That is, a sigma-algebra is a Boolean algebra with all countable sups and infs. Because the sups and infs are of bounded cardinality, unlike the situation with complete Boolean algebras, the Gaifman-Hales result does not apply and free sigma-algebras do exist. Unlike the situation with CABAs however, the free countably generated sigma algebra is not a power set algebra.|$|E
40|$|We give an {{abstract}} categorical treatment of Plonka sums and products using lax and oplax morphisms of monads. Plonka sums were originally defined as operations on algebras of regular theories. Their <b>arities</b> are sup-semilattices. It {{turns out that}} even more general operations {{are available on the}} categories of algebras of semi-analytic monads. Their <b>arities</b> are the categories of the regular polynomials over any sup-semilattice, i. e. any algebra for the terminal semi-analytic monad. We also show that similar operations can be defined on any category of algebras of any analytic monad. This time we can allow the <b>arities</b> to be the categories of linear polynomials over any commutative monoid, i. e. any algebra for the terminal analytic monad. There are also dual operations of Plonka products. They can be defined on Kleisli categories of commutative monads. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

25|$|In {{mathematical}} logic, {{very often}} symbols {{are not allowed}} to be nullary, so that constant symbols must be treated separately rather than as nullary function symbols. They form a set Sconst disjoint from Sfunc, on which the <b>arity</b> function ar is not defined. However, this only serves to complicate matters, especially in proofs by induction over the structure of a formula, where an additional case must be considered. Any nullary relation symbol, which is also not allowed under such a definition, can be emulated by a unary relation symbol together with a sentence expressing that its value is the same for all elements. This translation fails only for empty structures (which are often excluded by convention). If nullary symbols are allowed, then every formula of propositional logic is also a formula of first-order logic.|$|E
