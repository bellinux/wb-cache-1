5|$|Always a tomboy, James quickly {{developed}} {{an interest in}} sports. Her godfather gave her a baseball bat and glove to celebrate her first holy communion. She excelled at hockey, baseball and synchronized swimming as a young child. Her mother wanted her to focus on swimming {{due to the lack}} of opportunities for girls in hockey in the 1970s. Her passion was for hockey, however, and she was constantly playing ball hockey with the neighbourhood boys from the time she was in kindergarten. James first played organized hockey in a Flemingdon Park boys house league at the age of eight, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> after her mother threatened legal action as officials opposed her inclusion.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less {{abundant in the}} crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per million of the Earth's crustal rocks, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It {{is significantly}} more abundant in the oceans, resulting from long-term leaching. There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% bromide ions. It is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's {{development}} as an interdisciplinary subject, {{research in the}} field is conducted by investigators trained {{in a wide range of}} disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> as a secondary category.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 primary was {{so close}} it forced a recount and {{prompted}} a lawsuit. When Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft dismissed Miller's charges of voting irregularities in Highland, Hocking and Warren counties, Miller filed suit in the Ohio Supreme Court. Miller dropped his court challenge in August <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> because his campaign treasury was exhausted. In the final count, McEwen won 33,219 votes to Miller's 32,922, a plurality of 297 votes. In the end, McEwen's geographic advantage (he retained 59% of his old territory) put him over the top. Ominously, however, Miller trounced him in the five counties {{that had been in}} Miller's old district.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} had star billing for seven major roles. Mischa Barton as Marissa, Rachel Bilson as Summer, Adam Brody as Seth, Melinda Clarke as Julie, Peter Gallagher as Sandy, Benjamin McKenzie as Ryan, and Kelly Rowan as Kirsten all {{returned}} to the main cast. Former main cast member Alan Dale did not return due to his character, Caleb, dying {{at the end of}} the second season, while Tate Donovan, as Jimmy Cooper, returned only in a recurring role, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> for the first three episodes of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>only</b> for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching. A FUTURO III regional course men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008. In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country. In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, 2007 it was {{announced}} that Crisis Core would be released in North America on March 25, 2008. If pre-ordered from certain retailers, such as GameStop, the buyer may receive a Shinra UMD case, depending on how long supplies lasted; if pre-ordered from Best Buy, the buyer may receive Crisis Core with a metallic foil cover. Two versions of the game were released in Europe: a standard edition, and a limited edition, which was only available online, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> when pre-ordered. This limited edition included special slipcase packaging and a book of promotional CG artwork entitled The Art of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. In Europe, a bundle containing the game and the limited edition Crisis Core-engraved silver PlayStation Portable was released on June 20. As with several games from the company, Square released an Ultimania guidebook in Japan, on October 18, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The end {{came first}} for Virginia. Because the {{blockade}} was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic {{use to the}} Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. Virginias draft was too great to permit her to pass up the river, which had a depth of only , <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, {{and then she was}} set afire. She burned {{through the rest of the}} day and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.|$|E

25|$|On 15 September 1917, {{shortly after}} promulgating the 1917 code, Benedict XV promulgated the motu proprio Cum Iuris Canonici, which forbade the Roman Congregations from issuing new general decrees {{unless it was}} {{necessary}} to do so, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> after consulting the Pontifical Commission charged with amending the code. The congregations were instead to issue Instructions on the canons of the code, and {{to make it clear that}} they were elucidating particular canons of the code. This was done so as not to make the code obsolete soon after it was promulgated. The 1917 Code was very rarely amended, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>only</b> slightly.|$|E
