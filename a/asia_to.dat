5|$|The {{majority}} of SEATO members were not located in Southeast <b>Asia.</b> <b>To</b> Australia and New Zealand, SEATO {{was seen as}} a more satisfying organization than ANZUS – a collective defense organization with the U.S. The United Kingdom and France joined partly due to having long maintained colonies in the region, and partly due to concerns over developments in Indochina. Pakistan, however, was simply interested in joining over the appeal of potential support for its long struggle against India. Last but not least, the U.S. upon perceiving Southeast <b>Asia</b> <b>to</b> be a pivotal frontier for Cold War geopolitics saw the establishment of SEATO as essential to its Cold War containment policy.|$|E

The Parthian {{encroachment}} {{in an area}} regarded as lying within the Roman sphere of influence worried the Roman leadership, and was widely seen as a major test of the new emperor's ability.

Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late Jurassic period than previously thought, and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E

5|$|After being {{occupied}} with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas {{throughout the year}} 970, Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus', moving his troops from <b>Asia</b> <b>to</b> Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment. The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops to effect a landing in the enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E

Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.|$|E
