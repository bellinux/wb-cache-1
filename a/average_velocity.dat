5|$|Circinus is {{the radiant}} of an annual meteor shower, the Alpha Circinids (ACI). First {{observed}} in Queensland in 1977, the meteors have an <b>average</b> <b>velocity</b> of 27.1km/s and {{are thought to}} be associated with a long-period comet. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.|$|E
5|$|Planetesimals {{within the}} region which would become the {{asteroid}} belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the <b>average</b> <b>velocity</b> of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in xenon gas (169m/s) is less than that in air because the <b>average</b> <b>velocity</b> of the heavy xenon atoms is {{less than that of}} {{nitrogen}} and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E

40|$|Darcy's {{law and the}} Brinkman {{equation}} are {{two main}} models used for creeping fluid flows inside moving permeable particles. For these two models, the time derivative and the nonlinear convective terms of fluid velocity are neglected in the momentum equation. In this paper, a new momentum equation including these two terms are rigorously derived from the pore-scale microscopic equations by the volume-averaging method, which can reduces to Darcy's law and the Brinkman equation under creeping flow conditions. Using the lattice Boltzmann equation method, the macroscopic equations are solved for the problem of a porous circular cylinder moving along the centerline of a channel. Galilean invariance of the equations are investigated both with the intrinsic phase <b>averaged</b> <b>velocity</b> and the phase <b>averaged</b> <b>velocity.</b> The results demonstrate that the commonly used phase <b>averaged</b> <b>velocity</b> cannot serve as the superficial velocity, while the intrinsic phase <b>averaged</b> <b>velocity</b> should be chosen for porous particulate systems...|$|R

25|$|The {{retardation}} {{factor is}} another very important feature {{that make the}} motion of the contaminant to deviate from the average groundwater motion. It is analogous to the retardation factor of chromatography. Unlike diffusion and dispersion, which simply spread the contaminant, the retardation factor changes its global <b>average</b> <b>velocity,</b> {{so that it can be}} much slower than that of water. This is due to a chemico-physical effect: the adsorption to the soil, which holds the contaminant back and does not allow it to progress until the quantity corresponding to the chemical adsorption equilibrium has been adsorbed. This effect is particularly important for less soluble contaminants, which thus can move even hundreds or thousands times slower than water. The effect of this phenomenon is that only more soluble species can cover long distances. The retardation factor depends on the chemical nature of both the contaminant and the aquifer.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{secondary}} flow is essential for predictions about the morphology of alluvial bottoms in tidal channels. In this research the determination of {{the secondary}} flow is based on a known depth <b>averaged</b> <b>velocity</b> field. The depth <b>averaged</b> <b>velocities</b> must be computed with a high accuracy in order to make possible a reasonable determination {{of the secondary}} flow. The depth <b>averaged</b> <b>velocities</b> are computed from the shallow water equations. These equations are solved by means of an implicit finite difference method of the ADI-type. The reproduction of the depth averaged flow with the generally used partly explicit ADI-method appeared not to be usabIe for the flow in tidal channels, because of a large diffusion coefficient, required to obtain stability. In this report a fully implicit ADI-method is considered. The simulation of the steady flow in a curved flume with the geometrical proportions of a river is compared to measurements. The reproduction of the depth <b>averaged</b> <b>velocity</b> field is satisfactory. A disturbance connected with the irregular numerical representation of the sidewalls will be much smaller in a tidal channel. The secondary flow, assumed fully developed, is computed, based on this depth <b>averaged</b> <b>velocity,</b> and compared to the measurements. The agreement is reasonable, especially when the narrowness of the flume and the connected severe influence of the disturbances at the sidewalls on the radius of curvature of the flow is considered.
