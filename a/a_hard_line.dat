5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he would sign if offered a $1.8 million signing bonus, which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
5|$|In November 1815, Louis XVIII's {{government}} had to sign another Treaty of Paris that formally ended Napoleon's Hundred Days. The previous treaty had been quite favourable to France, but this one took <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line.</b> France's borders were retracted to their extent at 1790. France {{had to pay for}} an army to occupy her, for at least five years, at a cost of 150million francs per year. France also had to pay a war indemnity of 700million francs to the allies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Welsh hopes of {{advancing}} the cause of female suffrage centred around the Liberal Party and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, {{one of the most}} important Welsh politicians of the day. After Liberal success in the 1906 Election failed to materialise into political change, suffragettes and in particular members of the more militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), took <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> stance towards their Members of Parliament, engaging in direct action against them.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{turned out}} in major cities across Egypt on the 25th, {{especially}} in Cairo's Tahrir Square. In the beginning, tensions were high between the police and protesters with violence breaking out in Suez and Alexandria. The government took <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line,</b> using riot-control tactics, and shutting down communications; But by the 28th the protests were continuing and the police had retreated. The security role {{was taken over by}} the military, and from then on the situation remained almost entirely peaceful. As pressure rose on Mubarak, the scale of the protests continued to grow, especially on specially organized Friday rallies.|$|E
5|$|U.S.-Soviet {{relations}} took a {{turn for}} the worse with the Soviet’s arrest of U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff, evidently for use as a bargaining chip in response to the August 30, 1986 arrest of suspected KGB agent Gennadiy Zakharov. Since Daniloff was not engaged in espionage, Matlock advised taking <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> with the Soviets. While charges against Daniloff were dropped, a diplomatic row ensued, leading by the end of October, to the expulsion of 100 Soviets, including 80 suspected intelligence officers. The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow, along with all 260 of the Russian support staff.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, the {{projects}} were {{often cited as}} among the country's most dangerous.

5|$|Mathias officially {{declared}} his candidacy for the Senate on February 10, 1968, calling for troop {{reductions in the}} Vietnam War, and identifying urban blight, racial discrimination, welfare reform, and improving public schools as major issues. As the campaign drew on, the two primary issues became the war and crime. Mathias argued that the extensive bombing campaigns in North Vietnam should be reduced, while Brewster had argued for increasing bombardment. Brewster adopted <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> stance on law and order, while Mathias advocated addressing the precipitating causes of poverty and the low standard of living in urban ghettos. Campaign finances were also an issue, with controversy erupting over Brewster's receipt of $15,000 in campaign contributions from his Senate staff and their families. On November 5, 1968, Mathias was elected, garnering 48% of the vote to Brewster's 39% and perennial candidate George P. Mahoney's 13%.|$|E
5|$|Smith had {{to conduct}} {{another set of}} {{surrender}} negotiations, that of the German armed forces, in May 1945. Smith met with {{the representatives of the}} German High Command (the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), Colonel General Alfred Jodl and General-Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as an interpreter. Smith took <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line,</b> threatening that unless terms were accepted, the Allies would seal the front, thus forcing the remaining Germans {{into the hands of the}} Red Army, but he made some concessions regarding a ceasefire before the surrender came into effect. On May 7, Smith signed the surrender document, along with the French representative, Major General François Sevez, and the Soviet Susloparov.|$|E
5|$|The government, {{represented}} by Lord Irwin, decided {{to negotiate with}} Gandhi. The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, {{in return for the}} suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.|$|E
50|$|On migrant policy, Doskozil has {{at times}} adopted <b>an</b> <b>harder</b> <b>line</b> than his {{predecessor}} Gerald Klug.

5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, {{and he said that he}} wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan pursued <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming {{it to be}} puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country {{to reduce the number of}} American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{there was}} {{public support for}} <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> against North Korea during {{increased}} tensions, but the support declined by 2011.

5|$|In late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey {{investigators}} foiled a plot {{to assassinate}} Booker led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons.

50|$|The Decree against Communism is a 1949 Papal decree which excommunicates all Catholics collaborating in {{communist}} organizations. The Vatican, {{having been}} silent {{during the war}} on communist excesses, displayed <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>line</b> on communism after 1945.

25|$|Civil liberties were {{of small}} concern in North and South. Lincoln and Davis both took <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>line</b> against dissent.
