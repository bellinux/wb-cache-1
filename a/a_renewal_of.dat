5|$|Kenyatta {{was also}} an elitist and {{encouraged}} {{the emergence of an}} elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> ancient feuds {{that same}} year, Sigtrygg {{executed}} Ragnall King of Waterford, in Dublin Ragnall was {{the grandson of}} the Ivar, Sigtrygg's earliest rival, who had contested for Dublin decades before. Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of the Isles forced Sigtrygg to abdicate in 1036. Sigtrygg died in exile, at an unknown place, in 1042.|$|E
5|$|Such {{efforts were}} premature, {{and did not}} succeed; only 24,000 Jews were living in Palestine {{on the eve of}} the {{emergence}} of Zionism within the world's Jewish communities in the last two decades of the 19th century. With the geopolitical shakeup occasioned by the outbreak of World War I, the earlier calculations, which had lapsed for some time, led to <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> strategic assessments and political bargaining over the Middle and Far East.|$|E
5000|$|Ida Higgins was {{identified}} as the wife of Billy Higgins in a filing for <b>a</b> copyright <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> [...] "There'll Be Some Changes Made" [...] in 1942. Rebecca McCollough, whose relationship to Higgins is not known, also filed for <b>a</b> copyright <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> [...] "There'll Be Some Changes Made" [...] in 1942.|$|R

5|$|With ESPN's College GameDay in town, Alabama {{defeated}} the Penn State Nittany Lions 24–3 in <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> their historic rivalry. Alabama scored first on a 36-yard touchdown pass from Greg McElroy to Kevin Norwood {{in the first}} quarter. The Crimson Tide added to their lead {{in the second quarter}} with a 14-yard McElroy touchdown pass to Preston Dial and a 31-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal to take a 17–0 lead at the half. After a scoreless third, Trent Richardson scored on a one-yard run and Penn State's Collin Wagner hit a 36-yard field goal to make the final score to 24–3.|$|E
5|$|With the re-unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Ahmose, <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> royal {{support for}} the arts and monumental {{construction}} occurred. Ahmose reportedly devoted a tenth of all the productive output towards the service of the traditional gods, reviving massive monumental constructions as well as the arts. However, as the defeat of the Hyksos occurred relatively late in Ahmose's reign, his subsequent building program likely lasted no more than seven years, and much of what was started was probably finished by his son and successor Amenhotep I.|$|E
5|$|Aziz al-Dawla's {{replacements}} were {{challenged by}} Salih and chaos prevailed in Aleppo. In 1023, Salih entered the Kilab into a military {{pact with the}} Banu Tayy of Transjordan and the Banu Kalb of central Syria, both of which opposed direct Fatimid rule. Medieval historian Yahya al-Antaki relates that the alliance was <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> a previous pact made by the same parties in circa 1021, during which they rebelled and ultimately reconciled with the new Fatimid caliph, az-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who took power {{in the aftermath of}} Caliph al-Hakim's disappearance in 1021. However, the reconciliation unraveled by 1023 due to the Tayy's conflict with Palestine's Fatimid governor, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, which prompted the respective chieftains of Tayy and Kalb, Hassan ibn Mufarrij and Sinan ibn Ulayyan, to meet with Salih at the outskirts of Aleppo and renew the alliance.|$|E

25|$|Most Baptists {{consider}} the Communion to be primarily {{an act of}} remembrance of Christ's atonement, and <b>a</b> time <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> personal commitment.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a couple}} has {{received}} a dispensation, the partners may validate the marriage by <b>a</b> simple <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> consent according to canonical form as a new act of the will. [...] When the impediment had affected {{only one of the}} parties and the other was unaware of the impediment, only the one aware of the impediment must renew consent. [...] If the impediment is known to both parties, or the impediment is public, then <b>a</b> public <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> consent by both parties is required.|$|R
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E
5|$|Heinz Field is {{a stadium}} {{located in the}} North Shore {{neighborhood}} of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It primarily serves as the home to the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) and the Pittsburgh Panthers of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The stadium opened in 2001, after the controlled implosion of the teams' previous stadium, Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium is named for the locally based H. J. Heinz Company, which purchased the naming rights in 2001. It hosted the 2011 NHL Winter Classic between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals on January 1, 2011. On September 10, 2016, it hosted the Keystone Classic, which featured <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the Penn State-Pitt football rivalry, setting a new attendance record at 69,983 people. In 2017 it hosted the Coors Light Stadium Series game featuring the Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
5|$|In 1232 {{the castle}} was {{inherited}} by John's son, William de Braose, {{and in turn}} his son, also called William. In {{the second half of}} the century, Wales saw <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fighting, and the castle was attacked again in 1251. The decision was taken to improve the castle's defences and, as part of this, a square, stone tower was added to the castle to provide living accommodation, with three chambers, the first floor containing a garderobe and a fireplace. A gateway was constructed through the curtain wall just to the south of the tower. Two further stone buildings were constructed within the castle walls.|$|E
50|$|If the {{impediment}} to a {{marriage is a}} defective consent by one or both parties, <b>a</b> simple <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> consent removes the impediment and can effect validation.|$|R
50|$|In 1580, {{cardinal}} Carlo Borromeo ordered <b>a</b> complete <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the icanttype church: {{the date}} on the architrave, 1585, suggests this was completed {{in a relatively short}} time.|$|R
50|$|In autumn 2014, Heyne wrote {{together}} with the German art critic Ralf Hanselle the Manifesto of Tabularism. It advocates <b>a</b> radical <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the photographic medium in contemporary art.|$|R
5|$|In October 1886 Britain {{declared}} the Line {{to be the}} provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. Proposals for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> relations and settlement of the dispute failed repeatedly, and by summer 1894, diplomatic relations had been severed for seven years, the dispute having dragged on for half a century. In addition, both sides had established police or military stations at key points in the area, partly to defend claims to the Caratal goldfield of the region's Yuruari basin, which was within Venezuelan territory but claimed by the British. The mine at El Callao, started in 1871, was for a time {{one of the richest}} in the world, and the goldfields as a whole saw over a million ounces exported between 1860 and 1883. The gold mining was dominated by immigrants from the British Isles and the British West Indies, giving an appearance of almost creating an English colony on Venezuelan territory.|$|E
5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be issued an {{identity}} card, one needs to fill in a form, which {{should be taken to}} the Identity Documents and Passport Regime Units within the District Police Stations. The forms could be obtained at all District Police Stations. When applying the name, gender, date and place of birth, digital image, ten fingerprints, palmprints, and an electronic signature in a JPEG2000 format are taken. First-time appliers must also provide a valid birth certificate. It is possible for a person to apply for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the ID card via a representative with a notary signed permit, provided there are no significant changes in his or hers appearance. There are, however limitations. If you apply via a representative, you must receive the new ID yourself. Vice versa, if you applied yourself, then an authorized representative may receive your ID. This does not apply to applying for passports, as fingerprints must be taken.|$|E
50|$|Most Baptists do not {{consider}} the Communion or its elements to be sacramental; rather, it {{is considered to be}} an act of remembrance of Christ's atonement, and <b>a</b> time <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> personal commitment.|$|R
50|$|During the 1830s, <b>a</b> general <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> {{the town}} {{led to the}} {{construction}} of new streets and squares. Also, building lots were developed for industrial expansion, and dilapidated buildings were demolished.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> curious feature <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> {{processes}} {{is that if}} we wait some predetermined time t {{and then}} observe how large the renewal interval containing t is, we should expect it to be typically larger than <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> interval <b>of</b> average size.|$|R
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{decaying}} {{infrastructure and}} {{the withdrawal of}} subsidies brought {{the future of the}} line into doubt. As one of its last acts the Greater London Council paid for the replacement of two bridges on the line, allowing operations to continue. The centenary of the line in 1989 saw <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> interest and an upgrading of the trains between Chalfont& Latimer and London Marylebone station made commuting more practical, and usage of the line stabilised. The introduction of London Underground S Stock in 2010 led to the replacement of the shuttle service with half-hourly through trains to and from London.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus proved {{themselves}} to be as incompetent as Caesar had hoped. Clodius terrorized the city with his armed gangs, and agitated Pompey {{to such a degree}} that Pompey was able to secure the passage of a law in 57 BC which recalled Cicero from his exile. This was more of a triumph for the senate than it was for Pompey, however, since Pompey was allied with Caesar. Pompey was so inept that the senate decided to override him, and rescind the land laws that Caesar had passed in 59 BC for Pompey's veterans. This forced <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the triumvirate: Pompey and Crassus were promised the Consulship in 55 BC and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, soon died in childbirth, and a year later, Crassus was killed during his invasion of the Parthian Empire. These two events severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.|$|E

5|$|Richard rewarded Longchamp {{with the}} custody of Eye and an {{appointment}} as Sheriff of Essex and Sheriff of Hertfordshire when the pair returned to England, but Longchamp soon became embroiled in <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> his disagreement with Archbishop Geoffrey of York. Richard left England in May 1194, and Longchamp accompanied him to the continent, never to return to England; Longchamp returned to the Emperor's court in 1195. Richard continued to use Longchamp in diplomacy—although it was Geoffrey who arranged a truce with King Philip in 1194—as well as retaining the bishop as chancellor, but the main power in England was now Hubert Walter. Longchamp {{spent the rest of}} his life outside his diocese, usually accompanying the king.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, a {{delivery}} from Larwood knocked Woodfull's bat {{from his hands}} and the Australian captain seemed unsettled. Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having been struck by short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted {{for an hour and}} a half. When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> protest. In later years, Woodfull's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Campo Formio, {{signed on}} 18 October 1797, {{resulted}} in another {{short period of}} relative peace. The Legions, hopeful for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the war, were seen as the most pro-French foreign forces in the Cisapline. In May 1798 the Poles helped the French to secure the Papal States, putting down some peasant revolts, and garrisoned Rome, which they entered on 3 May. Dąbrowski obtained a number of trophies from a Roman representative, that the Polish king, Jan III Sobieski, had sent there after his victory over the Ottoman Empire at the siege of Vienna in 1683; amongst these was an Ottoman standard which subsequently {{became part of the}} Legions' colors, accompanying them from then on.|$|E

50|$|The modern {{concept of}} {{copyright}} originated in England, {{in the year}} 1710, with the Statute of Anne. Under the Statute of Anne (1710), copyright term lasted 14 years plus <b>an</b> optional <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> 14 additional years.|$|R
