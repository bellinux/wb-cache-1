25|$|Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL) {{the only}} legally {{recognized}} party of Bangladesh founded on 7 June 1975 following the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh. Mujib's government soon began encountering increased dissatisfaction and unrest. His programs of nationalization and industrial socialism suffered {{from lack of}} trained personnel, inefficiency, rampant corruption, and poor leadership. Mujib focused almost entirely on national issues and thus neglected local issues and government. The party and central government exercised full control and democracy was weakened, with virtually no elections organized <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> roots or local levels. Political opposition included communists as well as Islamic fundamentalists, who were angered by the declaration of a secular state. Mujib was criticized for nepotism in appointing family members to important positions. A famine in 1974 further intensified the food crisis, and devastated agriculture– the mainstay of the economy. Intense criticism of Mujib arose over the lack of political leadership, a flawed pricing policy, and rising inflation amidst heavy losses suffered by the nationalized industries. Mujib's ambitious social programs performed poorly, owing to scarcity of resources, funds, and personnel, and caused unrest amongst the masses.|$|E

500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish to change all things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass,</b> the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s {{a number of}} those who had grown up in a {{fundamentalist}} ethos began to question the eccentricities of the subculture, and particularly its disengagement from both the academy and mainstream culture. A new organization known as the National Association of Evangelicals was formed with the agenda of reforming society. Some of the emerging leaders of this movement, which came to be dubbed [...] "Neo-Evangelical" [...] included Carl F. H. Henry, Harold Ockenga and Billy Graham. These men were convinced that a two-pronged approach to societal transformation was possible. One approach was to reengage the academy bringing a distinctly Christian worldview to bear on disciplines such as history, philosophy, science, literature, art and law. The other approach involved itinerant evangelistic preachers proclaiming the message <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> roots level of society.|$|E
2500|$|In 1800, James McGready {{stood at}} the {{juncture}} of two centuries, looking backward to the traditions of his spiritual fathers and forward to children of a new century in a young republic. [...] The segment of the Second Great Awakening that arose from the concert of voices he led, stood {{in the shadow of}} the First, when republican ideals deferred to a king and revival fervor emanated primarily from the voices of preachers wearing clerical collars or holding seminary degrees. [...] McGready witnessed both the fracturing and stagnation of Presbyterianism in Kentucky, as well as the flowering of new forms of religious expressions thriving <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> roots, where Bible reading, hymn singing, camp meetings and revival preaching were primary expressions of religious piety and feeling, reflecting the doctrines of the new birth among the common people. [...] Largely as a result of the revival, religion was less hierarchical and controlled than in the preceding century, as well as more democratic and diverse.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{people thought}} the Compromise had ended the {{territorial}} issue, but Stephen A. Douglas reopened it in 1854, {{in the name}} of democracy. Douglas proposed the Kansas–Nebraska Bill with the intention of opening up vast new high quality farm lands to settlement. As a Chicagoan, he was especially interested in the railroad connections from Chicago into Kansas and Nebraska, but that was not a controversial point. More importantly, Douglas firmly believed in democracy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> roots—that actual settlers have the right to decide on slavery, not politicians from other states. His bill provided that popular sovereignty, through the territorial legislatures, should decide [...] "all questions pertaining to slavery", thus effectively repealing the Missouri Compromise. The ensuing public reaction against it created a firestorm of protest in the Northern states. It was seen as an effort to repeal the Missouri Compromise. However, the popular reaction in the first month after the bill's introduction failed to foreshadow the gravity of the situation. As Northern papers initially ignored the story, Republican leaders lamented the lack of a popular response.|$|E
