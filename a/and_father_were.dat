500|$|First {{hinted at}} in early December 1999, Devil May Cry {{started out as}} the {{earliest}} incarnation of Resident Evil 4. Initially developed for the PlayStation 2, the game was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him {{to create a new}} entry in the Resident Evil series. Around the turn of the millennium, regular series writer Noboru Sugimura created a scenario for the title, based on Kamiya's idea to make a very cool and stylized action game. The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of protagonist Tony, an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology. As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous Resident Evil installments and instead opted for a dynamic camera system. This new direction required the team to make a trip to Europe where they spent eleven days in the United Kingdom and Spain photographing things like Gothic statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in textures. Though the developers tried to make the [...] "coolness" [...] theme fit into the world of Resident Evil, Mikami felt it strayed too far from the series' survival horror roots and gradually convinced all of the staff members to make the game independent from it. Kamiya eventually rewrote the story to be set in a world full of demons and changed the hero's name to [...] "Dante". The cast of characters remained largely identical to that in Sugimura's scenario, although appearances of the hero's mother <b>and</b> <b>father</b> <b>were</b> written out of the story. The game's new title was revealed as Devil May Cry in November 2000. Hideki Kamiya, director of the hit video game, Devil May Cry in 2005 revealed that he chose John Taylor from the very popular English rock band, Duran Duran as the model for the game's main character, Dante. He modeled the character's looks, style, charisma and attitude after John Taylor's.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were few}} {{black people in}} Lowell, so the young Kerouac did not {{encounter}} the sort of racism that was common {{in other parts of}} the United States.

2500|$|Zweig studied {{philosophy}} at the University of Vienna and in 1904 earned a doctoral degree with a thesis on [...] "The Philosophy of Hippolyte Taine".

Yet he did not renounce his Jewish faith and wrote repeatedly on Jews and Jewish themes, as in his story Buchmendel.

Zweig believed in internationalism and in Europeanism, as The World of Yesterday, his autobiography, makes clear.
