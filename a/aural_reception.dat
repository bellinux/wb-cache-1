40|$|The article {{describes}} the theoretical basis and practical recommendations for modelling the facilitative educational environment for elementary school pupils with learning difficulties. It is shown that 80 % of elementary school pupils with learning difficulties have problems related to auditory imperceptions. At the same time, the peripheral hearing of these students is usually normal.  Auditory imperception has {{a negative impact on}} all types of educational activities, as educational material is mainly based on <b>aural</b> <b>reception.</b> The practical recommendations are aimed at changing the objective environment and the communicative strategies of all adults involved in educational activities of pupils in order to create conditions facilitating the <b>aural</b> <b>reception</b> of information by pupils. To create a facilitative environment, the following measures are proposed: improvement of the acoustic characteristics of the learning premises, the use of visual cues, change of the communicative strategies of adults, the use of special equipment in the classroom. The author suggests measures for creating the facilitating environment at home for children with aural imperceptions when they do their homework. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to ponder the {{reception}} of the Letter to the Galatians in an aural setting. How did the first recipients react, what can we expect that they remembered after having listened to the letter? Are there structural elements in the letter that would have aided the <b>aural</b> <b>reception</b> of the letter? In four readings, the investigation traces textual indicators of interaction and emotion, compares their locations with epistolary and rhetorical structure-analysis and identifies a structure of persuasion. The focus on listeners is motivated by the supposition that illiteracy was the rule rather than the exception among those to whom the letter to the Galatians was sent. The different readings reveal a structure of persuasion with a realistic prospect to succeed as a mnemonic device in an aural setting on a macro-structural level. Situational passages (1 : 6 - 10; 3 : 1 - 5; 4 : 8 - 20; 5 : 2 - 12 and 6 : 12 - 13), together with recurring affirmations of Christ and Paul as embodiments of faithfulness and commitment in suffering, imprint on the aural memory of the first listeners a concern for an imitatio Christi crucifixi...|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} {{aspect of}} the aging process is cognitive decline. The dimensions of cognitive decline are partially reversible however, because the brain retains the lifelong capacity for plasticity and reorganization of cortical tissue. Mahncke and colleagues developed a brain plasticity-based training program that induced learning in mature adults experiencing age-related decline. This training program focused intensively on <b>aural</b> language <b>reception</b> accuracy and cognitively demanding exercises that have been proven to partially reverse the age-related losses in memory. It included highly rewarding novel tasks that required attention control and became progressively more difficult to perform. In comparison to the control group, who received no training and showed no significant change in memory function, the experimental training group displayed a marked enhancement in memory that was sustained at the 3-month follow-up period. These findings suggest that cognitive function, particularly memory, can be significantly improved in mature adults with age-related cognitive decline by using brain plasticity-based training methods.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} studies to assess receptive and expressive language skills in a South Indian language, Kannada. It demystifies language impairments and provides a model for future research to understand other languages in India and in countries around the world. Method: Language impairments were identified in 68 students of Grades 3 and 4, in elementary schools where Kannada was the medium of instruction. The children were assessed in different language components. The results were analysed in terms of their ages and their levels of functioning in each language component and sub-component. Results: As a group, the subjects showed no significant deficits in phonological and semantic skills; however, individual deficits and deficits within sub-component skills of semantics were noted. Mean and individual deficits in auditory <b>reception,</b> <b>aural</b> comprehension and receptive vocabulary were also noted. Deficits in syntax & verbal expression were notably significant. The extent of language delay increases with age, and plateaus at higher ages. Conclusion: Children with language impairments in Kannada, display many similar characteristics in terms of problems in different components of language. Early intervention is called for because the language delay increases as age advances. A thorough assessment reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in language components and skills. This can be used as a starting point to base remediation activities. doi: 10. 5463 /dcid. v 23 i 3. 134 </p...|$|R
40|$|We used an anuran {{acoustic}} communication system {{to test a}} prediction of the "fluctuating asymmetries/good genes " hypothesis that females prefer more symmetric mates because symmetry indicates genetic quality. Mate preferences of female cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) can be influenced by three call characters: dominant frequency, numbers of pulses per call, and number of pulse groups per call. We tested the hypothesis that these preferences result in females preferring more symmetric males. We measured fluctuating asymmetries of characters not involved with the communication system (head and tibia), and those in-volved in signal production (laryngeal characters) and signal <b>reception</b> (<b>aural</b> characters). We determined whether the asym-metries in these characters {{were related to the}} three variables that enhance call attractiveness. Most of the multiple regression models showed no significant association between the fluctuating asymmetries of characters and any of the calls. The regression of head and tibia fluctuating asymmetry on pulse number was significant, but partial regression coefficients revealed that more pulses were associated with a more symmetric head length and a less symmetric tibia length. Our findings provide little or no support for the fluctuating asymmetries/good genes hypothesis. We emphasize, however, that this hypothesis should not be abandoned based on negative results of a single study, but deserves further scrutiny.

40|$|The diction {{of glory}} and fame in Old English {{literature}} reveals {{to us the}} intricacies woven into this theme. Here we look at three words, dom, lof, and hlisa, which offer us particular insights into the Anglo-Saxon desire to be known. Dom, or fame of the head, is shown to be the sort of glory and fame that an individual receives through the rational assessment and pronouncement of his deeds as good by another individual or group. Lof, or fame of the mouth, will be identified as the joyful verbal pronouncement by an individual or group that another’s deeds are worthy of praise, and thus worthy of imitation. Hlisa, or fame of the ears, will {{be connected to the}} <b>aural</b> <b>reception</b> of one’s deeds as honorable. This word is employed nearly exclusively by King Alfred and his circle of writers and Ælfric of Eynsham. Particular attention will be given to Ælfric’s use of the word to describe the glory and fame of his saints. ^ The study will provide a linguistic analysis of each word as well as a literary analysis of the contexts in which the words appear. To facilitate the literary analysis, we will provide a framework of terminology that looks at secular, syncretic, and Christian moments of glory and fame. In the end, we conclude that the nuanced uses of different glory and fame words throughout the Old English corpus demonstrates {{the way in which the}} Anglo-Saxons engaged and expressed their desire to be known. ...|$|E
40|$|Any {{consideration}} of the <b>aural</b> <b>reception</b> of Christian faith must take the ecclesial practice of music {{and its relation to}} the divine logos into account. Specifically, the logos provides normativity for such music, as the latter endeavours to proclaim that divine Word. Contemporary theological reflections on music are made difficult by the modern development of the concept of taste, which has culminated in a radicalized subjectivity that eschews normative criteria. A reclamation of the normative role of the logos is thus required in the dogmatic theology of music. Karl Barth’s theology is examined in order to establish the critical relation between proclamation and dogmatics. Barth’s praise of Mozart is reviewed to demonstrate how his detachment from a broader historical tradition confines him to a strictly formalist aesthetic that is unable to hear musical meaning. Further examination of his early writings reveal how his critical revelatory dialectic, vis-à-vis his reading of the Auftrag, prohibits a proclamatory role for the ecclesial practice of music. Pope Benedict XVI’s theology provides a fitting alternative, as his dogmatic reflections assume a necessarily kerygmatic role for music that Barth denies. In this Benedict is more in tune with the ancient Church Fathers. His dogmatic reflections on the “musified” logos are in dialectical tension with modern philosophies of music, as he espouses a Christian rationality over against modern secular/subjective reason. This dialectic is augmented with a comparison of Augustine and Kant on the practice of counting. Finally, contrary to some readings, the normativity of Benedict’s musical logos is not an oppressive force, hampering the freedom of musical performance. A “descriptive” method of dogmatic reflection is finally recommended, in which the theology of music approximates a kind of journalistic “music criticism,” albeit one that listens for the Word of Christ, the hearing of which brings faith (Romans 10 : 17) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{establish}} the inadequacy of readings of the Gospel of Matthew as intended for, and a reflection of, a local audience or community. Despite repeated challenges, the local audience thesis continues to dominate {{a large proportion of}} Matthean scholarship, and, as such, the issue of determining the Gospel's audience remains an open question. This thesis posits four main critiques. First, the assumptions which underpin the text- focused process of identifying the Gospel's audience, whether deemed to be local, Jewish, or universal, lack clarity. Literary entities such as the implied reader, the intended reader, or the authorial audience, prove inadequate as a means of identifying the Gospel's audience. Second, local audience readings necessarily exclude plot-related developments and are both selective and restrictive in their treatment of characterisation. Much is lost or ignored, as a coherent and simplified audience context is derived from the complex narrative world of the Gospel. Third, this thesis argues that many in an audience of the Gospel would have incorporated their experience of hearing Matthew within pre-existing mental representations shaped by Mark or other early traditions. Thus, they would have understood the Gospel as relating to events and settings distinct from their own context, regardless {{of the degree to which}} they identified with characters or events in the Gospel. Fourth, this thesis argues that early Christian audiences were largely heterogeneous in terms of ethnicity, age, sex, wealth, familiarity with Christian traditions, and levels of commitment. As such, the <b>aural</b> <b>reception</b> of the Gospel would have resulted in a variety of impacts. A number of these critiques extend beyond the local audience option and for this reason this thesis does not posit a particular audience for the Gospel.

40|$|Although deaf {{children}} {{depend upon}} sight for communication, retinitis pigmentosa {{is present in}} 6 per cent of those with a profound hearing deficit. Usher syndrome type 1 (USH- 1) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by profound hearing impairment, absent vestibular function, and progressive loss of vision due to retinitis pigmentosa. Owing to the severe handicap of the combined disorders, early diagnosis of USH- 1 is of crucial importance. The profound hearing deficit is often detected at hearing tests in infancy, but as the sight problems do not develop until later diagnosis is often delayed. The diagnosis of Usher's syndrome is established by electroretinography (ERG), as confirmation of the retinitis pigmentosa is a prerequisite. As the progressive deterioration of sight hinders the use of sign language, a cochlear implant constitutes an invaluable aid at an early age. Early diagnosis is thus of both medical and educative importance. To avoid delay in diagnosis past the age when optimal results may be expected from a cochlear implant, a screening test was sought for infants with profound hearing loss to identify those at increased risk of USH- 1, for whom ERG is a priority. Although conventional vestibular testing methods are not well tolerated by infants, with recently developed equipment for video or CCI) (charge-coupled device) camera inspection of eye movements, vestibular screening can now be performed in the office. In our experience {{it is possible to}} screen most infants, given a careful approach by the investigator. Children with clinically diagnosed USH- 1, without any vestibulo-ocular reflex, manifested no vestibular responses during 'video-nystagmoscopy' when rotated on the parent's lap, preliminary findings strongly suggest that vestibular function should be tested in all children with a profound congenital hearing deficit, as it is important for children with USH- 1 to be provided with a cochlear implant permitting <b>aural</b> <b>reception</b> of communication from the environment at an early age, because of the progressive deterioration of vision and the ultimate double handicap...|$|E
