5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1817 Captain George Woodbine, one of Nicolls's former {{subordinate}} officers, was present in Spanish East Florida together with the former British soldier and Scottish mercenary lieutenant of Simon Bolivar, Gregor MacGregor. Woodbine and MacGregor both left Spanish East Florida to rejoin the Latin American revolutionary movement prior to U.S. military intervention in East Florida. The names of Nicolls, Woodbine, and MacGregor had become associated with the arming of blacks as soldiers, militiamen, and even as mercenaries. The threat, real or imaginary, was an <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> North American popular conceptions of the time.|$|E
5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion to the Republican Party and his cooperation with his old friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments {{he wrote in his}} memoirs about General Lee's wartime performance, made him <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin {{worked to}} deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling {{he had turned}} against the South. Douglas contended that {{although}} the Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.|$|E

5000|$|In Early Christian writings, {{hypostasis}} is used {{to denote}} [...] "being" [...] or [...] "substantive reality" [...] and is not always distinguished in meaning from ousia ('essence' or 'substance'). It {{was used in this}} way by Tatian and Origen, and also in the <b>anathemas</b> appended <b>to</b> the Nicene Creed of 325.|$|R

It is also Daniel's first album since his departure in 2002 (after {{the release of the}} previous album A Fine Day to Exit).|$|R
5|$|Born in Ilford, Essex, Grant {{developed}} {{an interest in}} occultism and Asian religion during his teenage years. After several months serving in India with the British Army amid the Second World War, he returned to Britain and became the personal secretary of Aleister Crowley, the ceremonial magician who had founded Thelema in 1904. Crowley instructed Grant in his esoteric practices, initiating him into his own occult order, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). When Crowley died in 1947, Grant was seen as his heir apparent in Britain, and was appointed as such by the American head of the O.T.O., Karl Germer. Founding the London-based New Isis Lodge in 1954, Grant added to many of Crowley's Thelemite teachings, bringing in extraterrestrial themes and influences {{from the work of}} H.P. Lovecraft. This was <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> Germer, who expelled Grant from the O.T.O. in 1955, although the latter continued to operate his Lodge regardless until 1962.|$|E
5|$|Endecott's {{responsibility}} was {{to establish}} the colony and to prepare it {{for the arrival of}} additional settlers. The winters of 1629 and 1630 were difficult compared to those in England, and he called on the Plymouth Colony for medical assistance. His wife, who had been ill on the voyage over, died that winter. Other difficulties he encountered included early signs of religious friction among the colony's settlers (dividing between Nonconformists and Separatists), and poor relations with Thomas Morton, whose failed Wessagusset Colony and libertine practices (which including a May pole and dancing) were <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> the conservative Puritanism practiced by most settlers in the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies. Early in his term as governor he visited the abandoned site of Morton's colony and had the Maypole taken down. When one group of early settlers wanted to establish a church independent of that established by the colonial leadership, he had their leaders summarily sent back to England.|$|E
5|$|The large Mexican Cession of {{land had}} divided the United States politically, with {{many in the}} North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and {{offering}} the Wilmot Proviso to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the Missouri Compromise line of 36°30′ N. Both proposals were <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> many Southerners, and the controversy divided the Democrats. At the 1848 Democratic National Convention, the majority nominated former Michigan senator Lewis Cass for president, while a minority broke off to become the Free Soil Party, backing former president Van Buren. The Whigs chose General Zachary Taylor, a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for Van Buren, Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil ticket, and was so effective that Taylor, who was elected president, was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.|$|E
50|$|With the Council of Trent in {{the sixteenth}} century began the {{departure}} from this ancient usage. This council used the word canon for short, dogmatic definitions with an <b>anathema</b> attached <b>to</b> them. On the other hand, it gave the name of decrees to its disciplinary regulations. The example set by Trent was followed by the First Council of the Vatican.|$|R
60|$|The {{round-up}} {{had ridden}} in {{but a few}} moments before, hungry and tired, to a supperless camp. The boys were engaged in an emulous display of <b>anathemas</b> supposed <b>to</b> fit {{the case of the}} absconding cook. While they were unsaddling and hobbling their ponies, the newcomer rode in and inquired for Pink Saunders. The boss ol the round-up came forth and was given the superintendent's note.|$|R
5000|$|While Patriarch Mennas of Constantinople {{condemned}} Origen and {{a form of}} apocatastasis at the Synod of Constantinople (543), {{experts are}} divided whether the Second Council of Constantinople (the Fifth Ecumenical Council) in 553 ratified the condemnation authentically as [...] "It is only certain that the council opened on 5 May, 553, {{in spite of the}} protestations of Pope Vigilius, who though at Constantinople refused to attend it, and that in the eight conciliary sessions (from 5 May to 2 June), the Acts of which we possess, only the question of the Three Chapters is treated." [...] Many heteroclite views became associated with Origen, and the 15 <b>anathemas</b> attributed <b>to</b> the council condemn a form of apocatastasis along with the pre-existence of the soul, animism (in this context, a heterodox Christology), and a denial of real and lasting resurrection of the body. Some authorities believe these <b>anathemas</b> belong <b>to</b> an earlier local synod. The anathema against Origen in his person, declaring him (among others) a heretic, reads as follows: ...|$|R
5|$|In Ireland, the {{population}} was split into three main socio-political groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and were also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army {{in support of the}} king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement {{at the same time as}} promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> Presbyterians. As a result, all three groups had become disaffected. Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him. In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance.|$|E
5|$|Rodrigues {{is taken}} to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic {{doctrine}} is <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him {{in charge of the}} proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues that court officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after being told to step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await someone. In the far distance, he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other prisoners are taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an inducement to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.|$|E
5|$|Fillmore sent {{a special}} message to Congress on August 6, 1850, {{disclosing}} {{the letter from}} Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders, and urging Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the Great Triumvirate of John C. Calhoun, Webster and Clay who had long dominated the Senate, Douglas and others led that body towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate {{with the support of}} the section that wanted it, plus a few members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of population. Most contentious was the Fugitive Slave Bill, whose provisions were <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs to abstain rather than oppose, including New Yorkers—threatening to kill the renomination of Congressman Abraham Schermerhorn of Rochester, whose constituents included Frederick Douglass, if he voted against the bill. Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between New Mexico Territory and Texas—the state would be given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District slave trade was ended, and the final status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk, holding the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, John J. Crittenden. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread, as was the hope this would settle the slavery question.|$|E

50|$|The CP also {{supported}} piecework {{systems in the}} electrical and automobile industries, which it defended as both necessary to boost production {{and a way to}} improve workers' earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the War Labor Board, but which were still <b>anathema,</b> particularly <b>to</b> unionists in mass production industries such as automobile manufacturing. Walter Reuther used this issue to great effect against the CP and its allies at the UAW's 1943 Convention, where his slate fell just short of defeating Addes and Frankensteen.|$|R

25|$|A firm {{supporter}} of Joseph Stalin, Foster split with James P. Cannon in 1928 and supported his former ally's expulsion for Trotskyism.

25|$|Additionally, Barre {{also sought}} to {{eradicate}} the importance of clan (qabil) affiliation within government and civil society.

Barre outlawed this question and a broad range of other activities classified as clanism. Informers reported qabilists to the government, leading to arrests and imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new field of}} transplantation has reinvigorated the debate. Xenotransplantation, or the transfer of animal (usually pig) organs into human bodies, promises to eliminate many of the ethical issues, while creating many of its own. While xenotransplantation promises to increase the supply of organs considerably, the threat of organ transplant rejection {{and the risk of}} xenozoonosis, coupled with general <b>anathema</b> <b>to</b> the idea, decreases the functionality of the technique. Some animal rights groups oppose the sacrifice of an animal for organ donation and have launched campaigns to ban them.|$|E

In a famous letter to Leopold von Gerlach, Bismarck wrote that it was foolish to play chess having first put 16 of the 64 squares out of bounds. This observation became ironic, as after 1871, France indeed became Germany's permanent enemy, and eventually allied with Russia against Germany in the 1890s.|$|E

40|$|Archival {{methods of}} {{research}} {{are crucial to}} reconstruct. interpret. and evaluate contributions of early sociologists that are hidden behind the veiIs of racism and sexism. Many of these founding sociologists profoundly shaped their communities and created important organizations to combat social inequality and injustice.
