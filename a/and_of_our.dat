Nagarjuna uses causation to present his arguments on how one individualizes objects, orders one's experience of the world, and understands agency in the world.|$|E

25|$|I defend {{absolutely}} Mr Farage's {{right to}} disagree about the policy or {{institutions of the}} Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility– in this case, to respect the dignity of others <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore– {{as an expression of}} the seriousness of the matter– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.|$|E
25|$|The {{decoration}} of the Igreja de São Roque {{is the result}} of several phases of activity throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, reflecting the ideals of either the Society of Jesus or, {{as in the case of}} the chapels, the respective brotherhoods or confraternities. It was born of the Catholic Reformation, and reflects the efforts of the Church to capture the attention of the faithful. The general decorative phases are Mannerist (the chapels of St. Francis Xavier, of the Holy Family, and of the chancel); early Baroque (Chapel of the Holy Sacrament); later Baroque (Chapels of Our Lady of the Doctrine <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Piety); and Roman Baroque of the 1740s (Chapel of St. John the Baptist). 19th-century renovations include the construction of the choir gallery over the main door where the pipe organ was installed; the remodeling of the screen of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament and the erection of the gilded iron railings; and the replacement of the entrance doors.|$|E
25|$|Maerth {{asserted}} that the eating of brain produces an aphrodisiac effect (presumably due to the vast amount of hormones in it), and that this initially caused apes to become addicted to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped {{in a frenzy of}} brain-induced sex and violence. However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and intelligence while triggering the loss both of body hair <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> innate psychic abilities. Thus man gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago. Modern humans, alienated from their surroundings now that they've no telepathic contact with nature and each other as animals do, suffering from a distorted sexuality resulting from hormonal imbalances, and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing on the inside of their skulls, are inevitably destroying themselves with pollution, overpopulation, racial integration and ultimately, nuclear war. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future, and suggests that the reader should drop out of society, embrace a vegetarian diet, steep himself in the wisdom of the East and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the shape of his skull as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.|$|E

2500|$|Two of Jameson's best-known claims from Postmodernism {{are that}} postmodernity is {{characterized}} by pastiche and a crisis in historicity. Jameson argued that parody (which implies a moral judgment or a comparison with societal norms) was replaced by pastiche (collage {{and other forms of}} juxtaposition without a normative grounding). Relatedly, Jameson argued that the postmodern era suffers from a crisis in historicity: [...] "there no longer does seem to be any organic relationship between the American history we learn from schoolbooks and the lived experience of the current, multinational, high-rise, stagflated city of the newspapers <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> own everyday life".|$|E

Earl Russell (as he had become) died there on 28 May 1878; Fanny, his second wife, in 1898.

2500|$|In 875, {{shortly after}} Charles the Bald's {{imperial}} coronation, Formosus fled Rome {{in fear of}} then-pope John VIII. [...] A few months later in 876, at a synod in Santa Maria Rotunda, John VIII issued a series of accusations against Formosus {{and some of his}} associates. [...] He asserted that Formosus had corrupted the mind of the Bulgarians [...] "so that, so long as [...] was alive, [...] would not accept any other bishop from the apostolic see," [...] that he and his fellow conspirators had attempted to usurp the papacy from John, and finally that he had deserted his see in Porto and was conspiring [...] "against the salvation of the state <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> beloved Charles [...]" [...] Formosus and his associates were excommunicated.|$|E

In response to these comments, Martin, with the support of National Liberal Caucus chair Andy Savoy, expelled her from caucus, saying, [...] "Even though I respect her right to express her viewpoint, I cannot, as leader of our party <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> caucus, tolerate her behaviour." ...|$|E

[...] On 30 June 2008, Indian Labour Minister Oscar Fernandes backed calls for decriminalisation of consensual gay sex, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called for greater tolerance towards homosexuals. On 23 July 2008, Bombay High Court Judge Bilal Nazki said that India's unnatural sex law should be reviewed.

2500|$|In 1839, at the {{suggestion}} of Bishop Hughes of New York, Mgr. Forbin-Janson introduced the Fathers of Mercy into the United States, initially in the Diocese of New Orleans. Bishop Potiers of Mobile, Alabama, then invited them to take charge of Spring Hill College. Two years later, Fathers Lafont and Aubril were sent to look after the increasing French population in New York City, where the Fathers of Mercy took charge of the parishes of St. Vincent de Paul, Manhattan, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Lourdes and St. Francis de Chantal, Brooklyn.

2500|$|Ruskin’s {{influence}} {{reached across}} the world.

Proust not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French. Gandhi wrote of the [...] "magic spell" [...] cast on him by Unto This Last and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it Sarvodaya, [...] "The Advancement of All". In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.|$|E
