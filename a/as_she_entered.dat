5|$|The old President Warfield was {{eventually}} acquired in early 1947 by Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, a Jewish organization helping Holocaust survivors illegally reach Palestine, then under British mandate. The former Baltimore Steam Packet and U.S. Navy steamship was renamed Exodus when she embarked from France for Palestine on July 11, 1947, carrying 4,515passengers. Two Royal Navy destroyers rammed the Exodus <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> Palestinian waters near Haifa on July18. British forces boarded the damaged ship and eventually deported the passengers. The Exodus remained in Haifa harbor until 1952, when the derelict caught fire and burned completely. The 1960 film Exodus depicted the refugees' odyssey aboard the former President Warfield.|$|E
5|$|Navigation {{through the}} rocks {{of the bay}} had been difficult, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> the bay Amazones rudder had been torn away, {{rendering}} the ship unmanoeuverable. With Amazone trapped, Macnamara called {{up the rest of}} the Cherbourg squadron, the frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and the brig-sloops HMS Goshawk under Commander James Lilburn and HMS Hawk under Commander Henry Bourchier. This force was required to remain a substantial distance offshore as the rocky coastline posed a considerable danger to the British ships. Macnamara's plan was to wait for high tide and then bring the squadron closer inshore to bombard the French frigate into surrender. As they waited, the squadron was joined by Niobe from the Le Havre under Captain John Wentworth Loring. At 16:00 the tides were optimal for the attack and Niobe, Amelia and Berwick sailed into the bay. However, Rosseau had situated Amazone in a strong position, protected from close attack by rocks and shoals and in consequence the British ships could only fire as they wore around, resulting in scattered and inaccurate fire. As they advanced, the British ships came under fire from Amazone, which killed one sailor on Berwick and killed one and wounded another on Amelia, while the British fire had no effect on the French ship. At 18:00, Macnamara withdrew his ships from the bay, all three vessels having suffered considerable damage to their rigging and sails from Amazones shot.|$|E

25|$|There were no {{sports teams}} for girls {{when she was}} in high school, but she played a number of sports {{including}} basketball, in rec leagues and pickup. When she was younger, she played with both boys and girls. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> her high school years, the girls dropped out for other interests, so she was more apt to play with boys. To help make sure she would be chosen, she bought the best basketball she could afford, so if the boys wanted to play with her basketball, they would have to pick her.|$|E

25|$|Betty Hahn {{was born}} on October 11, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois where she also grew up. At the age of ten, Hahn was given her first camera by an aunt. Hahn later on went to {{graduate}} from Scecina Memorial Catholic High School. Soon after, Hahn enrolled at Indiana University with a full scholarship where she furthered her studies in fine arts, receiving both her BFA (1963) and her MFA (1966). Throughout her undergraduate years, she concentrated in drawing and painting; however, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> graduate studies, she worked in photography. During this important developmental period, Hahn studied {{under one of the}} most well-known photography teachers of the time, Henry Holmes Smith, who encouraged Hahn’s work in alternative processes.|$|E
25|$|Vijaya then {{requested}} Kuveni, his Yakkhini queen, {{to leave}} the community, saying that his citizens feared supernatural beings like her. He offered her money, and asked her {{to leave the}}ir two children behind. But Kuveni took the children along with her to the Yakkha city of Lankapura. She asked her children to stay back, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> the city, where other Yakkhas recognized her as a traitor. She was suspected of being a spy, and killed by a Yakkha. On advice of her maternal uncle, the children fled to Sumanakuta (identified with Adam's Peak). In the Malaya region of Lanka, they became husband-wife and gave rise to the Pulinda race (identified with the Vedda people; {{not to be confused with}} the Pulindas of India).|$|E
25|$|The next morning, as {{she headed}} to a union {{negotiation}} meeting, Silkwood again {{tested positive for}} plutonium, although she had performed only paperwork duties that morning. She was given a more intensive decontamination. On November 7, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> the plant, she {{was found to be}} dangerously contaminated, even expelling contaminated air from her lungs. A health physics team accompanied her back to her home and found plutonium traces on several surfaces, especially in the bathroom and the refrigerator. When the house was later stripped and decontaminated, some of her property had to be destroyed. Silkwood, her boyfriend Drew Stephens, and her roommate Dusty Ellis, were sent to Los Alamos National Laboratory for in-depth testing {{to determine the extent of}} the contamination in their bodies.|$|E

25|$|Dollinger {{began to}} focus on shorter sprinting events <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> her twenties. At the 1931 Olympics of Grace, an {{international}} women's sporting competition, she won the 100 metres title in a time of 12.6 seconds and was also the 200 metres runner-up behind Britain's Nellie Halstead. Later that year she ran a 200m personal best of 25.2 seconds in Magdeburg, equalling the European record time (not ratified by the European Athletic Association. Her second Olympic appearance came at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. She travelled with the German team to compete in the 100m individual and relay events. She broke the 100 metres Olympic record with a time of 12.2 seconds, as again she was the winner in the first heat. This time was immediately improved by Stanisława Walasiewicz, who set a world record. Dollinger reached the final but was beaten to the podium by Billie von Bremen, ending up in fourth position. In the 4×100 metres relay she anchored a team of Grete Heublein, Ellen Braumüller and Tilly Fleischer, but the German women managed only sixth place overall.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} existing communal shelters were the London Underground stations. Although many civilians had used them for shelter during the First World War, {{the government in}} 1939 refused to allow the stations {{to be used as}} shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids but by the second week of heavy bombing, the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened. Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4:00 pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In mid-September 1940, about 150,000 people a night slept in the Underground, although by the winter and spring months the numbers had declined to 100,000 or less. Noises of battle were muffled and sleep was easier in the deepest stations but many people were killed from direct hits on stations. In March 1943, 173 men, women and children were crushed to death at Bethnal Green tube station in a panic after a woman fell down the steps <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> the station.|$|E

[...] Their second daughter, Kira Kirillovna, was born in Paris in 1909. Victoria and Kirill, who had hoped for a son, were disappointed to have a girl, but named their daughter after her father.|$|E

After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed her in the back and slashed her throat. With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. When she realized that the wound would not be fatal, she wrote [...] "call the police" [...] in red marker on her door and called emergency services to the house. Investigators found the four children tucked in their beds, some with stuffed toys in their arms.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, for example, {{the court}} {{accepted}} {{the claim of}} the Dean of Westminster to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony (for nearly a thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book of practices), the claim of the Lord Bishop of Durham and the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells to walk beside the Queen <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> and exited the Abbey and to stand {{on either side of}} her through the entire coronation ritual, the claim of the Earl of Shrewsbury in his capacity as Lord High Steward of Ireland to carry a white staff. The legal claim of the Scholars of Westminster School to be the first to acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people was formally disallowed by the court, but in practice their traditional shouts of [...] "Vivat!

500|$|The concert {{began with}} the lights dimming and a sole {{spotlight}} being focused on the crowd. The spotlight then followed Shakira <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> the hall wearing a hooded fuchsia gown. Singing the [...] "pensive" [...] and [...] "sentimental" [...] ballad [...] "Pienso En Tí" [...] ("I Think of You"), she began walking towards the stage while shaking her fans' hands and hugging them. As soon as Shakira climbed the stage, she threw off the gown to reveal her main attire: a mesh gold crop top coupled with skin-tight leather pants. A more energetic routine followed as she [...] "sprinted, jumped, and yodelled" [...] across the stage while performing more guitar-oriented versions of [...] "Why Wait" [...] and [...] "Te Dejo Madrid" [...] ("I Leave You Madrid"). After stopping to play a harmonica solo, Shakira performed [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] ("If You Go") accompanied by [...] "dense" [...] musical instrumentation.

500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this success, {{no further}} vessels were {{ordered by the}} Royal Navy, {{possibly}} because the development of quick-traversing and quick-firing guns <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>entered</b> service had rendered the concept behind her design less practical.
