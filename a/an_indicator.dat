5|$|In ancient times, the addax {{occurred}} from Northern Africa through Arabia and the Levant. Pictures in a tomb, {{dating back}} to the 2500 BCE show at least the partial domestication of the addax by the ancient Egyptians. These pictures show addax and some other antelopes tied with ropes to stakes. The number of addax captured by a person were considered <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> of his high social and economic position in the society. But today excess poaching has resulted in the extinction of this species in Egypt since the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with <b>an</b> <b>indicator</b> in the instrument panel.|$|E

The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
