25|$|Chad Michael Murray was {{the first}} person to be cast for One Tree Hill. The {{producers}} were originally unsure as to who Murray would play. Series creator Mark Schwahn wanted him to play the character of Nathan Scott since Murray had played <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> several times before, and he felt it was only natural to give him this role. Murray, however, wanted to portray Lucas due to a connection he felt with the character. He felt that he could inhabit the character as the two share several similarities. Murray's mother left him when he was young, and Lucas was abandoned by his father. Murray's passion for the role led the producers to cast him as Lucas. Murray had turned down the lead role of Ryan Atwood in The O.C. to accept the role as Lucas Scott.|$|E
25|$|Self-important, romantic, {{and nearly}} always wrong, Barney dreamed {{of the day}} he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever {{frustrated}} that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.|$|E

500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy,</b> but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show." [...] He added, [...] "I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but I do love playing this character." ...|$|E

[...] In nine games, he recorded two assists and 14 penalty minutes. Russia captured a silver medal at the tournament.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to a reviewer's criticism of Bond as villainous, Fleming said in a 1964 Playboy interview {{that he did not}} consider his character to be particularly evil or good: [...] "I don't think that he is necessarily a good guy or <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy.</b> Who is? He's got his vices and very few perceptible virtues except patriotism and courage, which are probably not virtues anyway... But I didn't intend for him to be a particularly likeable person." [...] Fleming agreed with some critics' characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer, but expressed that he was a product of his time: [...] "James Bond is a healthy, violent, noncerebral man in his middle-thirties, and a creature of his era. I wouldn't say he's particularly typical of our times, but he's certainly of the times." ...|$|E

[...] Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: [...] "He was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy.</b> [...] He carried pistols. He was down there on the South Side, holding his own. I {{was scared to death}} of that cat". Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as [...] "always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly".

500|$|David Duchovny {{initially}} suggested {{having a}} Walter Skinner-centric episode {{as a way}} to give himself a break, although ultimately he still ended up having a large part in the episode. Duchovny felt that Skinner was a good character who was not utilized to his full extent on the show. Duchovny's idea, which was written in collaboration with writer Howard Gordon, also surrounded the conceit that what Mulder and Skinner do comes with a tremendous price. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish the ground rules regarding where Skinner stood in regards to the X-Files. Writer Vince Gilligan noted that Skinner was originally intended to be <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy,</b> but because Mitch Pileggi was such a good actor the writers decided to not take his character in that direction.|$|E

I think he’s not <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy,</b> he just gets blinded by ambition." [...] On the character's second season arc, Fazekas reiterated that he [...] "puts his ambition and his ego over other things, over sometimes doing the right thing, and he often doesn't care who gets hurt or who is upset about it ... he actually decides {{to do the right thing}} in the end at great cost to himself." ...|$|E

So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy,</b> and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad.

500|$|During the {{production}} of [...] "Deus Ex Machina", which introduced the Nigerian airplane, a corpse dressed as a priest with a gun, and Virgin Mary statues filled with heroin, the Lost writers decided {{that the story of}} the Beechcraft would coincide with one of the characters' flashbacks. They decided to use one of the tail section characters to be introduced in season 2, [...] "essentially <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> who was forced to disguise himself as a priest, and how would that come about, and could he now be presenting himself as a priest".

She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend.
