5|$|The {{fortunes}} of Gray's Inn continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a year. This fall in numbers was {{partly because the}} landed gentry were no longer sending sons who {{had no intention of}} becoming barristers to study <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn.</b> In 1615, 13 students joined the Inn for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members to every 1 call.|$|E

Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn.</b> Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|The Gray's Inn masque in 1588 {{with its}} centrepiece, The Misfortunes of Arthur by Thomas Hughes, is {{considered}} by A.W. Ward be the most impressive masque thrown {{at any of the}} Inns.

For the Christmas of 1594, his play The Comedy of Errors was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men before a riotous assembly of notables in such disorder that the affair became known as the Night of Errors and a mock trial was held to arraign the culprit.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} four months of 1945, III Corps moved quickly to the offensive. On 25 February, the corps, now as part of the First Army, {{established}} a bridgehead over the Roer River, which, in turn, led to the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, on the Rhine River, on 7 March. On 30 March, the Edersee Dam was captured intact by Task Force Wolfe of the 7th Armored Division, and the corps, now commanded by Major General James Van Fleet after Millikin's relief, continued the attack to seize the Ruhr Pocket on 5 April 1945. In late April, III Corps reformed and launched a drive through Bavaria towards Austria. On 2 May 1945, III Corps was ordered to halt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> River on the Austrian border, just days before V-E Day, when the German forces surrendered, bringing an end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1469 Thomas Mathew (died 1469), {{the third}} or fourth son of Sir David Mathew (died 1484) of Llandaf, {{inherited}} the land by marriage to Catherine, heiress of Radyr, and built Radyr Court, a manor house on the site of what is now the Radyr Court Inn in Danescourt. The house was used as a court. Although it was destroyed by a fire in the 19th century, the three large dungeons survived and can still be seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn.</b> On Thomas' death, his lands passed to his eldest son David and then to his younger son William Mathew (died 1528), who was knighted by King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Sir William accompanied Henry VIII to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. His successor was his eldest son Sir George Mathew, who became MP for Glamorganshire and in 1545 Sheriff of Glamorgan.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} not a {{particularly}} prosperous time for the Inn or its members, and few notable barristers were members during this period. Some noted members include Sir Thomas Clarke, the Master of the Rolls, Sir James Eyre, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Samuel Romilly, a noted law reformer. In 1780 the Inn {{was involved in the}} case of R v the Benchers of Gray's Inn, a test {{of the role of the}} Inns of Court as the sole authority to call students to the Bar. The case was brought to the Court of King's Bench by William Hart, a student <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn,</b> who asked the court (under Lord Mansfield) to order the Inn to call him to the Bar. Mansfield ruled that the Inns of Court were indeed the only organisations able to call students to the Bar, and refused to order the Inns to call Hart.|$|E

5|$|After {{shedding}} {{the burden}} of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856. Due to {{the time it took}} to elect new councillors, it was not until 29 December that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious Scotch thistle. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the amount of work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long is {{an assassin}} {{sent by the}} Emperor of China to kill a pirate lord, but failed. Badly injured, he was rescued by a woman named Chie and {{eventually}} {{fell in love with}} her. While out one day, a fight broke out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> and Chie was believed to be dead. Told falsely the swordsman Heishirō Mitsurugi was responsible, he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade. Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats, repurposing some for his own use. Upon finding and defeating him, he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie, and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge. He located its wielder, Cervantes, but was beaten severely. Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye, he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his former employer. Traveling by night under a false name, he was taken in by a girl that reminded him of Chie. When the assassins eventually found him, Li Long stood his ground and defeated them. Remembering the feel of fighting for something other than revenge, he set out to find himself, not knowing that Chie was actually alive and, after giving birth to their son, had set out to find him.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court are {{referred}} to as the third university of England. [...] Inns of Court were where practicing lawyers and law students gathered to eat, socialize, gain legal education, board, and be entertained. There were four of these Inns of Court: Gray's Inn, Inner Temple, Lincoln's Inn, and Middle Temple. [...] In contrast to Cambridge and Oxford, who produced theatre as a literary study, <b>the</b> London <b>Inns</b> of Court produced theatre as a means of entertainment. [...] Beginning around 1587, <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court produced masques and revels, yet another contrast from the Oxford and Cambridge plays. [...] Until the end of the 17th century, these performances typically took the form of masques written by law students <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court. Once <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court transitioned from masques to plays, the so-called third university served as the cradle for classical English drama. Eventually, by the early 17th century, writers such as Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare began producing English comedies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court, thus expanding the range of materials performed. [...] After 1614, the masques were written and designed by professionals; simultaneously the new emerging dramas were written and performed by professional theatre practitioners. [...] Due to the close proximity to the English court, nobility frequently attended <b>the</b> performances <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> of Court.|$|R

In the 1600 s Paradox became a character in The Masque of Mountbanks, represented <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> to honour Francis Bacon.
