25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, I suppose, that the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E

In 2010 he rebuffed a query about his interest in sculpting a memorial to Bill McLaren, a rugby union broadcaster: [...] "I do not do sportsmen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> do not do sports commentators. I do artists, philosophers and poets", he said, [...] warning that memorials are often hastily erected. Advocates of the memorial described the remarks as insensitive, and said that [...] "To have Bill {{looking down on the}} fans at Murrayfield, microphone in hand, would bring a huge smile to so many faces." ...|$|E

500|$|A French battery {{advanced}} to within 300 {{yards of the}} 1/1st Nassau square causing heavy casualties. When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers [...] Yet another battery deployed on the flank of Mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed Mercer back. Mercer later recalled, [...] "The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appaling. Every shot almost took effect, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> expected {{we should all be}} annihilated. ... The saddle-bags, in many instances were torn from horses' backs ... One shell I saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped".|$|E
500|$|On 7 January 2006, {{three days}} before the auction of the final 1,000 pixels was due to end, Tew {{received}} an e-mail from an organisation called [...] "The Dark Group", and was told The Million Dollar Homepage would become the victim of a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) if a ransom of $5,000 was not paid by 10 January. Believing the threat to be a hoax, he ignored it, but a week later received a second e-mail threat: [...] "Hello u website is under us atack to stop the DDoS send us 50000$." [...] Again, he ignored the threat, and the website was flooded with extra traffic and e-mails, causing it to crash. [...] "I haven't replied to any of them as I don't want to give them the satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don't intend to pay them any money. What is happening to my website is like terrorism. If you pay them, new attacks will start," [...] Tew said.|$|E
500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers {{produced}} the track. In 1986, Madonna told Company magazine, that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, [...] "I'm very career-oriented. You are attracted {{to people who are}} ambitious that way, too, like in the song 'Material Girl'. You are attracted to men who have material things because that's what pays the rents and buys you furs. That's the security. That lasts longer than emotions." [...] During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". Madonna responded by saying, [...] "I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words, I thought they were clever.

500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E

2500|$|James' vocal {{style and}} in {{particular}} his falsetto, has often been {{compared to that of}} singers as Thom Yorke (Radiohead), Jeff Buckley and sometimes even mistaken for Chris Martin (Coldplay).

The following summer, July if I remember correctly, I went as usual to visit him when Mr. Aston, laughing, said ‘similarly you don’t know about this person’s publications’ and showed me five books containing six volumes in temporary bindings which had been published. They, the Kawatake Mokuami script series, had been published as articles by the Ginza’s Kabuki Shinpō [...] (Kabuki News) Company. They covered ‘Nakamitsu’, ‘Four Thousand Ryō‘ (...) (in Japanese) and ‘’. When I went I {{had no idea that}} they had been successively published and had been delivered from a Ginza bookstore.

2500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the documents was challenged within hours on Internet forums and blogs, with questions initially focused on alleged anachronisms in the documents' typography. [...] Content soon spread to the mass media. Although CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for a two-week period, continued scrutiny from other news organizations and independent analysis of the documents obtained by USA Today and CBS raised questions about their validity {{and led to a}} public repudiation on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, [...] "if I knew then what I know now – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> would not have used the documents in question," [...] and CBS News President Andrew Heyward said, [...] "Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1944, Pregulman was {{inducted}} into the United States Navy where he served as a gunnery officer on the USS Taluga in the Pacific Theater of Operations. [...] The Taluga left Norfolk, Virginia in October 1944. On December 10, 1944, the ship reached Ulithi, an atoll in the Caroline Islands of the western Pacific Ocean, which served as her base of operations until the end of World War II. For the next 11 months, Pregulman and the Taluga crew were in and out of Ulithi picking up oil and other supplies there and carrying them to units of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. During that time, they supported carrier strikes and landings on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, landings on Okinawa, strikes on Formosa, and the final sweep of the Japanese home islands in the summer of 1945. Between April and July 1945, Pregulman and the Taluga crew spent much of their time in and around the anchorage at Kerama Retto, just west of the southern end of Okinawa. At dawn on April 16, 1945, ten kamikazes attacked their formation. One of the kamikazes dove at Taluga, strafed her deck, and then made for her superstructure. The attacker careened off the ship's bridge and hit the wheelhouse. However, only 12 men were injured, and the oiler was soon back in action. Pregulman normally {{would have been in the}} wheelhouse, but he went on deck just before the attack. He recalled: [...] "If he had been five minutes later, I would have been in the wheelhouse <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> wouldn't be here." [...] He recalled that the plane sheared off the top of the wheelhouse, and blew a hole in the deck, but no American soldiers were killed.|$|E
