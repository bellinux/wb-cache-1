40|$|The {{recommended}} continuos {{operating temperature}} for Timetal 21 S is below 540 °C. Application temperature for this alloy can, however exceed this level, with attendant embrittlement due to oxidation. The present study examines {{the effects of}} exposures in air on the tensile ductility of fully aged Timetal 21 S sheet specimens in temperature range 482 - 693 °C. In this thesis, the kinetics {{of the loss of}} tensile ductility is investigated as a function of exposure temperature and sheet thickness. The experimental embrittlement activation energies are estimated by determining exposure times at various temperatures to reach close to zero ductility at room temperature. The embrittlement kinetics is investigated for three different sheet thickness; 0. 12, 0. 39, and 1. 0 mm. The morphology of the surface layer and changes in microstructure are examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as a function of exposure conditions. Phase changes as function of the exposure parameters are investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Kinetics of weight gain during exposure is also investigated. Results of this study show that two distinct embrittlement mechanisms exist within the temperature range mentioned above. At higher temperatures, 3 ̆e 550 °C, the activation energy is 57 kcal/mole indicating that the embrittlement process is controlled by diffusion of oxygen. Below 550 °C, the embrittlement activation energy approaches zero, a characteristic of a diffusionless <b>athermal</b> <b>transformation.</b> Furthermore, the SEM examinations reveal that a protective oxide layer is present only at temperatures higher than 550 °C. There is also an indication of increased volume fraction of α phase {{in the vicinity of the}} surface. TEM examinations reveal an increase of the isothermal ω phase as function of the exposure time increase. The general trend of these results lead to the conclusion that embrittlement at higher temperature is caused by enhanced diffusion of oxygen, which increases both the volume fraction of a phase and dissolved oxygen. At lower temperature, below 550 °C, embrittlement is probably caused by an <b>athermal</b> <b>transformation</b> of β to ω phase resulting from oxidation of molybdenum, which is a β stabilizer...|$|E
40|$|The {{progress}} of martensite formation in plain carbon steels Fe- 0. 46 C, Fe- 0. 66 C, and Fe- 0. 80 C {{has been investigated}} by dilatometry. It is demonstrated that carbon enrichment of the remaining austenite due to intercritical annealing of Fe- 0. 46 C and Fe- 0. 66 C does not only depress the start temperature for martensite, but also slows the {{progress of}} the transformation with temperature compared to full austenitization. In contrast, such a change of kinetics is not observed when the remaining austenite of lean-Si steel Fe- 0. 80 C is stabilized due to a partial transformation to bainite, which suggests that the stabilization is not of a chemical but of a mechanical nature. The growth of bainite and martensite is accompanied by a shape change at the microstructural scale, which leads to plastic deformation and thus strengthening of the surrounding austenite. Based on this stabilizing mechanism, the <b>athermal</b> <b>transformation</b> kinetics is rationalized by balancing the increase in driving force corresponding to a temperature decrease with the increase in strain energy required for the formation of martensite in the strengthened remaining austenite.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of dynamic failure in amorphous materials via {{the propagation of}} free boundaries like cracks and voids must go beyond elasticity theory, since plasticity intervenes in a crucial and poorly understood manner near the moving free boundary. In this Letter we focus on failure via a cavitation instability in a radially-symmetric stressed material, set up the free boundary dynamics taking both elasticity and visco-plasticity into account, using the recently proposed <b>athermal</b> Shear <b>Transformation</b> Zone theory.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a finite threshold, the yield stress, for the onset of plastic yielding is a universal feature of plasticity. This jamming-unjamming transition is naturally {{accounted for by the}} dynamics of a bistable internal state field.

We further show that the mean-field theory cannot select the velocity of these fronts and go beyond the mean-field description to include fluctuations and correlations effects, resulting in new nonlocal terms in the equations. Finally, we demonstrate that the new terms, with an associated intrinsic lengthscale, provide a velocity selection mechanism for the plastic fronts.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between stress and martensitic transformation are studied for a low alloyed steel (60 NCD 11) with a Ms temperature of 230 °C. For tensile tests {{carried out at}} temperatures just above Ms, the transformation doesn't exhibit the stress-assisted behavior expected for <b>athermal</b> martensitic <b>transformation.</b> In contrast, for "static" tests, Ms is enhanced even at low stresses, but this enhancement is cooling-rate dependant. A comparison has been made with an Fe-Ni-C-Cr alloy obtained by adding Nickel to the 60 NCD 11 steel and an Fe- 20 Ni - 0. 5 C alloy. For these two alloys Ms is below room temperature. A classical scheme with stress-assisted martensite and strain-induced martensite is observed for the Fe - 20 Ni - 0. 5 C alloy but an intermediate behaviour is obtained for the Fe-Ni-C-Cr alloy...|$|R
40|$|Both x-ray diffuse {{reflectivity}} {{and laser}} light scattering {{have been used}} to investigate the temperature-dependent surface behavior of a Ni{sub 63 }Al{sub 37 } single crystal on different length scales. In-situ experiments were performed above the conventional martensitic start temperature M{sub s}. to search for premartensitic phenomena. X-ray experiments showed the presence of a surface precursor with second-order (continuous) character several 10 K above M{sub s}. This premonitory effect corresponds to a height-height-correlation function which changes on the nanometer scale as the martensitic transformation is approached. At the martensitic transformation, the surface morphology changed from nanoscopic roughness to macroscopic relief within a temperature interval of less than 1 K via intermediate stages. Laser light scattering was employed to study time-dependent aspects of the <b>athermal</b> martensitic <b>transformation</b> above M{sub s}.

40|$|The most {{efficient}} way to tune microstructures and mechanical properties of metallic alloys lies in designing and using <b>athermal</b> phase <b>transformations.</b> Examples are shape memory alloys and high strength steels, which together stand for 1, 500 million tons annual production. In these materials, martensite formation and mechanical twinning are tuned via composition adjustment for realizing complex microstructures and beneficial mechanical properties. Here we report a new phase transformation that has the potential to widen the application window of Ti alloys, the most important structural material in aerospace design, by nanostructuring them via complexion-mediated transformation. This is a reversible martensitic transformation mechanism that leads to a final nanolaminate structure of α″ (orthorhombic) martensite bounded with planar complexions of athermal ω (a–ω, hexagonal). Both phases are crystallographically related to the parent β (BCC) matrix. As expected from a planar complexion, the a–ω is stable only at the hetero-interface. European Commission.

40|$|In {{this study}} phase transformations in {{metastable}} beta Ti 15 Mo alloy were investigated by an in situ electrical resistance measurement {{in a wide}} range of temperatures from 196 C to 850 C. Different temperature ranges of the evolution of electrical resistance were correlated with underlying phase transformations. In the low temperature range, stage I (from 196 C to 220 C) the decrease of electrical resistance with increasing temperature is caused by the dissolution of ωath (formed during quenching by <b>athermal</b> shue <b>transformation)</b> which is accompanied by the relaxation of lattice strain, while the diffusional assisted growth of ωiso in the range from 220 C to 380 C (stage II) is the main mechanism causing the increase of resistance. Another decrease of the resistance in the range from 380 C to 550 C (stage III) is explained by the dissolution or transformation of ωiso. The increase of resistance above 550 C (stage IV) is related to the growth of α-phase particles. The fully reversible character of ωath growth and dissolution during heating and cooling in the stage I up to 100 C was confirmed by temperature cycling during repeated in situ resistance runs from RT. Pre-ageing of samples at 300 C promotes the formation of ωiso particles. Subsequently, ωath particles are not created, which is fully consistent with electrical resistance measurements.

40|$|The {{constitutive}} behaviour of a metastable {{austenitic stainless}} steel during metal forming and hardening is described with a macroscopic model. The steel undergoes a strain-induced transformation during forming. Depending on the annealing conditions, the steel also transforms isothermally as opposed to <b>athermal</b> martensite. This <b>transformation</b> can also take place immediately after plastic deformation, {{as a result of}} the residual stresses. The martensite phase of this steel shows a substantial ageing response, about 1000 N/mm 2. A constitutive model based on the data from literature as well as on measurements is presented which describes the stress–strain behaviour along with the phase transformation. The work hardening is based on dislocation density as internal state variable.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of martensitic {{transformation in}} austenitic Fe-Ni-Mo alloys {{depends on the}} carbon content.

The martensitic transformation was proved by magnetic induction and thermal differential analyses. The increase of carbon content in quenched austenitic alloys leads to the saturation of dislocation atmospheres and to the supersaturation of f. c. c. solid solution. The type of martensitic <b>transformation</b> (<b>athermal</b> or isothermal) kinetics depends on different relaxation resistance of austenite which is controlled by different dislocation pinning degree.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{consistent}} mathematical description of martensite fraction evolution during <b>athermal</b> thermoelastic phase <b>transformation</b> in a {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) induced by a general thermomechanical loading. The global kinetic law {{is based on an}} experimentally de-fined stress-temperature phase diagram, transformation functions for a one-dimensional SMA body and a novel vector hysteresis model. The global kinetic law provides the phase fraction history given a loading path on the stress-temperature phase diagram and an initial value of martensite fraction. The phase transformation is considered to occur only within transformation strips on the phase diagram and only on loading path segments oriented in the transformation direction. The developed procedure can be used to model a range of different SMA transforma-tion behaviors depending on the choice of transformation functions and local kinetic law algo-rithms. The phase fraction evolution is examined for a number of characteristic examples, including cyclic loading resulting in oscillatory transformation paths, and internal loops of partial transformation with associated attractor loops. Differences between the various local kinetic law algorithms used in the overall framework are highlighted. The simulation results using a cosine transformation function are found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. 1...|$|R
40|$|The copper (Cu) {{interconnect}} {{has become}} the bottleneck for bandwidth scaling due to its increasing RC time constant with the decreasing gate line width. Currently, silicon based optical interconnect is widely pursued as the most promising technology to replace Cu in microprocessor chips. Silicon optical interconnect is based on integrated silicon nanophotonic technologies. It can leverage the large scale and low cost of CMOS technology and deliver higher bandwidth with no EMI and low heat dissipation. Passive photonic component, such as waveguides, couplers, filters, splitters, are the backbone of integrated photonic circuit. This thesis {{is dedicated to the}} development of low loss, high performance, high index contrast optical waveguides and couplers via materials, processes engineering, development, and device designs. We primarily focus on SOI single crystalline silicon (c-Si or SOI), PECVD amorphous silicon (a-Si:H, or simplified as a-Si), and PECVD silicon nitride (SiNxHy) based single mode channel waveguides. We have previously identified that sidewall roughness scattering is the dominant loss mechanism for the TE mode in high index contrast single mode channel waveguides. In this thesis, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the roughness scattering and its positive correlations with (1) sidewall optical intensity; (2) sidewall RMS roughness; and (3) sidewall index contrast. Novel processes and designs, such as hard mask and chemical oxidation, are developed based on the above understanding. In single mode, 500 x 200 nm 2 c-Si channel waveguides, we have achieved world-record 2. 7 dB/cm and 0. 7 dB/cm transmission loss coefficients for the TE mode and the TM mode, respectively. For deposited waveguides, bulk absorption loss is also important for both TE and TM modes. For PECVD a-Si, we adapt hydrogen passivation to reduce dangling bond density. (cont.) We also use a thin silicon nitride as the over cladding layer to help preserve H passivation and to reduce sidewall index contrast, acting as the graded index layer for a-Si waveguide core. We have accomplished the lowest reported loss coefficients in directly etched, single mode, 700 x 100 nm 2 a-Si channel waveguides of 2. 7 dB/cm for the TE mode, comparable to c-Si waveguide with similar dimensions. For the first time, damascene process has also been demonstrated as a promising process for a-Si waveguide fabrication. We have achieved a record-low loss of 2. 5 dB/cm in 600 x 100 cm 2 a-Si channel waveguides. Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) is the most critical step. For PECVD SiNxHy, we have previously identified that the absorption loss is due to the resonant absorption caused by N-H vibration. In this thesis, three different low temperature approaches have been developed and optimized to reduce NH concentration in as-deposited SiNxHY via (1) deposition chemistry; (2) post-deposition Ultraviolet light (UV) treatment; and (3) post-deposition, in-situ N 2 /Ar plasma treatment. All three processes are compatible with CMOS back-end processes, such as a-Si process. While changing deposition chemistry is the simplest method to obtain low NH containing SiNxHy, it comes with high SiH concentration and may have undesirable properties. Experimentally, for UV treatment, the highest H removal percentage is 60 %; for plasma treatment, - 90 %. UV treatment shows strong compositional dependence. The underlying mechanism of such dependence is identified and confirmed by Monte-Carlo modeling. Low loss and spectrally broadband optical couplers are indispensable optical components in an integrated photonic circuit. A high performance coupler should be capable of overcoming the mode-size mismatch, mode-shape mismatch, mode-position mismatch, and polarization mismatch, bridging different optical devices with minimal coupling loss. In this thesis, we have demonstrated a fiber-to-waveguide coupler based on asymmetric graded index taper and monolithically integrated cylindrical lens. (cont.) It is capable of transforming single mode light between single mode fiber and waveguides with minimal coupling loss of 0. 45 dB between 1520 nm and 1630 nm. We have also demonstrated a vertical waveguide-to-waveguide coupler that is based on complementary inverse tapers. This design is tolerant of large refractive index mismatch between the two waveguides and also of any fabrication variation that would affect the effective indices of the two waveguides. We have achieved a minimal coupling loss of 0. 25 dB per coupler and excellent broadband behavior is also demonstrated. Slot waveguides are a newly developed class of waveguides with unique optical properties. Slot waveguides can achieve exceptional high optical field in nanometer sized low index regions. In this thesis, we have demonstrated low loss transmission of 6 dB/cm for the fundamental slot mode in horizontal slot waveguides at 1550 nm. The horizontal slot configuration removes the constraints of thin slot definition by lithography and allows an arbitrarily thin slot to be fabricated via deposition or oxidation. Because the resulting interface is much smoother than the etched interface, the transmission loss in horizontal slot waveguides is much lower than in vertical slot waveguides. We also demonstrated that multiple slot configurations result in higher optical confinement compared to single slot configurations with the same slot thickness. The low loss and high optical confinement in the low index slot region realized in horizontal slot waveguides promises many useful applications, such as Er-doped silicon-based light emitters. For integration of slot waveguides with conventional channel waveguides, we have designed and simulated mode couplers and polarization rotators for slot-slot, slot-channel waveguide mode <b>transformations.</b> <b>Athermal</b> operation is important for realizing stable passive, WDM optical network on silicon. Athermal design of silicon waveguide systems uses advanced polymer cladding of large negative TO coefficient to provide compensation for the large positive TO coefficient in silicon. The reduced thermo-optic (TO) effect is experimentally demonstrated by reducing TO coefficient from 85 pm/K to 11 pm/K using polymer films. by Rong Sun. Thesis (Ph. D.)
