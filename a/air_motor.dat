2500|$|Thus if 1.0m3 of {{air from}} the {{atmosphere}} is very slowly compressed into a 5L bottle at , the potential energy stored is 530kJ. A highly efficient <b>air</b> <b>motor</b> can transfer this into kinetic energy if it runs very slowly and manages to expand the air from its initial 20MPa pressure down to 100kPa (bottle completely [...] "empty" [...] at atmospheric pressure). Achieving high efficiency is a technical challenge both due to heat loss to the ambient and to unrecoverable internal gas heat. If the bottle above is emptied to 1MPa, the extractable energy is about 300kJ at the motor shaft.|$|E
50|$|A {{pneumatic}} motor (<b>Air</b> <b>motor)</b> or compressed air engine {{is a type}} of motor which does mechanical work by expanding compressed air. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion. Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or piston actuator, while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type <b>air</b> <b>motor,</b> piston <b>air</b> <b>motor,</b> air turbine or gear type motor.|$|E

5000|$|When {{lubricant}} pumps {{were first}} invented, {{they were used}} to pump oil and lightweight greases. Overtime, lubricant viscosity increased and lubricant pumps were stressed to the limits. The higher viscosity lubricants were required because cars were built to perform at higher RPM (Conley). One outcome of attempting to pump heavier materials was that seals would fail and the lubricant would leak into the <b>air</b> <b>motor.</b> By divorcing the pump tube from the <b>air</b> <b>motor,</b> a seal failure would simply cause grease to be leaked onto the ground, not into the <b>air</b> <b>motor.</b> Also, the new design allowed for easier repairs of the pump or the packings which were being [...] "eaten away" [...] by new materials and chemistry affecting the industry.

50|$|On larger diesel {{generators}} {{found in}} large shore installations and especially on ships, a pneumatic starting gear is used. The <b>air</b> <b>motor</b> is normally powered by compressed air at pressures of 10-30 bar. The <b>air</b> <b>motor</b> {{is made up}} of a center drum {{about the size of a}} soup can with four or more slots cut into it to allow for the vanes to be placed radially on the drum to form chambers around the drum. The drum is offset inside a round casing so that the inlet air for starting is admitted at the area where the drum and vanes form a small chamber compared to the others. The compressed air can only expand by rotating the drum, which allows the small chamber to become larger and puts another one of the cambers in the air inlet. The <b>air</b> <b>motor</b> spins much too fast to be used directly on the flywheel of the engine; instead a large gearing reduction, such as a planetary gear, is used to lower the output speed. A Bendix gear is used to engage the flywheel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — It {{is now a}} banal {{truth that}} the {{environment}} is being subjected to plenty of environmental hazards. These are attributable to pollution that has completely overwhelmed the environment {{which in turn is}} also responsible for bringing about atrocious changes to the environment. The principle reason behind this change is increased carbon emission. Every day, a huge amount of carbon is released in the air because of burning fuel which results in Global Warming. People are gradually realizing this concern and have gradually started to use alternative sources of energy. This paper is about a design of an application which will help facilitate a revolution in Bangladesh. In this design Four Vane <b>Air</b> <b>Motors</b> act as the prime mover. Vane <b>Air</b> <b>Motors</b> contain vanes within an air tight body onto which air at high pressure is passed. The vanes are directly connected to a rotating shaft and hence any force on the vanes causes a torque, which can rotate the shaft helping to drive any load connected to it. Not only does this solve an age old question of finding an energy efficient fuel source, it also proves that efficient fuel can also be environment friendly. The Existing CNG Threewheeler plying the roads of Bangladesh is scrutinized versus the proposed air powered model. Like any new technology, it still has its boundaries but after weighing out {{the pros and cons of}} this technology, it can be safely construed that compressed air technology is sure to dominate...|$|R

Pneumatic technology has advantages over battery-powered technology, including lighter weight, lower operating costs, decreased environmental impact, better reliability, and increased safety. Two prototypes were created that incorporated rotary piston <b>air</b> <b>motors,</b> high-pressure <b>air</b> tanks, and air-pressure regulators. Prototype 1 was created by modifying an existing electric PMD. Range tests were performed to determine the feasibility of pneumatic technology and the optimal combination of components to allow the longest range possible at acceptable speeds over ideal condition s. Using a 1. 44 L air tank for feasibility testing, prototype 1 was capable of traveling 800 m, which confirmed the feasibility of pneumatic technology usage in PMDs. Prototype 2 was designed based on the testing results from prototype 1. After further optimization of prototype 2, the average maximum range was 3, 150 m. Prototype 2 is up to 28. 3 % lighter than an equivalent size electric PMD and can be fully recharged in approximately 2 minutes.
