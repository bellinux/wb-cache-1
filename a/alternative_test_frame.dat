40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this paper}} a choice relation framework for supporting category-partition test case generation. We capture the constraints among various values (or ranges of values) of the parameters and environment conditions identified from the specification, known formally as choices. We express these constraints in terms of relations among choices and combinations of choices, known formally as <b>test</b> <b>frames.</b> We propose a theoretical backbone and techniques for consistency checks and automatic deductions of relations. Based on the theory, algorithms {{have been developed for}} generating <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> from the relations. These <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> can then be used as the basis for generating test cases. Our algorithms take into consideration the resource constraints specified by software testers, thus maintaining the effectiveness of the <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> (and hence <b>test</b> cases) generated. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for automatically generating logical schemata that specify groups of black-box test cases from formal specifications containing universal and existential quantification. These schemata are called <b>test</b> <b>frames.</b> Previous automated techniques {{have dealt with}} languages based on propositional logic. Since this new technique deals with quantification it {{can be applied to}} more expressive specifications. This makes the technique applicable to specifications written at the system requirements level. The limitations imposed by quanti cation are discussed. Industrial needs are addressed by the capabilities of recognizing and augmenting existing <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> and by accommodating a range of specification-coverage schemes. The coverage scheme taxonomy introduced in this paper provides a standard for controlling the number of <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> produced. This technique is intended to automate portions of what is done manually by practitioners. Basing this technique on formal rules of logical derivation ensures that the <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> produced are logical consequences of the specification. It is expected that deriving <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> automatically will offset the cost of developing a formal specification. This tangible product makes formal specification more economically feasible for industry...|$|R
40|$|This study {{contains}} {{the identification of}} modal dynamic properties of a 3 -story large-scale steel <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> structure through shaking table measurements. Shaking table test is carried out to estimate the modal properties of the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> such as natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes. Among many different model structures, ARX (Auto Recursive Exogenous) model structure is used for modal identification of the frame structure system. The unknown parameters in the obtained ARX model structure are estimated by Least-Square method by minimizing the AIC criteria {{with the help of}} a program coded in advanced computing software MATLAB®. The adopted model structure is then tested out in time domain to verify the validity of the model with the selected model parameters. Then the modal characteristics of <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> and the story stiffness are estimated using the white noise shakings. An attempt is done to determine the change of modal characteristics and the story stiffness of <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> according to the velocity, which the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> structure experienced during the shaking schedule and also during the input shaking of El Centro 1940 NS. Results shows that there is an increase in damping ratio and a decrease in both story stiffness and natural frequency for all modes when the damage forms at cementitious device and the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> structure itself during the shaking schedule...|$|R

In a standard <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> fitted with flat wedge grips, the gripping action alone creates stresses on the wire specimen that cause the wire to fail at the grip location. A new <b>test</b> <b>frame,</b> which is outfitted with a vacuum chamber, negated the use of any conventional commercially available wire test fixtures, as only 7 in.

40|$|Advances {{in space}} {{telescope}} and aperture technology {{have created a}} need to launch larger structures into space. Traditional truss structures will be too heavy and bulky to be effectively used {{in the next generation}} of space-based structures. Large deployable structures are a possible solution. By packaging deployable trusses, the cargo volume of these large structures greatly decreases. The ultimate goal is to three dimensionally measure a boom's deployment in simulated microgravity. This project outlines the construction of the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> that supports a gravity offload system. The <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> is stable enough to hold the gravity offload system and does not interfere with deployment of, or vibrations in, the deployable test boom. The natural frequencies and stability of the frame were engineered in FEMAP. The <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> was developed to have natural frequencies that would not match the first two modes of the deployable beam. The frame was then modeled in Solidworks and constructed. The <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> constructed is a stable base to perform studies on deployable structures...|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{problems}} arising in speech processing are characterized by extremely large training and testing sets, constraining the kinds of models and algorithms that lead to tractable implementations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the levels of awareness and use of <b>alternative</b> HIV <b>tests</b> (home collection kit, oral mucosal transudate collection kit, and rapid tests) among people at high risk for HIV infection. METHODS: Data were collected as part of an anonymous, cross-sectional interview study [...] the HIV Testing Survey (HITS) [...] conducted in seven states from September 2000 to February 2001. Three high-risk populations were recruited: men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and high-risk heterosexuals. Respondents were asked about their awareness and use of <b>alternative</b> HIV <b>tests.</b> RESULTS: The overall awareness and use of the <b>alternative</b> <b>tests</b> was limited: 54 % of respondents were aware of the home collection kit, 42 % were aware of the oral mucosal transudate collection kit test, and 13 % were aware of rapid tests. Among those aware of <b>alternative</b> <b>tests,</b> self-reported use of the tests was also low. The most common reasons given for not using <b>alternative</b> HIV <b>tests</b> were: preference for the standard test; concern that the results could be less accurate; and that <b>alternative</b> <b>tests</b> were not offered. CONCLUSIONS: The low levels of awareness and use of <b>alternative</b> HIV <b>tests</b> suggest that the potential for promoting testing among individuals at high risk for HIV by encouraging use of <b>alternative</b> HIV <b>tests</b> has not been fully realized. <b>Alternative</b> <b>tests</b> should be made more broadly available and should be accompanied by education about these tests for physicians and people at risk. Educational efforts should be evaluated to determine if promoting <b>alternative</b> HIV <b>tests</b> increases the numbers of people at risk for HIV who are tested...|$|R

Both transient time-history and nonlinear static (pushover) analyses are considered. The lateral resistance of the <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> is provided by a pair of cold-formed tubular steel members. The brace cross-section is varied between tests to investigate the influence of brace slenderness on the stiffness, resistance and ductility displayed by the frame under strong earthquake loading. Response simulations using a two-dimensional analytical model of the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> are compared with the experimental results. Brace strengths and elastic <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> properties established in complementary static tensile tests and low-level shake table tests, respectively, are used to determine model input data. The transient acceleration and displacement response of the frames calculated in nonlinear time-history analyses are compared with corresponding experimental measurements. The base shear frame drift relationship is calculated using pushover analyses that consider either the resistance of both frame braces or the tension brace alone. These are compared with the experimental hysteretic response of the <b>test</b> <b>frame.</b> On the whole, the analytical results are observed to agree well with the experimental results, especially with respect to brace tension forces and frame base shear.

The quality of these test measures must be evaluated at the design stage, before the actual production, in order to select the most appropriate ones.
