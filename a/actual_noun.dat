5000|$|The New Testament {{does not}} use the <b>actual</b> <b>noun</b> kénōsis but the verb form kenóō occurs five times (Ro.4:14, 1Co.1:17, 9:15, 2Co.9:3, Phil.2:7). Of these five times it is Phil 2:7, in which Jesus {{is said to have}} [...] "emptied himself", which is the {{starting}} point of Christian ideas of kenosis.|$|E
50|$|Tibetan nouns {{are marked}} for six cases: absolutive, agentive, genitive, ablative, {{associative}} and oblique. Particles {{are attached to}} entire noun phrases, not to individual nouns. Case suffixes {{are attached to the}} noun phrase as a whole, while the <b>actual</b> <b>noun</b> remains unchanged. The form taken by the suffix depends on the final sound of the noun to which the suffix is attached.|$|E
50|$|The {{constituency}} {{trees are}} on the left, and the corresponding dependency trees on the right. These trees are merely broadly representative {{of each of the}} possible analyses (many modern constituency grammars would likely reject the relatively flat structures on the left, opting instead for more layered trees). The ellipsis analysis assumes the presence of the elided noun. The null pronoun analysis also assumes ellipsis, but what is absent is not an <b>actual</b> <b>noun,</b> but rather it is a covert pronoun that would perhaps surface as one if it were not elided. The overt pronoun analysis entirely rejects the notion that ellipsis is involved. Instead, it grants the one pre-nominal element the status of an indefinite pronoun.|$|E
5000|$|...Class 17 is a locative class {{containing}} few <b>actual</b> <b>nouns</b> (which {{are often}} used as adverbs). In many other Bantu languages, including Setswana, this class is productive, {{but this is no}} longer the case in Sesotho.|$|R
5000|$|As for pronouns, {{they are}} not gender-specific in {{the first or second}} persons, {{singular}} and plural. In the third person singular, there are four pronouns (the U between brackets can be used or left out, mostly according to personal choice): il(u) (he), el(u) (she), ol(u) (it, when it refers back to an <b>actual</b> inanimate <b>noun,</b> and not in sentences as [...] "Its raining"), and additionally lu, which can be used instead of any of the other three pronouns, whether it be for stylistic purposes, personal choice, or to refer to an indefinite being (usually human or animal) that can be thought of indifferently as male or female. For example: ...|$|R
5000|$|Evan is a Welsh {{masculine}} {{given name}} derived from [...] "Iefan", a Welsh {{form for the}} name John. In other languages it could be compared to [...] "Ivan", [...] "Ian", and [...] "Juan"; the name John itself {{is derived from the}} ancient Hebrew name [...] Yəhôḥānān, which means [...] "YHWH is gracious". Evan also comes from the Gaelic word [...] "Eóghan" [...] meaning [...] "youth" [...] or [...] "young warrior" [...] and Scots for [...] "right-handed". In Hebrew, the <b>actual</b> non-proper <b>noun,</b> [...] "evan/even/eban/eben", literally means [...] "rock". It can also be the shortened version of the Greek name [...] "Evangelos" [...] (meaning messenger, or [...] "Evander" [...] (meaning good man). The old English translation of the name [...] "Evan" [...] could also be interpreted as [...] "Heir of the Earth" [...] or [...] "The King". The name is also occasionally given to females, as with actress Evan Rachel Wood. It may be encountered as a surname, but Evans is usual.|$|R
5000|$|Mockbusters {{based on}} popular {{animated}} films {{are known as}} a [...] "drafting opportunity." [...] For example, Kiara the Brave (a mockbuster of Pixar's Brave) and Puss in Boots: A Furry Tale (a mockbuster of Puss in Boots) use soundalike titling to [...] "draft off" [...] the marketing success ("slipstream") of popular films. [...] "Can you trademark an <b>actual</b> <b>noun?</b> The idea of a battleship?," [...] asks Boxoffice magazine editor Amy Nicholson. The original Puss in Boots was made by DreamWorks Animation by 300 people working for four years {{at the cost of}} $130 million. The mockbuster, with nearly exactly the same name was made by 12 people, in six months, for less than $1 million. For these large production houses, it wasn't just a question of free riding on the marketing success of these more popular films; mockbusters have become a source of bad publicity. Customers who had accidentally bought the mockbuster Puss in Boots: A Furry Tale but did not know that it was a mockbuster gave the original movie bad reviews. Mockbuster producers have had no legal troubles with drafting off as a result of Disney losing a case against GoodTimes Entertainment, which had used similar packaging for their own version of Aladdin.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether modal information elicited empirical effects {{with regard}} to discourse processing. That is, like tense information, one of the linguistic factors shown to be relevant in organizing a discourse representation is modality, where the mood of an utterance indicates {{whether or not it}} is asserted. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used in order to address the question of the qualitative nature of discourse processing, as well as the time course of this process. This experiment investigated pronoun resolution in two-sentence discourses, where context sentences either contained a hypothetical or <b>actual</b> <b>Noun</b> Phrase antecedent. [ [...] . ] That is, at the Verb position in continuation sentences, we found frontal positivity, consistent with the family of P 600 components, and not an N 400 effect, which suggests that the anomalous target sentences caused a revision in discourse structure. Furthermore, sentences exhibiting modal information resulted in negative-going waveforms at other points in the continuation sentence, indicating that modality affects the overall structural complexity of discourse representation...|$|E
