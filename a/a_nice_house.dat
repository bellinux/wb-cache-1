60|$|DAISY. [As though {{talking to}} herself.] I've got {{a husband who}} adores me and <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> to live in. I've got a {{position}} and {{as much money as}} I want. I'm safe. I'm respectable. I ought to be happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle {{would be}} delighted," [...] said Mrs. Berry, with a wilful {{blinking}} of plain facts. [...] "He’s got {{nothing better to}} do; it’s <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> and good food, and he could sit at the open window and sniff at the sea all day long." ...|$|E
50|$|By 1862 the Streiffs were prosperous {{enough to}} build <b>a</b> <b>nicer</b> <b>house</b> for themselves. It {{is the oldest}} {{surviving}} building on the farm, but is not the house pictured at right. Their 1862 farmhouse is in gabled ell form with the then-popular Greek Revival-styled cornice returns, and with bay windows and lunette windows in the gables.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> and I {{like your}} friend," [...] he commented. [...] "It's lucky he invited us, because I don't know how they'd have put us {{up at the}} hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{she did not}} {{immediately}} reply, he continued uneasily, [...] "Miss Preston says we kin get <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little <b>house</b> that is near the Fort, until we want to build." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Mr. Jernshaw. [...] "I don’t {{know the}} sex, then, that’s all. If {{you think that}} you’re going to keep <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> like this all to yourself, you’re mistaken. It’s a home; and where there’s a home a woman comes in, somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{went to live}} at Radnor and for {{a little}} while {{everything}} went well. Margaret had <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> and was gay and happy. She dressed beautiful and entertained a good deal. Then--well, Ronald Fraser's first wife turned up looking for him! She wasn't dead after all.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mercy on us, if that's {{your idea}} of <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house!</b> But I don't know--I have always kept out of it,' Lady Davenant added, {{checking}} herself. Then she went on, 'If you are so fond of Mrs. Berrington I am sorry {{to inform you that}} she is absolutely good-for-nothing.' ...|$|E
60|$|During {{this visit}} Peggotty {{was married to}} Mr. Barkis, and had <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little <b>house</b> of her own, and Davy spent {{the night before he}} was to return home in a little room in the roof.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will intercede with my husband, ma'am,' she said. 'He's a true man if rightly managed; and I'll beg him to {{consider}} your position. 'Tis <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> you've got here,' she added, glancing round, 'and well worth a little sacrifice to keep it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Tim married, {{seven or}} eight years after his master, and settled down in <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little <b>house</b> upon the estate. Although, henceforth, he did no work whatever; he insisted, {{to the end of his}} life, that he was still in Colonel Marryat's service.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{it is like}} a bit of England, Master Wilfrid! That {{might very}} well be the Thames there, and this some gentleman's place near Reading; only the trees are different. When we get up <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> here, with a garden round it, it will be like home again." ...|$|E
60|$|Annie {{lived in}} <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> {{and had a}} little maid. Paul ran gaily up the steps. He {{expected}} his mother laughing in the hall, but it was Annie who opened to him. She seemed distant to him. He stood a second in dismay. Annie let him kiss her cheek.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dear, {{more like}} this than {{anything}} else you have ever seen; but the sun does not always shine so brightly as it does just now, and sometimes there are terrible snow-storms. But we will build you <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> Eda, with a very large fireplace, so that we won't feel the cold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{had a lot}} of {{experience}} with housekeeping, aunty, and don't you think," [...] Kennicott appealed, [...] "that it would be sensible to have <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> square <b>house,</b> and pay more attention to getting a crackajack furnace than to all this architecture and doodads?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1914 {{he visited}} Australia with his wife, the musical comedy actress Madge Temple, who was playing leading roles there. After {{his return to}} Britain during the First World War, Darewski {{combined}} administrative work for charities and prolific composition. He {{was one of the}} first British composers to compose for the new theatrical form, revue, writing, among others, Business as Usual and Push and Go for Albert de Courville, and The Better 'Ole and Carminetta for Charles B. Cochran. Among Darewski's songs are [...] "Sister Susie's Sewing Shirts for Soldiers", [...] "The Big Brass Band", and [...] "Ours is <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>'Ouse</b> Ours Is." [...] He also wrote songs for the London production of Phi-Phi.|$|R
6000|$|But Kipps {{lay awake}} {{for a long}} while {{building}} his house, and in the morning at breakfast he made his meaning clear. He had smarted under the indignities of house agents long enough, and this seemed to promise revenge--a fine revenge. [...] "And, you know, we might reely make rather <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little <b>'ouse</b> out of it--like we want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, {{with a large}} toleration of tone and a deep breath that {{expanded}} his ample chest, [...] "we spend more on our houses nowadays. I started out to build a forty-thousand-dollar house. Well, sir! that fellow has got me in for more than sixty thousand already, and I doubt if I {{get out of it}} much under a hundred. You can't have <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> for nothing. It's just like ordering a picture of a painter. You pay him enough, and he can afford to paint you a first-class picture; and if you don't, he can't. That's all there is of it. Why, they tell me that A. T. Stewart gave one of those French fellows sixty thousand dollars for a little seven-by-nine picture the other day. Yes, sir, give an architect money enough, and he'll give you <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> every time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You've <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> Joseph,' I {{could not}} refrain from observing, 'and {{pleasant}} inmates; and I think the concentrated essence {{of all the}} madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with theirs! However, {{that is not to}} the present purpose--there are other rooms. For heaven's sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On and on I galloped {{up a steep}} road. I {{remember}} hearing lions roaring round me in the darkness. I remember one of them springing upon my horse and the poor beast's scream. Then I remember no more till I found myself--I {{believe it was a}} week or so later--lying on the verandah of <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> and being attended by some good-looking women of an Abyssinian cast of countenance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Aunt Geoffrey {{would not}} come here, {{because she did not}} wish to be far from London, because old Lady Susan has not been well. And only think, Fred, Queen Bee says there is <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> to be let close to the village, and they went to look at it with grandpapa, and he kept on saying how well it would do for us." ...|$|R
50|$|If {{you miss}} the direct buses to Sirigere, you can board in any bus plying between Chitradurga and Davangere, and get down at the Arch (Sirigere Bennur Circle). From this Bennur Circle, many private mini vans, jeeps are {{available}} to Sirigere (6 km). There is <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guest <b>house</b> of the Ashram to stay even if you arrive in Sirigere at late hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came across}} a young fellow the other day," [...] {{continued}} the Senator, [...] "in <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> with £700 <b>a</b> year, and learned that he had inherited the living because he was his father's second son. Some poor clergyman had been keeping it ready for him for {{the last fifteen years}} and had to turn out as soon as this young spark could be made a clergyman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she explained, [...] "they're {{married and}} {{gone off to}} farm; but what I {{want to tell you}} is that I'm going to follow their example to-morrow. It's quite straight. We're to be married in the morning. He says he's got <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> and he looks as if he'd treat me decently." [...] She laid her hand on Alison's arm, and seemed to hesitate. [...] "A neighbor, another farmer, came in with him--and he hasn't found anybody yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|James {{reflected}} sourly {{that they}} had <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> (rather small) in an excellent position, no children, and no money troubles. Soames was reserved about his affairs, but he must be getting a very warm man. He had a capital income from the business--for Soames, like his father, {{was a member of}} that well-known firm of solicitors, Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte--and had always been very careful. He had done quite unusually well with some mortgages he had taken up, too--a little timely foreclosure--most lucky hits! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a pretty}} place {{you live in}} here, Tot, an' <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house.</b> It's there the lady lives, I suppose who has the strange fancy to keep her wealth in a box on the sideboard? Well, it is curious, but there's no accountin' for the fancies o' the rich, Tot. An' you say she keeps no men-servants about her? Well, that's wise, for men are {{dangerous}} characters for women to 'ave about 'em. She's quite right. There's a dear little dog too, she keeps, I'm told. Is that the only one she owns?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite, my dear. In {{such a case}} as this, {{one must}} be {{particular}} about ages. She is {{a few years older}} than he is probably, but she is not bad looking, and a good woman with <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> big <b>house</b> and lots of money. He has walked out of my office into a fine position, and I unselfishly congratulated him with all my heart." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Rancho bar has {{recently}} acquired a dj formerly from San Francisco, who plays every other Tuesday, Rick, who plays <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> mix of <b>house</b> and old school, who brings a fresh sound to the slightly dated bar.|$|R
6000|$|He confided. [...] "She wants a {{week-end}} cottage. But I don't see why {{it should}} be a week-end cottage. I don't {{see why it}} shouldn't be made into <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little country <b>house.</b> Compact, of course. By using up that barn." ...|$|R
60|$|To these {{arguments}} Meinik had reluctantly yielded. He was somewhat {{proud of the}} position that he occupied, as one of some authority {{in the establishment of}} the principal merchants on the coast. He was fond of his wife and little children; and felt that to be established among strangers, of different habits and race, would be very terrible for them. Stanley bought him <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> at Rangoon and, as his rate of pay, which had been gradually increased, was now sufficient to cause him to rank high among the native population, he himself came to feel that he had done wisely in accepting Stanley's advice.|$|E
60|$|For {{the rest}} Dorcas was fairly comfortable, as with their means {{she was always}} able to have <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> in {{whatever}} town they might be stationed, where she could give tennis parties and even little lunches and dinners, that is if her husband chanced to be away, as often he was visiting up-country districts, or taking the duty there for another missionary who was sick or on leave. Indeed, in these conditions she came to like Africa fairly well, for she was a chilly little thing who loved its ample, all-pervading sunshine, and made a good many friends, especially among young men, to whom her helplessness and rather forlorn little face appealed.|$|E
6000|$|Alexander Abraham's {{place was}} about three miles along the White Sands road. I knew the house as soon as I came to it by its {{neglected}} appearance. It needed paint badly; the blinds were crooked and torn; weeds grew up to the very door. Plainly, there was no woman about THAT place. Still, it was <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>house,</b> and the barns were splendid. My father always said that when a man's barns were bigger than his house {{it was a sign}} that his income exceeded his expenditure. So it was all right that they should be bigger; but it was all wrong that they should be trimmer and better painted. Still, thought I, what else could you expect of a woman hater? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'She fell in {{love with}} me on top of a bus in the Mile End Road,' he ses. 'Love at fust sight it was. She's a widder lady with <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little <b>'ouse</b> at Bow, and plenty to live on-her 'usband having been a builder. I don't know what to do. You see, if I married both of 'em it's sure to be found out sooner or later.' ...|$|R
60|$|MARTHA--Three {{years and}} two--both girls. [She goes on sadly.] We had <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little <b>house</b> in Goldfield. [Forcing a smile.] We were very respectable home folks then. The {{wandering}} came later, after--It was a Sunday in winter when Curt and I had gone visiting some friends. The nurse girl fell asleep--or something--and the children sneaked {{out in their}} underclothes and played in the snow. Pneumonia set in--and a week later they were both dead.|$|R
2500|$|Our {{street was}} called Carr Street after my Father. We had <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> <b>house</b> and <b>a</b> lovely garden... Carr Street {{was a very}} fine street. The dirt road waved {{up and down and}} in and out. the horses made it that way, zigzagging the carts and {{carriages}} through it. The rest of the street was green grass and wild roses. [...] In front of our place Father had made a gravel walk but after our trees stopped there were just two planks to walk on.|$|R
