40|$|Following initial {{discussions in}} 2006 within the {{framework}} of the EURATOM – <b>ABACC</b> R&D Cooperation Agreement, in 2012 the European Union engaged into a cooperation project to strengthen Safeguards Capabilities at <b>ABACC</b> (the Brazilian-Argentinean Agency for Accountancy and Control). <b>ABACC</b> expressed interest in having access to two new Safeguards capabilities based on two JRC technologies approved for Safeguards use by both EURATOM and IAEA. This four-year cooperation project is funded by the European Commission Directorate General for Development and Cooperation – EuropeAid (DEVCO), under the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation (INSC). The new capabilities to be created at <b>ABACC</b> are: (i) Verification of complex plant design and lay-out ("as-is") and (ii) Containment of Spent Fuel in a complex Storage Environment. This is to be achieved by transferring to <b>ABACC</b> two JRC-owned technologies: (a) 3 D Laser Verification System and (b) Ultrasonic Seals. The development of the two technologies to be transferred were funded by JRC's internal work-programme and targeted to Safeguards under the framework of the European Commission Support Programme to the IAEA (tasks EC-E- 1425 and EC-E- 1559). The transfer of technologies includes a set of comprehensive training actions and field support activities. Close coordination with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) takes place during the whole project’s lifetime. The European Commission Directorate General for Energy (EURATOM Safeguards) is also informed on the project progress and achievements. Given the technologies to be transferred have been approved and are used by the IAEA, it will be possible at the end of the project to have the Safeguards equipment being jointly used by <b>ABACC</b> and the IAEA. This paper details all aspects of this cooperation project. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E
40|$|Design Information Verification (DIV) {{is a very}} {{important}} activity in verifying the operator declaration to detect possible changes that may represent diversion scenarios in nuclear installations or their misuses. Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (<b>ABACC)</b> has become involved in the application of safeguards to complex and sensitive facilities, where the physical verification of the design present status is sometimes complex and a long task. The methodology to carry out the DIV has been improved recently. However, the way to execute some tasks is still relying on the expertise and technical background of the inspectors. One of the tools that is currently available to increase the effectiveness of the DIV process is the 3 D Laser Range Finder (3 DLR) developed by the European Commission¿s Joint Research Centre (JRC). This tool is currently used by the IAEA, and <b>ABACC</b> considers it is a very promising tool to be used at facilities having numerous pipes, tanks and accessories. Besides, the technology applied contributes for non proliferation because the information can be kept at the facility, and requires less intrusive access to the plant. <b>ABACC</b> and JRC started cooperating on the 3 D Laser Range Finder (3 DLR) for Design Information Verification within the scope of the general ABACC-EURATOM cooperation agreement. This paper presents the advantages of the technology, the applications envisaged by <b>ABACC,</b> and the technical features of the 3 DLR system for these applications. The paper also describes the operational aspects of the application and the necessary procedure to be agreed among operator, States and Safeguards agencies (<b>ABACC</b> and IAEA).

40|$|Nuclear {{cooperation}} between Argentina and Brazil {{has been growing}} since the early 1980 `s and as it grew, so did cooperation with the US Department of Energy (DOE). The Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (<b>ABACC)</b> was formed in December 1991 to operate the Common System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (SCCC). In April 1994, <b>ABACC</b> and the DOE signed an Agreement of Cooperation in nuclear material safeguards. This cooperation has included training safeguards inspectors, exchanging nuclear material measurement and containment and surveillance technology, characterizing reference materials, and studying enrichment plant safeguards. The goal of the collaboration is to exchange technology, evaluate new technology in Latin American nuclear facilities, and strengthen regional safeguards.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the technical cooperation agreements between the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the European Atomic Energy Commission (EURATOM), and between DOE and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of nuclear materials (<b>ABACC),</b> a collaborative effort has been established to investigate the use of a three dimensional (3 D) laser imaging system combined with gamma imaging systems for international safeguards applications. The effort is being conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy (JRC-Ispra) and <b>ABACC.</b> In a previous study, ORNL, LLNL and JRC-Ispra demonstrated the capability of combining outputs from a commercially available 3 D laser system and gamma-ray imager prototypes. Because safeguards inspections rely heavily on design information verification, gamma and neutron measurements, the possibility of combining different measurement techniques into one tool would optimize inspection effort and increase effectiveness. This paper describes the collaborative effort, presents the technology under investigation ¿ a Compton imaging and a coded aperture gamma-imager prototypes, and the 3 D laser imager ¿, and introduces the preliminary results of measurements conducted in controlled environments.

40|$|The {{so-called}} "Cristallini Method" for {{sampling of}} UF 6 by adsorption and hydrolysis in alumina pellets inside a fluorothene P- 10 tube {{has been developed}} by the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (<b>ABACC)</b> several years ago [1]. This method has several advantages compared to the currently used sampling method, for which UF 6 is distilled into a stainless steel tube for transportation, with hydrolysis and isotopic analysis being performed after shipping to the analytical laboratory. Using the Cristallini sampling method the transport is cheaper and relatively safer concerning radiological protection aspects. In order to be reliable for both scientific and nuclear safeguards applications, the Cristallini sampling method {{has been subjected to}} a rigorous validation program. This includes a variety of sampling materials and measurement methods for the isotopic analyses as well as numerous participating laboratories around the world. The involved organizations include laboratories in Argentina, Brazil (collaborating within <b>ABACC),</b> Germany, Belgium (sites of Joint Research Centre, JRC, in Karlsruhe and Geel, respectively), Austria (Safeguards Analytical Services Laboratory of the IAEA) and within the United States, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the NBL-Program office and ASTM. This technical report describes in particular the application of the "Double Spike" method by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (DS/TIMS) for the validation program of the Cristallini method, performed by staff from the unit JRC-G. 2 in Geel/Belgium (formerly IRMM) in collaboration with staff from SGAS/IAEA. The results are in good mutual agreement, but they reveal slight differences for the 235 U/ 238 U isotope ratios for samples taken by the Cristallini method compared to samples processed in the traditional manner by distillation and subsequent direct hydrolysis. For test samples prepared by <b>ABACC</b> using the IRMM- 020 (0. 2 % 235 U) and IRMM- 022 (0. 72 % 235 U) certified UF 6 reference materials, significant differences of about 0. 01 %- 0. 02 % were observed, but for test samples prepared from IRMM- 023 (3. 3 % 235 U) the differences are insignificant. The reason for the observed differences is not yet known, they can be due to fractionation, contamination or memory effects occurred during the sampling or subsequent chemical processing. The results from JRC-G. 2 and SGAS/IAEA using the double spike method play a special role within the validation program due to the high precision of this method. The results are proposed to be included for the intended standardization of the Cristallini sampling method through ASTM, in particular for defining an additional uncertainty component to account for the sampling process and the subsequent sample preparation, which would have to be attributed in the future to all isotopic measurements on samples taken by the Cristallini sampling method.

40|$|In 2017 the JRC-G. 2 /METRO {{team has}} contributed to {{standardization}} of methods developed at JRC for nuclear mass spectrometry in various ways. Firstly, in early 2017 the revision of the ASTM standard document for the "classical" total evaporation (TE) method, written by K. Mathew (LANL, US-DOE) and S. Richter (JRC-G. 2 /METRO), was published with designation ASTM C 1672 - 17. The document contains {{a detailed description of}} the TE method for U and Pu measurements, which was originally developed at JRC in the late 1980 s. S. Richter from JRC-G. 2 /METRO contributed to the revision of ASTM 1672 in particular to the newly defined requirements for calibration and quality control for TE measurements, as well as by providing new algorithms for uranium and plutonium concentration measurements by IDMS (Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry). Secondly, during the year 2017 a new draft standard document has been written by S. Richter (JRC-G. 2 /METRO). The document contains {{a detailed description of the}} "Double Spike" method (DS/TIMS) for high precision 235 U/ 238 U isotope ratio measurements. The first draft has been submitted for the C 26 - 05 sub-committee ballot on 04 / 09 / 2017. The double spike method for TIMS was used successfully for the validation program of the Cristallini method for sampling of UF 6, to which staff from the unit JRC-G. 2 in Geel/Belgium (formerly IRMM) and the SGAS/IAEA contributed successfully. Thirdly, S Richter (JRC-G. 2 /METRO) revised the draft "New Practice for Sampling and Preparation of UF 6 using the ABACC-Cristallini Method", which was drafted by P. Mason (NBL Program Office, US-DOE) and O. Pereira (IPEN, <b>ABACC)</b> and which will include the validation report as an annex.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report that closed a joint {{collaboration}} effort between DOE and the National Nuclear Energy Commission of Brazil (CNEN). In 2005, DOE and CNEN started a collaborative effort to evaluate measures that can strengthen the effectiveness of international safeguards at a natural uranium conversion plant (NUCP). The work was performed by DOE s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and CNEN. A generic model of a NUCP was developed and typical processing steps were defined. Advanced instrumentation and techniques for verification purposes were identified and investigated. The scope of the work was triggered by the International Atomic Energy Agency s 2003 revised policy concerning {{the starting point of}} safeguards at uranium conversion facilities. Prior to this policy only the final products of the uranium conversion plant were considered to be of composition and purity suitable for use in the nuclear fuel cycle and therefore, subject to the IAEA safeguards control. DOE and CNEN have explored options for implementing the IAEA policy, although Brazil understands that the new policy established by the IAEA is beyond the framework of the Quadripartite Agreement of which {{it is one of the}} parties, together with Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (<b>ABACC)</b> and the IAEA.

40|$|As {{a part of}} the International Remote Monitoring Project, during March 1995, a Remote Monitoring System (RMS) was {{installed}} at the Embalse Nuclear Power Station in Embalse, Argentina. This system monitors the status of four typical Candu spent fuel dry storage silos. The monitoring equipment for each silo consists of analog sensors for temperature and gamma radiation measurement; digital sensors for motion detection; and electronic fiber-optic seals. The monitoring system for each silo is connected to a wireless Authenticate Item Monitoring System (AIMS). This paper describes the operation of the RMS {{during the first year of}} the trial and presents the results of the signals reported by the system compared with the on site inspections conducted by the regulatory bodies, <b>ABACC,</b> IAEA, ENREN. As an additional security feature, each sensor periodically transmits authenticated State-of-Health (SOH) messages. This feature provides assurance that all sensors are operational and have not been tampered with. The details of the transmitted information and the incidents of loss of SOH, referred to as Missing SOH Event, and the possible causes which produced the MSOHE are described. The RMS at the embalse facility uses gamma radiation detectors in a strong radiation field of spent fuel dry storage silos. The detectors are Geiger Muller tubes and Silicon solid state diodes. The study of the thermal drift of electronics in GM detectors and the possible radiation damage in silicon detectors is shown.
