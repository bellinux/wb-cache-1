40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} status of the NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) Double Data Rate 2 (DDR 2) Reliability effort for FY 2012. The task expanded the focus of evaluating reliability effects targeted for device examination. FY 11 work highlighted the need to test many more parts and to examine more operating conditions, in order to provide useful recommendations for NASA users of these devices. This year's efforts focused on development of test capabilities, particularly focusing on those {{that can be used to}} determine overall lot quality and identify outlier devices, and test methods that can be employed on components for flight use. Flight <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> potentially includes considerable time for up-screening (though this time may not currently be used for much reliability testing). Manufacturers are much more knowledgeable about the relevant reliability mechanisms for each of their devices. We are not in a position to know what the appropriate reliability tests are for any given device, so although reliability testing could be focused for a given device, we are forced to perform a large campaign of reliability tests to identify devices with degraded reliability. With the available up-screening time for NASA parts, it is possible to run many device performance studies. This includes verification of basic datasheet characteristics. Furthermore, it is possible to perform significant pattern sensitivity studies. By doing these studies we can establish higher reliability of flight components. In order to develop these approaches, it is necessary to develop test capability that can identify reliability outliers. To do this we must test many devices to ensure outliers are in the sample, and we must develop characterization capability to measure many different parameters. For FY 12 we increased capability for reliability characterization and sample size. We increased sample size this year by moving from loose devices to dual inline memory modules (DIMMs) with an approximate reduction of 20 to 50 times in terms of per device under test (DUT) cost. By increasing sample size we have improved our ability to characterize devices that may be considered reliability outliers. This report provides an update on the effort to improve DDR 2 testing capability. Although focused on DDR 2, the methods being used can be extended to DDR and DDR 3 with relative ease...|$|E

Component-based frameworks tailored specifically for the domain of database integration are lacking, however. To use an existing component framework, data integrators must construct custom components specialized to the tasks of the data integration problem at hand. This approach allows other components provided by the framework to be reused, but is overly tedious and requires the integrator to employ the programming paradigms assumed by the component framework for interconnection and intercommunication between <b>components,</b> and manipulation <b>of</b> data provided by them.

40|$|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) {{is treated}} psychologically with {{exposure}} and cognitive restructuring techniques. Shapiro's (1995) Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) treatment for PTSD involves imaginal exposure, cognitive restructuring, and {{rapid eye movements}} (EMs). EMDR has been presented as an advance {{in the treatment of}} PTSD, based on the theory that rapid EMs facilitate the accelerated processing of trauma-related information, via the activation of physiological mechanisms which stimulate retrieval of positive memories and emotions (Shapiro, 1995). It is suggested in this literature review that Shapiro's EMs theories are unsound, and that claims that EMDR is superior to traditional PTSD treatments are premature, but it is proposed that EMDR may have therapeutic benefits in treating PTSD. It is suggested that the exposure and cognitive restructuring <b>components</b> <b>of</b> EMDR may be more critical than the EMs in reducing PTSD symptoms. However, the EMs may facilitate client <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> these <b>components</b> by distracting clients from their anxiety and reducing the intensity of imaginal exposure.

This paper investigates the influence of uniformity in surface appearance of diecast AZ 91 D plates on their corrosion behaviour. Through immersion, hydrogen collection and weight loss measurements it was found that corrosion is more likely to occur on the areas of the plate that appear to be darker, leading to a non-uniformly corroded surface. Microstructural analysis showed that the non-uniformity in appearance is related to a difference in the morphology and distribution of porosity across the surface of a diecast AZ 91 D plate. The darker areas of the surface are high in porosity which breaks the continuity of the beta-phase network and provides shortcut paths for corrosion from the surface to the interior of the casting. The brighter shiny areas of the surface are much less porous, with isolated pores being confined by corrosion resistant beta-precipitates thus reducing the corrosion rate...|$|R
40|$|Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is an oral dysaesthesia {{that causes}} chronic orofacial {{pain in the}} absence of a detectable organic cause. The aetiology of BMS is complex and multifactorial, and has been associated in the literature with menopause, trigger events and even genetic polymorphisms. Other studies have found evidence for mechanisms such as central and peripheral nervous system changes, with clinical and laboratory investigations supporting a neuropathologic cause. These physiological explanations notwithstanding, there is still much evidence that BMS aetiology has at least some psychological elements. Somatoform pain disorder has been suggested as a mechanism and factors such as personality, stress, anxiety, depression and other psychological, psychosocial and even psychiatric disorders play a demonstrable role in BMS aetiology and symptomatology. In order to treat BMS patients, both physiological and psychological factors must be managed, but patient <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>components</b> <b>of</b> psychological disease basis is a major hurdle. Clinical signs of patient stress, anxiety or depression are a useful reinforcement of clinical discussions.

40|$|AbstractComponent-Based Software Development is an {{emerging}} {{discipline in the}} field of Software Engineering. When constructing component-based systems, we must be sure that the cooperative behaviour <b>of</b> the <b>components</b> and their interaction will be successful. In this paper, we use Linda to specify the interactive behaviour <b>of</b> software <b>components.</b> To do this, we first introduce a process algebra for Linda, and then we define a compatibility relation providing conditions that ensure safe composition. This relation takes into account the state of a shared tuple space which represents the current execution. Indeed, a Linda-based computation is characterized by the store's evolution, so that the set of tuples included into the store governs each computation step. In this context, the success of the composition of a pair of agents in presence of a suitable store can be useful to condition the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a given <b>component</b> into an open running system. In order to extend our approach to complex systems, where constructing a system involves more than two components, we propose the use of distributed tuple spaces as the glue to join components...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} user-centric framework was {{the result}} of integrating previous research, after conducting a comprehensive study of existing human-centric frameworks and related theories. The expert evaluation has been designed to validate the framework’s attributes and the results of this validation reflect the experts’ confirmation and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the framework’s <b>components.</b> Yet, some amendments have been made to the framework according to the experts’ recommendations. In the socio-psychological perspective, computer knowledge has been replaced by social network knowledge. Most social network users should already have basic computer knowledge but their knowledge of social networking sites and applications is more critical to the study purpose. In the perceptual perspective, two dimensions are included which are risk perception and the user competence dimensions. The risk perception includes the severity of threat and the likelihood of threat while user competence includes self-efficacy, privacy awareness, security awareness, and past experience. In the socio-emotional perspective, two dimensions are included which are the motivation dimension, and the trust dimension which includes the attributes of trusting SN members and trusting SN provider.|$|R
40|$|<b>Acceptance</b> <b>of</b> ITS <b>components</b> {{that are}} {{designed}} to increase capacity will hinge {{on the extent to which}} additional capacity induces additional travel. This study addressed methodologies for studying the effects of capacity on travel: 1) before and after studies or travel times and volumes in corridors in which capacity had been increased, 2) surveys of users of routes on which capacity had been increased, and 3) statistical changes in county VMT as a function of freeway capacity. On I- 80 in the Bay Area, the site selected for the investigation, travel times and volumes were quite variable. This suggests that a fairly high volume of data are required to draw conclusions about changes in volumes. Furthermore, construction destroyed most of the existing loop detectors, and new detectors were not connected immediately. Thus such comparisons may not be possible in the short term if researchers do not have an alternate method of obtaining a sufficient quantity of volume data. A survey was designed, but was not tested, because it was decided to survey travelers on I- 80 rather than Route 85 as initially planned in order to use the survey to explain whatever differences were observed and to provide information on the extent to which the travel time savings motivated changes in job or housing location. The statistical analysis of changes in VMT based on Smog Check data did not prove feasible because the data were not available at a level of aggregation needed for such an analysis.

40|$|Software plays a {{steadily}} increasing {{role in the}} value creation chain of today's companies. Due to this high impact of software it {{becomes more and more}} necessary to enhance the process of developing and operating software solutions. At the present time component-based software development {{is one of the most}} promising approaches to meet this challenge. The reuse <b>of</b> existing <b>components</b> is the key success factor in implementing this development paradigm. However, despite the existence <b>of</b> <b>component</b> technologies like J 2 EE or. NET, which facilitate the reuse <b>of</b> software <b>components</b> on a technical level, a lot of obstacles are based on non-technical issues. The main aspect is the lack of tool support for managing the reuse <b>of</b> software <b>components</b> which is especially impedimental for developing software in distributed teams. This thesis therefore had the objective of designing and implementing a component repository for storing and managing software components with the focus on increasing the level <b>of</b> <b>component</b> reuse. The thesis defines a framework of services for the component repository which comprises basic services for uploading and retrieving components including versioning and release management. In addition to these basic services which are already partially implemented in currently available products the thesis focuses on the definition of value-added services which offer additional benefits to the users of the system and thus increase the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>component</b> repository. Examples for valueadded services are notification mechanisms, reuse references, incentive systems and the recording of performance indicators. In addition to the service framework the thesis defines a classification scheme and a specification method based on the industry standards XML und UML in order to enable the uniform description <b>of</b> the <b>components</b> stored in the repository. To successfully establish a central component repository in an existing organization the development processes and organizational structures have to be adopted to support component reuse. In the context of this thesis the relevant activities, roles and skills for performing this organizational transition are described and complemented with a step-by-step rollout strategy. In order to validate the concepts developed in the thesis a web-based component repository implementing the basic and value-added services was realized using J 2 EE technologies and open source components. A further validation was conducted by applying the concepts in three use cases in different areas: the development of automotive software, the development of text recognition systems and the development of applications for technical surveillance organizations. The thesis concludes with summarizing considerations and an outlook on future developments regarding software reuse...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a qualitative study to investigate the perceptions and experiences of health workers involved in a a cluster-randomized controlled trial of a novel intervention to improve health worker malaria case-management in 107 government health facilities in Kenya. The intervention involved sending text-messages about paediatric outpatient malaria case-management accompanied by "motivating" quotes to health workers' mobile phones. Ten malaria messages were developed reflecting recommendations from the Kenyan national guidelines. Two messages were delivered per day for 5 working days and the process was repeated for 26 weeks (May to October 2009). The accompanying quotes were unique to each message. The intervention was delivered to 119 health workers and there were significant improvements in correct artemether-lumefantrine (AL) management both immediately after the intervention (November 2009) and 6 months later (May 2010). In-depth interviews with 24 health workers were undertaken to investigate the possible drivers of this change. The results suggest high <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> all <b>components</b> <b>of</b> the intervention, with the active delivery of information in an on the job setting, the ready availability of new and stored text messages and the perception of being kept 'up to date' as important factors influencing practice. Applying the construct of stages of change we infer that in this intervention the SMS messages were operating primarily at the action and maintenance stages of behaviour change achieving their effect by creating an enabling environment and providing a prompt to action for the implementation of case management practices that had already been accepted as the clinical norm by the health workers. Future trials testing the effectiveness of SMS reminders in creating an enabling environment for the establishment of new norms in clinical practice as well as in providing a prompt to action for the implementation of the new case-management guidelines are justified...|$|R
