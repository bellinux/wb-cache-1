The Red Army was dispersed and still preparing when the invasion commenced. Their units were often separated and lacked adequate transportation.|$|E
5|$|Laika {{died within}} hours from overheating, {{possibly}} {{caused by a}} failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution of 1917, {{many of the}} Bolsheviks who {{had been}} {{involved}} in the robbery gained political power in the new Soviet Union. Lenin went on to become its first premier until his death in 1924, followed by Stalin until his death in 1953. Maxim Litvinov became a Soviet diplomat, serving as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (1930–1939). Leonid Krasin initially quit politics after the split from Lenin in 1909, but rejoined the Bolsheviks after the 1917 Revolution and served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> trade representative in London and as People's Commissar for Foreign Trade until his death in 1926.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Moldavian SSR had a Romanian majority, Romania never had strident claims against <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> could use {{economic}} sanctions or even threaten invasion.|$|R
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} four ships was plagued with {{difficulties}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> shipbuilding and related industries were not prepared to build such large ships. One battleship, Sovetskaya Belorussiya, was cancelled on 19 October 1940 after serious construction flaws were found. Construction {{of the other three}} ships was suspended shortly after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, and never resumed. All three of the surviving hulls were scrapped in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Down {{from the}} slopes {{in front of}} Prokhorovka, the massed Soviet armour charged with five tank brigades of the 18th and 29th Tank Corps, firing as they came at Leibstandartes positions. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> tanks rolled down the slopes, they carried {{the men of the}} 9th Guards Airborne Division on their hulls. The troops of Leibstandarte were not slated to go into action until later in the day. Exhausted from the {{previous}} week's fighting, many were just starting their day {{at the outset of the}} attack. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> armour appeared, German outposts all across the corps' frontage began firing purple warning flares signalling a tank attack. Obersturmbannführer Rudolf von Ribbentrop, commander of a panzer company under the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, stated that he knew at once a major attack was underway. He ordered his company of seven Panzer IVs to follow him over a bridge across an anti-tank ditch. Crossing the bridge they fanned out on the lower slope of Hill 252.2. On the crest of the hill, Sturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's 3rd Panzergrenadier Battalion of the 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment were being overrun.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{government}} purchased <b>the</b> M-156 from Martin in 1937. The sale {{included a}} set of production plans, engineering specifications and manufacturing licenses <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> intended to mass-produce this aircraft.

5|$|From 26 to 28 June 1944, Shanina {{participated in}} the {{elimination}} of the encircled German troops near Vitebsk during the Vitebsk–Orsha Offensive. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> army advanced further westward, from 8 to 13 July of the same year, Shanina and her sisters-in-arms took part in the struggle for Vilnius, which had been under German occupation since 24 June 1941. The Germans were finally driven out from Vilnius on 13 July 1944. During the Soviet summer offensives of that year Shanina managed to capture three Germans.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to their stated objectives, Soviet {{troops and the}} predominantly Azerbaijani soldiers in the AzSSR OMON and army forcibly uprooted Armenians living in the 24 villages strewn across Shahumyan {{to leave their homes}} and settle elsewhere in Nagorno-Karabakh or in the neighboring Armenian SSR. British journalist Thomas de Waal has described Ring <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's first and only civil war. Some authors have also described the actions of the joint Soviet and Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing. The military operation was accompanied by systematic and gross human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|After Soviet units {{completed}} the {{operation in the}} towns, they ordered a full-scale deportation of all resident Armenians in the two towns, helicoptering them to Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, and later to Armenia proper. Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described the acts of violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May.|$|E
50|$|Tensions {{were already}} high between <b>the</b> Hungarian and <b>Soviet</b> water polo teams, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had taken {{advantage}} of their political control of Hungary to study and copy the training methods and tactics of the Olympic champion Hungarians.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>soviet</b> republics were {{short-lived}} communist revolutionary {{governments that}} {{were established in}} {{what had been the}} Russian Empire after the October Revolution and under its influence. These states included some such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian <b>Soviet</b> Socialist Republic and <b>the</b> Latvian Socialist <b>Soviet</b> Republic which won independence from Russia during the civil war period. Others such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian <b>Soviet</b> Republic and <b>the</b> Socialist <b>Soviet</b> Republic of Byelorussia later became union republics of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and are now independent states. Still others such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Kuban <b>Soviet</b> Republic and <b>the</b> Bukharan People's <b>Soviet</b> Republic were absorbed into other polities and no longer formally exist under those names.|$|R
50|$|The M1914/30 {{also saw}} use in World War II, {{but it was}} {{eventually}} replaced by <b>the</b> RGD-33 grenade <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet's</b> primary stick grenade.The Axis forces used captured M1914/30 grenades, which they classified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> HG 336(r), or Handgranate 336 (russische).|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Army {{pushed the}} Wehrmacht {{back on the}} Eastern Front, it became {{necessary}} to reactivate Prinz Eugen as a gunnery support vessel; on 1 October 1943, the ship was reassigned to combat duty. In June 1944, Prinz Eugen, the heavy cruiser Lützow, and the 6th Destroyer Flotilla formed the Second Task Force, later renamed Task Force Thiele after its commander, Vizeadmiral August Thiele. Prinz Eugen was at this time {{under the command of}} KzS Hans-Jürgen Reinicke; throughout June she steamed in the eastern Baltic, northwest of the island of Utö as a show of force during the German withdrawal from Finland. On 19–20 August, the ship steamed into the Gulf of Riga and bombarded Tukums. Four destroyers and two torpedo boats supported the action, along with Prinz Eugens Ar 196 floatplanes; the cruiser fired a total of 265 shells from her main battery. Prinz Eugens bombardment was instrumental in the successful repulse of the Soviet attack.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay. After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in the relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she could be used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
50|$|From 1942 to 1944 he {{was imprisoned}} by Nazi Germany. In 1945 he was freed by the Red Army, {{only to be}} quickly {{deported}} to Poland <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> tried to destroy the archdiocese of Vilnius in <b>the</b> Lithuanian <b>Soviet</b> Socialist Republic. He died in 1955.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, 4 Iranian Chinooks strayed into <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union while training. One {{was damaged}} and one {{shot down by}} a Soviet pilot in a MiG-23 Flogger.

5|$|Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's {{advance on}} Dresden, and ordered it {{to pull back}} and secure the breach. On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th {{remained}} near Dresden. For a while Świerczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev. Konev also sent his chief of staff, General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov, and his chief of operations, General Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev, {{to look at the}} situation. Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge. Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence. To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions. Soviet 14th and Soviet 95th guards rifle divisions, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> 4th Guards Tank Corps, were ordered to attack toward Kamenz, Königswartha and Sdier to stop the Germans from advancing further north. The 2nd Air Army was also assigned to this theater.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 he did {{not succeed}} in {{defending}} his French Pro title as Hans Nüsslein took it from him in three sets. The doubles final was played betweenStoefen–Tilden and Cochet-Ramillon with the former team crowned champions in the end. Cochet then repeated the Soviet tour and missed the German Pro and the Bonnardel Cup. He returned to the tour at the Wembley Pro where he only won one match before having been knocked out in the semifinal stage. Cochet then was a part of a rather fruitless Italian tour, his only notably victory came in the Foro Italico against Tilden. The next year was spent mostly with Cochet-Tilden headlined trips to India and Ireland. He also returned to the Soviet Union for the third straight time to accept a coaching venture, {{which turned out to be}} a short-term assignment <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government accused him of espionage and expelled him.|$|E
50|$|Czechoslovakia {{was free}} of the German {{occupation}} regime {{for the first time}} since late 1938. The country's prewar borders, however, would not be completely restored <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> engineered <b>the</b> cession of Carpathian Ruthenia to the U.S.S.R. in July 1945.|$|R

5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} the inclusion of a short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|In February, {{the unit}} fought in Operation Star, whose {{objective}} was {{the capture of}} the important city of Kharkov in eastern Ukraine, and participated in the capture of that city. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> advance outran its supply lines, the corps was slowly worn down and was virtually destroyed after being surrounded by a German counteroffensive in the Third Battle of Kharkov during late February and early March. Corps commander Koptsov was among those killed in the fierce fighting. The corps was rebuilt in the following months and {{became part of the}} new 3rd Guards Tank Army, fighting in Operation Kutuzov during late July, the Soviet counteroffensive after the Battle of Kursk. For its actions in the offensive, the corps was converted into the 7th Guards Tank Corps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the war for}} independence, the {{division}} of assimilados versus indigenas peoples masked the inter-ethnic conflict between the various native tribes, a division {{that emerged in the}} early 1970s. The Union of Peoples of Angola, the predecessor to the FNLA, only controlled 15% of Angola's territory during the independence war, excluding MPLA-controlled Cabinda. The People's Republic of China openly backed UNITA upon independence despite the mutual support from its adversary South Africa and UNITA's pro-Western tilt. The PRC's support for Savimbi came in 1965, a year after he left the FNLA. China saw Holden Roberto and the FNLA as the stooge of the West and the MPLA <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's proxy. With the Sino-Soviet split, South Africa presented the least odious of allies to the PRC.|$|E
50|$|These battles {{saw some}} of the most violent {{fighting}} of the whole war, during the nine campaigns launched, coordinated Soviet assaults would regularly drive out the Mujahideen from the valley but they would return <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> left.|$|R

50|$|Pakistan used American {{weaponry}} {{to fight}} the Afghan incursions but the weaponry had been sold under the pretext of fighting Communism and the USA was not pleased with this development, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> at that time became the chief benefactor to Afghanistan.
