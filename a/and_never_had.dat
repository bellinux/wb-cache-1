25|$|However, Petipa's {{original}} {{scheme and}} Bryullov's painting also contain a mythological inaccuracy {{in that they}} both erroneously portray Endymion as the lover of Diana; this is an inaccuracy that appears in several ballets, including Léo Delibes's Sylvia. In actual fact, Endymion was the lover of Luna the Roman Goddess of the Moon (Selene in Greek mythology) <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> any association with Diana at all. Diana's famous love interest was actually the Titan hunter, Orion.|$|E

25|$|Kentucky {{was a slave}} state, {{and blacks}} once {{comprised}} over one-quarter of its population. However, it lacked the cotton plantation system <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> the same high percentage of African Americans as most other slave states. With less than 8% of its current population being black, Kentucky is rarely included in modern-day definitions of the Black Belt, despite a relatively significant rural African American population in the Central and Western areas of the state.|$|E
25|$|Johnson's father, {{a wealthy}} cotton planter with lands in Kentucky and Arkansas, {{served in the}} Confederate Army in the Civil War. The war ruined the family financially, and {{they were forced to}} move to several {{locations}} in the South in search of work. By age 11, Johnson was selling newspapers on the railroads in Staunton, Virginia and providing a substantial part of the family's support. He worked all through his youth, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> more than one complete year of formal education.|$|E
25|$|Announcements of Red Cloud's {{death and}} {{recognition}} of his achievements were printed in major newspapers across the country. As had been typical of the US perception during Red Cloud's prominence in war, the article in The New York Times mistakenly described him as leader of all the Sioux bands and tribes, but noted his abilities as a leader and diplomat. While he was a prominent leader, the Lakota were highly decentralized <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> one overall leader, especially of the major divisions, such as Oglala and Brulé.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Estonia and Latvia {{where the}} Germans conscripted the local {{population}} into military formations within Waffen-SS, Lithuania boycotted German recruitment calls <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> its own Waffen-SS division. In 1944, the Nazi authorities created a 10,000-strong Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force under General Povilas Plechavičius to combat Soviet partisans led by Antanas Sniečkus and Polish partisans (Leśni). The Germans, however, quickly came to see this force as a nationalist threat to their occupation regime. The senior staff were arrested on May 15, 1944, and General Plechavičius was deported to the concentration camp in Salaspils, Latvia. However, {{approximately half of the}} remaining Defense Force formed guerrilla units and dissolved into the countryside in preparation for partisan operations against the Soviet Army as the Eastern Front approached. These men formed the basis for the Lithuanian partisans.|$|E
25|$|By December 2011, {{media reports}} {{indicated}} that Mario Cárdenas Guillén, {{the brother of}} the late Antonio Cárdenas Guillén and of the imprisoned Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, had assumed control of the Gulf Cartel. Nonetheless, Mario was not very active in his family affairs and his reluctance to get directly involved in the cartel's drug operations appears to have continued after the death of Antonio. The Mexican Navy, however, arrested him on 3 September 2012 in the city of Altamira, Tamaulipas. In addition, the current leader of the organization, Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, had been reclusive <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a permanent spot, often retreating to one of his ranches where he gives orders. Costilla Sánchez never got involved in the day-by-day operations of the cartel, but it seemed unlikely that he will be replaced, given Mario's arrest and past behavior.|$|E

25|$|Fort Collins {{was founded}} as a {{military}} outpost of the United States Army in 1864. It succeeded a previous encampment, known as Camp Collins, on the Cache La Poudre River, near what is known today as Laporte. Camp Collins was erected during the Indian wars of the mid-1860s to protect the Overland mail route that had been recently relocated through the region. Travelers crossing the county on the Overland Trail would camp there, but a flood destroyed the camp in June 1864. Afterward, {{the commander of the}} fort wrote to the commandant of Fort Laramie in southeast Wyoming, Colonel William O. Collins, suggesting that a site several miles farther down the river would make a good location for the fort. The post was manned originally by two companies of the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> walls.|$|E
25|$|C deck was {{the highest}} deck within the ship's hull. Third class cabins were in the {{starboard}} bow section, and the third class dining room was opposite of the cabins. After the third class area were more first-class cabins, terminating at a stair tower. Aft of the stairwell were second-class berths without private bath facilities, and aft of the second-class rooms was a sheltered promenade. B deck consisted mostly of public space. The first class and tourist class dining areas were both located amidships, separated by the ship's galley. The first class dining saloon was lit with fluorescent lights and equipped with apparatus to minimize sensation of the roll of the ship. The second-class dining area {{was similar to the}} first-class area, but not as lavish, and also doubled as the ship's cinema. The bow section of B Deck had more third-class accommodations and the third-class ship entrance. A deck had mostly crew's quarters, storage rooms, and had the ship's engines. There were also third class cabins in the bow. Notably, Cambodges original steam turbine engine never suffered significant breakdowns <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to be replaced.|$|E
25|$|The first amalgame {{began in}} 1793 and by 5 September five demi-brigades were created with a nominal {{strength}} of 2,437 men and {{divided into three}} battalions of 812 soldiers. Eventually, 18 more demi-brigades were formed, giving the army a total of 60,000 men. Of these, probably one-third served in garrisons and were of lower quality. Because {{it was difficult to}} procure forage, the cavalry was perpetually understrength and about two-thirds of the horses died {{during the course of the}} war. Fortunately, the terrain did not lend itself to operations by mounted troops. Military transport and the artillery also suffered from the problem of inadequate forage <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> enough horses. The artillery arm was built up from scratch into a considerable force thanks largely to the capture of 535 Spanish guns and the efforts of the army's artillery chief Augustin de Lespinasse. He also created a pontoon train and units of artisans who repaired muskets taken from the Spaniards. Another innovation of the Army of the Western Pyrenees was its organization of work companies. While the army's soldiers initially suffered due to lack of supplies, by the end of the war the troops were well equipped by their logistical base at Bayonne.|$|E

500|$|On 7 December 1902, {{both the}} United Kingdom and Germany issued ultimatums to Venezuela, {{even though there}} was still {{disagreement}} about whether to impose a Pacific Oceanic blockade (as the Germans wanted) or a war blockade (as the British wanted). Germany ultimately agreed to a war blockade, and after receiving no reply to their ultimatums, an unofficial naval blockade was imposed on 9 December with SMS Panther, SMS Falke, SMS Gazelle and SMS Vineta as major Kaiserliche Marine warships in Caribbean sea. On 11 December, Italy offered its own ultimatum, which Venezuela also rejected.
