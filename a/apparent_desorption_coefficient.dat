40|$|Gas phase {{photocatalysis}} using {{titanium dioxide}} irradiated with near ultraviolet (UV) light (360 nm) was investigated {{for the application}} of controlling trichloroethylene (TCE) vapor. Experimental parameters studied were oxygen content, TCE concentration, space time and relative humidity. Photocatalytic degradation of TCE required simultaneous presence of UV light and oxygen. Water vapor severely hindered the photocatalytic TCE degradation efficiency by effectively quenching oxygen atoms, competing with limited adsorption sites, or condensing on photocatalyst surfaces. TCE destruction efficiency increased with decreasing TCE concentration and increasing oxygen content. Viscous and volatile reaction products were observed at relatively low oxygen concentrations but were not detected at near ambient oxygen conditions. The experimental data analysis suggested that TCE oxidation is a dominant process at high oxygen concentration whereas both TCE polymerization and oxidation processes were taking place at low oxygen levels. ^ Mechanistic models based on the formation of activated oxygen atom were proposed to represent TCE decomposition kinetics. A dual site, surface reaction controlled kinetic model was employed to describe the experimental data observed at high oxygen concentrations. Product desorption controlled kinetic model was also proposed for the low oxygen concentration experiments; however, <b>apparent</b> product <b>desorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained revealed that the overall disappearance of TCE was affected by both product desorption and surface reaction mechanisms. ...|$|R

Desorption experiments were performed from suspensions with different potassium nitrate concentrations (1, 10 and 50 mM) and at varying shear rates (15 - 200 s- 1). The initial <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficient</b> beta 0, ranging from 1 x 10 (- 3) to 20 x 10 (- 3) s- 1, and the final <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficient</b> beta(infinity), ranging from 0. 01 x 10 (- 3) to 0. 65 x 10 (- 3) s- 1 were both larger than the <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> calculated neglecting a possible residence time dependence.

In order to quantify such recontamination, a one-dimensional biofilm model was developed taking into account adsorption, desorption, {{and the growth of}} cells. The model consisted of two mass balances describing increases in biofilm formation at the wall and the accumulation of cells in the liquid phase. The necessary parameters for the model were obtained in laboratory biofilm experiments. These experiments involved a flowing system and the use of Staphylococcus aureus as a model pathogen and silicon tubing as a testing material. S. aureus was inoculated into the system for 2 h, and then the system was changed to a sterile medium. Both biofilm formation and the release of cells into the flowing liquid were measured until steady-state conditions were reached (for up to 9 days). The experiments were performed in duplicate for different flow conditions (i. e., for Reynolds numbers of 3. 2, 32, and 170). It was shown that at higher Reynolds numbers, the biofilm developed faster, probably owing to an increase in the transfer of nutrients to the surface.

40|$|Contaminant {{sorption}} to soils has two components: (1) instantaneous sorption, and (2) time dependent sorption. Three coefficients {{can be used}} {{to describe}} the sorption/desorption of contaminants to soils. (1) The partition coefficient relates the contaminant concentration in the soil to the contaminant concentration in the aqueous phase. (2) The fraction of instantaneous sorption is the ratio of the time independent sorption to the total sorption. (3) The sorption rate constant quantifies the kinetics of the time dependent sorption. This study challenges the long accepted premise that the values of the sorption coefficients are equal to the values of the <b>desorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> and examines the ionic strength and temperature dependence of those coefficients. The sorption/desorption of naphthalene on Lincoln Fine Sand was examined with ionic strengths ranging from 0. 001 M to 0. 5 M. The partition coefficients varied as predicted with ionic strength but were about half to a third the predicted magnitude. An apparent minimum partition coefficient was observed at 0. 06 M. The fraction of equilibrium sorption was a maximum in the range of 0. 01 M to 0. 1 M. The sorption rate constants, α, decreased with increasing ionic strength. The α for the sorption data was 0. 5 hr- 1 at 0. 001 M decreasing to 0. 05 hr- 1 at 0. 5 M. α for desorption only decreased from 0. 13 hr- 1 to 0. 09 hr- 1 over the same ionic strength range.

The initial deposition rates increased linearly with particle concentrations in suspensions as expected from theoretical mass transport calculations. Deposition efficiencies of 0. 78 and 0. 62 were obtained for wall shear rates, G, of 15 and 50 s(- 1), respectively. Blocked areas, A(1) expressed {{as the number of}} particle cross sections, gamma, decreased from initially high to low values (A(1,G= 15) = 10 and A(1,G= 50) = 18, at infinite particle concentration) {{as a function of the}} particle concentration. This decrease in blocked area with particle concentration was explained as a consequence of the increased backscattering of flowing particles colliding with adhering particles. Backscattering due to collisions between flowing particles is obviously more frequent at higher Concentrations. Blocked areas, calculated using pair distribution functions, corresponded well with those obtained from deposition kinetics. Initial <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficients,</b> beta(0) ranging from 0. 3 x 10 (- 3) to 2. 0 x 10 (- 3) s(- 1), increased linearly with particle concentration in suspension due to an increase in the number of collisions between adhering and flowing particles per unit time.

The experimental results from the batch tests were fitted to a Langmuir hyperbolic isotherm model. Diffusion coefficients were determined by fitting the experimental results from a radial diffusion 1 -dimensional experiment to a Finite Difference Model. Diffusion coefficients for F 2 and F 3 Fraction PHCs were developed for 7 tailings materials (MFT, LG MFT, PT MFT, Tailings Sand, 2 : 1 CT, 4 : 1 CT and 6 : 1 CT). The diffusion coefficients (D*) and the Langmuir desorption constants (and) developed from these experiments are included in Table A. 1.

The results of the radial diffusion experiments agree with diffusion rates found by other researchers in similar porous media. More research may be needed to verify both of these preliminary results for the desorptive and diffusive transport of F 2 and F 3 PHC fractions in tailings.

Three im-portant migration pathways were distinguished: microcracks, grain boundaries, and cleavage planes. We also discuss the influence of sample processing on the observed permeability, {{and the effect of}} the crystallization of secondary phases on the disproportion between the sorption – <b>desorption</b> <b>coefficients...</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2001 for {{the first}} time a vacuum {{pressure}} increase during a high intensity U 28 + run in SIS- 18 was observed [1]. It was noticed that the lifetime of the ions was no longer independent of the injected ion current. During injection, ions are lost at the chamber wall or other aperture limiting devices and desorb gas molecules there. This leads to a pressure increase and therefore to a higher charge exchange rate and again to ion losses, which cause desorption. Similar observations where reported in Ref. [2]. Here the <b>desorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> is about 10 4 molecules/ion. Out of the data measured at SIS- 18 it was possible to calculate the ion induced desorption yield to 11000 - 27000 [3]. To confirm this observation a dedicated experiment was done. Therefore the U 28 + ion beam was steered onto the chamber wall and a pressure increase of 3. 5 10 - 11 mbar was observed. This increase correspond...|$|R
40|$|Transition state theory (TST) {{has long}} been applied to gas-surface {{reactions}} {{for the purpose of}} characterizing and predicting <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficients,</b> but current perceptions of its use exclude TST from meaningful description of the sticking coefficient for partially covered surfaces. This paper re-examines the application of TST to partially covered surfaces, and in particular to Langmuir systems with barrierless adsorption. An analogy is drawn in the present work between barrierless adsorption processes and gas-phase radical-radical recombination reactions that reveals a simple method by which TST can describe kinetics in Langmuir systems. Construction of a model "hard-wall" Hamiltonian that reflects the exclusion of adsorbates from occupied sites enables the kinetics in Langmuir systems to be described by constructing a transition state surface that does not permit adsorption at occupied sites. This method gives analytic expressions for the TST sticking <b>coefficient</b> (and <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficient)</b> in two important limiting cases for the gas-surface dynamics, and resolves previous difficulties in the TST description of Langmuir systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the adsorption coefficient (Koc) of chlorpyrifos in clay soil by measuring the Freundlich adsorption <b>coefficient</b> (Kads(f)) and <b>desorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> (1 /n value) of chlorpyrifos. It was found that the Freundlich adsorption coefficient (Kads(f)) and the linear regression (r 2) of the Freundlich adsorption isotherm for chlorpyrifos in the clay soil were 52. 6 L/kg and 0. 5344, respectively. Adsoprtion equilibrium time was achieved within 24 hours for clay soil. This adsoprtion equilibrium time was used to determine the effect of concentration on adsorption. The adsorption coefficient (Koc) of clay soil was found to be 2783 L/kg with an initial concentration solution of 1 µg/g, soil-solution ratio (1 : 5) at 30 oC when the equilibrium between the soil matrix and solution was 24 hours. The Kdes decreased over four repetitions of the desorption process. The chlorpyrifos residues may be strongly adsorbed onto the surface of clay. ABSTRA...|$|R
