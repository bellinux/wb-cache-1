5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} police {{stations}} in the town since 1857, when the first Police Station was rented. It had three cells and a petty session courtroom. A new police station was built in 1974, which underwent a major refurbishment in 2011, to become <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> hub for Mid Devon, with 72 staff members. The town acquired its first steam driven fire engine in 1914 which cost £100 and was paid for by voluntary subscription.|$|E

5|$|Concerns over {{possible}} violent outbreaks {{continued for}} many years. Chartism became {{prominent in the}} region in the late 1830s, again causing Bute considerable worries in 1839 and leading to him encouraging the mobilisation of military forces to deal with the threat. Bute began to advocate the creation of <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> to suppress the problems in the northern valleys, for once allying himself with the local ironmasters to overcome rural opposition to the scheme. In 1841 the scheme was passed by the Glamorgan magistrates, with a chief constable and headquarters established that year.|$|E
5|$|Preparations {{to set up}} the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde – ZNG) {{began on}} 12 April 1991. Establishment of the ZNG as <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> with {{military}} capabilities was thought necessary by the Croatian authorities following armed clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes in March and due to the possibility of further confrontation with the JNA. The ZNG, formally established on 23 April, was tasked with protection of the constitutional order, maintenance of public order, anti-terrorist operations, protection of Croatia's borders, territory, coast and territorial waters, as well as the protection of high-value structures and high-profile persons.|$|E
5|$|The new {{corporation}} {{was required}} to appoint a Watch Committee and <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> under {{the provisions of the}} County and Borough Police Act 1856. In 1947, the City of Peterborough Constabulary amalgamated with the Liberty of Peterborough Constabulary, which had shared its chief constable with Northamptonshire until 1931 and Peterborough thereafter, to form the Peterborough Combined Police force. This, in turn, merged into Mid-Anglia Constabulary in 1965 and was renamed Cambridgeshire Constabulary in 1974. The Fire Brigades Act 1938 made it a requirement for the corporation to maintain a fire brigade; under the Fire Services Act 1947 this function passed to the councils of counties.|$|E

The South Western Ambulance Service covers the entire South West of England, including all of Somerset; prior to February 2013 the unitary districts of Somerset came under the Great Western Ambulance Service, which merged into South Western. The Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance is a charitable organisation based in the county.|$|E
5|$|Information {{is largely}} absent {{regarding}} any major administrative changes Salih {{made to the}} Emirate of Aleppo. His only known institutional innovation was the post of shaykh al-dawla (chieftain of the state) or raʾīs al-balad (municipal chief), who served as Salih's trusted confidant and permanent representative {{with the people of}} Aleppo. The post emulated that of the shaykh, who played a secondary role to an amīr in a princely Kilabi clan. The shaykh al-dawla played an important political role in the city and came from a prominent leading family. Salih assigned Ibn Mustafad to the post and utilized the aḥdāth, which consisted of young armed men from the city's lower and middle classes, as <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force.</b> Although they cooperated with Salih, the aḥdāth were still an independent force. Sometime during his reign, Salih also acquired a number of Turkish ghilmān, though details about them are lacking in the sources.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} {{that gave the}} city a battalion of artillery, a regiment of infantry {{and at least one}} full troop of cavalry for the purpose of providing the preservation of peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led to the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass an 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> of one man per 150 taxable inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability to maintain order effectively in Philadelphia's suburbs would be an important argument for the consolidation of the city in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for the ZNG {{began on}} 12 April 1991. Its {{formation}} as <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> with military capability was considered necessary by Croatian authorities after March clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes {{and the possibility}} of further confrontation with the JNA. Since it was illegal to establish a separate military in a constituent republic of Yugoslavia, the ZNG was planned as part of the police force under the Ministry of the Interior. Parliament amended the Internal Affairs Act on 18 April, and the ZNG was formally established five days later. It was tasked with the protection of the constitutional order, the maintenance of public order, anti-terrorist operations, the protection of Croatia's borders, territory, coast and territorial waters, valuable structures and high-profile individuals. Although the ZNG was formally subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior, its founding legislation stipulated that it would be commanded by the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|The Judge Dredd {{comic strip}} is mostly set in Mega-City One in the 22nd century, {{on the east}} coast of the former United States. When President Robert L. Booth started the Third World War in 2070 (see Atomic Wars), the Judges – until then no more than <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> with {{extraordinary}} powers – deposed Booth, overthrew the Constitution and seized control of all institutions of government. Disillusioned with the elected politicians who had caused so much destruction to their country, much of the American public supported this move at the time. For the next four decades America was a dictatorship. (Mega-City One and the other American mega-cities became sovereign city-states early during this period, and the US ceased to exist.) Although the Judges were initially popular, the citizens soon grew to resent their new leaders as much as they had the old, until activists began calling for a return to democratic government.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{fighting}} at Tobruk, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} front and placed in reserve. When Japan entered the war, the division was transferred to India. It was considered the most experienced and best trained British formation available in Asia. In India, the division formed a reserve to counter possible Japanese landings while it trained in jungle warfare. It also served as <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force,</b> protecting railways and being used to suppress civil disobedience caused by the Quit India Movement. While it was requested that the division {{be sent to the}} front line in Burma, it was instead transferred to Special Force, commonly known as the Chindits. Such a move was opposed by the highest military commanders in India and Burma, and proved controversial with the troops themselves. Despite their pleas, the division was broken up and officially ceased to exist on 24November 1943. Historian Woodburn Kirby and Lieutenant-General William Slim (who led the British troops in Burma) believed that the division could have had a greater impact against the Japanese had it been retained as a single formation.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula of Matabeleland on 30 October 1888, Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889. Under this charter, the Company was {{empowered}} {{to trade with}} indigenous rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise and run <b>a</b> <b>police</b> <b>force.</b> In return for these rights, the British South Africa Company would administer and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders. Though the Company made good on most of these pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored. Lobengula reacted by making war on the new arrivals, their Tswana allies and the local Mashona people in 1893. The resulting conflict ended with Lobengula's torching of his own capital at Bulawayo, his death from smallpox in early 1894, and the subsequent submission of his izinDuna (advisors) to the Company. Violent rebellion to the north-east, in neighbouring Mashonaland, was forcibly put down by the Company during 1897.|$|E
