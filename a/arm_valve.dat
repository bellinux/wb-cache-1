50|$|The M30 was {{originally}} {{developed in the}} late 1960s, loosely based on the straight-four BMW M10 engine first used in the 'Neue Klasse' BMW 1500. Several features, including a profile lowering 30-degree slant to the right, a crossflow head (a gas flow head in later designs) and a chain-driven single overhead cam with rocker <b>arm</b> <b>valve</b> actuation are common between the M10 and the M30. Further similarities include a cast-iron block with an aluminium head and a forged crankshaft. The first two engines introduced were the 2.8 and the 2.5 litre option, both short-stroke engines sharing a common bore.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Schlenk flask is a round bottom, pear-shaped, or tubular flask with {{a ground}} glass joint and a side arm. The side arm contains a valve, usually a greased stopcock, {{used to control}} the flask's exposure to a manifold or the atmosphere. This allows a material {{to be added to}} a flask through the ground glass joint, which is then capped with a septum. This operation can, for example, be done in a glove box. The flask can then be removed from the glove box and taken to a Schlenk line. Once connected to the Schlenk line, the inert gas and/or vacuum {{can be applied to the}} flask as required. While the flask is connected to the line under a positive pressure of inert gas, the septum can be replaced with other apparatus, for example a reflux condenser. Once the manipulations are complete, the contents can be vacuum dried and placed under a static vacuum by closing the side <b>arm</b> <b>valve.</b> These evacuated flasks can be taken back into a glove box for further manipulation or storage of the flasks' contents.|$|E

5000|$|The 2L-T II is {{an upgrade}} of the 2L-T. Of the same {{dimensions}} as all other 2L engines, {{the most significant}} change is that the camshaft lifts the valve directly via tappet instead of a rocker <b>arm.</b> The <b>valve</b> clearance is adjusted using shims. Compression rate is also 20:1. Output is [...] at 4000 rpm, 22.0 kgm Nm at 2400 rpm ...|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to the VF750 almost every component had weight shaved off it, each con-rod lost 90g, rocker <b>arms</b> 6g, intake <b>valve</b> 0.5g, exhaust valves 1.5g, pistons 20g, piston rings 1.3g per set, valve springs 17g each.|$|R
5000|$|The 2L-II is {{an upgrade}} of the 2L. Bore and stroke remains the same. The most {{significant}} change {{is that the}} camshaft lifts the valve directly via tappet instead of a rocker <b>arm.</b> The <b>valve</b> clearance is adjusted using shims. Later L engines (3L and 5L) also use this method of valve operation. Maximum output is [...] gross at 4,200 rpm and maximum torque is 149 NÂ·m net or 167 Nm gross at 2,400 rpm.|$|R
50|$|The sidevalve's poppet valves {{are usually}} sited {{on one side}} of the {{cylinder}}(s). A recess in the cylinder head creates a corridor connecting the valves and the combustion chamber. The valve gear comprises a camshaft which operates the valves via simple tappets, most commonly without any further valvetrain components (such as pushrods, rocker <b>arms,</b> overhead <b>valves</b> or overhead camshafts). Indian, however, employs both rocker arms and pushrods to transmit motion from the cam lobes to the valve stems.|$|R
30|$|Comparing {{with the}} {{two-level}} converters, the disadvantages of the MMCs are: (1) {{as there are}} {{a large number of}} sub-modules in series connection in each bridge <b>arm,</b> the <b>valve</b> control system needs to process a large amount of data in each period, therefore high requirements are needed for the control system; (2) distributed energy storage capacitor increases the balance control for the sub-module capacitor voltages [15]; (3) the energy is not evenly distributed in each bridge arm, which destroys the internal stability within the sub-modules and causes the distortion of the current waveform.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The elastic {{effects of}} the valve train {{components}} are analyzed by using the finite element models of the rocker <b>arm</b> and <b>valve.</b> The whole equations of motion of the valvetrain of an internal combustion engine formulated by finite element techniques are solved by imposing the contact conditions with the augmented Lagrange multiplier method.

5000|$|September 1978 brought another engine upgrade: The new [...] "Vulcan II" [...] G23B {{featured}} the lean burn MCA-Jet {{emissions control system}} with a hemispherical head, aluminium rocker <b>arms</b> and three <b>valves</b> per cylinder, but power outputs remained static. The model code became A106, with A106V used for the van which continued to use the bodywork of the second generation.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were directly}} below the smokebox and moderately inclined, with all four cylinders {{driving on the}} third axle. The crosshead was, unusually, a single bar type. Walschaerts valve gear was used. The piston rods are particularly long, allowing space for a rocker <b>arm</b> on the <b>valve</b> rods, between the valve chest and the combination lever, to drive the inner valves.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{cam shaft}} and its {{associated}} parts control the opening and closing of the two valves. The associated parts are push rods, rocker <b>arms,</b> <b>valve</b> springs and tappets. It consists of a cylindrical rod running over {{the length of the}} cylinder bank with a number of oblong lobes protruding from it, one for each valve. The cam lobes force the valves open by pressing on the valve, or on some intermediate mechanism as they rotate. This shaft also provides the drive to the ignition system. The camshaft is driven by the crankshaft through timing gears cams are made as integral parts of the camshaft and are designed in such a way to open and close the valves at the correct timing and to keep them open for the necessary duration. A common example is the camshaft of an automobile, which takes the rotary motion of the engine and translates it in to the reciprocating motion necessary to operate the intake and exhaust valves of the cylinders. In this work, a camshaft is designed for multi cylinder engine and 3 D-model of the camshaft is created using modeling software pro/Engineer. The model created in pro/E is imported in to ANSYS. After completing the element properties, meshing and constraints the loads are applied on camshaft for three different materials namely aluminum alloy 360, forged steel and cast iron. For that condition the results have been taken has displacement values and von misses stresses for the static state of the camshaft. After taking the results of static analysis, the model analysis and harmonic analysis are done one by one. Finally, comparing the three different materials the best suitable material is selected for the construction of camshaft...|$|R
40|$|Camshaft can {{be defined}} as a machine element having the curve {{outlined}} or a curved grooved, gives the predetermined specified motion to another element called the follower. In automotive field, Camshaft and its follower take importance roles to run the engine. Nowadays the car maker have developed the vary schemes of cam profile to match with the engine performance. Since the system deals with high load and high speed and many analyses have been carried out on the failure of the components. The analysis is done either by experimental or finite element analysis. The result from the finite element analysis is an approximate of the component failure. In the mean time, the software development is improving in this few decades. Problems with the components such as cam and rocker arm are wears while the valve bends. This project aim determines the stress concentration on the cam and followers during normal operation. More over, this project used the cam, rocker <b>arms,</b> <b>valve</b> lifter, exhaust valve and accessories used in 4 G 13 engine in type. Solidworks, Cosmosmotion and Algor software are used for determination of stress concentration on the components. The finite element analysis are done for determination of stress concentration during 30 degree of cam where the roller fully climbing the cam and during maximum exhaust valve lift. Cam is rotated at 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm and 6000 rpm of crank rotation. In the analysis, the typical values for coefficient of friction, materials, and spring rate are used. The result from finite element analysis showed that the maximum stress concentration occurred at rocker arm that leads to the failure of the component. Value for maximum stress is over the allowable stress for rocker arm material. Other components are approximately safe where the maximum stress is not over the allowable stress for components...|$|R
50|$|But {{there was}} another {{extraordinary}} engine from Ilmor in 1994 - the Mercedes-Benz 500I (although work on this started long before the Mercedes takeover as a private project between Ilmor and Penske). The 500I exploited a loophole in the engine rules at the Indianapolis 500 (which was run under slightly different rules to other CART races). Originally stock-block engines based on production units, fitted with two pushrod and rocker <b>arm</b> actuated <b>valves</b> per cylinder, were permitted to run at increased cubic capacity (3.43 litres vs 2.65 litres) and significantly greater turbo boost than the pure racing engines. For several years Buick V6 units had been extremely fast but fragile; the restrictions were relaxed {{with the intent of}} permitting Buick-like engines to use stronger but still production-like blocks - the Menard engine based on the Buick took this approach, as did the unsuccessful Greenfield V8.|$|R
5000|$|Honda's {{advanced}} VTEC technology departs {{greatly from}} its previous incarnations by no longer relying on switching between {{two sets of}} lobes on a given camshaft. It instead uses a single cam lobe per valve, and two rocker <b>arms</b> per <b>valve</b> whereby the second rocker arm has a movable pivot point, there by provide the varying cam lift. Advanced VTEC motors still use the now standard oil pressure controlled variable cam gear angle mechanism. With these two technologies combined Honda has developed an infinitely variable valve timing and lift system ("VVTL"). Previous versions of VTEC included only staged VVTL i.e. High-Low. With the introduction of i-VTEC the systems gained infinitely variable valve timing but still only staged lift i.e. High-Low. The [...] "infinitely variable" [...] portion of the A-VTEC {{is what makes it}} stand out as a serious evolutionary step in the world of VTEC.|$|R
50|$|The wasserboxer, as {{with all}} Volkswagen boxer engines, {{directly}} drives the three-bearing camshaft via a small steel gear on the crankshaft, and a large aluminium one on the camshaft, {{so there is no}} timing belt or timing chain. The entire mechanism is internal to the engine, so there should be no concerns regarding wear or replacements, as long as the engine oil is changed regularly. The overhead poppet valves each feature two concentric valve springs, and are operated by pushrods, with adjustable rocker <b>arms</b> to facilitate <b>valve</b> clearance adjustment.|$|R
50|$|Following the yellow, {{the race}} swelled {{into a huge}} 18-car battle. Neil Bonnett, driving an Oldsmobile, raced into the lead and was {{challenged}} by A. J. Foyt and Darrell Waltrip; he fought them off but was soon challenged by Bobby Allison, trying to unlap himself, and rookie Dale Earnhardt and dark-horse driver Tighe Scott, driving a Buick Century prepared by Harry Hyde. A six-car crash eliminated David Pearson and others. Then Donnie Allison raced to unlap himself, and did so when Bonnett blew a tire and spun in traffic. Other contenders were eliminated, as Bobby Allison fell multiple laps behind, Harry Gant crashed, Dale Earnhardt over-revved his engine leaving the pits and broke a rocker <b>arm</b> and <b>valve</b> spring, Benny Parsons' car overheated and Scott slid through his pits unable to stop when he hit a puddle of water from Parsons' overheating engine. Past the halfway point Donnie assumed the lead, but Cale Yarborough used more caution flags to make up his laps.|$|R
50|$|The 12-valve (2 valves per cylinder) DOHC 5M-GE is {{familiar}} as {{the engine of}} the Toyota Supra and Toyota Cressida of the 1980s. It was quite different from any previous member of the M family, with Bosch L Jetronic-derived electronic fuel injection (using an AFM intake measuring scheme), wide-angle valves, and belt-driven dual camshafts. It used hydraulic valve lifters, a first for Toyota. The use of rocker <b>arms</b> and <b>valve</b> lash adjusters eliminated the need for valve clearance maintenance, a world first for any twin cam engine. This version of the M made its US debut in 1982's Toyota Celica Supra MK2. The 1982 version had a vacuum-advance distributor, whereas the 1983-1988 versions found in the Celica Supra and Cressida had full electronic control of the ignition system and distributor. The newer engine control system found in these later cars was named TCCS, or Toyota Computer Control System and, together with different intake runners, increased max power by 5 PS from August 1983.|$|R
30|$|The valve {{level control}} {{is the main}} {{difference}} of control system between MMC, HVDC Flexible, conventional HVDC and two-level HVDC Flexible. The valve base controller (VBC) in the HVDC Flexible is the middle connector to realize the station level control system and low-level sub-module control. It is used to realize the control, protection and monitoring of the <b>valve</b> <b>arms</b> and the communication between the station control system and converter valve. Meanwhile it {{is also used to}} realize the balance function of the sub-module capacitor voltage and circulation control function, which is the key to ensure the normal operation of the MMC HVDC Flexible system. Because the <b>valve</b> <b>arm</b> in the system with high voltage and large capacity is generally made up of hundreds of sub-modules, in order to ensure the voltage balance between each sub-module, VBC has a high requirement on the data disposal speed of the sub-modules, usually less than 100 Â Î¼s. It is a huge challenge for the valve control design to achieve this high speed control balance technique of large-scale sub-modules. The unique circulation phenomenon of modular multi-level technique will cause the increase of the converter valve current stress and the loss level. If serious enough, it may make the system lose the balance and be unable to operate normally. For this reason, the design of circulating current control strategy is also a key factor in valve control.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{beginning}} with the J37A4 3.7L SOHC V6 engine introduced on all 2009 Acura TL SH-AWD models, SOHC VTEC was incorporated for use with intake and exhaust valves. The intake and exhaust rocker shafts contain primary and secondary intake and exhaust rocker arms, respectively. The primary rocker arm contains the VTEC switching piston, while the secondary rocker arm contains the return spring. The term [...] "primary" [...] does not refer to which rocker <b>arm</b> forces the <b>valve</b> down during low-RPM engine operation. Rather, {{it refers to the}} rocker arm which contains the VTEC switching piston and receives oil from the rocker shaft.|$|R
50|$|Also {{located within}} the railway yard is the Westinghouse Brake Examination Pit and shelter. It {{comprises}} a modest corrugated iron building with a barrel vaulted corrugated iron roof covering a long rectangular brick-lined pit. The building contains boards detailing brake examination schedules, and a workbench.Other yard structures include Signal Cabin A, a water crane and a wagon weighbridge. Signal Cabin A is a two-storeyed chamferboard-clad building with pitched corrugated iron roofs, a cantilevered timber catwalk overlooking the railway at first floor level. The building contains intact but disconnected mechanical signalling equipment. The first floor contains a large frame of colour-coded mechanical steel signalling levers, timber and brass track indicators, and a yard diagram. The Water Crane comprises a cast iron hollow tube surmounted by a rotating cast iron feeder <b>arm</b> with <b>valve</b> controls and a canvas tube attached, mounted on a concrete pedestal and adjacent to a concrete drain. The Wagon Weighbridge comprises a large steel scale housed in chamferboard-clad building with a pitched corrugated iron roof, and a large metal balance plate.|$|R
2500|$|The game is {{presented}} almost entirely from a first person perspective, aside from vehicular combat.

50|$|When {{both the}} trip <b>arm</b> and trip <b>valve</b> were new, {{this did not}} matter; the train did not fill its entire {{clearance}} envelope, and the trip arm would contact the trip valve normally. However, with normal wear of the wheels and rails, and with the train rounding a curve at speed (and therefore riding off-centre) it was another matter. The first wheel {{on the right-hand side}} of the train hit a bolt in the mechanism attached to the trip arm and knocked the arm down. It would then rise again, but too late: with the train moving quickly, the trip valve, just a few feet behind the wheel, would already have gone past, thus making the train stop useless for ensuring signal compliance.|$|R

5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of incorporating VTEC {{for both the}} intake and exhaust valves in a SOHC engine has been removed on the J37A4 by a novel design of the intake rocker <b>arm.</b> Each exhaust <b>valve</b> on the J37A4 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust rocker arm. Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust rocker arms and twelve secondary exhaust rocker arms. However, each secondary intake rocker arm is shaped similar to a [...] "Y" [...] which allows it to contact two intake valves at once. One primary intake rocker arm corresponds to each secondary intake rocker arm. As {{a result of this}} design, there are only six primary intake rocker arms and six secondary intake rocker arms.|$|R
50|$|Four stroke model engines, {{since they}} are {{generally}} designed to be simple powerplants while still incorporating the usual camshaft, rocker <b>arms</b> and poppet <b>valves</b> of larger sized four stroke engines, are generally meant to use glow ignition and their fuel. Often, the oil percentage for four stroke glow fuel can be lowered from the 18-20% figure used for some two-stroke engines, down to as low as a 12-15% percentage per unit of blended glow fuel, but use of such low-percentage lubricant fuel can also mandate {{the need for a}} small percentage of castor oil in the mix to avoid having too little oil in the mix, and also mandates setting the high-speed fuel mixture carefully by using a handheld digital tachometer to check engine speed to avoid over-leaning of the fuel mixture.|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of cylinder deactivation used today, {{depending on the}} type of engine. The first is for the pushrod design which uses solenoids to alter the oil pressure delivered to the lifters. In their collapsed state, the lifters are unable to elevate their companion pushrods under the <b>valve</b> rocker <b>arms,</b> resulting in <b>valves</b> that cannot be actuated and remain closed. The second is used for overhead cam engines, and uses a pair of locked-together rocker arms that are employed for each valve. One rocker follows the cam profile, while the other actuates the valve. When a cylinder is deactivated, solenoid-controlled oil pressure releases a locking pin between the two rocker arms. While one arm still follows the camshaft, the unlocked arm remains motionless and unable to activate the valve.|$|R
5000|$|The {{terminal}} at Volga Hydroelectric Station, Volzhskaya converter station, {{is situated}} on the dam of the power plant at [...] Each of the poles consist of four series connected three-phase valve bridges, which form two series connected twelve pulse bridges. Originally all valves of the scheme were mercury arc valves designed for a voltage of 100 kV and a maximum current of 938 Amperes. Unusually for valves of such high current rating, each valve used only a single anode but because the peak reverse voltage rating was quite limited, two valves were connected in series in each converter <b>arm.</b> [...] The <b>valves</b> used oil-cooled cathode tanks and natural air-cooled anode insulators, with internal grading electrodes inside the porcelain. Each valve stood 3.5 m tall and weighed about 2 tonnes.|$|R
60|$|The neck is {{likewise}} lined throughout its whole length with transverse rows of long, thin, transparent hairs, having broad bulbous (fig. 30) bases, with similarly constructed sharp points. They arise from little projecting ridges, formed of rectangular epidermic cells. The hairs vary {{a little in}} length, but their points generally extend down to the row next below; so that if the neck is split open and laid flat, the inner surface resembles a paper of pins,--the hairs representing the pins, and the little transverse ridges representing the folds of paper through which the pins are thrust. These rows of hairs are indicated in the previous figure (29) by numerous transverse lines crossing the neck. The inside of the neck is [page 449] also studded with papillae; those in the lower part are spherical and formed of four cells, as in {{the lower part of}} the utricle; those in the upper part are formed of two cells, which are much elongated downwards beneath their points of attachment. These two-celled papillae apparently correspond with the bifid process in the upper part of the bladders of Utricularia. The narrow transverse orifice (o, fig. 29) is situated between the bases of the two spiral <b>arms.</b> No <b>valve</b> could be detected here, nor was any such structure seen by Dr. Warming. The lips of the orifice are armed with many short, thick, sharply pointed, somewhat incurved hairs or teeth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker <b>arms</b> per <b>valve,</b> so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives did {{not show}} the pressure of steam in the boiler, but {{it was possible to}} estimate this by the position of the safety <b>valve</b> <b>arm</b> which often extended onto the firebox back plate; gradations marked on the spring column gave a rough indication of the actual pressure. The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot vertical tube of mercury with a sight-glass at the top, mounted alongside the chimney, for his Rocket. The Bourdon tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.|$|R
