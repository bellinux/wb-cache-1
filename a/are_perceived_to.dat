25|$|In Uganda “touching {{a person}} with {{homosexual}} intent” results in a life sentence in prison, and actions that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> promote homosexuality carry a seven-year sentence – these actions include advocating for gay human rights, belonging to a gay organization, and advocating for safe homosexual sex.|$|E
25|$|A {{related and}} more general {{phenomenon}} {{is that of}} subjective validation. Subjective validation occurs when two unrelated or even random events <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be related because a belief, expectation, or hypothesis demands a relationship. For example, while reading a horoscope, people actively seek a correspondence between its contents and their perception of their personality.|$|E

Both countries are relatively underdeveloped and require improvements in these areas {{in order to be}} technologically competitive with developed economies.|$|R
25|$|After harvesting, {{the seeds}} are usually cleaned and hulled. In some countries, once the seeds have been hulled, they are passed through an {{electronic}} colour-sorting machine that rejects any discolored seeds to ensure perfect colour. This is done because sesame seeds with consistent appearance <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be of better quality by consumers, and sell {{for a higher}} price.|$|E
25|$|Social {{comparison}} {{means that}} individuals {{are more comfortable}} interacting with others who share common characteristics with themselves, such as a psychiatric illness, {{in order to establish}} a sense of normalcy. By interacting with others who <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be better than them, peers are given a sense of optimism and something to strive toward.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian cells require {{stimulation}} for {{cell division}} and survival; {{in the absence}} of growth factor, apoptosis ensues. Such requirements for extracellular stimulation are necessary for controlling cell behavior in unicellular and multicellular organisms; signal transduction pathways <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be so central to biological processes {{that a large number of}} diseases are attributed to their disregulation.|$|E

Females who are physically attractive have a higher mate value than those who are less physically attractive.|$|R

25|$|Inflation {{levels and}} trends: Typically a {{currency}} will lose value {{if there is}} a high level of inflation in the country or if inflation levels <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be rising. This is because inflation erodes purchasing power, thus demand, for that particular currency. However, a currency may sometimes strengthen when inflation rises because of expectations that the central bank will raise short-term interest rates to combat rising inflation.|$|E
25|$|Practitioners of {{traditional}} herbal-based medicine and divination called albularyo {{are not considered}} witches. They <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. Feng shui, an influence of Filipino Chinese culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.|$|E
25|$|Cricket imposes {{penalties}} on captains {{if their}} players bowl their overs {{at a very}} slow rate, such as fines, loss of competition points, and match bans. If a team is proceeding slowly, some captains will choose to use slow/spin bowlers. Such bowlers have a shorter run up so they complete their overs more quickly. Often this means choosing an inferior strategy by employing a less skillful bowler to avoid penalties that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be greater, such as being banned or losing points.|$|E

25|$|West Ham {{fans have}} also {{displayed}} a zeal for abusing former players who <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> have abandoned the club, or performed some disservice. Famously Dimitri Payet {{as well as}} Paul Ince, Frank Lampard, Jermain Defoe, Craig Bellamy and Nigel Reo-Coker have borne the brunt of verbal abuse and a hostile reception at Upton Park. However, players such as Joe Cole, Michael Carrick, Rio Ferdinand, Bobby Zamora and Carlos Tévez receive applause and even standing ovations in honour of their contributions for the club.|$|E
25|$|Since {{resolution}} {{in space and}} time is lost in each node as described above, beliefs formed by higher-level nodes represent an even larger range of space and time. This is meant to reflect the organization of the physical world as it is perceived by human brain. Larger concepts (e.g. causes, actions and objects) <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> change more slowly and consist of smaller concepts that change more quickly. Jeff Hawkins postulates that brains evolved this type of hierarchy to match, predict, and affect the organization of the external world.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia is a {{condition}} affecting human visual perception in which objects <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be smaller than they actually are. Micropsia {{can be caused by}} optical factors (such as wearing glasses), by distortion of images in the eye (such as optically, via swelling of the cornea or from changes {{in the shape of the}} retina such as from retinal edema, macular degeneration, or central serous retinopathy), by changes in the brain (such as from traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, migraines, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs), and from psychological factors. Dissociative phenomena are linked with micropsia, which may be the result of brain-lateralization disturbance.|$|E
40|$|Social {{rejection}} {{can lead}} to a variety of emotions. Two studies show that specific emotional reactions to social rejection can be understood by relying on the fundamental distinction between competence and warmth. Rejection that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due to incompetence leads to anger, whereas rejection that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due to lack of warmth leads to sadness. Study 1 measures perceptions of competence and warmth judgments. Study 2 manipulates those perceptions. In both studies, rejection that <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of incompetence led primarily to anger, while rejection that <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of lack of warmth led primarily to sadness. These results show that the effects of rejection can be better understood if we take into account how rejection <b>is</b> <b>perceived.</b> Highlights ► Adaptive emotional reactions to social rejection ► Compare effects of rejection due to lack of competence and due to lack of warmth ► Rejection due to lack of competence primarily leads to anger ► Rejection due to lack of warmth primarily leads to sadness Keywords: Social rejection, Competence warmth, Social perception, Emotio...|$|R

25|$|Psychologists such as John B. Watson, Robert Plutchik, and Paul Ekman have {{suggested}} {{that there is only}} a small set of basic or innate emotions and that fear is one of them. This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction, anger, angst, anxiety, fright, horror, joy, panic, and sadness. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of threats that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be uncontrollable or unavoidable. The fear response serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution.|$|E
25|$|The term heterophobia is {{confusing}} {{for some people}} for several reasons. On the one hand, some {{look at it as}} just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> clash.|$|E
25|$|IFS (B) {{officers}} {{themselves have}} an acrimonious rivalry with the secretarial personnel or stenographers who <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be lower in prestige than the IFS (B) officers {{but have a}} closer working relationship with IFS (A) officers, giving the stenographers at times promotion opportunities ahead of IFS (B) officers. This rivalry {{was brought to the}} fore when a stenographer was appointed as Indian ambassador to North Korea in 2012. Within a week of the appointment IFS (B) officers vociferously protested. Three different associations representing IFS (B) officers came together to write a single complaint to the Prime Minister’s Office and the external affairs minister expressing their “utter disappointment” and requesting a review of the appointment.|$|E

30|$|This {{study had}} been able, {{for the first}} time in this country, to collect {{perception}} on the public FMSs in many significant domains of clinical practices from PHCPs of almost all categories, at the three main health care facilities, in a nationwide cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. We found that there was an overall positive perception on FMS professionalism, clinical competency and ethical practice. FMS <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> provide effective and safe treatment to their patients; equal care was provided disregard of patient’s social background, and FMSs <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> safeguard patient’s confidentiality. While some of these clinical attributes <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> outstanding in the FMSs, the results also showed areas of concerns such as in doing home visit, patient referral, walk-in consultation and appointment interval.|$|R
40|$|This interpretive study, {{framed in}} {{relational}} dialectics theory, sought to identify stepchildren’s {{perceptions of the}} contradictions that animate communication with the stepparent in their household of primary residence. In-depth interviews were conducted, producing 802 pages of double-spaced interview transcripts, which were analyzed inductively for commonly experienced contradictions of stepchild-stepparent communication. Three underlying contradictions were identified. First, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> characterized by a dialectic of integration, characterized by both closeness and distance. Second, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> characterized by a dialectic of parental status, in which the stepparent was, and was not, granted legitimacy in a parent role. Third, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> animated by a dialectic of expression in which both candor and discretion were featured...|$|R
25|$|Homebuilt {{aircraft}} are generally small, one to four-seat sportsplanes which employ simple methods of construction. Fabric-covered wood or metal frames and plywood {{are common in}} the aircraft structure, but increasingly, fiberglass and other composites as well as full aluminum construction techniques are being used, techniques first pioneered by Hugo Junkers {{as far back as}} the late World War I era. Engines are most often the same as, or similar to, the engines used in certified aircraft (such as Lycoming, Continental, Rotax, and Jabiru). A minority of homebuilts use converted automobile engines, with Volkswagen air-cooled flat-4s, Subaru-based liquid-cooled engines, Mazda Wankel and Chevrolet Corvair six-cylinder engines being most common. The use of automotive engines helps to reduce costs, but many builders prefer dedicated aircraft engines, which <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> have better performance and reliability. Other engines that have been used include chainsaw and motorcycle engines.|$|E
25|$|Central to Theosophical {{belief is}} the idea that a group of spiritual adepts known as the Masters both exist and were {{responsible}} for the production of early Theosophical texts. For most Theosophists, these Masters are deemed to be the real founders of the modern Theosophical movement. In Theosophical literature, these Masters are also referred to as the Mahatmas, Adepts, Masters of Wisdom, Masters of Compassion, and Elder Brothers. They <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be a fraternity of human men who are highly evolved, both in terms of having an advanced moral development and intellectual attainment. They are claimed to have achieved extra-long life spans, and to have gained the power of clairvoyance and to project their soul out of their body to any other location in an instant. These are powers that they have allegedly attained through many years of training. According to Blavatsky, their chief residence was in the Himalayan kingdom of Tibet. She also claimed that these Masters were the source of many of her published writings.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be vastly more realistic {{than most of the}} action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
