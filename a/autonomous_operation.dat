25|$|Energy {{harvesting}} devices converting ambient {{energy into}} electrical energy have attracted {{much interest in}} both the military and commercial sectors. Some systems convert motion, {{such as that of}} ocean waves, into electricity to be used by oceanographic monitoring sensors for <b>autonomous</b> <b>operation.</b> Future applications may include high power output devices (or arrays of such devices) deployed at remote locations to serve as reliable power stations for large systems. Another application is in wearable electronics, where energy harvesting devices can power or recharge cellphones, mobile computers, radio communication equipment, etc. All of these devices must be sufficiently robust to endure long-term exposure to hostile environments and have a broad range of dynamic sensitivity to exploit the entire spectrum of wave motions.|$|E

40|$|This study examine {{why some}} firms that are {{operating}} {{in an area}} of business through collaborations eventually become independent whereas others continue to collaborate. Using data on the aircraft industry, we show that experience with collaboration alone is insufficient to allow firms that were formerly in collaborations to establish <b>autonomous</b> <b>operations.</b> Collaborative experience needs to be partner-specific, gathered in contexts involving low levels of causal ambiguity, and fairly recent to help former partner firms obtain the resources required to establish <b>autonomous</b> <b>operations.</b> We then discuss how our study contributes to the interorganizational learning literature...|$|R
