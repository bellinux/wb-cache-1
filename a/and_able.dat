5|$|Although Herodotus {{presents}} the revolt {{as a consequence}} of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong <b>and</b> <b>able</b> leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.|$|E
40|$|This survey {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of strategies used by primary schools and local authorities to support <b>and</b> challenge more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils. Overall, most more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils are not challenged enough and too few pupils achieve above the expected levels {{at the end of}} key stages 1 and 2. Provision for more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils varies too much across Wales. In the few primary schools with the best provision, thorough analysis of data and assessment outcomes helps to identify more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils. In these few schools, more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils are supported through a range of additional provision and their progress tracked and monitored carefully. Parents understand the school’s approach to providing additional support for more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils. More <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils gain most in schools that promote individualised or personalised approaches to learning and they benefit particularly from having control over how and what they learn. However, in the majority of primary schools, more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils are not identified and do not receive appropriate support. Teachers in these schools do not have the expertise to identify, support or track the progress of more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils. Transition arrangements between primary and secondary schools often do not provide enough continuity and progression in the education of more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils. Few local authorities use data to monitor the progress of more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils or promote the sharing of best practice between schools. School improvement officers rarely discuss more <b>able</b> <b>and</b> talented pupils during their visits to schools. " - page 1...|$|R

5|$|Analyses {{has been}} {{published}} by currency strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention to weaken their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings {{are based on the}} openness of a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilians are polyphyodonts <b>and</b> <b>able</b> {{to replace}} {{each of their}} {{approximately}} 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35 to 75-year lifespan. They are the only non-mammalian vertebrates with tooth sockets.

Tooth replacement slows significantly and eventually stops as the animal grows old.|$|E

5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E
