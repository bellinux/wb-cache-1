According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{unaware that the}} vessel he was attacking was a {{hospital}} ship, and that the sinking was an unfortunate accident. This view was supported by several Japanese officers, {{both before and after}} the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible.

Orita did not hear <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crew about having sunk a hospital ship, not even rumours, and believed that if I-177 had knowingly attacked Centaur, he would have learned this from the crew's gossip.|$|E

5|$|Following the annulment, Cromwell was {{executed}} on 28 July. Cranmer now {{found himself in}} a politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London {{as a member of a}} council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine {{was executed}} in February 1542.|$|E
5|$|Work from Ahmose's reign {{is made of}} much finer {{material}} than <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Second Intermediate Period, {{though the}} craftsmanship from his reign does not always match the best work from either the Old or Middle Kingdoms. With the Delta and Nubia under Egyptian control once more, access was gained to resources not available in Upper Egypt. Gold and silver were received from Nubia, Lapis Lazuli from distant parts of central Asia, cedar from Byblos, and in the Sinai the Serabit el-Khadim turquoise mines were reopened. Although {{the exact nature of}} the relationship between Egypt and Crete is uncertain, at least some Minoan designs have been found on objects from this period, and Egypt considered the Aegean to be part of its empire. Ahmose reopened the Tura limestone quarries to provide stone for monuments and used Asiatic cattle from Phoenicia to haul the stone, according to his quarry inscription.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} Al-Khoei {{brings up}} {{in favor of}} the Quran is that by the time ‘Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread {{to such an extent that}} it was impossible for him, or even for anyone more powerful than him, to remove <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Quran. The value and importance of the Quran during this time protected it from being altered. In the oral culture at this time, people paid great attention to memorizing pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, it is hard to imagine that they did not pay similar attention to the preservation of the Book of the Almighty, especially since they believed they would be rewarded in the hereafter for memorizing it. Uthman could have altered the text, but he would have been unable to remove the Quran from the hearts of the Muslims who had memorized it.|$|E
25|$|Apocalyptic {{fiction is}} {{concerned}} with the end of civilization through war (On the Beach), pandemic (The Last Man), astronomic impact (When Worlds Collide), ecological disaster (The Wind from Nowhere), or some other general disaster or with a world or civilization after such a disaster. Typical of the genre are George R. Stewart's novel Earth Abides and Pat Frank's novel Alas, Babylon. Apocalyptic fiction generally concerns the disaster itself and the direct aftermath, while post-apocalyptic fiction can deal with <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> near aftermath (as in Cormac McCarthy's The Road) and Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake to centuries in the future (as in Stephen Vincent Benét's By the Waters of Babylon and Octavia Butler's Lilith's Brood) to hundreds or thousands of years in the future, as in Russell Hoban's novel Riddley Walker and Walter M.

25|$|No space colonies {{have been}} built so far. Currently, the {{building}} of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges. Space settlements would have to provide for nearly all (or all) the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans, in an environment out in space that is very hostile to human life. They would involve technologies, such as controlled ecological life support systems, that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way. They would also {{have to deal with the}} as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term.

Next up for the Blues was a tricky away tie to another team going well in a {{domestic}} cup. Portsmouth, who had just qualified for the semi-final of the FA Cup, went into an early two-goal lead thanks to Jermain Defoe, before goals from Fabrice Muamba and another Larsson free kick saw Blues complete a first-half comeback.

25|$|Attendees {{included}} the king, officers and other dignitaries in rows of seats, {{as well as}} half of the inhabitants of Athens in the stands. Since {{it was one of}} the first mass gatherings in the city's modern history, neither the people nor the police had any previous experience with maintaining the order at such an event. The press of that time lauded the Games as being positive, but they were a disappointment for thousands of Athenians who could not see <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear stands and who did not understand this kind of event. The site was also unsuited for the sports and the weather was too cold. Moreover, the athletic competition had a more game-like than sportive character: as the competitors were not individuals who were seriously dedicated to athletics, the Organising Committee accepted the participation of workers, porters, etc., who were attracted by the monetary prizes of the Games. According to the press of the time, many comical incidents took place during the games: for instance, a policeman, who was assigned to watch over the crowds, left his post and participated in the races. Even a beggar, who pretended to be blind, participated in the races.|$|E
25|$|In Australia and Japan, {{members of}} the family are highly sought after by anglers for their {{sporting}} and eating qualities, with anglers often taking more than commercial fishermen in some areas. The fishing techniques for all sillaginids are quite similar, with the shallow habitats often requiring light line and quiet movements. Whiting are also popular in part due to their accessibility, with tidal flats around beaches, estuaries and jetties common habitats from where many whiting species are caught without need for a boat. Tidal movements also affect catches, as do lunar phases, causing whiting to 'bite' when the tide is changing. Tackle used is kept light to avoid spooking the fish, and often requires only a simple setup, with a hook and light sinker tied directly to the mainline usually effective. In deeper water fished from boats or where currents are strong, more complex rigs are used, often with hooks tied to dropper loops on the trace. in Australia, some specialist whiting fishermen who target the fish in the surf or on shallow banks use red beads or tubing to attract the fish, claiming the method produces more fish. The bait used is normally <b>anything</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surrounding environment which the whiting naturally prey on, with polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans such as prawns and crabs, cephalopods and small fish effective for most species. As with most species, live bait is known to produce better catches. Lure fishing for whiting is not normally practiced, but saltwater flies have been used to good effect, as have small soft plastic lures. In some areas, restrictions to the amount and size of fish are in place and enforced by fishery authorities.|$|E
