5|$|Most of the overtures are {{in three}} sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a {{concluding}} allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself {{did not always}} follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to Utopia Limited is dominated by a slow section, with only <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> original passage introducing it.|$|E
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Adkins {{was born}} in Boone County, West Virginia on April 29, 1937, where he spent his entire life. He was the {{youngest}} of ten children of Wid Adkins, a coal miner, and Alice Adkins, raised in a tarpaper shack on property rented from a local coal company. Born {{at the time of the}} Great Depression, Adkins' early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were unable to provide him shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> time, as few as two days of first grade.|$|E
50|$|American Ballet Theatre {{describes}} it in full extensive detail in its Archives. Here is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>briefest</b> summary. The setting {{is a small}} country town in 1900 (perhaps in Schoenberg's Austria). Hagar, the middle of three sisters, whose elder sister is a spinster, foresees the same fate for herself. Hagar is surrounded {{on the one side}} by the prude and judging neighboring women of the small town, and on the other by licentious men and their hedonistic women. The man she unrequitedly loves seems to show preference for her flirtatious younger sister.|$|R

5|$|Returning {{to private}} practice, Hayes formed <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> law {{partnership}} with Leopold Markbreit, lasting {{three days before}} the war began. After the Confederates had fired on Fort Sumter, Hayes resolved his doubts and joined a volunteer company composed of his Literary Society friends. That June, Governor William Dennison appointed several of the officers of the volunteer company to positions in the 23rd Regiment of Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Hayes was promoted to major, and his friend and college classmate Stanley Matthews was appointed lieutenant colonel. Joining the regiment as a private was William McKinley, another future president.|$|E
5|$|The initial hot, dense {{state is}} called the Planck epoch, a brief period {{extending}} from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation {{is believed to have}} been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the Universe has been expanding to its present form, possibly with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> period of cosmic inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less than 10−32 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Tornado watches {{were also}} issued for the Lower Great Lakes in the {{afternoon}} hours, and supercells began to track across southern Michigan in the early evening. Two tornadoes touched down in Michigan and caused damage to farm structures. Further east, severe thunderstorms caused scattered wind damage and large hail across Pennsylvania and New York. Two-inch-diameter hail was reported in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. An isolated supercell moved across Central New York {{throughout much of the}} afternoon, producing golf ball-sized hail in Syracuse, and spawned <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> EF1 tornado in Verona Mills, causing primarily tree damage. Another tornado in Gilbertsville caused significant damage to an athletic field at a school.|$|E

Then, and after the friends had had <b>a</b> <b>brief,</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> interview, the delighted and inexorable mother, giving her hand to Warrington, sent him out of the room, too, back to Laura and the Major, who had not resumed their play of Cymbeline where they had left it off at the arrival of the {{rightful}} owner of Pen's chambers.|$|R
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit and was deeply disturbed by his work tending wounded French soldiers. For <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> period {{he served as a}} volunteer ambulance driver before ill health forced his return to Britain. Subsequently, Nevinson volunteered for home service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He used these experiences as the subject matter for a series of powerful paintings which used the machine aesthetic of Futurism and the influence of Cubism to great effect. His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote at the time that Nevinson's painting La Mitrailleuse, 'will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance on the war in the history of painting.' In 1917, Nevinson was appointed an official war artist, but he was no longer finding Modernist styles adequate for describing the horrors of modern war, and he increasingly painted in a more realistic manner. Nevinson's later World War One paintings, based on short visits to the Western Front, lacked the same powerful effect as those earlier works which had helped to make him {{one of the most famous}} young artists working in England.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1941, the 6th Division was {{dispatched}} to Greece, where they fought <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> campaign following the German invasion {{of that country}} {{in the middle of}} the month. Overwhelmed, the Allied forces were forced back over the course of several weeks during which the 2/6th took part in several desperate rearguard actions and withdrawals during which the battalion lost 28 men killed and 43 wounded. Finally, they were evacuated by sea at the end of the month, but amidst the confusion a large of the battalion's personnel– 217 personnel from all ranks– were captured, while others were landed on Crete, instead of Alexandria in Egypt, after the ship on which they were sailing, the Costa Rica, was sunk. On Crete, 13 officers and 202 other ranks from the 2/6th were organised into a 17th Brigade composite battalion along with men from the brigade's other battalions less the 2/7th. They subsequently fought unsuccessfully to repulse the German invasion that came in May, after which many more became prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Shamrock Rovers is disputed amongst {{supporters of the}} club. No official documentation of the era exists. For many years the earliest known mention of the club in the newspaper archives at the National Library of Ireland came from 1901 and {{an article in the}} club programme from 28 December 1941 claims that the club was founded in this year. Research by the Shamrock Rovers Heritage Trust uncovered <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> report in the Evening Herald from April 1899 on a match between Shamrock Rovers and Rosemount, has established that the club was in existence from at least that time. The only two certainties about the origins of the club in relation to what year they were formed are the facts that, Rovers played only exhibition games for {{the first two years of}} their existence and the club registered with the Leinster Football Association in 1901. Essentially, the dispute is over whether the two years of exhibition games were played before or after the registration. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the date 1899 was written on the gates of Glenmalure Park but since the 1990s, 1901 had been adopted as the founding year by the various regimes which have run the club. In light of the discovery of evidence supporting a founding date before April 1899 the club opened a 1899 Suite in Tallaght Stadium in February 2017.|$|E

50|$|His 1874 {{work was}} <b>a</b> series of <b>very</b> <b>brief,</b> largely unannotated, pedigrees, {{covering}} {{only a few}} generations for each family. It merely transcribes the often <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> Heraldic Visitation return documents signed by the senior member of each family. Even blazons of coats of arms are omitted from the 1874 work. This work was greatly expanded in his 1887 work.|$|R

25|$|Humanity's {{ability to}} detect {{intelligent}} extraterrestrial life has existed for only <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> period—from 1937 onwards, if {{the invention of the}} radio telescope is taken as the dividing line—and Homo sapiens is a geologically recent species. The whole period of modern human existence to date is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>brief</b> period on a cosmological scale, and radio transmissions have only been propagated since 1895. Thus, it remains possible that human beings have neither existed long enough nor made themselves sufficiently detectable to be found by extraterrestrial intelligence.|$|E
