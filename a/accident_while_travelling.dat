500|$|In March 2009, it was {{announced}} that the Parker family were to be written out of the show after Mignon and Bastoni decided to leave to concentrate on other commitments. Mignon, Bastoni and Coghill filmed their final scenes in April 2009. Mignon announced that her reason for leaving the show was so that she could return to studying an Arts degree at Melbourne university. Mignon said [...] "I didn't want to defer uni forever and, to be honest, I'd had enough of the Neighbours experience". The Neighbours writers took the decision to kill the character off. Viewers saw Bridget being injured in a car <b>accident</b> <b>while</b> <b>travelling</b> to Oakey. Bridget underwent surgery and she then had a premonition of her death. Her vision comes true and she dies from internal injuries. The Metro newspaper called the scenes [...] "tear-jerking".|$|E
60|$|There was no answer, because Sir Junius had gone. I {{never saw}} him again, for years ago the poor man died quite disgraced. His passion for semi-fraudulent speculations reasserted itself, and he became a {{bankrupt}} in conditions which caused {{him to leave the}} country for America, where he was killed in a railway <b>accident</b> <b>while</b> <b>travelling</b> as an immigrant. I have heard, however, that he was not asked to shoot at Ragnall any more.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Accident</b> apprised him, <b>while</b> <b>travelling</b> {{towards his}} native district, that the ladies, near whose mansion he must {{necessarily}} pass, were absent; and learning that Cuddie {{and his wife}} acted as their principal domestics, he could not resist pausing at their cottage to learn, if possible, the real progress which Lord Evandale had made in the affections of Miss Bellen den--alas! no longer his Edith. This rash experiment ended as we have related, and he parted from the house of Fairy Knowe, conscious {{that he was still}} beloved by Edith, yet compelled, by faith and honour, to relinquish her for ever. With what feelings he must have listened to the dialogue between Lord Evandale and Edith, the greater part of which he involuntarily overheard, the reader must conceive, for we dare not attempt to describe them. An hundred times he was tempted to burst upon their interview, or to exclaim aloud, [...] "Edith, I yet live!" [...] and as often the recollection of her plighted troth, and of the debt of gratitude which he owed Lord Evandale (to whose influence with Claverhouse he justly ascribed his escape from torture and from death), withheld him from a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress, but gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness. He repressed forcibly these selfish emotions, though with an agony which thrilled his every nerve.|$|R
