The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin.

25|$|The general colour of the upperparts is pearl grey, tinged {{brownish}} {{towards the}} east of its Eurasian range. The cheeks and chin {{as well as a}} thin and often hard-to-see stripe above the eye are white, and a deep black mask extends from the beak through the eye to the ear coverts; the area immediately above the beak is grey. The scapulars (shoulder feathers) are white, and the wings are black with a white bar made up by the bases of the primary remiges, continuing slightly offset onto the bases of the secondary remiges in some regions. The tail is black, long, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> the tip; the outer rectrices have white outer vanes. The underparts are white, slightly tinged with grey in most subspecies. In particular the breast is usually darker and sometimes browner {{than the rest of the}} light underside, and may appear as an indistinct band between the lighter belly and white throat. In the subspecies around the North Pacific in particular and in females elsewhere too, there may be faint brownish bars on the breast. The bill is large and hooked at the tip and coloured nearly black, but pale at the base of the under mandible (though the extent varies seasonally). The legs and feet are blackish.|$|E

500|$|Dean Smith {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Democrats in North Carolina politics. Politically, he was best known for promoting desegregation. In 1964, Smith joined a local pastor and a black North Carolina theology student to integrate The Pines, a Chapel Hill restaurant. He also integrated the Tar Heels basketball team by recruiting Charlie Scott as the university's first black scholarship athlete. In 1965, Smith helped Howard Lee, a black graduate student at North Carolina, purchase a home in an all-white neighborhood. He opposed the Vietnam War and, in the early 1980s, famously recorded radio spots to promote a freeze on nuclear weapons. He has been a prominent opponent of the death penalty. In 1998, he appeared at a clemency hearing for a death-row inmate <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> then-Governor Jim Hunt: [...] "You're a murderer. And I'm a murderer. The death penalty makes us all murderers." [...] As head coach, he periodically held North Carolina basketball practices in North Carolina prisons.|$|E

Defense {{attorneys}} tried to discredit Martínez' testimony and show the jury {{that she was a}} con-woman. They presented letters from several of her former clients who had paid around US$600 for love potions. One woman from San Antonio said that Martínez consulted her after she began having problems with her boyfriend and did not see positive results. Martínez denied knowing who the writers were, but changed her mind when the defense read the letters to her and the jury. She admitted that she used herbs, oils, and holy water in her sessions, and that she kept a human skull in her shop. She did not call herself a curandera (fortune teller) because she did not study for to earn the title. Martínez was then asked to read her cards for one of the attorney's in the courtroom to show the jury how she worked.|$|E

The prosecution claimed that in November 2008 Khalid repeatedly drove past a demonstration that Griffin was attending, and on the second occasion shouted [...] "white bastards". Khalid admitted shouting derisory comments at Griffin and other demonstrators, telling the jury he shouted [...] "Nick Griffin, you fucking wanker" [...] and [...] "Get the fuck out of Burnley, you're not welcome here", but denied shouting [...] "white bastard".
