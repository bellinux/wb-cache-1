40|$|Pluralistic ignorance'' is a {{phenomenon}} mainly studied in social psychology. Viewed as an epistemic phenomenon, one way to define it is as a situation where ``no one believes, but everyone believes that everyone else believes''. In this paper various versions of pluralistic ignorance are formalized using epistemic/doxastic logic (based on plausibility models). The motive is twofold. Firstly, the formalizations are used to show that <b>the</b> various versions <b>of</b> pluralistic ignorance are all consistent, thus {{there is nothing in}} the phenomenon that necessarily goes against logic. Secondly, pluralistic ignorance, is on many occasions, assumed to be fragile. In this paper, however, it is shown that pluralistic ignorance need not be fragile to <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agents' beliefs. Hence, to dissolve pluralistic ignorance in general, something more than <b>announcements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjective views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agents is needed. Finally, suggestions to further research are outlined...|$|R
