5|$|The {{last of the}} sirenian {{families}} to appear, Trichechidae, apparently arose from early dugongids in the late Eocene or early Oligocene. It is a monophyletic taxa. In 1994, the family was expanded to not only include the subfamily Trichechinae (Potamosiren, Ribodon, and Trichechus), but also Miosireninae (Anomotherium and Miosiren). The African manatee and the West Indian manatee are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatee.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> are large, cylindrically shaped mammals, with forelimbs {{modified}} into flippers, no free hind-limbs, and {{the rear}} of the body {{in the form of a}} flat, rounded, horizontal paddle. The flexible flippers are used for aiding motion over the bottom, scratching, touching and even embracing other manatees, and moving food into and cleaning the mouth. The manatee's upper lip is modified into a large bristly surface, which is deeply divided. It can move each side of the lips independently while feeding. The general coloration is grey, and most <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> have a distinct white or bright pink patch on the breast.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> (Trichechus inunguis) {{and river}} {{dolphins}} (Inia geoffrensis) {{spend time in}} várzea areas during high water periods of the flood season.

5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of {{manatees}} are valuable items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack {{of law enforcement}} in these areas induce poaching. Some residents of West African countries, such as Mali and Chad, depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees,</b> {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees,</b> especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild.

2500|$|Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous {{marine mammals}} {{sometimes}} known as sea cows. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing {{three of the}} four living species in the order Sirenia: the <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis). They measure up to [...] long, weigh as much as , and have paddle-like flippers. The etymology of the name is dubious, with connections having been made to Latin [...] "manus" [...] (hand), and to a word sometimes cited as [...] "manati" [...] used by the Taíno, a pre-Columbian people of the Caribbean, meaning [...] "breast".

40|$|VHF {{telemetry}} {{data indicate}} that {{in the region of}} the Mamirauá and Amanã Sustainable Development Reserves <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> carry out seasonal migrations from floodplain lakes, where they stay during the high water season, to highland lakes, their home in the low water season. To explore the reasons for this behavior, a temporal monitoring of the distribution and abundance of their main food resource, aquatic macrophyte, is being carried out via remote sensing (RS). As historical RS data is limited to Landsat-TM images, which have a spatial resolution that is inadequate to capture small sized macrophyte stands, image restoration techniques were used. Results indicate that restoration to 15 x 15 m enhances detection of stands. Also, results indicate that band 4 alone is adequate to distinguish aquatic macrophyte stands in the high water season.

40|$|The Trichechus inunguis is {{endemic to}} the Amazon region. Observation is nearly {{impossible}} because of the turbid water, which consequently hinders study of their behaviour. In this study, we deployed the acceleration data loggers to 9 captive <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> to classify their behaviour at INPA, Brazil. The experiments were also recorded by video camera. We classified four types of behaviours: inactive on the bottom, walking on the bottom, surfacing and swimming. Inactive and walking on the bottom were classified using standard deviation (SD) of dive depth and longitudinal acceleration. The SD of dive depth shows the low variability in inactive and walking on the bottom (ranged from 0. 0 to 0. 1 m), the SD of longitudinal acceleration shows the low variability in inactive (from 0. 00 to 0. 01 ms(- 2)), high variability in walking on the bottom (from 0. 01 to 0. 15 ms(- 2)). Mean classification accuracy was 87. 1 % and 84. 9 % during inactive and walking on the bottom, respectively. 6 manatees were fed floating vegetables during experiment, and they showed a characteristic of long surfacing during feeding time. This characteristic was probably a fair reflection of their natural behavior, as wild <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> prefer floating and emergent aquatic plants...|$|R

Para tanto foram coletadas amostras fecais provenientes de 34 peixes-boi marinhos, 12 peixes-boi amazônicos e 21 funcionários envolvidos em atividades de manejo, bem como amostras de água {{superficial}} destinada a manutenção e consumo dos animais. As amostras fecais foram processadas através da sedimentação pelo formoléter e coradas pela técnica de Kinyoun. No que concerne as amostras de água, estas foram submetidas ao processo de filtração em membranas (47 mm de diâmetro e 3 &# 956;m de porosidade) sob pressão negativa. No final das análises, as amostras positivas foram submetidas ao Teste de Imunofluorescência Direta. Os resultados obtidos namicroscopia de luz e fluorescência revelaram oocistos de Cryptosporidium spp. em 25 % (34 / 136) e 4, 30 % (05 / 115), sendo inerentes respectivamente aos peixes-boi marinhos e amazônicos, 23, 80 % (10 / 42) do material proveniente dos funcionários e 66, 67 % (04 / 06) das análises de água. Os resultados finais apontam a possibilidade dos peixes-boi marinhos e peixes-boi amazônicos infectarem-se com Cryptosporidium spp., e participar da epidemiologia das doenças veiculadas pela água, através da eliminação de oocistos viáveis ao ambiente que podem infectar o homem e um grande número de animais domésticos e silvestres. O controle da freqüência de infecções de Cryptosporidium spp. nos funcionários diretamente envolvidos no manejo e cuidados dos animais mantidos em cativeiro pode ser um dos caminhos para prevenir a infecção nas espécies de peixes-boi.

5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|R

500|$|Sirenians are {{referred}} to as [...] "sea cows" [...] because their diet consists mainly of seagrass. They ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although they will feed on just the leaves if this is not possible. Manatees, in particular the West Indian manatee, are known to consume over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants, such as shoalweed, water lettuce, muskgrass, manatee grass, and turtle grass. Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10%-15% of their body weight, or , per day, which requires the manatee to graze for several hours per day. However, 10% of the diet of the African manatee is fish and mollusks. Manatees have been known to eat small amounts of fish from nets. As opposed to bulk feeding, dugongs target high-nitrogen grasses to maximize nutrient intake, and, although almost completely herbivorous, dugongs will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish. Some populations of dugongs, such as the one in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when their supply of seagrasses decrease. In other dugong populations in western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. Populations of <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> become restricted to lakes during the July–August dry season when water levels begin to fall, and are thought to fast during this period. Their large fat reserves and low metabolic rates – only 36% of the usual placental mammal metabolic rate – allow them to survive for up to seven months with little or no food.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the current population status of <b>Amazonian</b> <b>manatees</b> (Trichechus inunguis) and their habitat in eastern Ecuador. Threats to this endangered species include oil exploration and extraction, water pollution, subsistence hunting, and incidental mortality. Our methods included side scanning sonar surveys of the Amazon River and tributaries in eastern Ecuador, interviews with local residents, and analysis of water samples using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods. Data collection will be in progress until the first of August. Sonar surveys were recorded and further analyzed for evidence of manatees. Forty possibIe manatee detections were identified. There were two visual sightings and thirty-eight sonar sightings. This is evidence that <b>manatees</b> persist in <b>Amazonian</b> Ecuador but are very rare. Upon completion of data collection, the population data will be analyzed using patch occupancy models. Interviews were conducted with local residents who live on the rivers and tributaries and have direct contact with the animals. Hundreds of manatee sightings were reported. It was noteworthy how many people had hunted and eaten these creatures. Many locals had multiple harpoons specifically for hunting manatees. Water samples were analyzed to determine the concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pAHs), volatile organics, toxic metals, mercury, and petroleum hydrocarbons in samples collected while conducting manatee surveys. All samples contained varying concentrations of crude oil with 30 - 40 carbons and both total and fecal coliforms, but no evidence of toxic PAHs, metals, or volatile organics has been found currently.
