Then the General Evaluator, or Master Evaluator, gives his or her overall evaluation of the meeting and makes recommendations of ways to improve future meetings. Some clubs have Table Topics Evaluators who evaluate members' responses to the table topics; for those that do not, the General Evaluator frequently fills that role.

2500|$|The {{definition}} {{in terms}} of μ-recursive functions {{as well as a}} different definition of rekursiv functions by Gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a Turing machine. The word decidable stems from the German word Entscheidungsproblem which was used in the original papers of Turing and others. In contemporary use, the term [...] "computable function" [...] has various definitions: according to Cutland (1980), it is a partial recursive function (which can be undefined for some inputs), while according to Soare (1987) it is a total recursive (equivalently, general recursive) function.

2500|$|On April 22, 2010, the U.S. National Research Council, the {{operating}} {{arm of the}} National Academy of Sciences, convened a review committee that heard testimony from Henry Heine, a microbiologist who was formerly employed at the Army's biodefense laboratory in Maryland where Ivins had worked. Heine told the panel {{that it was impossible}} that the deadly spores had been produced undetected in Ivins's laboratory, as maintained by the F.B.I. He testified that using the equipment at the army lab, at least a year of intensive work would have been required to produce the quantity of spores contained in the letters, and that such an intensive effort could not have escaped the attention of colleagues. Heine also told the panel that lab technicians who worked closely with Ivins have told him they saw no such work. He stated further that where Ivins worked biological containment measures were inadequate to prevent the Anthrax spores from floating out of the laboratory into animal cages and offices. [...] "You'd have had dead animals or dead people," [...] Heine said. According to Science Magazine, [...] "Heine caveated his remarks by saying that he himself had no experience making anthrax stocks." [...] Science magazine provides <b>additional</b> <b>comments</b> by Adam Driks of Loyola who stated that the amount of anthrax in the letters could be made in [...] "a number of days".

[...] You know it sort of makes you real mad." [...] On September 8, 2006, another local news station, WUSA9, showed an off-screen reporter asking him, [...] "Did you call her an Old Mother Hubbard?" [...] to which he responded, [...] "Well, what does she look like? ... Old-fashioned hairdo; long dress ... If I lose or win – whatever I do – I'm gonna send her some Style magazines." [...] His campaign called a press conference, but he failed to show. [...] Owens commented that perhaps Schaefer had become too old to run, saying that running against him was like a granddaughter [...] "taking the keys away from grandpa." [...] In response, Schaefer and his campaign hinted that Owens was lashing out at him in an act of age discrimination. [...] One viewer wrote in, suggesting that perhaps Schaefer was showing signs of dementia. [...] The anchor responded that the caller had pointed out [...] "the elephant in the room" [...] that, until then, the media was hesitant to suggest. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments regarding Owens' appearance, saying, [...] "An apology? An apology for what? I can't help it how she looks."
