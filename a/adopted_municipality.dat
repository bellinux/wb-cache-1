40|$|Increasingly, {{municipal}} leaders {{justify their}} use of tax increment financing (TIF) by touting its role in improving municipal employment. However, empirical studies on TIF have primarily examined TIF's impact on property values, ignoring the claim {{that serves as the}} primary justification for its use. This article addresses the claim by examining the impact of TIF adoption on municipal employment growth in Illinois, looking for both general impact and impact specific to the type of development supported. Results find no general impact of TIF use on employment. However, findings suggest that TIF districts supporting industrial development may {{have a positive effect on}} municipal employment, whereas TIF districts supporting retail development have a negative effect on municipal employment. These results are consistent with industrial TIF districts capturing employment that would have otherwise occurred outside of the <b>adopting</b> <b>municipality</b> and retail TIF districts shifting employment within the municipality to more labor-efficient retailers within the TIF district. tax increment financing; employment; economic development incentives; state and local taxation...|$|R
