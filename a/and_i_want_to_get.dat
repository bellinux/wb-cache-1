500|$|Real estate magnate Donald Trump, head of The Trump Organization since 1971, first {{dabbled in}} presidential {{politics}} in the early summer of 1987. [...] Republican political organizer Mike Dunbar, unimpressed with the candidates for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, founded the [...] "Draft Trump for President" [...] organization. [...] Believing Trump had {{the makings of a}} president, Dunbar pitched Trump the idea of speaking at an event for Republican candidates in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. [...] According to Dunbar in a later interview, Trump was receptive to this idea. [...] Then a registered Democrat, Trump officially changed his registration to Republican in July 1987. [...] Speculation that he would actually run for president intensified two months later, when he purchased $94,801 worth of full-page advertisements in The New York Times, Boston Globe, and The Washington Post with the heading [...] "There’s nothing wrong with America’s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can’t cure." [...] The advertisements reflected Trump's concerns that Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait were taking advantage of American money and protection without providing any benefit to the United States. [...] The next month, as Dunbar had proposed, Trump appeared at a Rotary Club luncheon in New Hampshire. [...] There, he delivered what The New York Times described as an [...] "impassioned speech," [...] in which he expressed concern about the United States being [...] "pushed around" [...] by its allies and proposed that [...] "these countries that are ripping us off pay off the $200 billion deficit." [...] In the audience, college students held placards reading [...] "Trump for President." [...] Nevertheless, Trump proclaimed, [...] "I'm not here because I'm running for President. I'm here because I'm tired of our country being kicked around <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my ideas across." [...] Later, Trump appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. [...] After the appearance, he received a letter from former President Richard Nixon in which Nixon explained that his wife Pat, [...] "an expert on politics," [...] had seen Trump on the show and [...] "predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!" [...] In November 1987, Trump released , which became a New York Times bestseller.|$|E
2500|$|While Evans {{considered}} himself an acoustic pianist, from the 1970 album From Left to Right on, he also released some material with Fender-Rhodes piano intermissions. However, unlike other jazz players (e.g. Herbie Hancock) he never fully embraced the new instrument, and invariably ended up {{returning to the}} acoustic sound. [...] "I don't {{think too much about}} the electronic thing, except that it's kind of fun to have it as an alternate voice. (...) [...] merely an alternate keyboard instrument, that offers a certain kind of sound that's appropriate sometimes. I find that it's a refreshing auxiliary to the piano—but I don't need it (...) I don't enjoy {{spending a lot of time}} with the electric piano. I play it for a period of time, then I quickly tire of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to the acoustic piano." [...] He commented that electronic music: [...] "just doesn't attract me. I'm of a certain period, a certain evolution. I hear music differently. For me, comparing electric bass to acoustic bass is sacrilege." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "How Far I'll Go" [...] was {{composed}} as Moana's [...] "I Want" [...] song, {{following in the}} long tradition of [...] "I Want" [...] songs in 1990s Disney animated musicals. It replaced an earlier attempt called [...] "More", for which the demo version recorded by Marcy Harriell was released as an outtake on the deluxe version of the soundtrack album. [...] Although Miranda has stressed that he is still [...] "very proud of" [...] the song as a first draft, [...] "More" [...] was not good enough in retrospect because it merely expressed Moana's vague desire to see more since she had already figured out everything about the island. In contrast, [...] "How Far I'll Go" [...] expresses a deeper, richer message: Moana's struggle with the irresistible impulse to explore beyond the reef notwithstanding her genuine love for her island, her family, and her people. [...] As Miranda explained to People: [...] "To me that's much more complicated than, 'I hate it here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out,' ... To say, ‘I love it here, I love my parents, but why can't I stop walking to the ocean and fantasizing about getting out of here?' And questioning that instinct? It's even more confusing. And that's a valid story too." ...|$|E
