5|$|Born in Kilburn, London to Dominican parents, Pacquette {{has played}} inter{{national}}ly for the Dominica national team. He scored on his debut against Barbados in 2008 and has earned two caps for the team. His second appearance came in <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> to Barbados {{in the second}} leg.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{made his}} first start for Leeds in <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> against Millwall, after {{replacing}} the injured Jermaine Beckford in the starting line-up. At {{the end of the}} 2009–10 season Leeds finished second thus earning promotion to the Championship. Dickov's contract wasn't renewed after promotion.|$|E

5|$|That Ouania is Govan is now {{reasonably}} certain, but {{the location}} of Newanbirig is less so. Although there are very many Newburghs, it is Newburgh-on-Tyne near Hexham {{that has been the}} preferred location. An alternative interpretation of the events of 756 has been advanced: it identifies Newanbirig with Newborough by Lichfield in the kingdom of Mercia. <b>A</b> <b>defeat</b> here for Eadberht and Óengus by Æthelbald's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named Óengus son of Fergus founded the church there as a thanksgiving to Saint Andrew for saving him after <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> in Mercia.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although the result was <b>a</b> <b>defeat,</b> it was {{not by any means}} decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|The New York Yankees bought Paschal {{from the}} Crackers {{near the end}} of the 1924 season and he played in four games. His only three hits, as well as three RBI, came in <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> by the Detroit Tigers on September 19.|$|E

5|$|After Spain were {{surprisingly}} {{eliminated from}} the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup by <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> to the United States, Alonso and Spain faced South Africa in the third-place match. After 90 minutes, the game was deadlocked at 2–2, so extra time was added, where Alonso scored a free-kick in to the bottom corner of the goal to help Spain win third.|$|E
5|$|Born in East Ham, London, Jones was {{rejected}} {{as a youth}} team player at Colchester United before impressing the coaches at Queens Park Rangers (QPR). He made his professional debut on 22 April 2006, coming on for the final seven minutes {{as a substitute for}} Steve Lomas in a 1–2 home loss to promotion-chasing Watford. Eight days later, he made his only other appearance of the season, coming on for Stefan Bailey in the 68th minute of <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> by the same score away to the already-crowned winners of the Football League Championship, Reading.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} January 2004, Arsenal {{were still}} in the hunt for all four trophies, but {{suffered}} setbacks in each of the cup competitions; they were unable to retain the FA Cup, losing out to eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-finals and days later were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League by Chelsea in the quarter-finals. They exited the League Cup after <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> to Middlesbrough in early February.|$|E
5|$|Carson joined Liverpool on a four-and-a-half-year {{contract}} and {{was to provide}} competition for Jerzy Dudek for a first-team place. He made his first team debut for Liverpool in March 2005 in <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> to Newcastle United, and made three consecutive appearances in April, including the home leg of the UEFA Champions League quarter-final victory over Juventus. He was an unused substitute when Liverpool were victorious in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final and 2005 UEFA Super Cup.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1190s, the Georgian {{government}} began {{to interfere in}} the affairs of the Ildenizids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing Shirvan to a tributary state. The Ildenizid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> at the hands of David Soslan at the Battle of Shamkor and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Ildenizids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.|$|E

5|$|Faramir's {{decision}} {{to reject the}} One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon. By not taking the Ring, Faramir rejects the desire for power and glory {{and the desire for}} renown which <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> of Sauron would bring him.|$|E
5|$|French rugby {{came of age}} {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s: they won their first Five Nations {{championship}} and completed a successful tour of South Africa. Their first championship was won in 1954 when they shared the title with England and Wales. France won their first outright Five Nations championship in 1959; they won with two wins, a draw (against England) and <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> (against Ireland).|$|E
5|$|His first {{match in}} charge {{ended in a}} 2–0 defeat against Chelsea at St James' Park. On 11 April, Newcastle earned their first point under Shearer with a 1–1 draw with Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium with Andy Carroll scoring a late {{equalising}} goal. After <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> to Tottenham Hotspur and a draw against Portsmouth, his first win for Newcastle came in a 3–1 victory over Middlesbrough that lifted Newcastle from the relegation zone.|$|E

5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} {{his better}} understanding of terrain in every possible way to gain strategic superiority over his enemies. During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered deep into Persian territory and always kept the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there in case of <b>a</b> <b>defeat.</b> It was only after all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated deep into Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain would help him in executing his grand strategy of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|King Louis the Child held {{a meeting}} at Regensburg in 901 to {{introduce}} further measures against the Hungarians. Moravian envoys proposed a peace between Moravia and East Francia, because the Hungarians had in the meantime plundered their country. A Hungarian army invading Carinthia was defeated in April and Aventinus describes <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> of the Hungarians by Margrave Luitpold at the river Fischa in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{qualified}} for the competition {{as a result of}} winning the 1983–84 European Cup. They had beaten Roma 4–2 in a penalty shootout, after the match had finished 1–1. Liverpool were appearing in their third Super Cup. They won the competition on their first appearance in 1977, beating German team Hamburg 7–1 on aggregate. Their other appearance in 1978 resulted in <b>a</b> <b>defeat</b> to Belgian team Anderlecht.|$|E
