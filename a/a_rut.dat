40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a summary index of <b>a</b> <b>rutted</b> profile for the estimation of ride quality of road vehicles in <b>a</b> <b>rutted</b> road. First, the spatial frequency analysis of the rutted profiles by the continuous wavelet transform is conducted to comprehend the wavy characteristics of the profiles associated with the vehicle motion caused by the lane-change maneuver in the rutting. The result shows that the wavy characteristics in the wavelength of 0. 4 m affect the vehicle dynamics with respect to the ride quality deterioration. Second, a difference filter is designed to detect the wavelength of 0. 4 m from <b>a</b> <b>rutted</b> profile. The filtering manipulation enhances the wavy characteristics of the profile corresponding to the ride quality of the vehicle. Finally, we develop a summary index of the profile that is the difference between maximum and minimum elevation of the filtered profile. The result of regression analysis shows that the developed index highly correlates with the ride quality rating value based on the vehicle dynamics. The index enables road administrators to directly estimate the ride quality from rutted profile data of road surfaces in the pavement monitoring activity...|$|R

25|$|Throughout his tenure, Gude had private {{pupils in}} {{addition}} to his normal classes. As a professor Gude taught six hours of class, held two hours of office hours, took turns with other professors supervising the nude drawing class and attended staff meetings. In 1857 Gude handed in his resignation, officially citing family considerations and failing health as his reasons for resigning, although in his memoirs he blamed opposition and backbiting from two of his pupils. The landscape painting professorship was the bottom of the pay scale at the Academy, and Gude {{was one of the few}} professors to be refused a raise when others received them in 1855. Others have suggested that Gude wished to leave the Academy for fear for becoming stuck in <b>a</b> <b>rut</b> artistically. Gude received better treatment from the Academy after he turned in his resignation, and it would take him a full five years to finally leave Düsseldorf. Although professors at the Academy complained that their teaching prevented them from undertaking more lucrative endeavors, Gude was able to sell enough works to afford a modest house in Düsseldorf which stood in what is now Hofgarten.|$|E

Harrison found these lines in what he called [...] "the garden building", carved in stone around two matching windows. The only other lyrics in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] are the song title, repeated four times to serve as its chorus. Sung in imitation of a clock chiming, the chorus lyrics, combined with the message of those of the verse, lend the composition an obvious New Year's theme. Harrison later described the song as [...] "very optimistic", and suggested: [...] "Instead of getting stuck in <b>a</b> <b>rut,</b> everybody should try ringing out the old and ringing in the new… [...] sing about it, but they never apply it to their lives." ...|$|E

500|$|Most {{reviews for}} Silent Hill: Origins were positive; its {{original}} release on the PSP received a Metacritic aggregate score of 78 out of 100.

[...] Shane Bettenhausen of 1UP.com concluded, [...] "Sure, it's predictable, conventional, {{and a little bit}} short, not to mention ill-suited for brief pick-up-and-play sessions on the bus, but we're encouraged to see developers making an original, console-quality experience for PSP." [...] According to Kristan Reed of Eurogamer, [...] "No doubt mindful of remaining faithful to the series' legacy, Climax pays such close attention to the ingredients of the first three Silent Hill games that it's basically an unapologetic homage to them." [...] While stating that Origins would appeal to fans for its story that adds to the series' mythos, Game Informer added, [...] "Unfortunately, the game has fallen into something like <b>a</b> <b>rut</b> in most other areas and less fanatical gamers won't be as forgiving of its faults." ...|$|E

[...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons of}} the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in <b>a</b> <b>rut,</b> or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy will be hard to match." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hassam {{had moved}} to France to study figure drawing and {{painting}} at the prestigious Académie Julian. He {{took advantage of the}} formal drawing classes with Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre, but quickly moved on to self-study, finding that [...] "he Julian academy is the personification of routine... crushes all originality out of growing men. It tends to put them in <b>a</b> <b>rut</b> and it keeps them in it", preferring instead, [...] "my own method in the same degree". His first Parisian works were street scenes, employing a mostly brown palette. He sent these works back to Boston and their sale, combined with that of older watercolors, provided him with sufficient income to sustain his stay abroad. In the autumn of 1887, Hassam painted two versions of Grand Prix Day, employing a breakthrough change of palette. In this dramatic change of technique, he was laying softer, more diffuse colors to canvas, similar to the French Impressionists, creating scenes full of light, done with freer brush strokes. He was likely inspired by French Impressionist paintings which he viewed in museums and exhibitions, though he did not meet any of the artists. Hassam eventually became one of the group of American Impressionists known as [...] "The Ten".|$|E
