Also, analytical models of the interference phenomena at the contact points were developed to investigate their effects on the roundness profile of a centerless ground workpiece. In order to {{study the effects of}} grinding variables on grinding mechanism, details of the machining factor were formulated using such process variables as grinding wheel speed, wheel specification, regulating wheel speed, dressing condition, etc. A least squares contact line was formulated to include the effect of workpiece orientation relative to the grinding machine. Using these formulas, 2 -D, 3 -D infeed, and 3 -D through-feed centerless grinding simulation models were developed. For the 3 -D through-feed simulation model, grinding forces of previous and/or following workpieces were assumed {{as a function of the}} current workpiece location. ^ The experiments and {{computer simulation}}s were carried out using three types of cylindrical workpiece shapes with varying flat length.

Through 2 -D simulation, it was verified that grinding wheel interference is affected not only by geometry but also by machine elasticity. 3 -D simulation results revealed that the effect of flat end is propagated to the opposite end through workpiece reorientation. It was shown that the inherent tapering error of the through-feed centerless grinding exists.

Real-time detection and tracking of targets with these cameras is nevertheless {{complicated by the}} fact that the geometrical relationship between the camera view and the 3 D observed scene is time-varying and, over long periods of op-eration, real world scenes exhibit changes either due to objects or context variations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the different scales of turbulent motion on plume dispersion in the atmospheric convective boundary layer (CBL) is studied {{by means of a}} large-eddy simulation (LES). In particular, the large-scale (meandering) and small-scale (relative diffusion) contributions are separated by analyzing dispersion in two reference systems: the <b>absolute</b> (fixed) <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> and the <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> relative to the plume¿s instantaneous center of mass. In the relative <b>coordinate</b> <b>system,</b> the (vertically) inhomogeneous meandering motion is removed, and only the small-scale, homogeneous turbulent motion contributes to the dispersion process. First, mean plume position, dispersion parameters (variance), and skewness of the plume position are discussed. The analysis of the third-order moments shows how the structure and the symmetry of scalar distribution are affected with respect to the turbulent characteristics of the CBL (inhomogeneity of the large-scale vertical motion) and the presence of the boundary conditions (surface and top of the CBL). In fact, the reflection of the plume by the CBL boundaries generates the presence of nonlinear cross-correlation terms in the balance equation for the third-order moments of the plume position. As a result, the third-order moment of the absolute position is not balanced by the sum of the third-order moments of the meandering and relative plume position. Second, mean concentration and concentration fluctuations are calculated and discussed in both <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems.</b> The intensity of relative concentration fluctuation icr, which quantifies the internal (in plume) mixing, is explicitly calculated. Based on these results, a parameterization for the probability distribution function (PDF) of the relative concentration is proposed, showing very good agreement with the LES results. Finally, the validity of Gifford¿s formula, which relates the absolute concentration¿s high-order moments to the relative concentration and the PDF of the plume centerline, is studied. It is found that due to the presence of the CBL boundaries, Gifford¿s formula is not able to reproduce correctly the value of the absolute mean concentration near the ground. This result is analyzed by showing that, when the plume is reflected by the CBL boundaries, the instantaneous relative plume width z¿ 2 r(t) departs from its mean value ¿ 2 r. By introducing the skewness of the relative plume position into a parameterization for the relative mean concentration, the results for the calculated mean concentration are improved...|$|R
