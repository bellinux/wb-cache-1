5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, <b>Americans</b> <b>like</b> William Billings were {{establishing}} a bold, new style of vocal performance, markedly distinct from European traditions. John Cole, an important publisher and tune collector in Baltimore, known for pushing a rarefied European outlook on American music, responded with the tunebook Beauties of Psalmody, which denigrated the new techniques, especially fuguing. Cole continued publishing tunebooks up to 1842, and soon began operating his own singing school. Besides Cole, Baltimore {{was home to}} other major music publishers as well. These included Wheeler Gillet, who focused on dignified, European-style music like Cole did, and Samuel Dyer, who collected more distinctly American-styled songs. The tunebooks published in Baltimore included instructional notes, using {{a broad array of}} music education techniques then common. Ruel Shaw, for example, used a system derived from the work of Heinrich Pestalozzi, interpreted by the American Lowell Mason. Though the Pestalozzian system was widely used in Baltimore, other techniques were tried, such as that developed by local singing master James M. Deems, based on the Italian solfeggi system.|$|E

He was an instrumental figure in keeping Aramco–Saudi relations as peaceful as could be. Given King Abdul-Aziz's relationship with Eddy and other <b>Americans</b> <b>like</b> Thomas Barger, the Saudis resisted completely nationalizing the company and instead brokered several key deals that would maintain American involvement and training {{while at the same}} time expanding benefits brought by the oil revenue to more Saudis.|$|E

25|$|The {{shooting}} and subsequent trial attracted nationwide attention. It {{has been reported}} that some Hmong <b>Americans,</b> <b>like</b> some other groups of Americans, do not fully understand American law regarding hunting. In their homeland, the Hmong had a different hunting culture, and most lands were government-owned and therefore open to subsistence hunting, as in other third world countries. Regional officials in Wisconsin and Minnesota have focused on educating Hmong hunters on private property rights to diminish the risk of future conflicts.|$|E
500|$|According to scholar Robert Zecker, {{the novel}} depicts African-American poverty {{but does not}} {{illustrate}} its causes. None of the characters think about how 500,000African-Americans were placed in cramped living areas of only 25 square blocks and the bitterness and rage that stems from such conditions. The African Americans do not forget the years of oppression they have endured. However, the Greek <b>Americans,</b> <b>like</b> other whites, fail {{to remember that the}} African Americans were assaulted by whites in 1943 and faced over two decades of oppression after that. Instead, Zecker noted that the characters in the novel believe that the 1967 Detroit riots are [...] "inexplicable cataclysms that came out of nowhere".|$|E
500|$|In 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{attacked}} Pearl Harbor, {{while other}} Japanese forces attacked the Philippines. Filipino <b>Americans,</b> <b>like</b> other Americans, attempted {{to volunteer for}} military service, but {{were not allowed to}} enlist since they were neither citizens nor resident aliens. Following a change in legislation it was announced on 3 January 1942, the day after Manila fell, that Filipinos would be permitted to volunteer, and could be drafted, for military service; in California, almost half of the male Filipino American population enlisted. Some who volunteered to serve were refused due to their age; other older volunteers were refused due to the need for agricultural labor. [...] Filipinos were strongly encouraged to volunteer for the Regiment, and only those who did so were assigned to it. [...] Those who did not volunteer to serve in the Regiment served in regular (white) units in various theaters of operation. One example was PFC Ramon S. Subejano, who was awarded the Silver Star for actions in Germany.|$|E

500|$|The first tunebook {{published}} in Maryland was the Baltimore Collection of Church Music by Alexander Ely in 1792, consisting mostly of hymns, {{with some more}} complex pieces described as anthems. In 1794, Joseph Carr established a shop in Baltimore, along with his sons Thomas and Benjamin, who ran shops in New York and Philadelphia. The Carrs {{would be the most}} successful publishing firm until around the start of the 19th century; however, they remained prominent until the company folded in 1821, and the Carrs were responsible for the first sheet music publication of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] in 1814, arranged by Thomas Carr himself, and they also published European instrumentals and stage pieces, as well as works by <b>Americans</b> <b>like</b> James Hewitt and Alexander Reinagle. Much of this music was collected, in serial format, in the Musical Journal for the Piano Forte, which spanned five volumes and was the largest collection of secular music in the country.|$|E
500|$|When the {{campaign}} season opened in May 1777, General Washington moved {{most of his}} army from its winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey to a strongly fortified position in the Watchung Mountains. In June 1777, Howe {{began a series of}} odd moves in New Jersey, apparently in an attempt to draw Washington and his army out of that position onto terrain more favourable for a general engagement. His motives for this are uncertain; historian John Buchanan argues that Howe was determined to attempt to draw Washington into a major engagement while both were in northern New Jersey, writing that [...] "Washington's shift in position had whetted Howe's appetite for a major action when, if everything went right, he would finally accomplish what he and his brother's policies had denied him the previous year: the destruction of the Continental Army", but that Howe's underlying campaign goal for the season was Philadelphia. [...] One British major wrote that [...] "he report circulated by those in power is that it was thought necessary to march to Hilsborough to offer Washington battle." [...] <b>Americans</b> <b>like</b> Henry Knox were perplexed but also concluded that was its purpose: [...] "It was unaccountable that [...] should stop short when they had gone only nine miles ... In {{the course of a day}} or two [...] discovered that they ... had come out with an intention of drawing us into the plain." [...] Washington had intelligence that Howe had moved without taking the heavy river-crossing equipment, and was apparently not fooled at all.|$|E
500|$|Race is a {{polarizing}} theme {{throughout the}} story. As William M. Morgan wrote, while the white characters are largely depicted as cold and humorless, {{and the black}} characters as warm and amusing, the town's racial hierarchy is omnipresent. Slavery is referred to several times throughout the story, as critic Nan Goodman noted; as a post-Civil War work, The Monster revisits slavery's legacy, {{as well as its}} effects on modern African <b>Americans</b> <b>like</b> Henry Johnson. At the beginning of the story, it is made clear that the white townspeople tolerate Henry because he [...] "behaves himself" [...] and [...] "knows his place" [...] as a black man. Later, when Henry struggles through the burning house to save Jimmie, it is said that [...] "he was submitting, submitting because of his fathers, bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration." [...] However, while his suffering is central to the story, Henry Johnson is never really fleshed out as a character; before the fire, he [...] "strikes in quick succession the minstrel's poses of an old-time, happy-go-lucky Negro", who charms children and women alike. Despite his heroism, Morgan stated, Henry does not stray far from a racial stereotype. Critics such as Lillian Gilkes and John R. Cooley have noted Crane's lack of racial sensitivity while writing The Monster, although they note that the author was simply exhibiting [...] "unconscious racism" [...] in order to fulfill literary conventions of the late 19th century. [...] In his 2002 essay, [...] "Blunders of Virtue: The Problem of Race in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster'", John Clemen sums up the critics' tendency to either [...] "ignore the evidence of Crane's racism, to dismiss it as [...] a cultural influence irrelevant to his larger purposes, or to reconfigure it within his irony {{in such a way as}} to enable the story and its author to achieve an unintended racial insight." ...|$|E

From 1910 to 1940, and then from the 1940s to 1970, more than 6.5 million African Americans left the South in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, defecting from persistent lynching, violence, segregation, poor education, and inability to vote. Black migration transformed many Northern cities, creating new cultures and music. Many African <b>Americans,</b> <b>like</b> other groups, became industrial workers; others started their own businesses within the communities.
