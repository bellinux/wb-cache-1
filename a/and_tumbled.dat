5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck <b>and</b> <b>tumbled</b> down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E

Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E

40|$|By {{using the}} children's own {{thoughts}} and stories this theses aim {{to investigate and}} illustrate the phenomenon of rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play <b>and</b> its existence among five year olds in preschool.      The formulations of the questions are: What do children consider as rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play? - <b>and</b> what characterise that? From without a perspective of rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play, which kinds of rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play do the children play in preschool? - and how do those characterise? What makes rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play possible <b>and</b> accepted {{for the children to}} play in preschool? In this thesis I have investigated the questions above by interviewing 11 five years olds about how they consider rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play in preschool. From without Birgitta Knutsdotter Olofsson's and Torben Hangaard Rasmussen's view about play <b>and</b> rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play I created a perspective of rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play, which I used for analyzing the empirics. With rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play I mean games or plays that includes wrestling, hitting, kicking, pushing, chasing, running or/and the use of weapons against other human beings or other visualized beings or/and human beings. The conclusions are that children has many different opinions of what rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play is. Depends on who you are asking you will get a different perspective. The conclusions also shows that rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play can exist, not just by its self, but also in interplay with other kinds of games and plays. The children are using different strategies to make the rough <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> play fit the restrictions put on by the educators in the preschool. ...|$|R

25|$|The ridge northward to Great Carrs {{is named}} Top of Broad Slack, Broad Slack being a ferociously steep grass slope {{climbing}} out of the Greenburn valley between neighbouring crags. The ridge is a grassy plateau with a pronounced downward tilt to the west. The eastern edge is precipitous, curving around the head of Greenburn. On the journey to Great Carrs the path passes a memorial. This {{is the site of}} a wartime aircrash and bears the sad remains of a Royal Canadian Air Force Handley Page Halifax bomber. The undercarriage, together with a wooden cross and memorial cairn lies {{on the top of the}} ridge with the rest of the wreckage spread down Broad Slack. In his guidebook The Southern Fells Alfred Wainwright suggests that the plane approached from the west, failed to clear the ridge <b>and</b> <b>tumbled</b> down the other side. In fact, the wrecked aircraft came to rest on the western slope; the majority of the wreckage was subsequently pushed over the edge of broad slack by the RAF salvage crew, in order to make it less prominent and reduce the likelihood of overflying pilots spotting the wreckage and repeatedly reporting the crash. An engine and propeller from the aircraft are preserved at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston. The tilted plateau of the north ridge is triangular in plan, narrowing to a point at Fairfield in the west. This is the col between Swirl How and the ridge's western outlier, Grey Friar. To the north of this ridge are long slopes leading down to the Duddon at Wrynose Bottom.|$|E
