5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>pervasive</b> {{developmental}} disorder, Asperger {{syndrome is}} distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{is one of}} the Ojibwe dialects {{that has}} {{undergone}} the most language change, although it shares many features with other dialects. The most distinctive change is <b>a</b> <b>pervasive</b> pattern of vowel syncope that deletes short vowels in many words, resulting in significant changes in their pronunciation. This and other innovations in pronunciation, in addition to changes in word structure and vocabulary, differentiate Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe.|$|E

5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of <b>a</b> <b>pervasive</b> personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive individual, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the working class, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an authoritarian regime responsible for political repression and mass killings.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and what he saw as <b>a</b> <b>pervasive</b> militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to be among the most pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E

We combine the ME- RODE modeling methodology with the ReWiRe framework for creating interactive pervasive applications that can cope with changing environ- ments. The core of our approach is a consistent environment model, which is essen- tial to create (re) configurable context-aware pervasive applications. We aggregate different ontologies that provide the requi- red semantics to describe almost any target environment. We present a case study that shows <b>a</b> interactive <b>pervasive</b> application for media access that incorporates parental control on media content and can mi- grate between devices.

This process can rapidly become costly and time-consuming when the target environment involves many entities. In this demonstration, we present DiaSim, <b>a</b> simulator for <b>pervasive</b> computing applications.

5|$|The {{dynamics}} of gender inequity are related with the ideological principles {{held by the}} ruling political regime. The imperial era was dominated by the social paradigm of Confucianism, which was <b>a</b> <b>pervasive</b> philosophy throughout the Orient. Confucian ideals emphasized morality, character, social relationship, and the status quo. Confucius preached jen (humanity) and the equality and educability of all people; Neo-Confucianists and Imperial leaders used his beliefs in social hierarchy, particularly in the family setting, for the physical and social oppression of women. As the Chinese government began to re-assimilate themselves into the global community in the late 19th to early 20th century, it shifted away from conventional Confucian ideals and women's role in society changed as well. After Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in 1949, a change in traditional gender roles came about. Mao's death {{marked the beginning of}} the current communist administration, and an influx of international communications in the areas of commerce, politics and social ideals. Since the 1980s, under the new communist party, the women's rights movement has gained momentum and has become a national issue as well as a sign of modernization.|$|E

40|$|Archived with {{permission}} of the Author. <b>As</b> <b>pervasive</b> gaming becomes more common, {{the question of what}} boundaries and rituals make up play attains greater importance. While commonly-held conceptions of play formulate it as delineated, rigid, structured, and characterized by a stringent set of symbolic boundaries, pervasive mobile games push at the walls of the demarcated magic circle and, in the process of seeking multiple theoretical transgressions, pose questions about the implication of players and non-players in games that can mask their status as such. This paper prods the ethics of transgressing the player/non-player divide through the analysis of several pervasive games and the design frameworks of their creators.

40|$|<b>As</b> <b>pervasive</b> {{computing}} {{is integrated}} incrementally with {{all facets of}} everyday life, {{it is reasonable to}} expect that its further proliferation may influence educational activities as well. Several such arguments have been thoroughly discussed in literature and several projects have been developed.

In this piece of work, a theoretical framework that puts the use of pervasive computing along with the special needs and requirements of Medical education utilising e-learning environments is proposed. To this extend likely problems and difficulties that may arise are discussed together with the social consequences that may be provoked...|$|R
