5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty.</b>|$|E

In preliminary research, yoga improved cognitive functioning. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found no evidence that yoga was effective for metabolic syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, a {{deputation}} led by Lord Shaftesbury {{was made}} to the Great Eastern Railway and Great Northern Railway, proposing that for trains due to arrive in central London prior to 8am, third class tickets should be sold at a fare of 3d providing the return journey was not made before 4pm. By May 1885 both railways had adopted this policy. However, the delays <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> caused by the fares dispute had discouraged prospective tenants, leaving large numbers of properties vacant and causing further building work to slow considerably.

5|$|New Jersey's {{first state}} {{constitution}} was adopted on July 2, 1776.

Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the moment. Its primary objective {{was to provide a}} basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy.

The German fleet came under intense fire from the British line, and Scheer sent Moltke, Von der Tann, Seydlitz, and Derfflinger at high speed towards the British fleet, in an attempt to disrupt their formation and gain time for his main force to retreat. By 20:17, the German battlecruisers had closed to within 7,700yards (7,040m) of , at which point Scheer directed the ships to engage the lead ship of the British line.

5|$|Most Indonesians {{lived in}} fear <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> {{particularly}} {{a significant proportion}} of the population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all sales to the Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term kedaulatan rakyat ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') – which is mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution and used by pemuda to demand pro-active policies from leaders – came to be used not only in the demanding of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery. Chinese merchants, in particular, were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{fault-tolerant}} control (FTC) problem for a class of linear time-invariant systems with time-varying actuator faults <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> For more general consideration, the faults <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are supposed {{to depend on the}} states of systems and unknown constant bounds. For the sake of eliminating the effects of such state-dependent faults <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> automatically, a switching control strategy which is formulated by a sign function is designed to configure controller based on system’s states. And some adjustable control parameters are updated via designing adaptive laws. Based on the information from switching function and the adaptive estimation mechanism, the robust adaptive controllers are constructed to compensate for the effects of faults <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> Through Lyapunov functions and adaptive schemes, the asymptotic stability of the resulting adaptive FTC uncertain system can be achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed design is illustrated via a rocket fairing structural-acoustic model...|$|R

5|$|The continual warring {{with the}} Cholas {{exhausted}} both empires, giving their subordinates {{the opportunity to}} rebel. In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command. The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other. By the time of Jagadhekamalla II, the Chalukyas had lost control of Vengi and his successor, Tailapa III, was defeated by the Kakatiya king Prola in 1149. Tailapa III was taken captive and later released bringing down {{the prestige of the}} Western Chalukyas. Seeing decadence <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> seeping into Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and Seunas also encroached upon the empire. Hoysala Narasimha I defeated and killed Tailapa III but was unable to overcome the Kalachuris who were vying for control of the same region. In 1157 the Kalachuris of Kalyanis under Bijjala II captured Kalyani and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their capital to Annigeri in the present day Dharwad district.|$|E
5|$|The {{sudden death}} of George Terter II had been {{followed}} by {{a brief period of}} confusion <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> which was exploited by the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. The Byzantines overran northeastern Thrace and captured a number of important cities including Yambol, Lardea, Ktenia, Rusokastro, Anchialus, Sozopol and Agatopol. At the same time, a Byzantine-sponsored pretender, Voysil, brother of the former Bulgarian emperor Smilets (r. 1292-1298), ensconced himself in Krăn, controlling the valleys between the Balkan mountains and Sredna Gora from Sliven to Kopsis. At this point the newly elected Michael Shishman marched south against Andronikos III, while another Byzantine army led by Andronikos III himself was besieging Philippopolis (Plovdiv). Defended by a Bulgarian garrison led by Ivan the Russian, the siege was a failure despite the Byzantines use of a 100-soldier, five-story siege tower. While the Byzantine army was engaged at Philipopolis, Michael Shishman led his troops to north-eastern Thrace and quickly retook the lost cities thus forcing the Byzantines to pull back.|$|E

Recovery plans need to consider both biologic and economic consequences in order to reduce <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> to ensure successful implementation of the plan. Risk communication is also valuable in the process, since it gives transparency of the objectives and means to meet these objectives, elucidates crucial information from stakeholders and legitimates the whole process of designing and implementing the recovery plans, which is essential for the success of these plans. To that end the plans should be as simply and realistic as possible. It is recommended to apply risk analysis and to use the precautionary principle only in cases where large uncertainties cannot be resolved. Two fisheries rebuilding plans are analysed and how they address risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are evaluated...|$|R
