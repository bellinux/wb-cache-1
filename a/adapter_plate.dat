50|$|The European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) was a payload {{mounted on}} the {{exterior}} of the European Columbus laboratory, one of the modules of the International Space Station. The facility, mounted onto the exterior of Columbus, provided a platform for multiple types of experiments and materials to be exposed directly to the harsh space environment.The EuTEF is a programmable, multifunctional architecture that provides uniform interfaces for instruments. Nine instrument modules are accommodated and operated simultaneously. Each experiment is {{mounted on the}} Columbus External Payload Adapter (CEPA), which consists of an <b>adapter</b> <b>plate,</b> the Active Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism (A-FRAM) and the connectors & harness. The experiments are mounted either directly onto the <b>adapter</b> <b>plate</b> or a support structure that elevates them for optimum exposure to the ram (direction of flight) and zenith directions.|$|E

50|$|The P100 {{was longer}} than the {{corresponding}} Cortina and Sierra models, and had a higher ride height due to having a multi leaf spring suspension in the rear and larger five-stud wheels all round. The hub design on the Cortina was a SA specific pattern and actually a Rover PCD, hence Rover SD1 alloys and steel wheels fit. The later Sierra front hubs were from the Granada with <b>adapter</b> <b>plates</b> to allow fitment of the heavier duty Ford Transit wheel. Its rear axle was lifted directly from the SWB Transit 80, hence {{the need for the}} front adapters to match.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{variation}} is called flex track or monorail track lighting {{in which the}} fixtures are hung from a single line monorail track attached to the ceiling using stems. There are several different types of track. Some are very flexible and can be curved in any shape or form and some are more rigid and can be curved very slightly. Some patterns {{that can be made}} are [...] "S curves" [...] or [...] "spirals". Various adapters are available for combining features of track and other lighting. There are [...] "L" [...] and [...] "T" [...] adapters for rigid track, as well as flexible ones for unusual angles, or to change the vertical angle where a ceiling changes slope. <b>Adapter</b> <b>plates</b> allow single fixtures to be attached directly to a junction box, by providing an extremely small section of track embedded into the plate.

40|$|In November 2016, Spaceflight, in {{partnership}} with SpaceX, is scheduled to set a new world record for the most number of free-flying spacecraft deployed from a single launch with eighty-nine spacecraft deployed during the FORMOSAT- 5 /SHERPA mission. This paper describes how this record was accomplished and key lessons learned. Spaceflight is a world leader {{in the development of}} commercial rideshare opportunities for the small satellite industry. Success on this mission required both technical and business innovations to include design and development of SHERPA, a custom ESPA Grande ring with custom payload adapters and dispenser systems, designed for manifesting multiple secondary payloads and hosting secondary payloads. <b>Adapter</b> <b>plates</b> designed for SHERPA enable either one or two microsats, or up to seven Innovative Solutions in Space (ISIS) QuadPack dispensers to be deployed from a single port. SHERPA carries a deployment sequencer to send separation commands to separation systems, and a data recorder and UHF transmitter to capture and send deployment state information to a ground receiver at Wallops Island, VA.

40|$|Machine integrators and PC {{builders}} {{require a}} great deal of flexibility and durability when assembling electronic components. The aim of this project was to design a universal ATX computer case that could accommodate any motherboard and processor combination available on the market. It also had to be isolated from the outside air, as to be used in dirty or industrial applications where durability is required. This case design maintains low cost and high flexibility by dissipating high amounts of heat using natural convection {{on the outside of the}} case and forced convection on the inside of the case. It is designed to dissipate a total of 250 W through a large heat exchanger and 27 W through a smaller one dedicated to dissipating heat from the hard disk. A universal CPU cooler uses pin fins with forced convection an custom <b>adapter</b> <b>plates</b> to mate with a variety of CPU processors. It is capable of dissipating 162 W, more than any CPU on the market needs. This is all accomplished without exceeding any surface temperature limit of any of the major electronic components in the case can operate in ambient air temperatures of 40 C. by Edward K. Summers.

50|$|The term {{may also}} be used to define {{replacement}} criteria for other components available from multiple sources. For example, a plug-compatible cooling fan may need to have not only the same physical size and shape, but also similar capability, run from the same voltage, use similar power, attach with a standard electrical connector, and have similar mounting arrangements. Some non-conforming units may be re-packaged or modified to meet plug-compatible requirements, as where an <b>adapter</b> <b>plate</b> is provided for mounting, or a different tool and instructions are supplied for installation, and these modifications would be reflected in the bill of materials for such components. Similar issues arise for computer system interfaces when competitors wish to offer an easy upgrade path.|$|E
5000|$|Upper {{and lower}} {{receiver}}s: The lower receiver {{is a standard}} M4A1 lower receiver sometimes modified {{with the addition of}} a CQD RSM sling <b>adapter</b> <b>plate.</b> However, many CQBR rifles also use surplus M16A1 lower receivers. Internally, the CQBR also takes advantage of a larger gas port and modified bolt carrier and buffer assembly. The gas port has been opened to 0.070 in (1.8 mm). A number of Lewis Machine & Tool 10.5" [...] (266.7 mm) upper receivers have also been reported to have been purchased for the CQBR program.
