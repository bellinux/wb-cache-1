Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> <b>that</b> she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

There were only a maximum of 13 Jesuit priest at any given time in the building, but they also hosted Jesuit brothers and secular students.

But the actress was eager to return for the show's second season. But during the second season the role was expanded which surprised Rosenblat.

500|$|Final Fantasy VIII {{received}} critical acclaim. Within {{two days}} of its North American release on September 9, 1999, Final Fantasy VIII became the top-selling video game in the United States, a position it held {{for more than three}} weeks. It was also a bestseller in Japan and the UK. It grossed a total of more than $50million in the 13 weeks to follow, making it the fastest-selling Final Fantasy title. In Japan, it sold roughly 2.5million units within the first four days of release. More than 6million units were sold in total by the end of 1999. As of March 31, 2003, the game had shipped 8.15million copies worldwide: 3.7million in Japan and 4.45million abroad.

500|$|While {{writing the}} lyrics to Lightning Bolt, Vedder tried to be less cryptic in expressing his {{feelings}} compared to the [...] "word games" [...] of previous Pearl Jam albums. The songs discuss lasting relationships, bad faith ("Getaway," [...] "Mind Your Manners"), {{the state of the}} world ("Infallible") and life's transience ("Pendulum"), which Vedder summed up as [...] "the same mysteries that I’ve been trying to unravel for a few decades now." [...] Gossard explained that the reflective tone was indicative of the bandmembers' age: [...] " [...] 40-something, almost 50-something, you're looking at life through your kids' eyes, through the filter of relationships that are 20 or 30 years long, through the filter of your parents getting older and the passing of friends and relatives-relationships and all that they encompass, the difficulties of them and the sacrifices you make in them and also the joy they bring you." [...] Vedder at first was afraid of writing songs about mortality, but relented given he felt that [...] "death is everywhere" [...] and writing about death would help [...] "getting through it", as [...] "living to the day you die, and being cognizant of the end, you might lead a more appreciative life". One of the compositions about the theme was [...] "Future Days", which discusses the loss of Vedder's friend Dennis Flemion, who accidentally drowned in 2012. The concernment in the songs also owed to Vedder being a father, as the singer detailed that [...] "It’s going to be their world and what is their future? It feels like there is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> can be lost in the next 50 years if people don’t pay attention." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1903, Howard Carter had {{discovered}} a tomb (KV60) in the Valley of the Kings that contained two female mummies, one identified as Hatshepsut's wetnurse, and the other unidentified. In the spring of 2007, the unidentified body was finally removed from the tomb by Dr. Zahi Hawass and brought to Cairo's Egyptian Museum for testing. This mummy was missing a tooth, and the space in the jaw perfectly matched Hatshepsut's existing molar, found in the DB320 [...] "canopic box".

As {{in the course of the}} Persian Constitutional Revolution nearly a century earlier, the concept of justice was at the center of the ideological debates among the followers of the three Islamic orientations during and after the revolution. The conservatives (principalists) adhered to the traditional notion of Islamic justice, one which, much like the Aristotelian idea of justice, states that [...] "equals should be treated alike, but unequals proportionately to their relevant differences, and all with impartiality." [...] Neoprincipalists, on the other hand, gave a messianic interpretation to the concept, one that promised equal distribution of societal resources to all—including the [...] "unequals." [...] And finally, those with a liberal orientation to Islam understood the notion of justice in terms of the French revolutionary slogan of egalité, i.e., the equality of all before the law.|$|E

2500|$|After Stokowski's death, Tom Burnam writes, the [...] "concatenization of canards" [...] {{that had}} arisen around him was revived {{that his name}} and accent were phony; that his musical {{education}} was deficient; that his musicians did not respect him; that he cared about nobody but himself. Burnam suggests {{that there was a}} dark, hidden reason for these rumours. Stokowski deplored the segregation of symphony orchestras in which women and minorities were excluded, and, so Burnam claims, his detractors got revenge by slandering Stokowski. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding the claims made by Tom Burnam, attitudes towards Stokowski have changed dramatically over the years since his death. In 1999, for Gramophone magazine, the noted music commentator David Mellor wrote: [...] "One of the great joys of recent years for me has been the reassessment of Leopold Stokowski. When I was growing up there was a tendency to disparage the old man as a charlatan. Today it is all very different. Stokowski is now recognised as the father of modern orchestral standards. He possessed a truly magical gift of extracting a burnished sound from both great and second-rank ensembles. He also loved the process of recording and his gramophone career was a constant quest for better recorded sound. But the greatest pleasure of all for me is his acceptance now as an outstanding conductor of nineteenth- and twentieth-century music, including <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> was {{at the cutting edge of}} contemporary achievement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Clare {{showing a}} more [...] "vulnerable" [...] {{side in the}} weeks prior to her departure, in episodes that aired in July 2008, Bradley {{discovered}} her original plan to manipulate money from himself and other men in Walford, and subsequently shunned her, leaving Clare [...] "feeling isolated and unwanted by her closest friends and family".

Kris Green from Digital Spy has suggested that the programme [...] "only really ever scratched the surface with [...] " [...] and that there was still <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>that</b> was undiscovered about the character, which Bissix has agreed with. She comments, [...] "This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head. Someone like Clare doesn't stick around Walford unless there's a reason. I like to believe in what I do and believe in my characters. I'm not going to stay in a job for no reason. Clare would definitely leave in this situation." [...] After one last [...] "huge row" [...] with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008.
