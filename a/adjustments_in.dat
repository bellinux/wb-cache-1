5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected <b>adjustments</b> <b>in</b> the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe Aristotle Basic Complexity {{score and}} the Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery system were {{developed}} by consensus to compare outcomes of congenital cardiac surgery. We compared the predictive value of the 2 systems. MethodsOf all index congenital cardiac operations at our institution from 1982 to 2004 (n = 13, 675), {{we were able to}} assign an Aristotle Basic Complexity score, a Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery score, and both scores to 13, 138 (96 %), 11, 533 (84 %), and 11, 438 (84 %) operations, respectively. Models of in-hospital mortality and length of stay were generated for Aristotle Basic Complexity and Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery using an identical data set in which both Aristotle Basic Complexity and Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery scores were assigned. The likelihood ratio test for nested models and paired concordance statistics were used. ResultsAfter adjustment for year of operation, the odds ratios for Aristotle Basic Complexity score 3 versus 6, 9 versus 6, 12 versus 6, and 15 versus 6 were 0. 29, 2. 22, 7. 62, and 26. 54 (P <. 0001). Similarly, odds ratios for Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery categories 1 versus 2, 3 versus 2, 4 versus 2, and 5 / 6 versus 2 were 0. 23, 1. 98, 5. 80, and 20. 71 (P <. 0001). Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery added significant predictive value over Aristotle Basic Complexity (likelihood ratio χ 2 = 162, P <. 0001), whereas Aristotle Basic Complexity contributed much less predictive value over Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery (likelihood ratio χ 2 = 13. 4, P =. 009). Neither system fully adjusted for the child’s age. The Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery scores were more concordant with length of stay compared with Aristotle Basic Complexity scores (P <. 0001). ConclusionsThe predictive value of Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery is higher than that of Aristotle Basic Complexity. The use of Aristotle Basic Complexity or Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery as risk stratification and trending tools to monitor outcomes over time and to guide risk-adjusted comparisons may be valuable...|$|R
5|$|Following Mary's childless death, her {{half-sister}} Elizabeth {{inherited the}} throne. One {{of the most}} important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was religion. Elizabeth could not be Roman Catholic, as that church considered her illegitimate. At the same time, she had observed the turmoil brought about by Edward's introduction of radical Protestant reforms. Communion with the Roman Catholic Church was again severed by Elizabeth. She relied primarily on her chief advisors, Sir William Cecil, as her Secretary of State, and Sir Nicholas Bacon, as the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, for direction on the matter. Chiefly she supported her father's idea of reforming the church but made some minor <b>adjustments.</b> <b>In</b> this way, Elizabeth and her advisors aimed at a church that included most opinions.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate <b>adjustments,</b> <b>in</b> order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed an unfair advantage and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions at the time of a jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E

The well-fortified city was able to withstand a general onslaught followed by a ten-month encirclement by an overwhelming force led by Mikhail Shein. At that time a Commonwealth rescue expedition of comparable strength arrived, under the highly effective military command of Władysław IV. After months of fierce fighting, in February 1634 Shein capitulated. The Treaty of Polyanovka confirmed the Deulino territorial arrangements with small <b>adjustments</b> <b>in</b> favor of the Tsardom. Władysław had relinquished, upon monetary compensation, his claims to the Russian throne.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning <b>adjustments</b> <b>in</b> the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
5|$|France, {{friendly}} towards both Russia and Austria, {{suggested a}} series of territorial <b>adjustments,</b> <b>in</b> which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia, and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) {{and parts of the}} Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony. King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia, gained recently in the Silesian Wars. He was, however, also interested in finding a peaceful solution– his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria, and the Seven Years' War had left Prussia's treasury and army weakened. He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be advantageously utilized {{in the event of a}} Prussian war either with Russia or Austria. Frederick's brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg. As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 (violating the Treaty of Lubowla), Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal, the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria, Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power, Austria. Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans. Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter-proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to Austria, but this plan was rejected by Frederick.|$|E
