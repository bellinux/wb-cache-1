5|$|The City of Ashland {{moved to}} improve local {{broadband}} Internet <b>access</b> <b>in</b> the late 1990s by creating the Ashland Fiber Network (AFN) {{and building a}} fiber optic ring inside the city boundaries. However, by 2006 the city faced difficulties servicing AFN's debt load, which was approaching $15.5million. The city hired a new AFN director, Joe Franell, who suggested scrapping cable television service while retaining the more profitable high-speed Internet <b>access.</b> <b>In</b> October 2006, the cable television service was transferred to a local company, Ashland Home Net, while the City retained both the infrastructure and the wholesale Internet business.|$|E

Using a broad definition of access, based on the WHO definition of an improved water source, <b>access</b> <b>in</b> rural areas in Colombia was 71%, while it was 81% in Honduras - a considerably poorer country - and 89% in Ecuador, also a poorer country than Colombia.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested <b>access</b> <b>in</b> November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA). The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E

Paul's 25-year-old son, Rand Paul {{who served as the}} aide-de-camp, was interviewed and explained that Paul had raised $2 million, $500,000 of which was spent on ballot access. Paul had spent $40,000 a month on traveling expenses. Just prior to Election Day, Paul predicted a low voter turnout.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s the Department of the Environment {{assisted}} the Powis estate by lending government staff {{to repair the}} castle. Visitor numbers were falling, however, in part due the dilapidated condition of the property, and the estate became increasingly unable to afford to maintain the castle. After 1984, when {{the function of the}} department was taken over by English Heritage, a more systematic approach was put into place. This based around a partnership in which the Powis Estate would retain ownership of the castle and develop visitor <b>access,</b> <b>in</b> exchange for a £500,000 contribution from English Heritage for a jointly-funded programme of repairs and maintenance, delivered through specialist contractors. This included repairs to the parts of the curtain wall, which collapsed in 1990, and the redevelopment of the visitor's centre. Limited archaeological excavation was carried out in the outer bailey between 1992 and 1993 by the City of Hereford Archaeology Unit.|$|E

5|$|In 1988 Jarre {{released}} Revolutions. The album spans several genres, including symphonic industrial, Arabian inspired, light guitar pop {{and ethnic}} electro jazz. A two-hour concert called Destination Docklands was planned for September 1988, {{to be held}} at the Royal Victoria Dock in east London. Close to the heart of London, the location was chosen in part for its desolate environment, but also because Jarre thought the architecture was ideally suited for his music. Early in 1988 Jarre met with local officials and members of the community, but Newham Borough Council expressed their fears about the event's safety and delayed their decision on whether to allow the concert to proceed until 12 September eventually rejecting the licence application. The local fire service were also concerned about <b>access</b> <b>in</b> the event of a fire. Site work continued as Jarre's team searched for alternative locations in which to stage the concert, but following improvements to both on and off-site safety Jarre eventually won conditional approval on 28 September to stage two separate performances, on the 8 and 9 October.|$|E
