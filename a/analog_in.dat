5|$|Marking {{the heart}} of the serpent is the constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Serpentis. Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a red giant of spectral type K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a visual magnitude of 2.630 ± 0.009, meaning it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star, although it is not visible to the naked eye. Situated near Alpha is Lambda Serpentis, a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away. Another solar <b>analog</b> <b>in</b> Serpens is the primary of Psi Serpentis, a binary star located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs.|$|E
5|$|Most useful ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP <b>analog</b> <b>in</b> which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.|$|E

25|$|Latin jazz is {{the term}} used to {{describe}} jazz which employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood {{to have a more}} specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. A more precise term might be Afro-Latin jazz, as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct <b>analog</b> <b>in</b> Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of Latin jazz are Afro-Cuban jazz and Brazilian jazz.|$|E
25|$|Signal {{processing}} {{deals with}} the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals can be either <b>analog,</b> <b>in</b> which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or digital, {{in which case the}} signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{terrestrial}} television (DTTV or DTT) is a technological evolution of broadcast television and an advancement over analog television. DTTV broadcasts land-based (terrestrial) signals. The advantages of digital {{terrestrial television}} are similar to digital versus <b>analog</b> <b>in</b> platforms such as cable, satellite, and all telecommunications: the efficient use of spectrum and provision of more capacity than analog, better quality images, and lower operating costs for broadcast and transmission (after the initial upgrade costs). A terrestrial implementation of digital television (DTV) technology uses an aerial to broadcast to a conventional television antenna (or aerial) instead of a satellite dish or cable television connection.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have studied}} demand in rats {{in a manner}} {{distinct}} from studying labor supply in pigeons. Specifically, in an operant conditioning chamber containing rats as experimental subjects, we require them to press a bar, instead of pecking a small disk, to receive a reward. The reward can be food (reward pellets), water, or a commodity drink such as cherry cola. Unlike in previous pigeon studies, where the work analog was pecking and the monetary analog was reward, the work <b>analog</b> <b>in</b> this experiment is bar-pressing. Under these circumstances, the researchers claim that changing the number of bar presses required to obtain a commodity item is analogous to changing {{the price of a}} commodity item in human economics.|$|E
25|$|Notes: 1) The {{story has}} some {{parallels}} to {{the legend of}} John Henry. 2) In this story it is learned that England's American colonies broke off into a new nation - the Federated Commonwealths of America - in 1738, and westward expansion began much sooner than in our history, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous humans in the regions to be colonized. 3) The character Trevithick is American rather than British, and appears to be 20 years older than his historic age, so he is probably not the historical figure but an <b>analog.</b> <b>In</b> Turtledove works, it is common for historic figures to have fictitious offspring (as with Edward Wingfield's daughter and her own great-grandson Thomas Kenton above) as a result of the butterfly effect.|$|E
25|$|Samovar {{culture has}} an <b>analog</b> <b>in</b> Iran and is {{maintained}} by expatriates around the world. In Iran, samovars {{have been used}} for at least two centuries (roughly since the era of close political and ethnic contact between Russia and Iran started), and electrical, oil-burning or natural gas-consuming samovars are still common. Samovar is pronounced samăvar in Persian. Iranian craftsmen used Persian art motifs in their samovar production. The Iranian city of Borujerd has been the main centre of samovar production and a few workshops still produce hand-made samovars. Borujerd's samovars are often made with German silver, in keeping with the famous Varsho-Sazi artistic style. The art samovars of Borujerd are often displayed in Iranian and Western museums as illustrations of Iranian art and handicraft.|$|E

25|$|Clinically, {{thalidomide}} {{has always}} {{been used as a}} racemate. Generally the S-isomer is associated with the infamous teratogenic effects of thalidomide and the R-isomer is devoid of the teratogenic properties but conveys the sedative effects, however this view is highly debated and {{it has been argued that}} the animal model that these different R- and S-effects were seen in was not sensitive to the thalidomide teratogenic effects. Later reports in rabbits, which is a sensitive species, unveiled teratogenic effects from both isomers. Moreover, thalidomide enantiomers have been shown to be interconversed in vivo due to the acidic chiral hydrogen in the asymmetric center (shown, for the EM-12 <b>analog,</b> <b>in</b> Figure 3), so the plan to administer a purified single enantiomer to avoid the teratogenic effects will most likely be in vain.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "divide and conquer" [...] is {{sometimes}} applied to algorithms that reduce each problem {{to only one}} sub-problem, such as the binary search algorithm for finding a record in a sorted list (or its <b>analog</b> <b>in</b> numerical computing, the bisection algorithm for root finding). [...] These algorithms can be implemented more efficiently than general divide-and-conquer algorithms; in particular, if they use tail recursion, they can be converted into simple loops.

[...] Therefore, some authors consider that the name [...] "divide and conquer" [...] should be used only when each problem may generate two or more subproblems.
