5|$|On 12 August 1978, Vulcan B.2 XL390 of No. 617 Squadron crashed {{during an}} air display at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois in the United States. The crew had been {{authorised}} {{to carry out}} a display at Chicago Lakeside airport, the captain had elected {{to carry out a}}n unauthorised display at Glenview beforehand. After <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> run, probably below , the aircraft pulled up for an improperly executed wingover, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> stall and crash, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 30. It almost immediately displayed signs of tropical cyclone formation with the development of deep convection and curved rainbands. Organization continued, and late on August 30 Dvorak classifications began on the system. On August 31, after passing well south of the Cape Verde islands, the system stopped its organization trend. Convection became sporadic, and the system became poorly organized as it moved westward at 20mph (32km). However, environmental conditions remained favorable. On September 1, the cloud pattern became better organized, and <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> circulation quickly developed. Following an increase in convection and conformation of <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> circulation by a buoy, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Six late on September 1 while located 1,600miles (2,590km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> mesocyclone. Barring <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> boundary, tornadogenesis is highly {{unlikely}} unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E

After the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a mini-high platform was added between 1990 and 1992.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on November5. It tracked steadily west across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Its forward motion slowed after it passed the Lesser Antilles on November12. A large well-defined anticyclone persisted across much of the Caribbean Sea, providing a favorable environment for the system. <b>A</b> <b>low-level</b> circulation gradually became evident on satellite imagery within the disturbance. Based on ship observations, the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system organized into a tropical depression on November17, about 280miles (450km) south of the western tip of Haiti.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{cloudiness}} and rainshowers developed {{several hundred}} miles east-southeast of Bermuda on August 25, likely {{in association with}} <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> disturbance that formed along a cold front. For several days, it moved southwestward, and, while located on the southwestern end of an upper-level trough {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico, deep convection throughout the system increased. The system tracked westward, and initially remained disorganized while surface pressures remained high. The system turned to a northwest drift, and began to slowly organize on August 30 while located a few hundred miles northeast of the Bahamas. A broad low-pressure area developed on August 31 though convection remained disorganized as winds of 20 to 25mph (32 to 40km/h) were reported in squalls. Conditions remained favorable for continued organization, and convection increased and persisted across the system. The system developed into Tropical Depression Five on September 1 after developing <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> circulation while located about 140miles (225km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E

5|$|On August 22, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa, and it moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without developing significantly. On September 1 the wave axis entered the Gulf of Mexico, and upon doing so convection steadily organized around <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> center of circulation. The system moved northward and developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 3 while located about 300miles (480kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida. Embedded within a slow mid-latitude trough, the depression moved eastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri on September 5.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1970, a large {{disturbance}} {{separated from}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. Others believe that the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a tropical wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on July 9.|$|E
5|$|On May21, 2006, a {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered the}} East Pacific. The wave drifted westward, and after several days began to interact with <b>a</b> <b>low-level</b> trough near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, {{and as a result}} deep convection increased. By May25, a large area of low pressure formed several hundred miles south of Acapulco, Mexico. Wind shear inhibited development initially, though conditions became slightly more favorable after a number of days, and at 0600UTC on May27, {{a tropical}} depression formed about 190mi (305km) south of Acapulco.|$|E
