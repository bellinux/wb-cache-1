30|$|One of {{the first}} {{techniques}} used for pore modulation during the anodization was pulse anodization [24 – 26]. This technique consisted in combining mild and hard anodization regimes by means of step voltage variations. This allowed great changes in the pore diameter along the pore axis, but {{despite the fact that}} no optical characterization was performed, the combination of mild and hard anodization regimes would result in abrupt refractive index variations which are incompatible with the development of rugate filters. Another technique is cyclic <b>anodization.</b> This <b>method</b> was used to fabricate DBRs by applying a periodic voltage which resulted in well-defined layers with branched pores [27 – 29].

30|$|Self-ordered and prepatterned guided growths are {{two kinds}} of {{anodization}} technology, which are competing in the aspects of product quality and production cost. For prepatterned guided <b>anodization,</b> imprinting <b>methods</b> have been used by several author groups to prepare ordered AAO, wherein nanoindentations are created by transferring patterns from hard master stamp onto the Al surface under a high pressure (5 - 25 kN cm- 2) before anodization [8 – 10]. Despite the ideally ordered patterns obtained, this method is limited by the pattern transfer protocol, and pattern transferred by imprint lithography directly onto metallic substrates such as Al foils or Al films requires 50 - 2000 times higher pressures in comparison with imprint lithography on polymer layers [11]. The applied pressure for pattern transfer tends to crack the substrates underneath the Al films, such as silicon and glass with brittle property, and leads to substrate fracture. Otherwise, damage to the imprint stamp often occurs after several runs of imprinting because of the high mechanical stresses.|$|R

30|$|Three {{different}} kinds of titania nanotubes are synthesized with different crystal structure and morphology by using chemical processing and rapid breakdown <b>anodization</b> <b>methods.</b> Based on the measurement results at room temperature, the thermal conductivity of the titania nanotubes is considerably lower {{as compared to the}} bulk titania. Titania (TNTA) nanotubes are single-walled with one end opened and other closed, and they have anatase structure and a wall thickness of 7 – 12  nm. The thermal conductivity of these nanotubes estimated by an effective model of thermal conductivity is 1.07  W m− 1  K− 1. The amorphous nanotubes (TNTAmor) with a wall thickness of 15 – 30  nm have a thermal conductivity of 0.98  W m− 1  K− 1. Their thermal conductivity is slightly lower than that of crystalline anatase nanotubes (TNTA). However, the multiwalled and open-ended nanotubes (TNTA,T) with a mixed crystal structure and a wall thickness of 4 – 5  nm have the lowest thermal conductivity of 0.75  W m− 1  K− 1. This low value of thermal conductivity is due to the reduced dimensions of walls approaching the calculated 2.5 -nm phonon mean free path. The reduction in the wall thickness is found to result in overall suppression of the thermal conductivity as the phonon confinement is enhanced and the phonon boundary scattering increased. The size confinement effects of phonon transport with different surface-related parameters for both crystalline and amorphous nanotubes are considered. Generally, the thermal conductivity of amorphous oxides is found independent of the size. Comparison of the present result on the amorphous nanotubes with those in the literature, however, suggests also size-dependent reduction in the thermal conductivity of the amorphous nanotubes. This {{may be due to the}} possible contribution of propagons in the overall thermal transport in disordered structure along with the diffusons. For TNTA,T, the thermal conductivity value agrees well with the surface roughness factor of 0.26, while in the case of TNTA nanotubes, it matches with 0.18 confirming the different surface roughness of the two kinds of crystalline nanotubes related to the synthesis processes. TNTAmor surface roughness (1.5  nm) estimated from TEM micrographs is in line with the calculated surface roughness factor of 0.65.|$|R

The ZnO NW arrays produced by anodization have been applied as working electrodes in back-illuminated DSSCs, linking cell performance to NW structural characteristics and anodization conditions.

30|$|Titania {{nanotubes}} (TNTs) {{with different}} morphology and crystal structure are prepared by chemical processing and rapid breakdown <b>anodization</b> (RBA) <b>methods.</b> The nanotubes are studied {{in terms of}} thermal conductivity. The TNTs with variable wall thickness below 30  nm have significantly reduced thermal conductivity than bulk titania, due to the phonon confinement, smaller phonon mean free path, and enhanced phonon boundary scattering. The amorphous nanotubes (TNTAmor) have comparatively thicker walls than both crystalline nanotubes. The TNTAmor has a thermal conductivity of 0.98  W m− 1  K− 1, which is slightly less than the thermal conductivity of crystalline anatase nanotubes (TNTA; 1.07  W m− 1  K− 1). However, the titania nanotubes with mixed structure (TNTA,T) and the smallest dimensions have the lowest thermal conductivity of 0.75  W m− 1  K− 1, {{probably due to the}} phonon confinement. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical study considering the size confinement effect with different wall dimensions of TNTs and surface scattering. The results agree well with the surface roughness factor (p) of 0.26 for TNTA,T, 0.18 for TNTA, and 0.65 for TNTAmor, indicating diffusive phonon scattering and rougher surfaces for TNTA. Interestingly, the present results together with those presented in literature suggest that thermal conductivity reduction with respect to the wall thickness occurs also for the amorphous nanotubes. This is ascribed to the role of propagons in the thermal transport of disordered structures.|$|R

30|$|The <b>anodization</b> <b>method</b> {{is one of}} the {{effective}} ways to synthesize ordered alignment and aspect radio TiO 2 nanotubes as shown in Fig.  1 c [35]. The anodic Ti foil dissolve (metal corrosion or electropolishing) to Ti metal cation under the action of electrolyte and electric field. On the one hand, the produced Ti metal cation reacts with the O 2 − (produced by water electrolysis) and forms a TiO 2 oxidation film on the surface of Ti foil, resulting in the increase of resistance. Therefore, the formation rate of TiO 2 oxidation film decreases. On the other side, the produced TiO 2 oxidation film is dissolved by the electrolyte. Under the combined action of formation and dissolution, nanotube arrays synthesize on the surface of Ti foil. The nanotube morphology depends on many influence factors: applied voltage, electrolyte composition, and pH value. In 2000, Grimes et al. presented that an aligned and organized TiO 2 with an average tube diameter from 25 to 65  nm nanotubes fabricated by <b>anodization</b> <b>method</b> [36]. In addition, Grimes reviewed the fabrication, properties of highly ordered TiO 2 nanotube arrays made by anodic oxidation of titanium in fluoride-based electrolytes [37].

The produced oxides also have greater layer thicknesses and interpore distance, and with a uniform nanopore spatial order (> 1000).

30|$|Nanoporous alumina {{which was}} {{produced}} by a conventional direct current anodization [DCA] process at low temperatures has received much attention in various applications such as nanomaterial synthesis, sensors, and photonics. In this article, we employed a newly developed hybrid pulse <b>anodization</b> [HPA] <b>method</b> to fabricate the nanoporous alumina on a flat and curved surface of an aluminum [Al] foil at room temperature [RT]. We fabricate the nanopores to grow on a hemisphere curved surface and characterize their behavior along the normal vectors of the hemisphere curve. In a conventional DCA approach, the structures of branched nanopores were grown on a photolithography-and-etched low-curvature curved surface with large interpore distances. However, a high-curvature hemisphere curved surface {{can be obtained by}} the HPA technique. Such a curved surface by HPA is intrinsically induced by the high-resistivity impurities in the aluminum foil and leads to branching and bending of nanopore growth via the electric field mechanism rather than the interpore distance in conventional approaches. It is noted that by the HPA technique, the Joule heat during the RT process has been significantly suppressed globally on the material, and nanopores have been grown along the normal vectors of a hemisphere curve. The curvature is much larger than that in other literatures due to different fabrication methods. In theory, the number of nanopores on the hemisphere surface is two times of the conventional flat plane, which is potentially useful for photocatalyst or other applications.|$|R
