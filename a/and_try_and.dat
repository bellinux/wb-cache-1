5|$|Written by David A. McIntee, {{this was}} a four-part Lovecraftian horror story set in Arkham, New England in 1927, {{although}} McIntee later began a rewrite to shift the action to Cornwall. The story involved alien bodysnatchers who could only inhabit {{the bodies of the}} dead. The villain of the piece would discover the remains of a Silurian god <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> clone itself a new body from the fossilized body.|$|E
5|$|In February 1872 Bruce {{proposed}} {{a bill that}} took some of the commission's recommendations, but widened the geographical scope from the 18 military centres to {{the whole of the}} UK. Although the LNA's initial stance was to accept some of the bill's clauses <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> change others, Josephine rejected it in its entirety and published The New Era, a 56-page pamphlet attacking the legislation; the pamphlet was re-published in serial form in The Shield. It was the first split in the repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance. The bill faced too much opposition from the parliamentary supporters of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and was withdrawn.|$|E

Summer asks what time The Jezabels are on stage and Andrew mentions that he wrote it down on his ticket, which is in his wallet inside Summer's bag.

500|$|Alienation was {{developed}} by Finnish video game company Housemarque and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released on April 26, 2016 exclusively on PlayStation4. The game, first hinted at in January 2014, was announced at the 2014 Sony Gamescom conference. In a question-and-answer article on the PlayStation Blog in April 2014, Mikael Haveri of Housemarque said that they are inspired for many of their games by other games. Haveri cited Dark Souls and Demon's Souls as examples, saying that they [...] "take a concept [...] like <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> improve it or put a twist on it". According to Haveri, Alienation would have content (such as better explosion mechanics) which players had not seen before. He noted the chance of references to other Housemarque games, similar to the incorporation of Resogun ships into Dead Nation.|$|E

They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> do work that means something to me." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} production, Hill collaborated {{with a group}} of musicians known as New Ark, {{consisting}} of Vada Nobles, Rasheem Pugh, Tejumold Newton, and Johari Newton. Hill later said that she wanted to [...] "write songs that lyrically move me and have the integrity of reggae and the knock of hip-hop and the instrumentation of classic soul" [...] and that the production on the album was intended to make the music sound raw and not computer-aided. Hill spoke of pressure from her label to emulate Prince, wherein all tracks would be credited as written and produced by the artist with little outside help. She also wanted to be appreciated as an auteur as much as Jean had within the Fugees. (She also saw a feminist cause: [...] "But step out <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> control things and there are doubts. This is a very sexist industry. They'll never throw the 'genius' title to a sister.") While recording the album, when Hill was asked about providing contracts or documentation to the musicians, she replied, [...] "We all love each other. This ain't about documents. This is blessed." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} plan for Escape from Woomera involved several choices in playable detainees, {{each with a}} different story about how they came to seek asylum in Australia. The game would have players [...] "battle the bureaucracy <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> survive day to day" [...] while working towards any of several escape strategies. As originally envisioned, players could attempt to escape through the legal channels, using lawyers and activists, or could attempt to flee by scaling fences or digging tunnels. The development team worked to create the most realistic depiction of the Woomera centre possible, despite the media not being allowed in the facility. The team utilised interviews with former detainees and activists, existing press reports, {{and a copy of}} the facility's floor plan obtained from a member of the Department of Immigration. Kate Wild, an investigative journalist hired by the development team to conduct research, was able to visit Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. She witnessed guards using spotlights and helicopters to keep detainees awake throughout the night, and police on horseback trampling over tents. Aside from Woomera and Baxter, Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre and Villawood Immigration Detention Centre were also used as influences. Details from the daily lives of detainees, such as their being referred to by number and communicating with the outside world through payphones, were incorporated into the game. Tasks that players had to complete, as well as the escape strategies themselves, were also based on the experiences of real detainees.|$|E
