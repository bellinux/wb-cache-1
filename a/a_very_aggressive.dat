5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a largely}} organic and uncalculated impulse, {{many of these}} new bands infused classic heavy metal with the immediacy of pub rock and the {{intensity}} of punk rock, implementing to various degrees the crossover of genres started by Motörhead; in general they shunned ballads, de-emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> sound based on riffs and power chords, featuring vocals ranging from high pitched wails to gruff and low growls. Iron Maiden, Angel Witch, Saxon, Holocaust, Tygers of Pan Tang, Girlschool, Tank and More are notable performers of this style, which bands such as Atomkraft, Jaguar, Raven and Venom stretched to produce even more extreme results. Critics consider this new approach to heavy metal the greatest musical accomplishment of the NWOBHM and an important evolutionary step for the genre.|$|E

25|$|O. bauri is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{species of}} ant. Once its nest is {{disturbed}} {{there are many}} worker ants performing the escape jump. If one lands on the intruder, then the workers immediately began stinging the prowler. Fortunately for the intruder, {{only a few of}} the workers in the nest will participate in stinging the intruder unlike ant species from the genus Solenopsis. The bites are not severe for humans, but they do produce an allergic reaction.|$|E
25|$|Nair is {{an example}} of a {{chemical}} hair removal product which also functions as a chemical exfoliant. It is done more frequently than waxing (once a week rather than once a month) since it only destroys hair partially below the skin, rather than destroying the entire root as with waxing. Using it weekly can substitute for a weekly exfoliant regime. It is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> chemical and cannot be used on the face so other exfoliants would need to be used on the face.|$|E

25|$|In metal, the lip and {{spur drill}} bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in a drill press. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges to take <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they {{have a tendency to}} punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Monomorium {{species is}} {{particularly}} successful. This fact is particularly curious {{because of the}} presence of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> ant family, Iridomyrmex, which is quite proficient at interference competition. Iridomyrmex ants are able to quickly seek out food sources and prevent other ant species from reaching them. However, unlike other ant species, Monomorium species, despite their unaggressive nature and small size, are able to thrive even in areas where Iridomyrmex dominates. This success can be attributed to their efficient foraging strategy, and their novel use of venom alkaloids, repellant chemical signals. With these two behaviors, Monomorium species can rapidly monopolize and defend food sources.|$|E
25|$|A {{great effort}} {{would have been}} needed by the England batsmen {{to put them in}} a {{position}} beyond defeat, and Milton and Bailey went to the wicket with a load on their shoulders. Benaud at once set <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a little deeper for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. I thought he was so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E

25|$|The S21 Deluxe-based Skyline Sport {{featured}} hand-built Michelotti {{bodies in}} stylish coupe and convertible versions. These cars used the 1.9L GB-4 engine from the S21D. While {{only a few}} hundred were built, Prince Motors had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> product placement group and they can be seen (along the company's mainstream models) in many Toho films of the early 1960s. The canted headlights reflected a similar appearance on the late 1950s through early 1960s Lincoln Continental, Buick, and Chrysler 300. The appearance is similar to the 1960s Lancia Flavia and Triumph Vitesse as Michelotti did contribute to Lancia vehicles during this time. Being the first sports-focused model, the Skyline Sport foreshadowed the Skyline GT-R sub-range.|$|E
25|$|Hobbs was {{immediately}} successful {{when he made}} his debut for Surrey, but his batting form went into decline in the rest of his first season. However, he established himself in the following seasons {{as one of the best}} and most promising professional batsmen in England. He was chosen to tour Australia with an England team in 1907–08, and retained his place in the team when England next played Test matches in 1909. While successful, it was not until Hobbs toured South Africa in 1909–10, where he established his dominance over the feared South African googly bowlers, that he established himself fully at Test level. By the time of his next series, in Australia in 1911–12, he was regarded by critics as the best batsman in the world and scored three centuries in the series. He maintained his position as the world's leading batsman until war broke out in 1914. Hobbs established a very effective opening partnership with Wilfred Rhodes at Test level, and another with Hayward for Surrey. By 1914, Hobbs was batting in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive,</b> attractive manner that he would never recapture again when his career resumed after the war.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 {{an affirmative}} action {{requirement}} {{was introduced to}} ensure {{that at least one}} third of each University's contingent must be female, unless the circumstances could be justified. This was prompted by the poor representation of female debaters at Australs. In 1990 only 8% of all speakers eligible to make the finals at Australasian championships were female, although women were over-represented as adjudicators. In 1991, the year before the introduction of the affirmative action requirement, the first women's meeting was held to discuss ways to combat the problem. At that time the participation rate had risen to 21%, with the introduction of a number of universities as first-time participants. Few women were represented in the finals, however. The intention behind the introduction of the rule was that it would encourage universities to promote debating to a large number of potential members and train their debaters before they attended Australs. It was also thought that this would encourage a greater diversity of speaking styles, rather than what was seen as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> style by a number of very successful and talented Australian male debaters, and this would benefit all debaters and universities.|$|E

40|$|Thyroid {{cancer is}} a {{malignant}} neoplasm originated from thyroid cells. It can be classified into papillary carcinomas (PTCs) and anaplastic carcinomas (ATCs). Although ATCs are in <b>an</b> <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> status and cause more death than PTCs, their difference is poorly understood at molecular level. In this study, {{we focus on the}} transcriptome difference among PTCs, ATCs and normal tissue from a published dataset including 45 normal tissues, 49 PTCs and 11 ATCs, by applying a machine learning method, maximum relevance minimum redundancy, and identified 9 genes (BCL 2, MRPS 31, ID 4, RASAL 2, DLG 2, MY 01 B, ZBTB 5, PRKCQ and PPP 6 C) and 1 miscRNA (miscellaneous RNA, LOC 646736) as important candidates involved in the progression of thyroid cancer. We further identified the protein-protein interaction (PPI) sub network from the shortest paths among the 9 genes in a PPI network constructed based on STRING database. Our results may provide insights to the molecular mechanism of the progression of thyroid cancer...|$|R

On the other hand, treatment of chronic infection {{may be necessary to}} reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronically infected individuals with persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, and HBV DNA levels are candidates for therapy. Treatment lasts from six months to a year, depending on medication and genotype. Treatment duration when medication is taken by mouth, however, is more variable and usually longer than one year.|$|E
