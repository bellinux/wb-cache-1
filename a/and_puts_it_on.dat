5|$|The {{following}} year, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College {{and made}} an associate dean, and he and Marion are married. Before the wedding party leaves the chapel, {{a gust of wind}} blows Indy's brown fedora off the coat rack and deposits it at Mutt's feet. Mutt picks it up and is about to don it before Jones snatches it from his hands <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> with a grin.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the waiting}} lounge, Tara {{approaches}} Shiv, believing {{him to be}} a doctor, and asks for his advice. He reveals that his wife had a stroke eight months ago while he was out watching a cricket match, and has been in a coma ever since. The two bond over their similar situations. Later, Girish drops Tara off at a hotel and gives her Rajat's bag. Tara finds his watch in it <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on.</b> The next day she is angered after reading an intimate message on Rajat's phone from a colleague Sheetal, who is later revealed to be a man. Shiv witnesses the whole misunderstanding, and the two share a light moment. He later visits her at the hotel, and she shares her disappointment with her friends and followers on social media for having abandoned her. She commends Shiv for his composure, as he explains the five stages of grief to her.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo {{from the}} tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. Aragorn leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan to march on the Black Gate to {{distract}} Sauron from his true danger. His army is vastly outnumbered by the great might of Sauron. Frodo and Sam reach {{the edge of the}} Cracks of Doom, but Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his finger. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. The Nazgûl perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.|$|E
25|$|Fergus {{is upset}} when he can't find any baby {{pictures}} {{of him in the}} family album. He storms off to the attic and goes through the mirror. Mandy finds a picture of him as a baby, <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the mirror for him to see. When Fergus comes back through the mirror it transforms him into the baby version of himself in the photograph. The children do {{not know what to do}} and send him back through where he is found by Violette. Constance tells the other that her mother found him and they try to get him back.

500|$|Despite {{having been}} {{impressed}} with the cast, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that [...] "Teen romance and operetta-style singing replace the horror elements familiar to film-goers, and director Joel Schumacher obscures any remnants of classy stage spectacle with the same disco overkill he brought to Batman Forever." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com believed that Phantom of the Opera [...] "takes everything that's wrong with Broadway <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the big screen in a gaudy splat." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy Jordan buys {{a coffee}} machine <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> Kenneth Parcell's desk, {{causing him to}} develop a {{caffeine}} addiction.

He therefore decides to return to Georgia on the midnight train; however, he quickly returns, explaining that the train was actually departing at 11:45 and he missed it.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{wanted the}} {{institute}} {{to concentrate on}} hard science. He gutted Carnegie's archeology program, setting the field back {{many years in the}} United States. He saw little value in the humanities and social sciences, and slashed funding for Isis, a journal dedicated to the history of science and technology and its cultural influence. Bush later explained that [...] "I have a great reservation about these studies where somebody goes out and interviews a bunch of people and reads a lot of stuff and writes a book <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a shelf and nobody ever reads it." ...|$|E

500|$|The section {{begins with}} Gaga wearing the tentacle dress, {{performing}} [...] "Partynauseous" [...] and [...] "Paparazzi" [...] with some ambient and quiet music. As {{she makes her}} way down the runways, her dancers bring the [...] "Monster Paw Chair" [...] <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> one of the small stages. There Gaga sings [...] "Do What U Want" [...] and near the end she reaches for the piano to perform [...] "Dope" [...] and an acoustic version of [...] "Born This Way". A speech ensues, which is followed by [...] "Jewels n' Drugs", as Gaga disappears beneath the stage. A video interlude starts showing the singer dancing. Gaga rises from the stage, near the piano, wearing a black latex dress and green wig, to sing the chorus of [...] "Jewels n' Drugs".|$|E
500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E
