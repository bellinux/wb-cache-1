5|$|Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby, was {{singled out}} in {{particular}} for his central {{involvement in the}} rebellion, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> the multiple was seven rather than five. The same {{was the case for}} Henry de Hastings, who was the commander of Kenilworth Castle. Those who had not taken part in the fighting themselves, but had incited others to rise up against the king, were fined at two years' value, while those who had been compelled to fight, or played only a minor part, had to pay one year's value of their land. The proceedings from the fines were awarded to royal supporters, some of whom had already been awarded parts of the rebels' land, and now had to give it back.|$|E

Emerging from the shadows, Tuan retorts that the US army has devastated his family, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{that makes the}} United States the enemy. On {{his way to the}} airport with Garlick, under MP escort, Cronauer sets up a quick {{softball}} game for the students from his English class, where he says goodbye to Trinh. As he boards the plane, he gives Garlick a taped farewell message; Garlick – taking Cronauer's place as DJ – plays the tape on the air the next morning.|$|E

During his mayoralty he was able to help raise £3 million towards the project <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> was a highlight of his year of office. His fundraising efforts were impressive and he was even able to persuade President Richard Nixon to be the project's patron in America. As a result, money flooded in, including one donation of $10 from an American pensioner who had visited the cathedral during the First World War in 1917.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1984, {{before the}} third-season premiere, The show's {{producers}} announced the character Frasier Crane, portrayed by Kelsey Grammer, {{was to be}} Diane's love interest and Sam's intellectual rival. They intended for Diane to end her relationship with Frasier within a few episodes, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to leave the show, but Grammer's performance was well-received, so his role was extended for the whole season. Long was still married to stockbroker Bruce Tyson and was pregnant with his child, and a storyline involving Diane Chambers's out-of-wedlock pregnancy was speculated with either Sam or Frasier as the father. The producers deemed the pregnancy idea undesirable and abandoned it. Instead, Diane was written as childless.|$|E

25|$|In {{the domain}} of letters he {{remained}} until his death a veritable pontiff, and an article or book of his was an event celebrated {{from one end of}} Portugal to the other. The nation continued to look up to him for intellecual leadership, but, in his later years, lacking hope himself, he could not stimulate others or use to advantage the powers conferred upon him. In politics he remained a constitutional Liberal of the old type, <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> the people were the middle classes in opposition to the lower, which he saw to have been the supporters of tyranny in all ages, while he considered radicalism to mean a return via anarchy to absolutism. However, though he conducted political propaganda campaigns in the press in his early days, Herculano never exercised much influence in politics.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{repression}} {{of identity and}} the inability to practice their culture and language has led the Talysh to an internalized self repression. This {{makes it hard to}} gauge support for any type of Talysh movement. According to Hema Kotecha, many Talysh fear being associated with the separatist Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic, with Russia, or with Armenia if they acknowledged or attempted to talk about their beliefs in the public sphere. One instance of current repression was when a school in Lerik wanted to invite a poet from Lenkoran to have a party in his honor <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to speak to Children; the headmaster was told that he would be dismessed if the event went ahead. The fear of the police is also another factor to this silence, although support for a secular democracy and shared Azerbaijani-Talysh feelings towards Nagorno-Karabakh contribute as well.|$|E

It was revealed that Hevesi had actually hired four, not the two employees initially thought for his wife's 'security detail' and said employees were running personal errands according to the report from the Attorney General Office. On December 13, 2006, a poll conducted between December 5–11 by Quinnipiac showed that 45% of people in New York felt that Hevesi should resign and 43% felt he had paid his debt to the state. 1,144 registered voters in New York were polled with a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percent.|$|E

In April 2017, Yoshiki debuted a special collaboration T-Shirt with rock group KISS titled “YOSHIKISS”. During these performances, he lost sensation {{in his left}} hand and was rediagnosed with cervical foraminal stenosis. In May 2017, it was announced that Yoshiki would undergo emergency cervical artificial disc replacement surgery in Los Angeles on May 16, resulting in the cancelling of his schedule for May, and future events being possibly cancelled or rescheduled based on discussions after his surgery. The surgery was successful, with his surgical wound expected to take six weeks to heal, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to make a 90% recovery in six months.

25|$|According to some sources, on {{the morning}} of her death, she took a bath, put on new clothes and lay down in bed. She asked for Ali and {{informed}} him that her time to die was very close. Upon hearing this news, Ali began to cry but was consoled by Fatimah who asked him to look after her two sons <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to bury her without ceremony. It is further stated that her two sons were the first family members to learn of her death and immediately proceeded to the mosque to inform their father. Upon hearing the news, Ali fell unconscious. After recovering he followed Fatima's wishes and performed the janazah. He buried her during the night on 13 Jumada al-awwal 11AH (632 AD), also making three false graves to ensure her real grave could not be identified. With him were his family and a few of his close companions. After her death, Ali followed her wishes and buried her without informing the Medinan people.|$|E
25|$|Like many spiritually minded Russians, Rasputin {{spoke of}} {{salvation}} as depending {{less on the}} clergy and the church than on seeking the spirit of God within. He also maintained that sin and repentance were interdependent and necessary to salvation. Thus, he claimed that yielding to temptation (<b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> personally, this meant sex and alcohol), even {{for the purposes of}} humiliation (so as to dispel the sin of vanity), was needed to proceed to repentance and salvation. Rasputin was deeply opposed to war, both from a moral point of view and as something which was likely to lead to political catastrophe. During the years of World War I, Rasputin's increasing drunkenness, sexual promiscuity and willingness to accept bribes (in return for helping petitioners who flocked to his apartment), as well as his efforts to have his critics dismissed from their posts, made him appear increasingly cynical. Attaining divine grace through sin seems to {{have been one of the}} central secret doctrines which Rasputin preached to (and practiced with) his inner circle of society ladies.|$|E

500|$|Burgon was {{permitted}} to examine the codex {{for an hour and}} a half in 1860, consulting 16 different passages. Burgon was a defender of the Traditional Text <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> Codex Vaticanus, as well as codices Sinaiticus and Codex Bezae, were the most corrupt documents extant. He felt that each of these three codices [...] "clearly exhibits a fabricated text – is the result of arbitrary and reckless recension." [...] The two most widely respected of these three codices, א and B, he likens to the [...] "two false witnesses" [...] of Matthew 26:60.|$|E
500|$|Banks {{has said}} that a common way of {{developing}} songs throughout the band's career was for Collins to play the rhythm, Rutherford {{to set up a}} groove and riffs, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to add the harmonies and melodies on top. He cites the [...] "Apocalypse in 9/8" [...] section of [...] "Supper's Ready", [...] "The Cinema Show" [...] and [...] "Domino" [...] as examples of this, and says the restrictions it gave him allowed the group to produce straightforward pop songs such as [...] "Invisible Touch" [...] and [...] "Land of Confusion" [...] in later years.|$|E
500|$|Kunichika was {{described}} as having an open, friendly and sincere personality. He enjoyed partying with the geishas and prostitutes of the Yoshiwara district, while consuming abundant amounts of alcohol. [...] His greatest passion, however, {{was said to be}} the theater, where he was a backstage regular. His appearance said to be shabby. He was constantly in debt and often borrowed money from the kabuki actors he depicted so admiringly. [...] A contemporary said of him: [...] "Print designing, theater and drinking were his life <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> that was enough." [...] A contemporary actor, Matsusuke IV, said that when visiting actors backstage for the purpose of sketching them, Kunichika would not socialize but would concentrate intensely on his work.|$|E

[...] He was almost past the {{point in his life}} when he felt he could {{consider}} an undersea expedition, but said he still had [...] "a mental restlessness" [...] to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. So when an IMAX film was made from footage shot of the wreck itself, he decided to seek Hollywood funding to [...] "pay for an expedition and do the same thing." [...] It was [...] "not because I particularly wanted to make the movie," [...] Cameron said. [...] "I wanted to dive to the shipwreck." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} was resolved when son Jay became a substitute drummer {{for his father}} during parts of the Working on a Dream Tour that Max could not make due to commitments to the O'Brien show. Springsteen said, [...] "Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O'Brien, and everyone on his team, for {{making it possible for}} Max to continue to do double duty for both us <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> [...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] In one case, Jay did one show of a two-night stand on the East Coast and Max then took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
500|$|Planning and rehearsals for {{the concert}} took {{about three weeks}} in a Manhattan theater. The rehearsals were {{characterized}} by past tensions that resurfaced between the performers under the intense time pressure. Paul Simon later said: [...] "Well, the rehearsals were just miserable. Artie and I fought all the time." [...] An early concept was for each singer to give a solo performance, with Simon allotted the greater amount of time, and to conclude with the duo performing their joint works. This idea was rejected because, according to Garfunkel, [...] "It didn't seem right to either of us that Paul should be the opening act for Simon & Garfunkel, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to follow Simon & Garfunkel didn't make show-business sense". The two decided to perform most of the show together, with room for each to showcase some solo material. [...] Simon, who had resumed songwriting after a long hiatus, interrupted a series of studio recording sessions for the concert preparations. He used the live show {{as an opportunity to}} test one of his new songs in front of an audience. Garfunkel also planned to present a new song, [...] "A Heart in New York", from his soon-to-be released album Scissors Cut.|$|E
