40|$|Residual phase {{trapping}} of CO 2 {{injected into}} aquifers {{is a key}} mechanism for reducing risk of leakage. The “inject low <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>rise</b> ” strategy of storing CO 2 in deep saline aquifers is one method to maximize residual trapping. In this strategy, the more uniform {{the front of the}} rising CO 2, the greater the amount of CO 2 trapped in this form. Previous studies have indicated that capillary pressure promotes the uniformity of the front by dampening its inherent instability. Typically these studies were done with a few (often one, never more than ten) rock types, with each type having a different capillary pressure curve. In this work we show that if capillary entry pressure varies spatially at the same length scale as the permeability – a geologically and petrophysically realistic situation – the dynamics of the rising front can be qualitatively different. As a result, the plume velocity and residual phase trapping can be dramatically different. We study this effect through a series of numerical simulations with GEM-GHG, a commercial reservoir simulator adapted to CO 2 storage applications. After generating geostatistical realizations of permeability, we scale a reference capillary pressure curve using the Leverett j-function so that each grid block has Pc-Sw curve physically consistent with its permeability. For the purposes of illustrating the effect on buoyancy driven flow, we idealize the post-injection distribution of CO 2 as a large initia...|$|E

5000|$|The baker's yeast and sourdough methods {{follow the}} same pattern. Water is mixed with flour, salt and the {{leavening}} agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to rise one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often [...] "punch down" [...] the dough <b>and</b> <b>let</b> it <b>rise</b> again), then loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an oven.|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} stock market affect {{inventory}} decisions? The efficient markets view is that low stock price means poor fundamentals, a higher cost of capital, and lower inventory. Normatively, firms should obtain their cost of capital from an efficient markets model of stock prices. My study is motivated by the {{growing body of evidence}} that {{the stock market}} is not efficient and can temporarily mis-value firms. I report evidence that the market's behavioral component explains firms' inventory as much as its fundamentals component. I further test three possibilities for how the behavioral component works. The first is a financing channel. When the market over-values firms, firms can get cheaper financing and increase inventory. The second is dissipation. When the market mis-values firms, firms are less disciplined <b>and</b> <b>let</b> inventories <b>rise.</b> The third is catering. When the market discounts high-inventory firms, firms decrease inventory, and vice versa. I report evidence that weakly supports financing, rejects dissipation and strongly supports catering. The findings suggest that we need to find new ways of calculating the cost of capital for operations models. They could begin to form the basis of a more empirically accurate account of how inventory decisions are affected by financial markets. ...|$|R
