This paper presents an analysis of multilateration data using an extension of an algorithm given in Jeddi et al. (2006). Key results are as follows. The separation distribution does not appear to change much at different points along the approach path. The left tail of separation (corresponding to the smallest separation values) {{does not appear to be}} heavy-tailed. This is positive from a safety perspective. If we extrapolate this behavior beyond the observed data, we conjecture that smaller separations have probabilities that rapidly decay to effectively zero. Lateral positions near the threshold do not appear to be heavy tailed either. Finally, estimates of the final-approach separation variability are consistent with previously published results.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the planning of}} railway freight classification at hump yards, where the problem involves the formation of departing freight train blocks from arriving trains subject to scheduling and capacity constraints. The hump yard layout considered consists of <b>arrival</b> <b>tracks</b> of sufficient length at an arrival yard, a hump, classification tracks of non-uniform and possibly non-sufficient length at a classification yard, and departure tracks of sufficient length. To increase yard capacity, freight cars arriving early can be stored temporarily on specific mixed-usage tracks. The entire hump yard planning process is covered in this paper, and heuristics for arrival and departure track assignment, as well as hump scheduling, have been included to provide the neccessary input data. However, the central problem considered is the classification track allocation problem. This problem has previously been modeled using direct mixed integer programming models, but this approach did not yield lower bounds of sufficient quality to prove optimality. Later attempts focused on a column generation approach based on branch-and-price that could solve problem instances of industrial size. Building upon the column generation approach we introduce a direct arc-based integer programming model, where the arcs are precedence relations between blocks on the same classification track. Further, the most promising models are adapted for rolling-horizon planning. We evaluate the methods on historical data from the Hallsberg shunting yard in Sweden. The {{results show that the}} new arc-based model performs as well as the column generation approach. It returns an optimal schedule within the execution time limit for all instances but from one, and executes as fast as the column generation approach. Further, the short execution times of the column generation approach and the arc-indexed model make them suitable for rolling-horizon planning, while the direct mixed integer program proved to be too slow for this. Extended analysis of the results shows that mixing was only required if the maximum number of concurrent trains on the classification yard exceeds 29 (there are 32 available tracks), and that after this point the number of extra car roll-ins increases heavily...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the DOA (direction of <b>arrival)</b> <b>tracking</b> problem with uniform linear arrays. In the litera-ture, there are two common approaches: one is to first use MUSIC based {{algorithms}} to estimate the signal subspace and then calculate the arrival angles from it; {{the other is to}} use Kalman filtering (KF) techniques to track the angles directly. This paper emphasizes on the fast movement case and hence follows the second approach. The key feature of this work is to simultaneously update the arrival angles and the source signals in the KF step by treating the source signals {{as a function of the}} arrival angles. Hence the term Simultaneous Angle-Souce Update (SASU). On the theoretical front, we show the deep connections between SASU and the two common approaches in the literature. On the more practical side, a Newton method is developed to solve the optimization problem in the KF step...|$|R

40|$|To {{overcome}} the deficiency of some current grid-/cell-based ray tracing algorithms, which are {{only able to}} handle first arrivals or primary reflections (or conversions) in anisotropic media, we have extended the functionality of the multistage irregular shortest-path method to 2 -D/ 3 -D tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media. The new approach is able to <b>track</b> multiple transmitted/reflected/converted <b>arrivals</b> composed {{of any kind of}} combinations of transmissions, reflections and mode conversions. The basic principle is that the seven parameters (five elastic parameters plus two polar angles defining the tilt of the symmetry axis) of the TTI media are sampled at primary nodes, and the group velocity values at secondary nodes are obtained by tri-linear interpolation of the primary nodes across each cell, from which the group velocities of the three wave modes (qP, qSV and qSH) are calculated. Finally, we conduct grid-/cell-based wave front expansion to trace multiple transmitted/reflected/converted arrivals from one region to the next. The results of calculations in uniform anisotropic media indicate that the numerical results agree with the analytical solutions except in directions of SV-wave triplications, at which only the lowest velocity value is selected at the singularity points by the multistage irregular shortest-path anisotropic ray tracing method. This verifies the accuracy of the methodology. Several simulation results show that the new method is able to efficiently and accurately approximate situations involving continuous velocity variations and undulating discontinuities, and that it is suitable for any combination of multiple transmitted/reflected/converted <b>arrival</b> <b>tracking</b> in TTI media of arbitrary strength and tilt. Crosshole synthetic traveltime tomographic tests have been performed, which highlight the importance of using such code when the medium is distinctly anisotropi...|$|R

The Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) signals are analyzed, and the underlying orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based physical layer used in the cellular downlink is exploited. The original contribution presented in the thesis is twofold. Firstly, a framework has been developed for assessing the TOA estimation performance achievable with OFDM signals. The signals are realistically modeled, and different power distributions of the available OFDM sub-carriers have been carefully defined. This allowed new exploration of the TOA estimation performance both in the asymptotic and in the threshold root mean square error (RMSE) regions. Moreover, a novel performance metric based on the shape of the Ziv-Zakai bound curve has been defined, and used to precisely evaluate the boundaries between the threshold and asymptotic RMSE regions. The analysis revealed a trade-off between the threshold RMSE, which is related in practice to sensitivity, and the asymptotic RMSE, which determines the ultimate accuracy. This shows that not only the Gabor bandwidth but also the threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) should be considered when designing reference signals. Secondly, a TOA estimation algorithm has been developed and applied to real LTE OFDM signals collected in multipath indoor and outdoor propagation environments. The new algorithm, referred to as ESPRIT and Kalman filter for time of <b>Arrival</b> <b>Tracking</b> (EKAT), combines a super-resolution algorithm, which performs the multipath separation, with a Kalman filter, which tracks the estimated direct path TOA. In addition, techniques have been extended for combining the received LTE pilot tones in the time, frequency, spatial and also cell ID domains. This exploits the intrinsic diversity offered by the LTE cell specific reference signal (CRS), and showed an improvement in the robustness and in the quality of the TOA estimates. The pseudoranges evaluated with the proposed EKAT algorithm have been used to feed a positioning filter, delivering position estimates with an error smaller than 8 m (50 % CEP) in the indoor scenario.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose a Track Before Detect (TBD) filter for Direction Of <b>Arrival</b> (DOA) <b>tracking</b> of {{multiple}} targets from phased-array observations. The phased-array model poses a new problem since each target emits a signal, called source signal. Existing methods consider the source signal as part of the system state. This is inefficient, especially for particle approximations of posteriors, where samples are drawn from the higher-dimensional posterior of the extended state. To address this problem, we propose a novel Marked Poisson Point Process (MPPP) model and derive the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter that adaptively estimates target DOAs. The PPP models variations of both the number and the location of points representing targets. The mark of a point represents the source signal, without the need of an extended state.
