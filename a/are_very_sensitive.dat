5|$|In general, {{like with}} many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy {{prescriptions}} it generates <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the underlying assumptions {{on the nature of the}} industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are diurnal and {{arboreal}} quadrupeds, often observed leaping {{through the}} upper canopy of the seasonal tropical rainforests in eastern Madagascar. They {{are also the}} most frugivorous of the Malagasy lemurs, and they <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to habitat disturbance. Ruffed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups and have a complex and flexible social structure, described as fission-fusion. They are highly vocal, and have loud, raucous calls.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to {{anthropogenic}} disturbances, and are keystone species, {{which can}} indicate the overall {{health of the}} marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution {{is a serious problem}} for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E

5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to sunburn.|$|E
5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations {{may be able to}} persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E

5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E
