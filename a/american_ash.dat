40|$|Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is an {{invasive}} {{forest pest}} causing widespread mortality of ash (Fraxinus spp.) in North America. Host resistance {{research and the}} development of resistant hosts offers a promising strategy for the long-term conservation of ash and management of EAB. Manchurian ash (F. mandshurica) shares an evolutionary history with EAB in Asia, resulting in its greater resistance relative to naive North <b>American</b> <b>ashes.</b> In the following studies I investigate antixenosis and antibiosis mechanisms of resistant and susceptible ashes. Antixenosis in Manchurian ash was demonstrated by quantifying substantially lower oviposition on this species relative to North <b>American</b> <b>ashes.</b> The potential underlying mechanisms of antixenosis were addressed by profiling the bark and canopy volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by susceptible black (F. nigra) and resistant Manchurian ashes and major species differences in VOC profiles were demonstrated. 	To address antibiosis, the physiological responses of EAB larvae that had fed on Manchurian, white (F. americana), and green (F. pennsylvanica) ash were quantified. It was found that antioxidant and quinone-protective enzyme activities of larvae feeding on Manchurian ash were substantially higher, suggesting that larvae feeding on Manchurian ash experience relatively high levels of reactive oxygen species and quinone stress. Manchurian ash demonstrated substantially higher activities of defense-associated enzymes and reactions than black ash, especially phenolic-oxidizing enzymes. These results support the conclusions of the larval physiology study that Manchurian ash appears to be able to generates greater amounts of quinone- and ROS-stress in vivo than North <b>American</b> <b>ashes.</b> Lastly, larval performance and bark phenolic chemistry and physiology were compared for Manchurian ash that were experimentally girdled or not. Girdling reduced larval performance by half but bark defenses did not differ by treatment indicating that decreases in larval performance are associated with factors other than a reduction in levels of host defenses. 	It was concluded that Manchurian ash expresses antixenosis, which may be driven by the emission of certain volatiles. Also, that antibiosis appears {{to be related to the}} ability of Manchurian ash to generate an oxidatively stressful diet for larvae and larval success in compromised trees does not stem from a reduction in defense levels...|$|R

50|$|Fraxinus caroliniana, {{commonly}} known as the pop ash, Florida ash, swamp ash, Carolina ash, or water ash, is a species of ash tree native from Cuba through the subtropical southeastern United States from southern Virginia to Texas. It was originally described by the botanist Philip Miller. It is a small tree about 40 ft. Leaves are compound, opposite, 7-12 in long, leaflets 5-7 in, ovate to oblong, coarsely serrate or entire, 3-6 in long, 2-3 in wide. Fruit is frequently 3-winged (samara) with flat seed portion; seed sometimes a bright violet color. It is the smallest of eastern North <b>American</b> <b>ash</b> species, wood light, soft, weak, 22 lbs/cu/ft. Typical to coastal swamps and subtropical lowlands.|$|E

When one Chinese city's original collection, which had survived into late 1980's suddenly all died, city fathers used trees by sending them back to America as wooden crates containing Chinese made parts supplying the American auto industry. Advantages of green ash include its tolerance of harsh urban environmental conditions, ease of propagation, and (in eastern North America) its value for wildlife as a native keystone species.|$|E

40|$|There are two North <b>American</b> <b>ash</b> species {{which have}} been acclimatized in north Croatian forest ecosystems: the white ash (Fraxinus {{americana}} L.) and the green ash (F. pennsylvanica Marshall).

40|$|The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) is an {{invasive}} wood-boring beetle {{that has}} killed millions of ash trees since its accidental introduction to North America. All North <b>American</b> <b>ash</b> species (Fraxinus spp.) that emerald ash borer has encountered {{so far are}} susceptible, while an Asian species, Manchurian ash (F. mandshurica), which shares an evolutionary history with emerald ash borer, is resistant. Phylogenetic evidence places North American black ash (F. nigra) and Manchurian ash in the same clade and section, yet black ash is highly susceptible to the emerald ash borer. This contrast provides an opportunity to compare the genetic traits of the two species and identify those with a potential role in defense/ resistance. We used Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) to compare the phloem proteomes of resistant Manchurian to susceptible black, green, and white ash. Differentially expressed proteins associated with the resistant Manchurian ash {{when compared to the}} susceptible ash species were identified using nano-LC-MS/MS and putative identities assigned. Proteomic differences were strongly associated with the phylogenetic relationships among the four species.
