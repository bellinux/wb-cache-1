25|$|Traditional images {{show the}} Trung sisters wearing yellow turbans during their revolt against China in AD 40. These were {{unwrapped}} <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> signal {{the beginning of}} a fight. A yellow banner with a red circle in the center was adopted as a standard by Emperor Gia Long (r. 1802–1820). The flag of South Vietnam was originally designed by Emperor Thành Thái in 1890, and was revived by Lê Văn Đệ and re-adopted by Emperor Bảo Đại in 1948. The three stripes represented the Quẻ Càn, or Qian trigram, one of eight trigrams used in the I-Ching, a Taoist scripture. Quẻ Càn is the divination sign for heaven. Later, the stripes were reinterpreted to represent the northern, central and southern regions of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|In early October, the PC-1264 {{was honored}} by being {{selected}} {{as one of}} forty-seven representative warships {{for a review of}} the fleet by President Truman on Navy Day, 27 October. On 24 October, she sailed from Norfolk to New York, where the review was to be held. Soon after the PC-1264 left Norfolk, her new commanding officer, Lieutenant (jg) Jack Sutherland, arrived—after traveling there from New York! He was sent back to New York and arrived there soon after his new command. However, he would not take command until after Navy Day. The PC-1264, as the smallest vessel, was {{at the tail end of}} the Fleet review. However, President Truman, on board the destroyer USS Renshaw, circled the PC-1264 <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the crew.|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of October, Phát and 19 others were put on trial in a {{military}} court; observers predicted Phát {{would be the only}} one to face the death penalty, and that this would be reduced to a custodial term. Of the accused, 7 were civilians and 13 were military officers. They tried to appear confident <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> family and friends. Đức told the assembled media the trial was unfair, stating [...] "I believe in the supreme court of conscience". He then pointed to his subordinate officers and called them [...] "national heroes". He denied media speculation he had backed down during the coup to avoid being bombed by Kỳ, claiming [...] "I wanted to avoid bloodshed ... I am very proud of my decision".|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "burmashaving" [...] {{is used in}} Canada to {{describe}} politicians holding signs <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> traffic {{by the side of}} the road, a common sight during election campaigns. One of the first to use the phrase was Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative premier John Buchanan, who would stand at the end of a long line of party signs <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> morning traffic.|$|R

2500|$|In 1972, Spitz {{was accused}} of product {{placement}} during the medal ceremony. Following the 200-meter freestyle race Spitz arrived to obtain his gold medal barefoot and carrying his shoes. [...] He put them down when the American national anthem, [...] "The Star Spangled Banner" [...] was played. [...] After the anthem played, {{he picked up his}} shoes <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the crowd. [...] The Soviets saw this as product placement. [...] When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. [...] The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|King Christian used to ride daily {{through the}} streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied while the people stood <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> him. One {{apocryphal}} story relates that one day, a German soldier remarked to a young boy that he found it odd that the king would ride with no bodyguard. The boy reportedly replied, [...] "All of Denmark is his bodyguard." [...] This story was recounted in Nathaniel Benchley's bestselling book Bright Candles as well as in Lois Lowry's book Number the Stars. The contemporary patriotic song [...] "Der rider en Konge" [...] (There Rides a King) centers on the king's rides. In this song, the narrator replies to a foreigner's inquiry about the king's lack of a guard that [...] "he is our freest man" [...] and that the king is not shielded by physical force but that [...] "hearts guard the king of Denmark." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 15, 2008, Wallenda {{performed}} on a live broadcast of Today. The {{plan was to}} walk and then bicycle off {{the roof of the}} Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the [...] cable with a [...] balancing pole. Halfway through, {{he sat down on the}} wire and called the Today show hosts. [...] "Where are you?" [...] he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. [...] "I actually slipped," [...] he said later. [...] "I lost focus there for a moment" [...] because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Rain delays had {{canceled}} the live telecast of the race, and most fans first {{learned of the}} accident during the night's sports newscasts. Video of the crash showed {{what appeared to be}} a fatal incident, but once medical workers arrived at the car, Earnhardt climbed out <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> the crowd, refusing to be loaded onto a stretcher despite a broken collarbone, sternum, and shoulder blade. Many thought the incident would end his season early, but Earnhardt refused to give up. The next week at Indianapolis, he started the race but exited the car on the first pit stop, allowing Mike Skinner to take the wheel. When asked, Earnhardt said that vacating the No. 3 car was the hardest thing he had ever done. The following weekend at Watkins Glen, he drove the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet to the fastest time in qualifying, earning the [...] "True Grit" [...] pole. T-shirts emblazoned with Earnhardt's face were quickly printed up, brandishing the caption, [...] "It Hurt So Good". Earnhardt led for most of the race and looked to have victory in hand, but fatigue took its toll and he ended up sixth behind race winner Geoff Bodine. Earnhardt did not win again in 1996 but still finished fourth in the standings behind Terry Labonte, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Jarrett. David Smith departed as crew chief of the No. 3 team and RCR at the end of the year for personal reasons, and he was replaced by Larry McReynolds.|$|E

60|$|A down-darting bird, all song, swiftly lighted on the unmoved and {{eternally}} immovable balancings of the Terror Stone, and cheerfully chirped to Pierre.

60|$|The {{movements}} of the Montauk were necessarily slow; but she obeyed her helm, and fell off until her bows pointed in towards the sailor in the water. This fine fellow, the moment he saw the ship approaching, waded to the verge of the rock, where it went off perpendicularly to the bottom, <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> them to come on without fear.|$|E
60|$|We {{drew near}} to Cività Vecchia: the old, mediaeval looking port, with its castle, and a round fortress-barracks at the entrance. Soldiers aboard shouted <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> {{soldiers}} on the ramparts. We backed insignificantly into the rather scrubby, insignificant harbour. And in five minutes we were out, and walking along the wide, desolate boulevard to the station. The cab-men looked hard at us: but no doubt owing to the knapsack, took us for poor Germans.|$|E
6000|$|But when he disappeared, {{shouting}} to her, [...] "I'll find a wy, I'll find a wy," [...] {{she screamed}} and ran after him. He {{was already in}} the cart, and it had started. He stood up in it and waved his hand to her, and she stood on the dyke <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> him, and thus they stood waving till a hollow in the road swallowed cart and man and boy. Then Elspeth put her hands to her eyes and went sobbing homeward.|$|E
50|$|The {{neighbourhood}} is {{also known}} for its celebration of the Chinese New Year.

60|$|Aunt Dahlia, who {{was sitting}} with a bevy of the local nibs in the second row, sighted me as I entered <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> me to join her, but I was too smart for that. I wedged myself in among the standees at the back, leaning up against a chap who, from the aroma, {{might have been a}} corn {{chandler}} or something on that order. The essence of strategy on these occasions is to be as near the door as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a minute," [...] he said, and, digging {{his heels}} {{sideways}} into the steep bank of red clay, he began nimbly to mount. He looked across at every tree-foot. At last he {{found what he}} wanted. Two beech-trees {{side by side on}} the hill held a little level on the upper face between their roots. It was littered with damp leaves, but it would do. The fishermen were perhaps sufficiently out of sight. He threw down his rainproof <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> her to come.|$|E
60|$|So saying Jack at once {{proceeded}} {{to throw off}} his oil-skins and sea-boots, while Ben went to {{the bow of the}} boat <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> <b>to</b> those on the wreck to slack out more line. They soon understood him, and the spar was presently floating twenty yards further astern. Jack had by this time stripped. A strong line was now fastened round his body under his arms, and going up to the bow of the boat, so as to give himself as long a distance as possible to drift, he prepared for the swim.|$|E

60|$|As I {{passed the}} end of the upper house, I saw a young woman just coming out of the back door. I had spoken to her in the summer.

She was carrying a pail, wearing a white apron that was longer than her preposterously short skirt, and she had on the cotton bonnet. I took off my hat to her and was going on. But she put down her pail and darted with a swift, furtive movement after me.|$|E
60|$|The exodus {{took place}} three days {{afterward}} {{to the entire}} satisfaction of all concerned. Tranquil Vale alone regarded {{the advent of the}} newcomers {{with a certain amount of}} uneasiness, the joy of Ted and the twins when they found that there was a river at the bottom of the garden, threatening to pass all bounds.

5000|$|In the film, Knox {{enters the}} court {{on a red}} carpet, dressed in what Battiste {{describes}} as a [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] manner, <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> the reporters.

Additionally, Knox did not, in Battiste's view, dress in a provocative manner <b>and</b> did not <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> the media. The film portrays Knox and Sollecito sitting near each other and sharing shifty looks during the trial, when in reality they sat farther apart.|$|R
