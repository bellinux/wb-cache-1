5|$|Murphy {{has been}} outspoken about several other of his rivals, criticising them for having too many toilet breaks <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> about table {{conditions}} among other things. Murphy also makes collective criticisms {{of his fellow}} professionals for not attending events and has branded other players' concerns over prize money as a joke. Murphy's harshest criticism has been reserved for Ronnie O'Sullivan. Murphy highlights what he perceives to be O'Sullivan's lack of professionalism.|$|E
5|$|Steege {{undertook}} a fighter sector course in January 1943, {{and was given}} command of No.8 Fighter Sector Headquarters in Brisbane. As a result, he later contended, of his petitioning Eastern Area Command for reassignment to combat duties <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> to Group Officer Clare Stevenson that {{there were too many}} WAAAFs in the sector for an unmarried man to supervise, he was posted to command No.14 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters at Camden, New South Wales, on 23May. The following month, the unit deployed to Goodenough Island in New Guinea as part of No.71 (Fighter) Wing, becoming operational on 27June. In August it moved to Kiriwina, under the aegis of No.73 (Fighter) Wing. Steege relinquished command on 1October to take charge of No.73 Wing. The wing's combat units consisted of two P-40 Kittyhawk squadrons and a Supermarine Spitfire squadron. As part of the build-up to the Battle of Arawe in December, the Kittyhawks launched a series of assaults on Gasmata; three days before the Allied landings, Steege personally led a force of thirty-four aircraft in a bombing and strafing attack on the town's landing strip. In January 1944, the wing took part in the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time, each involving over seventy aircraft attacking enemy camps and depots at Lindenhafen, New Britain. Steege was promoted acting group captain the following month; the rank was made temporary in July.|$|E
25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema and I must say a very difficult one. I {{had to work with}} a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E

25|$|The {{subjects}} {{believed that}} for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual shocks. In reality, {{there were no}} shocks. After the confederate was separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electroshock generator, which played prerecorded sounds for each shock level. After a number of voltage-level increases, the actor started to bang on the wall that separated him from the subject. After several times banging on the wall <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> about his heart condition, all responses by the learner would cease.|$|E
25|$|Worship and temples {{appear to}} have been {{routinely}} offered by Greeks to their Roman governors, with varied reactions. Cicero declined a temple proposed by the city officials of Roman Asia to his brother and himself, while the latter was proconsul, to avoid jealousy from other Romans; when Cicero himself was Governor of Cilicia, he claimed to have accepted no statues, shrines, or chariots. His predecessor, Appius Claudius Pulcher, was so pleased, however, when the Cilicians built a temple to him that, when it was not finished at the end of Claudius' year in office, Claudius wrote Cicero {{to make sure it was}} done, <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> that Cicero was not active enough in the matter.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April 2013, al-Baghdadi {{released}} an audio statement {{in which he}} announced that the al-Nusra Front had been established, financed, and supported by ISI, and that {{the two groups were}} merging under the name Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIL, Al-Sham also translates as the Levant). However, Abu Mohammad al-Julani and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leaders of al-Nusra and al-Qaeda respectively, rejected the merger. Al-Julani issued a statement denying the merger, <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> that neither he nor anyone else in al-Nusra's leadership had been consulted about it. In June 2013, Al Jazeera reported that it had obtained a letter written by al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, addressed to both leaders, in which he ruled against the merger, and appointed an emissary to oversee relations between them {{to put an end to}} tensions. That same month, al-Baghdadi {{released an}} audio message rejecting al-Zawahiri's ruling and declaring that the merger was going ahead.|$|E

25|$|On April 26 {{the pirates}} {{captured}} the ship Mary Anne with a hold full of Madeira wine. The captain of Mary Anne refused Bellamy's request to pilot {{them up the}} coast, so Bellamy arrested the captain and five of his crew and brought them aboard Whydah Gally, leaving three of the original crew aboard Mary Anne. Then Bellamy sent 7 of his own men onboard of Mary Anne - {{one of whom was}} the carpenter Thomas South who had been forced by Bellamy and his crew to make repairs; not wanting to join the pirate crew he had been offered release by Bellamy after work was completed, but the surviving pirates later testified to the court that they had over-ruled Bellamy's decision and forced South to stay due to his much whimpering <b>and</b> <b>complaining.</b> South testified that it was his choice to accompany the 6 pirates going aboard Mary Anne in hopes of escaping, possibly by jumping overboard and swimming ashore as they drew near to the Cape. Sometime around sunset that evening, the winds completely died, and a massive fog bank made visibility virtually nil. The four ships in Bellamy's fleet lost sight of one another. Bellamy's ships Anne (captained by his quartermaster Richard Noland) and Fisher moved out to sea (eventually making it to Damariscove Island with heavy damage). Williams had turned the Marianne away earlier, putting into Block Island to visit relatives but agreeing to meet Bellamy later off Maine.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, Emperor Xuanzong's train reached Mawei Station (馬嵬驛, {{in modern}} Xianyang, Shaanxi). The {{imperial}} guards were not fed and were angry at Yang Guozhong. Chen {{also believed that}} Yang Guozhong provoked this disaster and planned to kill him—and reported his plans to Li Heng through Li Heng's eunuch Li Fuguo, but Li Heng was hesitated and gave no approval. Meanwhile, though, emissaries of the Tibetan Empire, who had followed Emperor Xuanzong south, were meeting with Yang Guozhong <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> that they were also not fed. The imperial guard soldiers took this opportunity to proclaim that Yang Guozhong was planning treason along with the Tibetan emissaries, and they killed him, along with his son Yang Xuan (楊暄), the Ladies of Han and Qin, and Wei Fangjin. Wei Jiansu was also nearly killed, but was spared {{at the last moment}} with severe injuries. The soldiers then surrounded Emperor Xuanzong's pavilion, and refused to scatter even after Emperor Xuanzong came out to comfort them and order them to scatter. Chen publicly urged him to put Consort Yang to death—which Emperor Xuanzong initially declined. After Wei Jiansu's son Wei E (韋諤) and Gao Lishi spoke further, Emperor Xuanzong finally resolved to do so. He therefore had Gao take Consort Yang to a Buddhist shrine and strangle her there. After he showed the body to Chen and the other imperial guard generals, the guard soldiers finally scattered and prepared for further movement. Meanwhile, Yang Guozhong's wife Pei Rou, son Yang Xi (楊晞), the Lady of Guo, and the Lady of Guo's son Pei Hui (裴徽) tried to flee, but were killed in flight.|$|E

500|$|In letters {{written at}} the time, Rand's {{reaction}} to the film was positive. She {{said it was the}} most faithful adaptation of a novel ever made in Hollywood and a [...] "real triumph". Sales of the novel increased as a result of interest spurred by the film. She displayed a more negative attitude later, saying she disliked the entire movie <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> about its editing, acting, and other elements.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Bad Day" [...] {{were said to}} have a {{universal}} appeal by Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine as they have an [...] "everyman breeziness" [...] because the song's subject can be any person going through a bad daytime. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as: [...] "a loping, sunny tune that pretty much has the opposite sentiment of its title". Although About.com's Bill Lamb described its lyrics as having a [...] "reassuring, comforting" [...] tone, Powter said the song [...] "mak fun of self-absorbed and narcissistic people who bitch and gripe". He also affirmed: [...] "It's not literally about having a bad day, it's more about not taking yourself too seriously <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> about trivial things".|$|E

500|$|Drake has a {{distinct}} personality, as the creators did {{not want him to}} appear as a caricature or [...] "cardboard cutout". Hennig constantly elaborated Drake's personality through in-game dialogue and interactions with other characters, rather than exclusively through cutaway scenes. Drake reacts to events in a human-like way, often commenting <b>and</b> <b>complaining</b> on the absurdity or difficulty of his situation. While traveling through chapters, Drake frequently makes sarcastic quips and taunts. Self-educated in history and various languages, Drake is also highly intelligent. Matt Casamassina of IGN commented on the character's interactions during gameplay that reveal Drake's nature: [...] "it's lighthearted and amusing, but it also demonstrates that Nate is aware of how absurd his predicaments sometimes are. It's a small, unimportant communication, but it makes sense that the two would behave exactly as they do." ...|$|E

Although Sainte-Hélène was mortally wounded, 150 of the attackers had been killed in action, and were utterly discouraged.

His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26October 1816. In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.|$|E
