500|$|Hed PE {{signed with}} Jive Records, {{releasing}} their self-titled debut album in 1997. In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Steve Huey wrote [...] "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans." [...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "We had these romantic visions of the music industry, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably {{the worst thing that could}} have happened. [...] We've had offers from Sony and others that we can't take because we owe Jive so much money." ...|$|E
500|$|The 3D {{cameras were}} unable to pick up {{anything}} shiny, such as stainless steel, due to a flare. Set decorator Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality. The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras, which are [...] "slow to pick up information". Loucks said, [...] "It's a very restrictive color palette. For example, in this warehouse scene, we saturated the floors in a dark, dark charcoal, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that was enough, but then the cameras showed them as still being too light. [...] So we had to add more and more black. [...] The reason I say it's too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets than we ever have before." ...|$|E
500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to think for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E

500|$|Actor George Clooney {{provided}} the small {{role of the}} voice of Sparky, which is limited entirely to dog barks. Clooney was a vocal South Park fan and was largely responsible for generating news about [...] "The Spirit of Christmas", a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone {{that served as a}} precursor to South Park. Parker said they decided to cast a famous actor in the small role of Sparky because [...] "we thought it was funny", and because they wanted to do something different from the animated series The Simpsons, which is known for having prominent guest appearances on a regular basis. Parker added, [...] "Since South Park is sort of a show that rips on celebrity, we wanted to degrade them in other ways too. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> let's have celebrities on, but have them do really minor, unimportant things". Comedy Central executives were excited at the prospect of having Clooney appear on the show, but Parker said they were disappointed to learn his role was so small.|$|E
500|$|To {{direct the}} play, the duo engaged Harold Clurman, noted {{for his work}} in drama and {{one of the founders of}} the Group Theatre. Jo Mielziner, veteran of several Rodgers and Hammerstein productions, was the stage designer. In {{contrast}} to the complex staging of Me and Juliet, Mielziner's sets were uncomplicated, a system of house-frame outlines in front of backdrops representing Monterey. Boris Runanin was the choreographer, Robert Russell Bennett provided orchestrations, and Salvatore Dell'Isola conducted. The two producers had hoped to hire the prestigious Majestic Theatre, where South Pacific had run, but the writing process took too long, and the Majestic was lost to Fanny. Instead, they booked the Shubert Theatre, in the top rank of Broadway theatres, but not as prestigious as the Majestic. Uniquely for their joint work, they solicited no backers, but underwrote the entire cost themselves. Feuer later said of the bargain he and Martin had made with Rodgers and Hammerstein, [...] "And the deal was pretty good: 50percent of the producers' end. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> We're rich! And we turned it over to them and they destroyed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I felt as though I couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that we felt weren't suitable for the band that we were in <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the band was set to perform at Summersault in August 2000, about eight songs, {{including}} [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", had been recorded as demos while the band {{was on the road}} touring. Guitarist Turner noted: [...] "After we were done we brought them in for the record company to hear, with an eye to making plans for next year. They heard what we were doing and said, 'Well, let's finish the album you're working on.' <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Album? We're just demoing.' But they told us what we had was great, so we went back into the studio with Arn and did just that." [...] Over the next two months, the band worked to complete the album with Arnold Lanni at Arnyard Studios in Toronto as well as Avatar Studios in New York City. Rumors had surfaced that, while in New York, Our Lady peace had dropped Lanni as producer to work with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. These rumors were later debunked by Maida. The first songs to be played live were [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", which debuted during Summersault in August 2000 shortly after they were first recorded. In an August 2000 interview with Chartattack Raine revealed that a song titled [...] "Yesterday" [...] (later to become [...] "Middle of Yesterday") was almost guaranteed to be the first single for Spiritual Machines.|$|E
500|$|... "Kidney Now!" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on March 5, 2009; it was filmed on March 16–17, 2009. [...] "He Needs a Kidney", the charity song {{featured}} in this episode, was written by show composer and co-executive producer Jeff Richmond. Richmond is married to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. In discussion {{of the development of}} [...] "Kidney Now!", Richmond said that Carlock and Fey [...] "were trying {{to figure out a way}} to highlight Jack's dad in getting a kidney and how they're going to deal with that", and that the two came to the decision to [...] "take advantage of the singing", as they have done so in the past with different 30 Rock episodes, in which the show's characters have sung songs. Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, [...] "We Are the World", [...] as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a kidney donor. [...] "Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but they want to get a kidney. I think we had angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph.|$|E

500|$|... 8701 was {{recorded}} in the United States, in the cities of Los Angeles, New York, Minneapolis and Atlanta. The album's production was handled by several producers including The Neptunes, Jermaine Dupri, P. Diddy—who had produced the majority of Usher's previous album, My Way—Babyface, Kevin [...] "She'kspere" [...] Briggs, Mike City, Bryan Michael Cox and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Both Jam and Lewis were asked by Usher's mother, and then manager, to contribute to 8701s production, during the 2000 MTV Music Awards. According to Jam, his mother had said [...] "Oh my God, Usher's got this track <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> you guys would be perfect to produce it". Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song [...] "Separated", along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari & Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A. Reid, who liked the track, {{and asked them to}} produce more. Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 [...] "Tender Love", performed by R vocal group Force MDs. Though he wanted it to be his own unique record, which contains a small similarity, to which Jam and Lewis created [...] "Can U Help Me". Following the completion of 8701, Jam and Lewis were sent back to the studio by Reid to revamp the album's second single [...] "U Remind Me", explaining [...] "we already know he can dance, and he's got the style and that whole thing. But I want people to just go, he can sing.|$|E

2500|$|The cover art for {{the album}} is an adapted version of Bowie's 1977 album, [...] "Heroes", with a white square with the album's title {{obscuring}} Bowie's face. Designed by Jonathan Barnbrook, who also designed packaging for Heathen and Reality and follow-up Blackstar, the obscuring of the photograph connotes [...] "forgetting or obliterating the past". The original cover image was shot by Masayoshi Sukita. Barnbrook explained the cover, saying: [...] "If {{you are going to}} subvert an album by David Bowie there are many to choose from but this is one of his most revered, it had to be an image that would really jar if it were subverted in some way <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> [...] "Heroes" [...] worked best on all counts." [...] A viral marketing campaign was launched to promote the album on 15 February 2013. The campaign grew out of the concept behind the album cover, taking seemingly ordinary images and subverting them through the addition of a white square.|$|E
2500|$|Elvis Presley {{reportedly}} spent {{days and}} nights with his friends and employees from the Memphis Mafia.

[...] Even the girls he dated lamented, [...] "Whenever you were with Elvis {{for the most part}} you were with his entourage. Those guys were always around". According to the singer's cousin Billy Smith, Elvis got into bed with Smith and his wife Jo [...] "many times at Graceland when we would spend the night there in Lisa's room, or on tour in the hotel, and at the trailer on the property at Graceland. ... we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world!
