5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole),</b> <b>and</b> yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E

Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994.
