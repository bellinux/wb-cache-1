40|$|The {{literature}} distinguishes finite sample {{studies of}} seasonal stationarity quite less intensely than it shows for seasonal unit root tests. Therefore, {{the use of}} both types of tests for better exploring time series dynamics is seldom noticed in the relative studies on such a topic. Recently, Lyhagen (2006) introduced for quarterly data the seasonal KPSS test which null hypothesis is no seasonal unit roots. In the same manner, as most unit root limit theory, the asymptotic theory of the seasonal KPSS test depends on whether the data has been filtered by a preliminary regression. More specifically, one may proceed to the extraction of deterministic components – such as the mean and trend – from the data before testing. In this paper, I took account of de-trending on the seasonal KPSS test. A sketch of its limit theory was provided in this case. Also, I studied in finite sample the behaviour of the test for monthly time series. This could enrich our knowledge about it since it was – <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> above – <b>early</b> introduced for quarterly data. Overall, the obtained {{results showed that the}} seasonal KPSS test preserved its good size and power properties. Furthermore, like the test of Kwiatkowski et al. [KPSS] (1992), the nonparametric corrections of residual variances may smooth the wide variations of the seasonal KPSS empirical sizes. ...|$|R

30|$|The first {{area for}} {{continued}} {{research is the}} identification of artists who work in way that are aligned with the processes and parameters of the makerspace.

However, it is not enough to simply ask students to find an artist who uses a certain technology or methodology. In future research, I will begin to differentiate between artists who use concepts that are drawn from makerspaces, and those artists that use the specific technologies. For example, Rube Goldberg was a cartoonist who drew magnificently complicated machines. Although he did earn a degree in engineering, he was an artist who used traditional means to make his art. Echo Yang repurposed common household machines to make his drawings. This type of appropriation is certainly important as a form of artistic expression; however, it is not clear the level to which Yang understands the modifications, from an electronic engineering perspective. And Jan Voorman used common Lego blocks to rebuilt war-torn walls in Berlin; once again, this is clever and visually powerful, but the connection to structural engineering might not be so strong.|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} process, my objectives were as follows; firstly, {{to explore the}} relationship between identity formation and poverty and secondly to explore {{the role of the}} church in combating the effects of poverty in the lives of those who live in poverty stricken communities. A Narrative approach was used to gather data from the community. I listened to the stories of those people who live in poverty. Seven movements were used as the methodology for {{this research}} (Muller 2005 : 81 - 86). As a practical theologian, I positioned myself within postfoundationalist theology. In this position I avoided foundation epistemology which seeks the absolute truth as well as anti or nonfoundational epistemology which promotes relativism. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier</b> postfoundationalist practical theology is always thinking in a specific context and can also go beyond that specific context into interdisciplinary thinking. Starting from a specific context into an interdisciplinary context, we found that the concept of poverty {{has been described as a}} discourse meaning that it went from poverty as a lack of resources into linguistic, poverty as lack of capabilities or poverty being political. By taking multidimension method to eradicate poverty one needs to apply a multidimensions approach. The stories from Nellmapius affirmed that poverty influences identity formation. The following effects were identified: low self-esteem, stress, depression, lack of self-acceptance and hopelessness. The church has the capacity as the biggest membership and with the most awareness organization in most communities that has the attention of many people. The church is able to preach hope for people in what seems to be hopelessness and encourage the poor to rise out of their poverty. It can facilitate the poor and the government to work together to change their lives. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Practical Theologyunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} the {{perspective}} of the producer, the pitch has become a very central part of the work compared to how it was between 1956 and 1987, when SVT had a monopoly on television in Sweden and only broadcast and produced their productions. Today the picture looks quite different. Commercial channels, including SVT, buy TV shows from production companies. I should add that SVT and even TV 4 is still a certain proportion of their own programs, but far from all. A pitch may seem small and insignificant in the big context, but despite being a small part it is incredibly important. If it is not a funder of the program proposal there will be no TV program. It is a matter for the producer to do a solid job with the pitch to get a "YES" from the TV channel. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find out what a producer at a Swedish production company is to say at the pitch to get a successful outcome. To find out, I have used the following question: What qualities are included in a successful pitch according to Swedish television companies? And as follow-up questions to this I have: Are there any differences in the perception of pitch between SVT and the commercial channels?I have limited myself by just watching the pitch between the Swedish production companies and the Swedish television channells SVT, TV 3, TV 4, and Kanal 5. The result, I have developed through theory and qualitative data I collected through a semi-structured interview made with the transmitter and receiver at a pitch situation, where the producers are the transmitters, and television channels have been recipients. The results show that all channels like to listen to a pitch where the person speaking is burning an awful lot for his or her idea, and who manages to explain the program proposal and its uniqueness in a quick and clear way. But they also want to listen to an idea that fits each channel's schedule, and since they have different missions (SVT are Independent and can take more risks, while the other channels who makes money from commercial, need a good result witch evry single TV-show), and different target groups and strategies so there is a difference between the channels regarding witch program proposals they will accept. Another factor that influence the decision is wheter the channel has confidence in the producer and production company. What sets the channels in {{terms of the}} perception of pitch is the content. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier</b> the channels have different missions, and thus they search for different types of program proposals. But since that SVT is independent and funded by a TV license they have better possibilities to take risks than the commercial channels have, since they are are in dire need of high viewing figures. When it comes to the pitch performance, all TV channels have the same thing (see answer to Question 1). Though my result I've made an movie who explain two important elements in a pitch, that the idea are complete, and that the producer choose the right TV-company for the pitch. The movie have an rethorical language, shape and structure. Validerat; 20120716 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to design an urban hotel located in Seoul, {{the capital city of}} Korea. I used an {{existing}} hotel, named Kims, for this renovation project. The existing hotel consists of forty-eight guest rooms, one bar, one coffee shop, one restaurant and a lobby area. The coffee shop and the restaurant are placed in the same room separated by three-foot high partitions. Compared to other transient or residential hotels in Seoul and large cities in the United States. this four-story hotel with forty-eight guest rooms can be designated as a small hotel in scale. William S. Gray and Salvatore C. Liguon define hotels with less than one hundred rooms as small hotels, with regard to their size in large cities. 1 Because Seoul is one of the busiest cities in Asia, {{as well as in the}} world, the owner of this hotel can expect not only an increase in the number of national guests but also in guests from abroad. The expected customer groups are business people from other areas in Korea, business people from abroad, and national and international tourists. I believe that customers will be aware of and enjoy visiting this small hotel if the hotel provides adequate advertising and a convenient and beautiful environment with distinguished decorations. Therefore, renovation is required to help improve the general qualities of the hotel and to provide advantages that small hotels possess such as coziness. Guests can feel as if they are staying home. Furthermore, the business operation is less complicated than it is in larger hotels. I intend to provide high quality facilities with easy access and unique decorations for guests and employees, and to use traditional Korean elements of decoration for this project, because I judge that the most important factor that could impress foreigners is to express my own culture to them through the design of this hotel. In addition, this design concept could evoke an attachment to the culture for natives. In the design process, I first referred to characteristics of traditional Korean house forms and furniture. They supported the design of the objects and the details that are used in this project. Then, I unified and abstracted the characteristics so that these motives could be integrated into my own design. Because one scope of this renovation is to internationalize this hotel, and the fact that I designed this project as a result of studying in the United States. I consulted Americans with Disabilities Act: law and regulations and Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations NYCRR: New York Codes, Rules, and Regulations for guidance. I approached this interior renovation project by dividing it into two main parts; space planning and design. For the space planning and circulation. I took a hotel 2 ̆ 7 s functional organizations and principles of operation into consideration, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier.</b> I used traditional Korean design characteristics for aesthetic motives. I intended, therefore, to make this hotel artistically wellorganized by means of combining its unique visual aspects with practicality in performing the basic role of hotels, such as management and operation. Thus, the hotel can be a more valuable asset than it was before the renovation, both for the owner as well as for expected customers...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} attempts {{to identify the}} image and activity of the Egyptian goddess Isis predominantly in Greece and also in Egypt. All these areas were in receipt of major cultural, political and religious developments, {{from the beginning of}} the Classical epoch throughout the Hellenistic time, the latter being characterised as possessing a very crucial, complicated and fluid time span. In terms of epigraphic and iconographical evidence, recent studies have been occupied with Isis' cults, mainly by French scholars, such as Dunand, Bricault, Leclant and Tran Tam Tinh, who have developed geographical patterns of her cuItic activity, as well as focussing on religious subjects and art history. English scholars, like Griffiths, Lloyd, Fraser, Witt, Thompson, Walters, have produced valuable studies of Isis' representations and assimilations in portraiture, in ancient sources and provided with reliable information about the history of the Late Period. German scholars such as HOlb 1 have dealt also with the Ptolemaic history, religion and iconography, finally Greek and Italian scholars, whose studies are limited but very important overall, as they have been producing exemplary catalogues of the artefacts. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> following the introduction of the goddess Isis in the Aegean, since the early Hellenistic period, she received remarkable admiration and attracted large groups of worshippers into her cult by Greeks living in Greece, Greeks overseas and most probably by Egyptian immigrants, travellers and merchants. The transformation of a pure Egyptian goddess into a Hellenistic semi-mortal figure as far as her iconographical representations reveal, and the vast spread of her appearance in the form of official texts, ex-votos or other dedications, prelude the begi ng of a new religious regime. Although, there has been good scholarly work on individual aspects of the goddess Isis, this study explores the cults of Isis in all its aspects by highlighting certain areas where previous work has been much rare, due to an absolute lack of a proper knitting together the epigraphic, iconographical and historical material, which are discussed in the following chapters. Chapter I lays out briefly the features and the cultic activity of the goddess Isis in the pre-hellenistic period and the later religious activity that are strongly connected with the development of Isis' family myth, cuItic interaction and iconography in the Mediterannean. The Egyptian influences in Greece during the Ptolemaic period and the official amval of the most prominent Egyptian deities, Isis and Sarapis changed the religious significance in the area. Also, this study shows evidence and suggests possibilities of the goddess' early development in Greece in relation to inscriptions within a flexible chronological framework, along with sculpture monuments and small scale finds that are related to her worship in Chapter II. A number of areas, some of them previously unknown for their importance in terms of Egyptian influence, show a religious continuity since the early stages of the Hellenistic period. In Chapter III, the relations of the Ptolemaic kingship with Isis' cults are described, where further on in Chapter N, an extended analysis of Isis' representations in statuary in connection to royal Ptolemaic portraiture leads to the hypothesis for a possible distinction between the identification of representations of Isis and those of Ptolemaic queens and their identities in statuary, which have been long the subject of confusion and debate. Furthermore, in Chapter V, issues of religious matters are raised concerning Egyptian cults, indicating those of Isis alone or with deities and the rulers, in a mixed Greco-Egyptian environment and its complications in the cuitic function of the cults, which are represented in ancient texts and in the archaeological record. Finally, I believe that this research deserves a fair consideration due to its nature of assembling the most recent evidence that was possible, taking into ccount my effort to collect and translate an enormous corpus of foreign literature, which treats with care very delicate issues that have been long established, some of which remained either unfamiliar or have received limited attention in previous studies.

40|$|The use of {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) has been increasing worldwide for teaching of science in secondary schools. Also in Pakistan, ICT technologies are now applied {{in a number of}} the Private schools and the public sector intends to use it for teaching and learning. The review of research studies suggest that appropriate and effective use of ICTs technology enhances and adds value to students 2 ̆ 7 learning in science education. However, the existing use of ICTs in schools in Pakistan appears not to be up to the level of its capacity, consequently a limited impact on students 2 ̆ 7 learning. Teachers are central to the successful use of ICT resources in science teaching and any use successful integration depends on the teachers comfort level with its use. Therefore, exploring their perceptions and practices of integrating ICTs with teaching of science would help in understanding the existing situation, of ICTs use in schools, so that planning for integration may be made. This qualitative action research study was conducted in a government high school of Urban Sindh, Pakistan. Data from field notes, interviews, and document analysis were used to explore perceptions and practices of ICT Integration of three science teachers and one technology coordinator prior and post action research. There were a total of four interviews, one with each participant and four reflections on their learning from the workshop and observations. Prior to the intervention teachers perceived ICT integration as any kind of use of computers i. e. finding the information to enrich the textbook content or some lesson plans from the internet, integration of ICT is resources dependent and it 2 ̆ 7 s very difficult to find out the reliable sources form the internet. From pre-intervention data, I inferred that without developing a participant teachers 2 ̆ 7 theoretical knowledge of teaching and learning of science with integration of ICT material, {{it would be difficult for}} me to help them understand the framework and process of the intervention stage of the intended research. Therefore, I decided to provide them with some reading material in order to develop their theoretical understanding of teaching of scientific concepts using ICT materials/resources. These readings helped participants to realize the importance of a few frameworks in sharpening their skills and understanding their role in developing the students 2 ̆ 7 scientific reasoning. They also gained some insights into planning and teaching of science concepts using appropriate ICT materials to teach science. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> teachers were thinking any use of computer as integration of ICT, I conducted a workshop of three days and provide them a basic training of use of ICT and about integration of ICT at suitable points and places in science lesson according to ABCD model (Anderson 2 ̆ 6 Weert, 2002) Hence, focus of the workshop was to enable participants in finding and integrate suitable ICT material on suitable places in science lesson. After getting start from me, teacher get hands on the same procedure under guidance and at the end of workshop they were very much aware of using ICT material properly in specific science topic. The findings of this study reveal that a teacher 2 ̆ 7 s selection of appropriate materials, meaningful questioning, and discussion with the students are vital for using ICT materials in teaching of science purposefully. Moreover, the exam-oriented teaching practices and a teacher 2 ̆ 7 s accountability were found to be hindering factors in teaching and learning science with integration of ICT, as they influence both the teacher and students in terms of their motivation, interest, and efforts to teach science. Nevertheless, at the end of intervention teachers perception about integration of ICT (any use of computer is integration of ICT) and practices (use of internet to enrich textbook content) was somehow changed and they believe that Integration has a sense of completeness or wholeness, by which all essential elements of a system are seamlessly combined together to make a whole. In education, simply handing out to students a collection of websites or CD-ROM programs is certainly not ICT integration. In a properly crafted ICT integrated lesson, ICT and other crucial educational components such as content and pedagogy are molded into one entity. As a result, the quality of the lesson would somehow be diminished if the ICT ingredient were taken away from the ICT-integrated lesson...|$|E

40|$|Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) - 1 Cue: Foot and Mouth {{disease is}} one of the most devastating of {{livestock}} diseases, not primarily because of the health risk it poses to animals, but because of the economic losses that occur when outbreaks happen. Areas that see Foot and Mouth outbreaks are unable to trade any livestock or livestock products until the disease is controlled, causing much financial hardship to farmers. In order to limit the size of outbreaks, early detection of the disease and quick notification of the veterinary authorities are both essential. For this reason it is vital that farmers are aware of the signs of the disease, and are constantly on the lookout. In our next report, Sylvia Jiyane finds out more about how farmers and veterinary services must work in partnership so that outbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease can be tackled quickly and effectively. IN:		?Good livestock management relies ? OUT:		?Matabeleland North province of Zimbabwe. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that report was from Sylvia Jiyane. Transcript Jiyane	Good livestock management relies heavily on disease control, and in our discussion today we shall be talking about Foot and Mouth disease. In our programme today I shall be talking to Dr Ndabezinhle Mkhwananzi, a government veterinary officer from Matabeleland North province in Bulawayo. He is going to start off by giving us a definition of the disease. Mkhwananzi	Foot and Mouth disease is a highly contagious specified, or notifiable disease, which causes blisters in the mouth and on the feet of cattle. In fact all cloven hoofed animals ? pigs, sheep and goats, as well as the wildlife like kudus and impalas. Jiyane	And what are some of the key signs and symptoms of this disease? Mkhwananzi	Blisters develop in the mouth and between the claws of the hooves. The blisters contain a clear fluid. In time the blisters will burst, and what will be left there is raw skin sores, which will be sore and the animal will not be able to walk; it will become lame. And it won?t even be able to eat. Jiyane	And Dr Mkhwananzi, if a farmer notices some of those symptoms which you have mentioned, what should he or she do? Mkhwananzi	<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> this is a notifiable disease. By law, if a farmer suspects his cow has got Foot and Mouth, he has to report to the Department of Veterinary Services, whereby in hours the Veterinary Department will quickly go there and confirm the symptoms, whether they are Foot and Mouth or not. Jiyane	And is this disease one that can be treated? Mkhwananzi	There is no treatment for Foot and Mouth disease. So the major thing is to control the outbreak of the disease. Jiyane	And what are some of these measures? Mkhwananzi	If the Department of Veterinary Services confirms that this is a suspicious case of Foot and Mouth, we will quickly put the area under quarantine. In fact this is the most important disease as far as the Department of Veterinary Services is concerned, not in terms of deaths and so forth, but the economic implications. So, people have to be on the look out for the disease and report it early enough. We put the place under quarantine, carry out vaccination campaigns. Then, after some time we go and investigate whether the disease is still there or not. Afterwards we shall then lift the quarantine. Jiyane	For how long will you quarantine animals in relation to this disease? Mkhwananzi	The initial quarantine will be thirty days. Jiyane	And you have just mentioned earlier on that this disease is of economic importance. Can you clarify that? Mkhwananzi	Right, when there is an outbreak of Foot and Mouth, no trade is supposed to take place. No animals are supposed to go for slaughter, or the milk to the dairy market and so forth. So it affects the economic activity relating to livestock. Jiyane	And for farmers listening right now, what advice would you give them from your own experience of this disease? Mkhwananzi	The main thing is to adhere to control measures, like movement of animals. They should come to the department for any movement of animals, say for distances of 5 kilometres or above, whereby they are issued with a permit, a movement permit. And inspections are carried out, to ascertain whether the animal has got any signs of Foot and Mouth or not. That will control the spread of the disease, and also the farmers are not inconvenienced when we put much stronger measures like quarantine and so forth. Jiyane	And just to take you back, you mentioned that this disease also affects wildlife. Is there any way in which the Veterinary Department is involved in the control of spread of that disease in wildlife areas? Mkhwananzi	The buffalo is taken to be the reservoir of the disease, that is, the carrier. The buffalo itself doesn?t get sick of Foot and Mouth; it carries the disease. So we prevent any contact between livestock, that is domestic livestock such as cattle, with the buffalo. All buffalo should be reported if they are sighted, so that the department will go and control them by culling. That is what we do.

40|$|My {{presentation}} {{consisted of}} four parts: First, Bonnie (co-presenter) and I offered {{a brief overview}} of ADHD and how the features of this diagnosis in woman can present differently from men. Secondly, I provided a very thorough powerpoint detailing many of these features for consideration to offer a user-friendly “take-away” resource for front-line service providers who may be encountering this diagnosis in their student population. The powerpoint was made available on the CADDSPE portion of the CACUSS website for participants to download. The videodocumentary was then presented, followed by a discussion, including a question/answer opportunity with Bonnie specific to her personal/professional experiences as a woman with ADHD in a post-secondary setting. The powerpoint will be sent for review. There were approximately 70 people who attended my presentation. Of those participants, the following support services were reported to be present: the Disability/Accessibility Service providers, Counsellors, Directors/Managers of Learning Service Centres, Academic Advisors, staff from Residence, Peer Mentorship Coordinators, Student Union, Directors of Counselling Centres, Learning Strategists/Academic Strategists, Tutors, and several students (two of which were diagnosed with ADHD and currently in programs) from Ryerson University. I received 50 evaluations, mostly indicating “very satisfied”. The majority of anecdotal comments fit three general themes: pleased to hear an overview of features more prevalent in women with ADHD; appreciation for the resource available to download; and compliments on the videography for conveying the unique truths of 3 women. Two evaluations indicated in their anecdotal comments that while they felt the presentation and video were “excellent”, they would have liked more opportunity for discussion {{at the end of the}} presentation to consolidate what they learned and to hear from other university/college settings. Interestingly, five people approached me privately to disclose their diagnosis and to reflect on the presentation and how it fit with their personal experiences as a student or staff member at a post-secondary institution. In my opinion as a presenter, I was very satisfied with both the turnout and the response to my presentation. I do wish there had been more time as one-hour was not sufficient to provide opportunity for a more in-depth follow-up conversation with workshop participants. I did not articulate learning outcomes in a clear enough manner and I will address this in future presentations. Bonnie and I briefly addressed common themes we have heard students with ADHD in distance learning settings versus traditional classroom settings. For instance, distance learning requires the student to be able to manage their time, organize their schedule, prioritize and approach coursework in a relatively systematic way. A great deal of independence is required in distance learning. A person with ADHD may find this lack of structure and need for systematic planning more challenging than an individual without ADHD. Students with ADHD in a more traditional setting have an external structure already in place (for example, class times are set, exam schedules are in place, and there is opportunity to immediately request clarification or interact with other students to clarify next steps). However, students with ADHD have also suggested that distance learning can be very beneficial and tremendously appealing once they learn more about their personal strengths and develop learning strategies to assist with time management, organization, prioritization and so forth. Generally we have heard students feel they often enjoy the varied pace available through distance learning, the opportunity to move around/take physical breaks while learning, the reduced need for extensive listening, and the prospect for more flexible scheduling around other activities. This is just one example for your interest. Several individuals approached me after my presentation which segued into an animated 2 -hour follow up conversation discussing the strengths and potential opportunities for students with ADHD to combine traditional and distance learning coursework. From this, several university representatives (two Directors from Counselling Centres and one Director from Accessibility Services) approached me to discuss possible opportunities for future collaboration with AU Counselling Services and possible professional development opportunities (i. e., present to their departments and to engage in some type of ongoing discussion to help guide best practice) to better accommodate and serve students in their institutions who maybe enrolled in both distance and traditionally-delivered coursework or programs. As well, the central focus of this conference was diversity, and within that, learners with more complex mental health issues. Many students diagnosed with ADHD may also have co-existing challenges related to mental health. I facilitated a pre-conference discussion with other interested institutions regarding various challenges, including: students in crisis who do not readily access support services; methods for supporting students with diverse needs via distance learning; and, the emerging use of on-line forums to offer education, resources and support for students in an e-campus/distance learning program. A particular point of discussion continued over a 3 -day period with several representatives (both staff from universities as well as students attending the conference) regarding the benefits and opportunities of a more integrated learning services approach (e. g., learning strategists, counsellors, accessibility services, academic advisors tend to collaborate more as a team for students), versus more traditional settings where teams may tend to work independently and without much overlap. A summary of comments from these conversations include perceived (and reported) benefits of a more integrated approach to be: increased student retention, particularly first year students; aligning of services and therefore more efficient use of time/less redundancy of service; improved efficiency for students seeking support in a timely manner; increased communication and opportunity to problem-solve challenges between different support services; and, increased overall student satisfaction with support services. The information, ideas and considerations which surfaced for me in this conference has provided occasion for discussion with the AU counselling team regarding best practice and future directions. To guide our team’s conversation, we are reviewing my collected notes and resources, as well as a position paper developed by CACUSS in 2005 entitled: Personal Counselling in a Canadian Post-Secondary Setting. This paper was written by Connie Coniglio, Graham McLean, and Todd Meuser. Finally, based on the response to my presentation and my overall experience at the CACUSS 2011 conference, some possible future directions (presentations, position papers, posters) from AU at future conferences may include: 1. 	Counselling from a Distance: Review of methods for appropriately and ethically supporting students with mental health issues. This was a major topic of discussion throughout the conference, and many university/college representatives approached me as an AU staff member to discuss working with students in an e-campus/distance learning environment as opportunities for students to engage in online coursework is increasing in many institutions. As a burgeoning field, the prevalent assumption at the conference from other institutions was that AU has refined its approach in this area because of its longitudinal history/experience in the area of distance learning. I believe that there is an important opportunity for AU to be a leader in this emerging area, as well as to continue to refine its approach and understanding of what counselling is and can be in our unique environment. 2. 	Retention Issues and Counselling: Role of counsellors in a distance learning environment in assisting with the retention of students. Two workshops I attended focused on the changing role of counsellors in post-secondary institutions with the emergence of more complex mental health concerns. The topic of the role of counsellors and other support services in retention was prevalent and several universities have conducted (I believe) more informal studies to determine the role of counselling in assisting with the retention of all students, including those with more complex needs. Much of that focus appeared to revolve on financially viable ways in which support service personnel may contribute to retention and the need for increased manpower to effectively play this role. The role of counsellor at AU is somewhat unique as it blends short-term, solution-focused counselling with learning strategy support as well as prospective student contact to assist with choosing programs to fit career goals. Significant interest from other institutions was expressed to learn more about AU’s choice to blend these services. As well, the development of this would help to guide best practice for AU counselling services. 3. 	Counselling, ASD, and Academic Advising: Challenges, limitations and potential opportunities for increased collaboration of services in a distance learning environment for students with complex needs. Informal discussions, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> focused on the differences amongst institutions in the way they interact and collaborate with other support services to provide student support. Many opportunities emerged in these discussions (in particular with two other institutions). I believe a position paper or presentation based on a literature review of current best practice, as well as a reflection on an organized discussion amongst the three institutions regarding different approaches would be of great interest to our post-secondary community. AU would offer the collective perspective of the unique challenges and potential benefits within a distance learning environment. 4. 	Peer Mentorship: Potential benefits and methods for providing online peer mentorship to students in a distance learning environment. Throughout the conference a theme emerged from Peer Mentor staff as well as attending students of the success of integrating peer mentors with certain support services, particularly for first year students. I believe it would be interesting to explore what AU currently offers to students via this approach, review current literature and then develop a workshop/presentation to reflect on information to guide future discussion and possible research opportunities. Examples of guiding themes: general ethical implications of on-line forums, manpower and criteria for those who may oversee/supervise; maintenance of blogs/forums; consideration of diversity within an online forum; confidentiality/privacy issues; student response, participation and retention; effectiveness of forums already in place at other institutions… 5. 	Students with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Benefits and challenges with online/Distance learning versus the traditional classroom experience. This of course stemmed from my own presentation, my past involved with Accessibility Services in another institution with students who were enrolled in both distance learning and traditionally-delivered courses. I believe there is potential to promote distance learning as part of an overall educational experience for many students, including those individuals diagnosed with ADHD. I believe a review of current literature both on educational delivery methods and ADHD as well as learning strategy support would be of interest to many institutions that are only now entering the on-line learning delivery model. Thank you again for this tremendous opportunity. Mary Cole, M. Couns., CCC Athabasca Counselling ServicesRecent literature has finally begun to acknowledge that women diagnosed with ADHD can experience unique challenges compared to their male counterparts. Mary and Bonnie will present case studies of women with ADHD in a post-secondary environment based on their work in Student Services at Athabasca University and Mount Royal University. Scenarios will include women previously diagnosed with ADHD; women with attention regulation challenges who learn of their ADHD during their undergraduate experience; and women with co-existing diagnoses. These women have granted permission for Mary and Bonnie to share each woman’s complex experience via a short video documentary and interactive discussion with the audience. Insights as to what strategies and supports have helped them in their lifelong journey will be shared. Students have given written permission to share their experiences at this conference. Additional Information: There is a short video documentary used in the presentation chronicling the experience of 3 women with ADHD who work or learn in a post-secondary environment. Two of the women are undergraduate students, and one woman works as an Accessibility Advisor for Mount Royal University. The focus of the video is on strategies and supports which have helped them experience success. Bonnie Blankert is the professional who participated in the video and will also be co-presenting. Bonnie is also the president of CADSPPE, The Canadian Association of Disability Service Providers in Post Secondary Education. CADSPPE is under the umbrella of CACUSS (the association offering this conference). The video was made outside of my work at Mount Royal University (where I worked at that time) via my private practice - Cole & Associates Counseling Services - the women who participated in the video gave full, written permission for this video to be viewed in conference settings...|$|E
