5|$|The NY9N {{designation}} {{was originally}} created {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to replace New York State Route9W, a route assigned to an <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> of US9 from Elizabethtown to Keeseville. NY9N was extended southward to Lake George in March1936 and to Saratoga Springs in the early 1950s, supplanting several other routes (including New York State Route9K) in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{the portion of}} NY321 south of Forward Road was co-designated as part of NY20SY, a largely <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> of US20 between Skaneateles and Manlius via Syracuse. Past Sweets Corners, NY20SY {{continued}} north on a previously unnumbered roadway to NY5 at Bennetts Corners, where it joined NY5 east into Camillus. The NY20SY designation was removed in 1961, leaving Bennetts Corners Road from Forward Road to NY5 as an unnumbered roadway once again.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Boulevard Line {{was one of}} {{the first}} lines built by the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), and {{stretches}} between the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan and 179th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens. The Queens Boulevard Line was in part financed by a Public Works Administration (PWA) loan and grant of $25,000,000. One of the proposed stations would have been located at Union Turnpike. A map from June 1925 shows a proposed <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would have had the line turn via Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing via Queens Boulevard. After proceeding via Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned via Hillside Avenue. If this route were used, then Kew Gardens Road would have had to been widened to accommodate the four track line. This <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> would have provided for better access to Richmond Hill. In 1930, in anticipation of growth due to the building of the Queens Boulevard Line, several blocks of land along Queens Boulevard were rezoned so that fifteen-story apartment buildings could be built.|$|E

However, aside from some work applying these concepts to unicast flows, <b>alternate</b> path <b>routing</b> has received little attention in the Internet community. We describe and evaluate an architecture for <b>alternate</b> path <b>routing</b> for multicast flows. For path installation, we design a receiver-oriented alternate path protocol and prove that it reconfigures multicast trees without introducing loops. For path computation, we propose a scalable local search heuristic that allows receivers to find alternate paths using only partial network information. We use a simulation study to demonstrate the ability of local search to find alternate paths approximately as well as a link-state protocol, with much lower overhead. I...|$|R

M-25 was originally {{an extension of}} US25 before the latter was decommissioned in Michigan, and M-24 was once an extension of US24 before routing changes separated the two highways. M-131 was an extension of US131 until US131 was routed onto the former M-131. There was also once an M-112 that served as an <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> for US112 (both have since been changed to I-94 and US12, respectively).|$|E
5|$|By 1951, {{the highway}} had been reconstructed {{generally}} along MT 87's present location, {{and it had}} been upgraded to an improved gravel road. In 1959, the road in the location of MT 87 was rapidly improved in order to serve as an <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> to U.S. Route 287. Portions of US 287 around Hebgen Lake collapsed and crumbled {{as a result of the}} 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. After US 287 was fixed, the highway's importance decreased. In 1962, the portions of the highway from the southern terminus to present-day milepost 8.395 were reconstructed along the current location. In 1967, the rest of the highway was reconstructed along the present location. By 1987, the highway had been numbered as MT 87. The route had also been paved.|$|E
5|$|The Delaware State Route System {{includes}} Delaware's {{portion of}} the Interstate Highway System and U.S. Highway System along with state routes. The system also includes special routes of the U.S. and state routes, such as alternate, business, and truck routes. These routes consist of a banner denoting the type of special route above the route marker. Alternate routes provide a second alignment of a route between two points. DE 10 Alternate provides an <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> to DE 10 between Willow Grove and Rising Sun by passing through Woodside while DE 10 passes through Camden. Business routes pass through the business area of a city while the main route bypasses it. DE 1 Business passes through the central portion of Milford while DE 1 bypasses {{the city to the}} east. Truck routes provide an alternate route for trucks around a certain portion of a route. DE 14 Truck provides a route for truck traffic that bypasses the section of DE 14 that passes through Harrington. Suffixed routes also exist for short alignments that branch off their parent routes, in which a letter suffix is added after the route number. DE 1 has three suffixed routes in the Rehoboth Beach area while DE 9A provides access to the Port of Wilmington from DE 9. In addition to these systems are other state roads designated with a maintenance road number.|$|E

5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, the line's junction with the IND Crosstown Line in Long Island City {{would have been}} a T-junction, allowing trains from Manhattan to travel south to Brooklyn via the Crosstown line. A map from June of that year shows a proposed <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would have had the line turn via Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing via Queens Boulevard. After proceeding via Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned via Hillside Avenue. The map also shows a two-track line continuing from the Van Wyck Boulevard station to 94th Avenue (Atlantic Avenue) in Richmond Hill via Van Wyck Boulevard (today's Van Wyck Expressway). During construction only bellmouths were built for the line, however they were eventually used for the IND Archer Avenue Line. As documented by the map, the Queens Boulevard Line, as originally planned, would have had the express trains travel on a more direct route, via Broadway and Queens Boulevard, while the local trains would take a less direct route hitting larger population centers. There were to be two such instances, however only one was actually completed. The first one, which was not constructed, would have gone through Winfield (now Woodside), west of the existing Elmhurst Avenue station, and the local tracks would have diverged, continuing via Queens Broadway before turning onto 69th Street (Fisk Avenue), rejoining the express tracks at Broadway in Woodside. The second instance, the one that was built, was planned to have the local tracks continue via Broadway west of the 65th Street station, and then it would turn south via Steinway Street before rejoining the express tracks at the 36th Street station. The express tracks here would take the more direct route, via Northern Boulevard.|$|E

NY56 initially continued northwestward from Nicholville to Massena by way of Lawrenceville, North Lawrence, and Winthrop. When NY2 was redesignated as US11 in 1927, the NY2A designation was eliminated and replaced with a rerouted NY56 from Potsdam to Nicholville. NY56 was truncated to end in Potsdam as part of the change. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY56 was renumbered to NY72 while an <b>alternate</b> <b>routing</b> of NY72 between Potsdam and Hopkinton via Parishville was assigned NY72A.|$|E

40|$|VI. CONCLUSION <b>Alternate</b> path <b>routing</b> (APR) {{has been}} applied to {{telephone}} networks, ATM and the Internet to support load balancing and survivability. The potential benefits of APR make it appear to be an ideal candidate for the bandwidth limited and dynamic mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). Our investigation of APR in the MANET environment has revealed that APR can, in some circumstances, provide as much as a 40 % improvements in end-to-end traffic delay. Quite often, however, the network topology and channel characteristics severely limit what APR is able to achieve. Whereas these factors can be addressed in wired networks through the deliberate addition and rearrangement of routers and cables, this level of administration contradicts the distributed and self-organizing philosophy o...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} multipath routing in {{a mobile}} wireless network. We review {{the premise that}} a routing protocol should prefer disjoint path construction and argue that using disjoint paths limits route reliability in mobile ad hoc networks compared to using multiple loop-free paths that need not be disjoint. In a mobile ad hoc network, link lifetimes may be relatively short compared to traffic flows. The characteristics of a MANET are significantly different than the networks considered by Kleinrock in his original delay analysis of <b>alternate</b> path <b>routing.</b> In particular, on-demand routing protocols may suffer a significant delay during path discovery. We argue that a routing protocol should exploit the mesh connectivity over non-disjoint loop-free paths to improve s, t-connectedness lifetime in a mobile network. Exploiting mesh connectivity amortizes expensive path discovery operations and may lead to better performance than using disjoint or maximally disjoint paths. I...|$|R
