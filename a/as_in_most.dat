5|$|Animals such as chameleon, frog, {{flatfish}} such as {{the peacock}} flounder, squid and octopus actively change their skin patterns and colours using special chromatophore cells to resemble their current background, or, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> chameleons, for signalling.

However, the distinction can be reconstructed because Tongan kept the *l but lost the *r.|$|R

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> Sonic series games, the Chaos Emeralds {{play a major}} role; {{they help}} Shadow {{remember}} his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move more quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> oryzomyines, the central digit {{is larger than the}} two at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E

Alternately, the foregut may expand into a very {{enlarged}} crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a diverticulum, or fluid-filled structure, as in some Diptera species.|$|E

5|$|Gorgosaurus {{teeth were}} typical of all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary teeth {{at the front}} of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and D-shaped in cross section. In Gorgosaurus, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth. The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section, rather than blade-like <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30maxillary teeth and 30 to 34teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This number of teeth is similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus but is fewer than those of Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case {{is used for}} agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominativeâ€“accusative language.|$|E
5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy game set in space. Gameplay, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> real-time strategy titles, {{is focused}} on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game includes both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to accomplish before they can end the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 levels is a hand-drawn, black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers.|$|E

5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are {{colonial and}} consist of multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E
5|$|Scouting in South Africa, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> British Colonies (such as Rhodesia), was {{originally}} segregated by race.

5|$|Some {{features}} of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In Transandinomys talamancae, {{a single pair of}} preputial glands is present at the penis. As is usual for sigmodontines, there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands. Part {{of the end of the}} vesicular gland is irregularly folded, not smooth <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> oryzomyines.|$|E

5|$|The beech {{forests of}} Riis Skov and Marselisborg occupy the hills {{along the coast}} {{to the north and}} south, and apart from the city centre, sandy beaches form the {{coastline}} of the entire municipality. There are two public seabaths, the northern Den Permanente below Riis Skov and close to the harbour area, and the southern Ballehage Beach in the Marselisborg Forests. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> of Denmark, there are no private beaches in the municipality, but access to Den Permanente requires a membership, except in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the cheetah is 38, the same <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other felids (though for the ocelot and the margay {{the number is}} 36). A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low genetic variability in comparison to other felids. Consequently, individuals show considerable genetic similarity to one another, as illustrated by skin grafts, electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys. A prolonged period of inbreeding, following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age, {{is believed to be}} the reason behind this anomaly. The consequences of such genetic uniformity might include a low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, deformed flagella, difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The bony palate is long and extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which perforate the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E

5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> other fish, is {{the transfer of}} gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the two stanzas of the chorale is identical. The tune {{is not a simple}} four-part setting <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> of Bach's later cantatas, but the voices are {{embedded}} in a concerto of the orchestra, led by violin I and oboe I. The instrumental theme is derived from the first line of the chorale tune.|$|E
5|$|Well-to-do men {{wore the}} Petha or Kulavi, a tall turban made of silk and {{decorated}} with gold. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> Indian societies, jewellery was used {{by men and women}} and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of rose water, civet musk, musk or sandalwood. In stark contrast to the commoners whose lives were modest, the lives of the empire's kings and queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court. Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery, their daily duties being light.|$|E
