500|$|Apollo 5 (AS-204) was {{the first}} {{unmanned}} test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB {{that would have been}} used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in <b>abort</b> <b>mode,</b> known as a [...] "fire-in-the-hole" [...] test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second unmanned test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be manned.|$|E

50|$|The EDS {{is enabled}} for the pad abort (beginning 5 minutes prior to launch) through <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> IB phases. Beginning in mode IC, the EDS is {{switched}} off and aborts must be commanded manually.|$|E
50|$|S-IVB to orbit: As in Mode III, {{the failing}} S-II would be jettisoned early, but Earth orbit {{insertion}} {{is now possible}} by the S-IVB alone. Other than not using the SM engine, this is identical to a Mode III abort. This <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> ends with normal S-II jettison.|$|E
50|$|There {{were four}} intact <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> for the Space Shuttle. Intact aborts were {{designed}} to provide a safe return of the orbiter to a planned landing site or to a lower orbit than planned for the mission.|$|R

50|$|In {{the event}} of catastrophic failure, the Soyuz {{spacecraft}} has a series of automated and semi-automated <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> to rescue the crew.

25|$|For {{the first}} two {{unmanned}} launches, eight solid-fuel ullage motors ignited for four seconds to give positive acceleration to the S-II stage, followed by start of the five J-2 engines. For the first seven manned Apollo missions only four ullage motors were used on the S-II, and they were eliminated completely for the final four launches. About 30 seconds after first stage separation, the interstage ring dropped from the second stage. This was done with an inertially fixed attitude so that the interstage, only 1 meter from the outboard J-2 engines, would fall cleanly without contacting them. Shortly after interstage separation the Launch Escape System was also jettisoned. See Apollo <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> {{for more information about}} the various <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> that could have been used during a launch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{moment at}} which an ATO became {{possible}} {{was referred to}} as the [...] "press to ATO" [...] moment. In an ATO situation, the spacecraft commander rotated the cockpit <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> switch to the ATO position and depressed the abort push button. This initiated the flight control software routines which handled the abort. In the event of a loss of communications, the spacecraft commander could have made the abort decision and taken action independently.|$|E
50|$|Once the shuttle's SRBs were ignited, {{the vehicle}} was {{committed}} to liftoff. If an event requiring an abort happened after SRB ignition, {{it was not possible}} to begin the abort until after SRB burnout and separation about two minutes after launch. There were five abort modes available during ascent, divided into the categories of intact aborts and contingency aborts.The choice of <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> depended on how urgent the situation was, and what emergency landing site could be reached.|$|E
50|$|The problem {{occurred}} at 01:23 GMT while the KURS-NA system was being activated. The issue forced the spacecraft into a passive <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> as designed under safety protocols. At {{the time of}} the abort ISS and Progress were flying 9.3 miles apart. Two orbits after the abort, Russian flight controllers commanded the automated rendezvous system to re-activate for the collection of data. A second redocking attempt had to be delayed till 28 July to de-conflict {{with the arrival of the}} Japanese Kounotori 3 spacecraft at the ISS on 27 July.|$|E
50|$|Responsible for {{the flight}} path of the space vehicle, both {{atmospheric}} and orbital. During lunar missions the FDO was also responsible for the lunar trajectory.

50|$|The <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> {{covered a}} wide range of {{potential}} problems, but the most commonly expected problem was a Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) failure, causing the vehicle to have insufficient thrust to achieve its planned orbit. Other possible non-engine failures necessitating an abort included a multiple auxiliary power unit (APU) failure, a cabin leak, and an external tank leak.|$|R

50|$|The LES {{included}} three wires that {{ran down the}} exterior of the launch vehicle. If the signals from any two of the wires were lost, the LES would activate automatically. Alternatively, the Commander could activate the system manually using one of two translation controller handles, which were switched to a special <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> for launch. When activated, the LES would fire a solid fuel escape rocket, and open a canard system to direct the Command Module away from, and off the path of, a launch vehicle in trouble. The LES would then jettison and the Command Module would land with its parachute recovery system.|$|E
50|$|Upon descent stage {{separation}} and ascent engine ignition, the Lunar Module began to roll violently because the crew accidentally duplicated commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of <b>abort</b> <b>mode,</b> the correct configuration for this maneuver. The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining {{control of the}} LM. Cernan has said he observed the horizon spinning eight times over, indicating eight rolls of the spacecraft under ascent engine power. While the incident was downplayed by NASA, the roll was just several revolutions from being unrecoverable, which {{would have resulted in}} the LM crashing into the lunar surface.|$|E
50|$|In early Soyuz models {{there were}} two <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> in the time ranging from the {{ejection}} of the launch escape system until orbit. One called for separation of only the upper two modules and a controlled descent and could be initiated before about t+522s, the other separated all three and underwent a ballistic descent after t+522.|$|R
50|$|The four <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> {{would also}} be used if the Max Launch Abort System (MLAS), a {{proposed}} alternative to the LAS, is flown {{in place of the}} LAS. The MLAS, which resembles the LAS, but without the Soyuz-like rocket tower, uses a strengthened boost protective cover, but with the main rockets placed inside of the BPC itself.|$|R
25|$|SpaceShipOne {{takes off}} from the ground, {{attached}} to White Knight in a parasite configuration, and under White Knight's power. The combination of SpaceShipOne and White Knight can take off, land, and fly under jet power to high altitude. A captive carry flight is one where the two craft land together without launching SpaceShipOne; {{this is one of}} the main <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> available.|$|R
50|$|After 1980, {{but before}} the 2010s, two orbital launch {{vehicles}} developed the capability {{to return to the}} launch site (RTLS). Both the US Space Shuttle—with one of its abort modes—and the Soviet Buranhad a designed-in capability to return a part of the launch vehicle to the launch site via the mechanism of horizontal-landing of the spaceplane portion of the launch vehicle. In both cases, the main vehicle thrust structure and the large propellant tank were expendable, as had been the standard procedure for all orbital launch vehicles flown prior to that time. Both were subsequently demonstrated on actual orbital nominal flights, although both also had an <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> during launch that could conceivably allow the crew to land the spaceplane following an off-nominal launch.|$|E
50|$|At 3 minutes 31 seconds {{into the}} ascent, {{one of the}} central engine's two {{high-pressure}} fuel turbopump turbine discharge temperature sensors failed. 2 minutes and 12 seconds later, the second sensor failed, causing the shutdown of the central engine. This was the only in-flight main-engine failure of the Shuttle program. Approximately 8 minutes into the flight, one of the same temperature sensors in the right engine failed, and the remaining right-engine temperature sensor displayed readings near the redline for engine shutdown. Booster Systems Engineer Jenny M. Howard acted quickly to command the crew to inhibit any further automatic SSME shutdowns based on readings from the remaining sensors, preventing the potential shutdown of a second engine and a possible <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> that may have resulted in the loss of the vehicle and crew.|$|E
5000|$|Return {{to launch}} site (RTLS) {{was the first}} <b>abort</b> <b>mode</b> {{available}} and could be selected just after SRB jettison. The Shuttle would continue downrange to burn excess propellant, as well as pitch up to maintain vertical speed in aborts with an SSME failure. After burning sufficient propellant, the vehicle would be pitched {{all the way around}} and begin thrusting back towards the launch site. This maneuver was called the [...] "powered pitcharound" [...] (PPA) and was timed to ensure less than 2% propellant remained in the external tank by the time the Shuttle's trajectory brought it back to the Kennedy Space Center. Additionally, the Shuttle's OMS and reaction control system (RCS) motors would continuously thrust to burn off excess OMS propellant to reduce landing weight and adjust the orbiter's center of gravity.|$|E
50|$|During {{the launch}} of an Apollo {{spacecraft}} by the Saturn IB or Saturn V rocket, the flight could be aborted to rescue the crew if the rocket failed catastrophically. Depending on how far the flight had progressed, they would use different procedures or modes. None of these launch <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> was ever used {{on any of the}} fifteen manned Apollo spacecraft flights.|$|R
50|$|The earlier Apollo {{system had}} various <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> {{depending}} on altitude, velocity, and other circumstances. Likewise the Orion will have similar {{modes of operation}} for its launch performance aborts. Some of these may not use the LAS itself, but would use {{the second stage of}} the Ares I, or even the Orion vehicle's own propulsion system (the Aerojet AJ-10 engine) instead.|$|R
50|$|SpaceShipOne {{takes off}} from the ground, {{attached}} to White Knight in a parasite configuration, and under White Knight's power. The combination of SpaceShipOne and White Knight can take off, land, and fly under jet power to high altitude. A captive carry flight is one where the two craft land together without launching SpaceShipOne; {{this is one of}} the main <b>abort</b> <b>modes</b> available.|$|R
