It is also an effective anxiolytic in both animal studies and human trials, although with some side effects at higher doses.|$|E
40|$|Nausea and/or {{vomiting}} affect 50 % of all pregnant women. For most women, {{this is a}} self-limited {{problem which}} responds well to conservative management. However, there are some situations where the risk to the mother and fetus posed by the illness are greater than the possible risks of teratogenicity of <b>antinauseant</b> drugs. Antihistamines have had the widest testing, and to date, {{there has been no}} evidence linking doxylamine, dimenhydrinate or promethazine to congenital malformations. Since no available drugs have official approval for use in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy the physician is left alone to make this difficult decision...|$|E
40|$|Doxyiamine succinate, a drug {{used as a}} sleep-inducing agent, an antihistamine, and in a {{therapeutic}} formulation taken by pregnant women as an <b>antinauseant,</b> was scheduled for toxicological evaluation {{as part of a}} struc-ture activity relationship study, with rats and mice, because a deficiency of such data exists with regard to many antihietamlnes. Analytical chemical procedures that ensure proper concentration, homogeneity, and stability of the drug in dosed feed, as well as the safety of person* nel and the environment, were prerequisites for the tox-icological tests. GC methods using a rubidium-sensitized nitrogen detector were developed for analysis of dox-ylamine succinate in animal feed, human urine, and wastewater at levels as low as 1 ppm, 100 ppb, and too ppb, respectively. Sample extracts were cleaned up by liquid-liquid partitioning, followed by additional cleanup on a column of silica gel. Data are presented concerning the stability of the drug in animal feed, extraction efficien-cies, {{and the use of the}} silica gel cleanup column to separate the caffeine interference from doxylamine in ex-tracts of human urine. Partition values and ancillary data concerning analysis of the drug in feed, by HPLC at levels as low as 10 ppm, are also reported...|$|E

40|$|WE REPORT A CASE INVOLVING AN 81 -YEAR-OLD {{man with}} {{schizoaffective}} disorder who presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) after {{an increase in}} his neuroleptic dose. NMS, a rare but potentially fatal complication of neuroleptic medications (e. g., antipsychotics, sedatives and <b>antinauseants),</b> is characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, an elevated creatine kinase level and autonomic instability. The syndrome often develops after a sudden increase in dosage of the neuroleptic medication or in states of dehydration. Treatment is mainly supportive and includes withdrawal of the neuroleptic medication and, possibly, administration of drugs such as dantrolene and bromocriptine. Complications of NMS include acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure. Given the widespread prescription of neuroleptics by physicians {{in a variety of}} fields, all physicians {{need to be able to}} recognize and appropriately manage NMS...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Monitoring {{appropriate}} {{categories of}} medication sales can provide early warning of certain disease outbreaks. This paper presents a methodology for choosing and monitoring medication sales relevant for the surveillance of gastroenteritis and assesses the operational {{characteristics of the}} selected medications for early warning. METHODS: Acute diarrhoea incidences in mainland France {{were obtained from the}} Sentinelles network surveillance system for the period 2000 - 2009. Medication sales grouped by therapeutic classes were obtained on the same period. Hierarchical clustering was used to select therapeutic classes correlating with disease incidence over the period. Alert thresholds were defined for the selected therapeutic classes. Single and multiple voter algorithms were investigated for outbreak detection based on sales crossing the thresholds. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated respective to known outbreaks periods. RESULTS: Four therapeutic classes were found to cluster with acute diarrhoea incidence. The therapeutic class other antiemetic and <b>antinauseants</b> had the best sensitivity (100 %) and timeliness (1. 625 weeks before official alerts), for a false alarm rate of 5 %. Multiple voter algorithm was the most efficient with the rule: 'Emit an outbreak alert when at least three therapeutic classes are over their threshold' (sensitivity 100 %, specificity 95 %, timeliness 1. 750 weeks before official alerts). CONCLUSIONS: The presented method allowed selection of relevant therapeutic classes for surveillance of a specific condition. Multiple voter algorithm based on several therapeutic classes performed slightly better than the best therapeutic class alone, while improving robustness against abrupt changes occurring in a single therapeutic class...|$|R
40|$|To the Editor: Nabilone is a {{synthetic}} annabinoid {{used as an}} <b>antinauseant,</b> primarily for patients undergoing chemotherapy. It differs structurally from A'-THC in that its C ring is saturated and contains a C 9 ketone group. The nabilone side chain has a dimethylheptyl group, instead of the n-pentyl side chain of THC (1). As a side effect it, like THC, can produce uphoria (2). Although used primarily with inpatients, nabilone {{has the potential for}} illicit use. During the development of a sensitive thin-layer chromatographic assay for screening for THC-COOH in urine, it was observed that pure nabilone gave a pink band with Fast Blue BB visualizing agent (3). Migration of nabilone, however, was different han THC-COOH on the TLC plate. Nabilone was also studied for potential cross-reactivity on the Abbott TDx cannabinoids a say which is considered very specific for THC-COOH. Blank urine fortified at 100 and 1000 ng/mL with nabilone gave apparent cannabinoid values of 17 and 42 ng/mL, respectively, on the TDx (4). Pharmacokinetic studies (I, 5) indicate however, that very little, if any, nabilone is excreted unchanged in the urine. Approximately 65 % of a dose is eliminated in the feces and about 20 % in the urine as several polar acidic metabolites. Unfortunately, the major urinary metabolite (carbinol metabolite) was not available from Lilly Research Laboratories...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} important side effects in patients with malignant disease who were receiving high doses of morphine {{as part of their}} palliative treatment. DESIGN [...] Data on patients were collected over 12 months. SETTING [...] Two palliative care units in Western Australia. PATIENTS [...] 19 Patients with malignant disease who were receiving morphine either subcutaneously or orally as the main analgesic. 10 Patients receiving a total daily dose of morphine of at least 500 mg orally or 250 mg parenterally were enrolled in the study. The other 9 patients were enrolled after an important problem thought {{to be related to the}} morphine had been identified. All of the patients were taking drugs to supplement the treatment. INTERVENTIONS [...] The dose of morphine or route of administration, or both, was changed in three patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Determination of the prevalence of side effects in the patients. Assessment of the relation of any side effects with the supplemental drugs taken by the patients. MAIN RESULTS [...] Plasma morphine and electrolyte concentrations were measured and a full history taken for each patient. Thirteen of the 19 patients had an important side effect; 12 of them had myoclonus and one had hyperalgesia of the skin. Plasma morphine concentrations were similar in patients with and without myoclonus, ranging from 158 to 3465 nmol/l and 39 to 2821 nmol/l respectively. Eight of the patients with side effects were taking an antipsychotic drug concurrently compared with none of those without side effects. A greater proportion of patients with side effects were taking the <b>antinauseant</b> drug thiethylperazine (6 / 13 v 2 / 6) and at least one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (10 / 13 v 2 / 6), whereas a smaller proportion were taking a glucocorticosteroid (3 / 13 v 4 / 6). The estimated prevalence of important side effects in the total population of patients receiving palliative treatment in the two units was 2. 7 - 3. 6 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] Myoclonus as a side effect of treatment with morphine is more likely to occur in patients taking antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs as antiemetics or as adjuvant agents or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for additional analgesia. If a patient develops myoclonus the best approach may be to change the supplemental treatment...|$|E
