In cooling mode, the cool supply air, typically around 55 °F (13 °C) (saturated) at design conditions, exits an outlet at high velocity. The high velocity supply <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> causes <b>turbulence</b> causing the room air to mix with the supply air. Because the entire room is near-fully mixed, temperature variations are small while the contaminant concentration is fairly uniform throughout the entire room. Diffusers are normally used as the air outlets to create the high velocity supply <b>air</b> <b>stream.</b> Most often, the air outlets and inlets are placed in the ceiling. Supply diffusers in the ceiling are fed by fan coil units in the ceiling void or by air handling units in a remote plant room. The fan coil or handling unit take in return air from the ceiling void and mix this with fresh air and cool, or heat it, as required to achieve the room design conditions. This arrangement is known as 'conventional room air distribution'.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{aerodynamic}} control of long-span suspension bridges {{and seek to}} raise the critical flutter wind speeds, while simultaneously suppressing buffeting. The control system design study {{is based on a}} simple flexible bridge section model that interacts with a constant-velocity <b>air</b> <b>stream.</b> A streamlined bridge deck is assumed and non-steady thin aerofoil theory is used to describe the interactions between the bridge deck and the <b>air</b> <b>stream.</b> Classical <b>turbulence</b> models, first developed in the aircraft industry, are used to model the buffet forces acting on the deck. While a wide variety of control systems is possible, we focus on a compensation scheme that can be implemented using passive mechanical components such as springs, dampers and a rack and pinion mechanism. A single-loop control system is investigated that controls a trailing-edge flap by sensing movements of the bridge deck; several such mechanisms are contemplated. The first finding is that the critical wind speed for flutter can be greatly increased, with good robustness characteristics, through passive feedback control. It is also possible simultaneously to suppress flutter using the same passive mechanical controller by solving a passive mixed H 2 /H control problem. The effect of flexible controller mounting arrangements are considered briefly. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Speech {{sound is}} {{a wave of}} air that {{originates}} from complex actions of the human body, which are supported by three functional units: generation of air pressure, regulation of vibrations, and control of resonators. The lung air pressure for speech results from accessory functions of the respiratory system during a prolonged phase of expiration after a short inhalation. Vibrations of air for voiced sounds are introduced by the vocal folds in the larynx: they are controlled {{by a set of}} laryngealmuscles and airflow from the lungs. The oscillations of the vocal folds convert the expiratory air into intermittent airflow pulses that result in a buzzing sound. The narrow constrictions of the airway along the tract above the larynx also generate transient source sounds: their pressure gives rise to <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> with <b>turbulence</b> or burst noises. The resonators are formed in the upper respiratory tract by the pharyngeal, oral, and nasal cavities. These cavities act as resonance chambers to transform the laryngeal buzz or turbulence noises into the sounds with special linguistic qualities. The main articulators are the tongue, lower jaw, lips, and velum. They generate patterned movements to alter the resonance characteristics of the supra-laryngeal airway. In this chapter, contemporary views on phonatory and articulatory mechanisms are summarized to illustrate the physiological processes of speech production, with brief notes on their observation techniques...|$|R

40|$|In this Master Thesis {{the effect}} of free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence</b> has been {{investigated}} on a model wind turbine's performance characteristics and the wake development downstream. The experiment {{took place in the}} recirculating wind tunnel in the Fluid Mechanics building at NTNU, and the model wind turbine that was used had a diameter of 0, 9 meter. A turbulence-generating grid with a mesh size of 0, 24 meters produced a turbulence intensity of 5, 5 % in front of the wind turbine, which corresponds to atmospheric turbulence levels offshore. The experimental results with free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence</b> were compared to the results without free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence.</b> A reference wind speed of approximately 10 m/s were used in all the experiments. The wind turbine is operating most efficiently at TSR= 6, and the peak power coefficient without free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence</b> was Cp= 0, 461, while it was Cp= 0, 45 with free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence.</b> Hence, the power coefficient seemed to be slightly reduced with increased levels of turbulence, except at low tip speed ratios where {{the effect of}} stall dominated. The free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence</b> has two opposite effects on the power extraction of the wind turbine, and this may be the reason why the peak power coefficient was only reduced by 2, 4 % with free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence,</b> which was lower than expected. Increased levels of turbulence increase the drag on the turbine blades, which reduces the power extraction. Simultaneously, the power extraction is proportional to the square of the relative velocity at the blades, which increases with higher levels of turbulence. Wake measurements were performed with a hot wire which measured the velocities and the normal stresses in the streamwise direction. The measurements were done across the wake at the distances 1, 3 and 5 rotor diameters downstream of the wind turbine. The thrust coefficients at TSR= 6 are almost identical both with and without free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence,</b> and the velocity profiles just behind the rotor are therefore also almost identical. However, the effect of the free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence</b> is clearly seen downstream in the wake, where velocity gradients, inhomogeneities and the kinetic energy in the tip vortices are smoothed and more spread out with free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence.</b> This is due to increased turbulent diffusion, which is increasing the radial transport of momentum in the wake. The velocity profiles in the wake hence become flatter and broader, and the wake recovers faster with higher levels of turbulence. Even though the power extraction is slightly reduced with free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence,</b> it seems like the effect on the recovery of the wake is larger, which will lead to higher power extraction and lower fatigue loads on a downwind turbine. Increased levels of ambient turbulence will therefore probably increase the total power output in a wind farm. The length scale of the turbulence produced from the grid was approximately 0, 2 meters, which was about 5 - 6 times smaller than desired compared to a wind turbine in the free atmosphere. The effect of the free <b>stream</b> <b>turbulence</b> on the performance characteristics and wake development of the model wind turbine might therefore be smaller than for a wind turbine in an open environment, and further studies should therefore be performed to investigate this effect. </p...|$|R

Measurements were made around a 1 / 2 -inch heated sphere in the plane of the equator normal to a stream whose velocity was 16 feet per second. Point air temperatures in the boundary layer of the sphere were predicted from the indications of a 0. 001 -inch diameter thermocouple with wires of platinum and platinum alloyed with 10 % rhodium. The method employed also determined the heat transfer coefficients for the thermocouple wire in the boundary layer. These local heat transfer coefficients are lower than those observed in a uniform stream whose velocity is equal to the local velocity in the boundary layer. Part II: The local convective heat transfer from a heated sphere 0. 5 inch in diameter was determined by means of temperature gradients measured in the boundary layer. Point temperatures were obtained in the boundary layer with a 0. 001 -inch diameter thermocouple mounted on a probe. The sphere was suspended in <b>air</b> <b>streams</b> at velocities of 4, 8, 16, and 32 feet per second and at a turbulence level of 0. 013.

40|$|The local {{convective}} {{thermal transfer}} from a spherical surface in an <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> was experimentally investigated {{by measuring the}} temperature distribution in the <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> surrounding the sphere. The investigation {{was carried out in}} an <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> of known <b>turbulence</b> level at bulk velocities of 8 and 16 feet per second using two different half-inch spheres. The local thermal flux over the spherical surface was calculated from the detailed measurements of temperature distribution in the air close to the surface. These results are compared with available experimental results obtained at higher velocities with larger spheres. In the forward region of the sphere from the stagnation point up to an angle of about 80 [degrees], the experimental radial temperature distributions are correlated empirically in terms of the displacement thickness of the thermal boundary layer. Over this region the experimental and correlated results are compared in terms of the Nusselt and Reynolds numbers with the results of theoretical analyses based on the laminar boundary layer theory. There is satisfactory agreement with the theoretical results obtained by the method of Drake and the application of the solutions of Eckert. The integrated values of thermal transfer are in agreement with the gross values obtained from simultaneous over-all measurements. There is also fair agreement between the integrated results and available published information on the gross thermal transfer from a sphere. A detailed knowledge of the distribution of temperature, thermal flux, and the pressure gradients associated with the turbulent flow of fluids is of importance in creating a background of experimental facts from which it is possible to predict the transfer characteristics for a particular physical situation. Special methods and equipment employed in the measurement and control of temperature and thermal flux in an investigation of thermal transfer in turbulent gas streams are described. Measurements of the thermal flux and the pressure gradient are presented {{as a function of the}} imposed temperature distribution and macroscopic flow rate. They extend from gross velocities of 10 to 90 feet per second and to average temperature gradients as high as 1000 [degrees] F. per foot. The results represent a contribution to the knowledge of the shear and the thermal flux associated with the nonisothermal flow of air between parallel plates. As expected, the thermal transfer coefficients for nonuniform transfer are larger than those obtained in this work under conditions of uniform transfer. The region near the boundary of a turbulently flowing fluid accounts for the greater part of the resistance to thermal transfer to or from the stream. An understanding of the influence of conditions of flow upon the temperature distribution near the boundary of turbulently flowing streams is required in order to permit the recent advances in fluid mechanics to be applied to the prediction of thermal transfer in steady flow. The detailed temperature distribution near the boundary of a turbulent <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> flowing between parallel plates was measured at gross velocities from 10 to 90 feet per second and for average temperature gradients as high as 1000 [degrees] F. per foot.
