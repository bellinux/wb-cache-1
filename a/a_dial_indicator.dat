40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the tire tread viscoelastic characteristics, especially by means of non-destructive procedures, is a particularly interesting topic for motorsport teams and companies, used to work with unknown and confidential compounds.

Because a centerless grinding line has typically three grinding machines the operator must be in complete control and must prevent blockages in transfers, grinding exits and packing areas, also size and quality must constantly be checked, so the operator is always alert while operating the line and checking for problems and quality issues.|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} {{described}} in this Thesis some attempt {{has been made to}} correlate the structures, mode of preparation and ageing of polymers with their electrical properties. The electrical properties investigated were the insulating as opposed to the dielectric properties. The electrical parameters monitored were conduction currents at temperatures from 20 ° - 100 ° C, breakdown voltages under steady fields and lastly internal discharges under alternating fields. The hardness of the polymers were determined using <b>a</b> modified <b>dial</b> <b>indicator.</b> The molecular structure and structural charges due to polymerisation were studied by infrared absorption spectra. Thermosetting polymers were prepared under controlled conditions. They were self polymerising diallyl esters or co-polymers with diethyl fumarate.

For the discharge measurements the E. R. A. discharge detector was modified from a purely visual display to one in which the discharge pulses could be extracted and analysed by use of a pulse height analyser. The results indicate that the current flow in the polymer is dependent on the conversion of monomer to polymer. The change in conductivity with both electric stress and temperature is clearly demonstrated and activation energies for electric conduction are calculated. The relation between breakdown strength and hardness is shown. Finally a mechanism of current flow is discussed...|$|R

50|$|For {{its first}} use in combat, during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, the Rogers train {{substituted}} a new telegraph instrument, the Beardslee Patent Magneto-Electric Field Telegraph Machine, invented by George W. Beardslee of New York. This instrument required no battery, using instead a hand-cranked generator, {{but it was}} also based on <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> <b>indicator.</b> The Beardslee telegraph was housed in a wooden chest with handles and weighed about 100 pounds. It had two significant technical deficiencies, however. Its generator could not produce enough electricity to transmit signals more than about 5 to 8 miles. More seriously, there was a tendency for the sending and receiving index pointers to get out of synchronization, hopelessly garbling transmitted messages. Broken machines had to be sent back to New York City for repair. It was these deficiencies that led Myer to his decision to use traditional Morse key technology and attempt to hire trained telegraphers, a decision that led Secretary Stanton to dismiss him as chief signal officer. All of the telegraph train assets of the Signal Corps were turned over to the Military Telegraph Service, but they did not use the Beardslee telegraph due to its unreliability. At their peak of usage in 1863, there were 30 telegraph trains in the field.|$|E
5000|$|Telegraph trains were {{introduced}} by Myer to support telegraphy for mobile operations. The horse-drawn wagons carried the telegraph sets and supplies such as reels of {{insulated copper wire}} and iron lances, for stringing temporary field lines, a practice called [...] "flying telegraph lines." [...] Each train consisted of two wagons, equipped with 5 miles of wire and a telegraph instrument. The first model train was constructed by Henry J. Rogers, a telegraphic engineer from New York City {{who had worked with}} Samuel F.B. Morse in building the first commercial telegraph line between Washington and Baltimore in 1844. Rogers's original telegraph instrument for the train replaced the traditional sending key and sound receiver with <b>a</b> <b>dial</b> <b>indicator,</b> a circular index plate bearing the letters of the alphabet and a pointer that turned to the letter to be transmitted. A similar pointer spelled out the message at the receiving end. Rogers provided a galvanic battery that eliminated the danger of acid spills. This equipment eliminated the need for skilled operators who had to be trained in Morse code. Field trials in February 1862 found that it worked satisfactorily over a test circuit of 2 miles of wire. A board of three signal officers recommended that such a train would be of great use as an auxiliary to permanent telegraph lines.|$|E

This research had done by flank wear experiment to the HSS cutting tools. The specimens were BOHLER RAPID EXTRA 1200 with 3 / 8 x 4 ” on size made in Austria and Taiwan.
