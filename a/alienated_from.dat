5|$|By 1816, the Shelleys {{were living}} in Italy and in 1818 and 1819, two of their young {{children}} died, Clara and William.

Mary Shelley revived a bit with the birth of Percy Florence later in 1819.|$|E
5|$|In March 1818 the Shelleys {{moved to}} Italy, where their two young children, Clara and William, soon died. Mary {{entered into a}} deep {{depression}} and became <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> Percy. She recovered to some extent {{with the birth of}} Percy Florence later in 1819.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{definition}} kept Pluto as a planet. Pluto's planetary status {{was and is}} fondly thought of by many, especially in the United States since Pluto was found by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, {{and the general public}} could have been <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> professional astronomers; there was considerable uproar when the media last suggested, in 1999, that Pluto might be demoted, which was a misunderstanding of a proposal to catalog all trans-Neptunian objects uniformly.|$|E
60|$|Q. What {{is it to}} be spiritually dead?--A. To be <b>alienate</b> <b>from</b> God, and to {{live without}} him in the world, through the ignorance that is in man, and {{through the power of}} their sins (Eph 4:18,19).|$|R
50|$|Valeriya Gai Germanika {{was born}} and {{registered}} Valeriya, named after Lucius Cornelius Sulla's wife Valeria, and later legally changed her given name, patronymic (to <b>alienate</b> <b>from</b> the biological father) and family name (in a Roman style) upon her adolescence.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the aims}} of {{environmental}} education is to make students take responsibility for protecting the environment and to lead them have nature friendly behaviors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to present primary science teacher candidates’ perceptions of nature and ideas about <b>alienating</b> <b>from</b> nature. The data was conducted with 44 students who have been studying in Siirt University Faculty of Education Primary Science Teaching Department in Turkey. The data was analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis and content analysis. The results of the study showed that most of the teacher candidates perceived nature as a living space and they stated that the reasons of <b>alienating</b> <b>from</b> nature were busy school, lesson and work schedule, depletion of natural resources and lands, and excessive urbanization...|$|R
5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. <b>Alienated</b> <b>from</b> his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E
5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
5000|$|Denston Hall is a grade II listed building, {{and became}} officially listed on 19 December 1961. The local {{authority}} that listed this building was St. Edmundsbury Borough Council.

5|$|Brodie was {{a native}} of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish {{immigrants}} who was <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> both his family and his family's religion. A bright, emotional graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections. Out of consideration for her mother, Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn's mother attended. None of Brodie's family did.|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> him {{and left his}} organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, framing Lépine's actions {{as the result}} of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E

5|$|The French {{government}} {{claimed that}} it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called repatriates to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> both Algeria and France.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} 1989 when a meteor shower hits Smallville; {{at the same}} time a small spacecraft, {{containing}} an alien boy, crashes in front of Jonathan and Martha Kent's (played by John Schneider and Annette O'Toole) truck. They adopt the superhumanly powerful child and name him Clark. Gough and Millar use this opening scene to establish that the three lead characters of the series, Clark, Lana and Lex, share a common bond—they are all without one or both parents: Clark is the only survivor of his homeworld; Lana's parents are killed in the meteor shower; and Lex is <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> his father, Lionel Luthor (John Glover), after being rendered bald by the meteor blast.|$|E
5|$|When Bahá'u'lláh {{returned}} to Baghdad {{he saw that}} the Bábí community had become disheartened and divided. During Bahá'u'lláh's absence, it had become <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> the religion because Mirza Yahya had continued his policy of militancy and had been unable to provide effective leadership. Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the Báb against the Báb's clear instructions; dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the Shah; and instigated violence against prominent Bábís who had challenged his leadership.|$|E

5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Haiko, {{the family moved to}} a rented house in Porvoo where, in August 1917, Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, her only son and the heir to the dynasty. The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E
5|$|Bure {{held out}} {{well into the}} 1998–99 season until he was traded on January 17, 1999, to the Florida Panthers, with Bret Hedican, Brad Ference, and Vancouver's third-round choice in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft (Robert Fried) for Ed Jovanovski, Dave Gagner, Mike Brown, Kevin Weekes, and Florida's first-round choice in the 2000 draft (Nathan Smith). Talks between Burke and Bryan Murray, {{general manager of the}} Panthers, had begun in late-December. After the trade was completed, Bure {{explained}} that he felt <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> Canucks' management after arriving in North America having defected from Russia. He claimed he had been in Los Angeles for two weeks before any Canucks' representative came to see him, as well as several bitter contract negotiationsparticularly those of 1994. He also claimed that someone within the Canucks' management planted the constant allegations that he threatened not to play during the 1994 playoff run. Bure's agent at the time, Ron Salcer, also believed the story.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, the seventeen-year-old Mary Shelley (Mary Godwin, at the time) ran {{off with}} Percy Bysshe Shelley to {{continental}} Europe, accompanied by Claire Clairmont, Mary's stepsister. After six weeks of travelling, they returned to England but continued to live together. Mary returned pregnant with Percy's child, but their infant daughter died soon after her premature birth. Percy was <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> his family and received little financial support from them; he was therefore harassed by creditors. In 1816, Mary and Percy had a second child, William. The same year, Claire Clairmont began an affair with the poet Lord Byron, and in January 1817 she had a daughter by him, Allegra. The group spent the summer of 1817 with Byron at Lake Geneva, where Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. That fall, Percy's wife, Harriet, committed suicide, and in December Percy and Mary were married. In September 1817, Mary and Percy had another child, Clara.|$|E
50|$|Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is {{supposed}} to have a tripartite name. Single mothers can give their children any patronym, this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship may choose not to have a patronym. Nowadays, an adult person is entitled to legally change their patronymic if necessary for any reason, for instance in order to <b>alienate</b> <b>from</b> the biological father (or show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for their underage child.|$|R

5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, Gates {{and other}} {{officials}} viewed the Corps as fraught with internal squabbling and <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> the other services. Because of this condition, combined with the reputation gained from the Ribbon Creek incident, {{it was decided that}} Pate needed to be replaced. Gates believed Shoup was a strong leader who could steer the Corps in the right direction. Shoup was selected over five lieutenant generals and four major generals senior to him in rank. Lieutenant General Merrill B. Twining was considered the likely appointee to the position; Lieutenant Generals Edward Pollock and Vernon E. Megee also aspired to the position of Commandant. Twining openly vied for the position and retired immediately after Shoup was selected, reportedly in protest, as did several other officers. Shoup emphasized military readiness, training, and inter-service cooperation, which differed from the political climate of the time. He rapidly gained a reputation as being extremely demanding and critical of poor performance, especially by Marine generals and leaders. He was sometimes blunt in his criticism of what he saw as poorly performing officers, to the extent that some considered him a bully.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, John {{accompanied}} the Nicaeans in their rapid {{occupation of the}} Epirote domains, but he quickly became <b>alienated</b> <b>from</b> them. He brought his own followers to Vonitsa, from where he contacted his father, who had taken refuge in the Ionian Islands. Michael accepted his son's apologies, and soon joined him on the mainland. Byzantine control over Epirus {{had not yet been}} consolidated, and father and son were quickly able to recapture the Epirote capital of Arta and then relieve the besieged city of Ioannina. Within a short time, the Nicaeans had been evicted from Epirus. John's half-brother Nikephoros was then sent in spring 1260 to recover Thessaly, which he mostly accomplished after defeating and capturing the Nicaean general Alexios Strategopoulos. Part of eastern Thessaly, however, around Demetrias, Velestino, Halmyros, and Pharsalos, remained in Nicaean hands for several years thereafter. Again, despite his association with Thessaly, John is not mentioned as playing a role in these events or in the administration of the Thessalian territories in the early 1260s, which seem rather to have been under the control of Nikephoros.|$|E
