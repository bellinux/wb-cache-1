5000|$|Austin Walker of GameSpot {{considered}} {{the lack of}} an overhead option as encouraging a [...] "slow, dreary march forward" [...] approach, while deeming the level design [...] "uninspired" [...] and the story [...] "underdeveloped," [...] as it [...] "turns its back ... in favor of pure aestheticization." [...] Kyle MacGregor for Destructoid enjoyed the gameplay as [...] "a heady, engrossing experience" [...] yet was critical of the enemy turns having a protracted length, being [...] "hellaciously long".

[...] Nintendo would later release an update that addressed significant downtime by allowing the player to fast-forward through enemy turns.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that between 200, 000 - 250, 000 Norwegians are subject to theincurable disease COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), whichcounts for around 8. 5 % of the adult population.

40|$|The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} has been a boon {{to the study of}} molecular ecology and population genetics of birds. But the nagging truth is that for many bird species, the number of {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) primer pairs that one can pick off the shelf and expect to amplify their target loci with ease is frustratingly small. Now, studying DNA sequence variation in natural populations of birds just got <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier.</b> This issue of Molecular Ecology reports a large-scale bioinformatics search for exonic sequences conserved between the chicken and zebra finch genomes and flanking polymorphic introns that has generated a staggering 242 PCR primer pairs that readily amplify their single-copy target loci in five avian species spanning ~ 100 million years of avian evolution (Backström et al. 2008). As proof of principle, these primers have also been used to survey the genomic landscape in over 110 kb of intronic sequence in the collared flycatcher, a model species in ecology and evolution. These resources pave the way for easy multilocus study of evolving populations and lineages of birds, and bring the goal of quickly turning nonmodel species in to ecological genomic models tantalizingly close...|$|E

But embracing the idea of representing true diversity in a formal research project is <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> than putting it into practice. The three dozen members of the Food Dignity action research team, now entering the fourth year of a five-year project, are intimately familiar with this challenge. In this article, four of the collaborators explore the intricacies of navigating {{what it means to}} bring together a genuine cross-section of community-based activists and academics in an effort to draw on one another’s professional and personal strengths to collect and disseminate research findings that represent the truth of a community’s experiences, and are ultimately disseminated in a way that brings tangible benefit to {{the heart and soul of}} that community. The authors include Food Dignity’s principal investigator (Porter) and three community organisers (Marshall, Herrera and Woodsum) in organisations that have partnered with Food Dignity. Two of the organisers (Herrera and Woodsum) also serve project-wide roles. These collaborators share their personal and professional hopes, struggles, concerns, successes and failures as participants in this cutting-edge effort to equalise community and university partnerships in research.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} with today s ASIC designs {{is not necessarily the}} performance in terms of speed, but rather their power consumption. This is becoming increasingly important as the demands for mobile devices are growing rapidly. Almost all of the microchips fabricated today are base on a global clock synchronizing the on-chip activity; hence they are called clocked or synchronous circuits. The use of a global clock eases the design process as the designer can assume discreet time, thus only needing to focus on the functionality of the circuit. However, synchronous circuits tend to dissipate unnecessary power when idle, and the increasing complexity of today s microchips makes the clock tree harder to distribute evenly. Asynchronous circuits don t have a global clock tree spanning the entire circuit. Instead all activity is synchronized by using handshake protocols between different stages in the circuit. This gives asynchronous circuits some theoretical benefits that make them attractive. These benefits include: (1) lower power consumption, (2) no clock distribution or clock skew problems, (3) robustness towards variations in supply voltage, temperature and fabrication parameters. On the other hand, there are some drawback related with these circuits like area overhead associated with handshaking circuitry and the lack of EDA tools easing the design process. However, papers have recently started to appear in academia that show different ways of designing asynchronous circuits by using a design flow originally intended for synchronous circuits. This allows the designer to reuse synchronous designs and automatically convert them into their asynchronous counterpart, thus making the design process <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier.</b> The main objective of this thesis has been to develop software which automatically converts a synchronous circuit into its asynchronous counterpart based on conversion techniques currently available in academia. The conversion tool has been designed in a way that allows it to be seamlessly integrated into a synchronous design flow, thus allowing for reuse of currently existing technology libraries. Several circuits have been converted and evaluated, including an 8 -bit CPU-core provided by Atmel...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{is built}} around a {{pounding}} riff that Clark later admitted was based on [...] "Needles and Pins" [...] by Jack Nitzsche and Sonny Bono. The song's refrain of [...] "I'll probably feel <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better when you're gone" [...] betrays Clark's uncertainty about ending the relationship and whether such an act would be the answer to his problems or not. Mark Deming {{has pointed out that}} {{the use of the word}} [...] "probably" [...] in this refrain is key and lends the track a depth of subtext that was unusual for a pop song in the mid-1960s. Jim Dickson, The Byrds' manager, has noted that this level of subtext was not unusual in Clark's songs of the period. Said Dickson, [...] "There was always something to unravel in those songs, the non-explanation of the complex feeling. For instance, if you remember I'll Feel <b>a</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Lot</b> Better, it doesn't say: [...] "I'll feel <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better", but [...] "I'll probably feel <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better." [...] For me, that makes the song. There's a statement followed by a hesitation."
