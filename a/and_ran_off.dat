The driver, 74-year-old Ernest Brown, was trapped in the cab and suffered pelvic injuries, while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries.

It returned to the 509th, now designated the 509th Bombardment Group, in September. On 3 September 1948, during a polar navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> the end of the runway when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance.|$|E

5|$|England were {{eventually}} out for 441 {{on the final}} day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman’s men progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries, whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine. Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle. This left Australia at 2/48; dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came; Lindsay Hassett joined Barnes and they took the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave Jack Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. He tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his square cut. The next morning, he perused all of the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.|$|E

Eleven of the 103 aboard received minor injuries, and the aircraft was written off.|$|E
25|$|Political {{tensions}} ran so {{high that}} {{a small group of}} white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the Wilmington government if their candidates were not elected. In the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898, more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected Alfred M. Waddell as mayor, in the only coup d'état in United States history.|$|E
25|$|The Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 (formerly {{called a}} race riot) {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of the racially charged political conflict that had occurred in the decades after the Civil War and efforts to reestablish white supremacy. In the 1870s, the Red Shirts, a white paramilitary organization, used violence and intimidation to suppress black voting, helping Democrats to regain power in the state legislature and end Reconstruction. In 1898, a cadre of white Democrats, professionals and businessmen, planned to overthrow the city government if their candidates were not elected. Two days after the election, more than 1500 white men attacked and burned the only black newspaper in the state <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> the white Republican mayor and aldermen (both white and black), overthrowing the legitimately elected municipal government. This is the only such coup d'état in United States history.|$|E
30|$|Stream {{frequency}} {{is directly}} related to the degree of dissection (Pankaj and Kumar 2009) <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> (Sujata Biswas <b>and</b> Sudhakar Desai 1999), and inversely related to mean annual rainfall (Morisawa 1962). This implies that watersheds with low stream frequency values such as Maruvattur, Pulambadi, Silaiyur and Valaiyur are likely to have higher mean annual rainfall and lower degree of dissection <b>and</b> lower <b>run</b> <b>off.</b> On the other hand watersheds with high stream frequency values such as Kallar, Shobanapuram, Kalungi, Belur and Sengattuppatti are likely to have lower mean annual rainfall and higher degree of dissection <b>and</b> higher <b>run</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R

Knowing there was a large demand for the new coins, Patterson thought it best to build up a stock of 500,000 before beginning distribution.|$|E

In the quarterfinals against [...] Peru, Brazil won 4–2, with Pelé {{assisting}} Tostão for Brazil's third goal. In their semi-final match, Brazil faced Uruguay {{for the first}} time since the 1950 World Cup final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2–1, and Pelé assisted Rivelino for the 3–1. During that match, Pelé made one of his most famous plays. Tostão passed the ball for Pelé to collect which Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> his line to get the ball before Pelé. However, Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a feint by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeepers left, while Pelé went to the goalkeepers right. Pelé ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.|$|E
