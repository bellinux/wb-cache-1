5|$|<b>A</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large {{trade surplus}} would {{generally}} {{see the value}} of its currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E

The Gyeongju International Marathon, held in October, garners elite level competition {{while the}} larger Gyeongju Cherry Blossom Marathon caters more for amateur fun runners. The Cherry Blossom Marathon {{has been held}} each year in Gyeongju since 1992, usually in April, to improve relations with Japan (<b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long history of marathon running). The race, mainly sponsored by Gyeongju city and the district, attracted 13,600 participants in 2009 including about 1,600 foreigners.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on {{a second round of}} QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing {{in a foreign country}} with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such <b>a</b> <b>country,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

25|$|Imbalances in {{international}} trade were theoretically rectified automatically by the gold standard. <b>A</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply.

Any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have {{a decrease in the}} amount of money available to spend.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin model) {{emphasized}} trade {{based on}} the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 13th century, the {{territory}} {{that is now}} known as Estonia was independent. The economy was largely an agricultural one, but Estonia being <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long coastline, there were also many maritime activities. Autonomous development was brought to an end by the Northern Crusades undertaken by the King of Denmark, the German Livonian and the Teutonic military orders. The Estonian world was transformed by military conquest. The war against the invaders lasted from 1208–1227. The last Estonian county to fall was the island of Saaremaa in 1261.|$|E

Austria was overwhelmingly Catholic.|$|E

25|$|Refugees {{are often}} more {{susceptible}} to illness for several reasons, including a lack of immunity to local strains of malaria and other diseases. Displacement of a people can create favorable conditions for disease transmission. Refugee camps are typically heavily populated with poor sanitary conditions. The removal of vegetation for space, building materials or firewood also deprives mosquitoes of their natural habitats, leading them to more closely interact with humans. In the 1970s, Afghani refugees that were relocated to Pakistan were going from a country with an effective malaria control strategy, to <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> less effective system.|$|E
