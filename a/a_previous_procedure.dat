40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{reviews the}} authors' {{experience}} with endoscopic management of duodenal ulcer and ulcers occurring after <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> drainage <b>procedure.</b> SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with complications of duodenal ulcer and ulcers occurring after <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> drainage <b>procedure</b> still require surgical management. Virtually all operations for duodenal ulcer include {{some form of}} vagotomy. American surgeons in academic centers prefer highly selective vagotomy in suitable candidates. Video-directed laparoscopic and thoracoscopic operations have been done for all complications of duodenal ulcer except for acute hemorrhage. METHODS: The authors have performed laparoscopic operation on eight patients with intractable chronic duodenal ulcer, seven patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease combined with duodenal ulcer, one patient with chronic duodenal ulcer and gastric outlet obstruction, and one patient with acute perforation. Operations performed included omentopexy, anterior seromyotomy plus post truncal vagotomy, and highly selective vagotomy. Seven patients had a simultaneous Nissen fundoplication; and the patient with obstruction underwent concomitant pyloroplasty and vagotomy. Six patients with intestinal ulcers occurring after <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> drainage <b>procedure</b> were treated with thoracoscopic vagotomy. Techniques used are shown. RESULTS: There has been one recurrent ulcer in the laparoscopic group after anterior seromyotomy plus posterior truncal vagotomy. The patient treated by omentopexy for duodenal perforation recovered gastrointestinal function promptly with no further difficulty, but eventually died of primary medical disease. Patients undergoing thoracoscopic vagotomy have all become asymptomatic. Postoperative hospital stay after highly selective vagotomy, anterior seromyotomy plus posterior truncal vagotomy, or thoracoscopic vagotomy was 1 - 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic management of duodenal ulcers is feasible. Larger numbers of patients with longer follow-up are essential. Ulcers occurring after a drainage procedure deserve thoracoscopic vagotomy...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detecting}} {{of information and}} logically independent (DILD) steps in programs is a key for equivalent program transformations.

We suggest a modification of index semantics that made connection equations trivial and loops iterations can be executed in parallel. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figurer...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} cryopreserving embryos of the screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), was {{developed}} for the long-term storage of strains used in research projects and for colonies maintained as back-up to production strains that are mass-reared for sterile insect release programs. This protocol, when combined with <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> {{that was designed to}} render screwworm embryos permeable to water loss and the influx of cryoprotectants, yields rates of ~ 53 % hatching, 22 % pupation, and 75 % adult emergence.

Important to the success of this study was identifying the optimum embryonic stage for treatment, formulating an incubation regime, which allowed consistent retrieval of embryos at the optimum stage, establishing the correct dehydration time for the previtrification step, and developing a recovery system after liquid nitrogen storage of the embryos...|$|E
40|$|During a 15 -year period, 62 {{patients}} were treated for achalasia of the esophagus. Pneumatic dilation (PD) had been performed initially in 46 and {{was successful in}} 23; failures were due to acute perforation of the esophagus, persistent dysphagia, or pathologic gastroesophageal reflux. Esophagomyotomy alone (EM) was performed in 19 individuals resulting in definite improvement in 12; four patients had moderate reflux or dysphagia, and three of these required another surgical procedure. An extended myotomy with an antireflux procedure (M-NF) was performed in 13 patients with symptomatic relief in 12; one patient required reconstruction of a too-tight fundoplication that caused persistent dysphagia. The advantages of pneumatic dilation were the ease of performance, patient acceptability, and an overall efficacy of 50 %.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{odontology}} requires an appropriate adjustment of treatments {{according to the}} circumstances of each patient. A follow-up treatment for a patient experiencing problems from <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> such as endodontic therapy, for example, may not necessarily preclude the possibility of extraction. It is therefore necessary to investigate new solutions aimed at analyzing data and, with regard to the given values, determine whether dental retreatment is required.

Thus, the system uses previous experiences to provide new predictions, which is completely innovative in the field of odontology. The proposed prediction technique includes an innovative combination of methods that minimizes false negatives to the greatest possible extent. False negatives refer to a prediction favoring a retreatment when in fact it would be ineffective. The combination of methods is performed by applying an optimization problem to reduce incorrect classifications and takes into account different parameters, such as precision, recall, and statistical probabilities.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{safety and}} efficacy of the GROSSER CTO Recanalization System (GROSSER). Background: The GROSSER, a novel device dedicated to recanalization of chronic total occlusions (CTO), relies on a monorail catheter delivering vibrational energy to facilitate the crossing of occluded coronary arteries. Methods: We included de novo or restenotic occlusions in native coronary arteries with typically unfavorable characteristics and a prior failed guidewire attempt either performed in <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> or just before the usage of the GROSSER. The end points analyzed were technical success (ability to cross or facilitate a guidewire crossing into the true lumen), angiographic success (20 mm in 76. 6 %. The median age of the CTO was 9 months (range 3 - 60 months). Technical success was obtained in 19 (63 %) occlusions and angiographic success in 16 (53 %) : 26. 3 % in lesions with prior procedural failure and 73. 7 % when GROSSER was attempted after initial guidewire failure. Complications were: one guidewire perforation without consequences and one peri-procedural myocardial infarction (MI). No events occurred within 30 -day follow-up after discharge. Conclusions: In our experience, the GROSSER System is safe and increases the success of opening CTO refractory to guidewires.

40|$|A simple {{effective}} procedure (MNP) {{for finding}} equilibrium tetragonal and hexagonal states under pressure is described and applied. The MNP procedure finds {{a path to}} minima of the Gibbs free energy G at T= 0  K (G=E+pV, E=energy per[*]atom, p=pressure, V=volume per atom) for tetragonal and hexagonal structures by using the approximate expansion of G in linear and quadratic strains at an arbitrary initial structure to find {{a change in the}} strains which moves toward a minimum of G. Iteration automatically proceeds to a minimum within preset convergence criteria on the calculation of the minimum. Comparison is made with experimental results for the ground states of seven metallic elements in hexagonal close-packed (hcp), face- and body-centered cubic structures, and with <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> for finding minima based on tracing G along the epitaxial Bain path (EBP) to a minimum; the MNP is more easily generalized than the EBP procedure to lower symmetry and more atoms in the unit cell. Comparison is also made with a molecular-dynamics program for crystal equilibrium structures under pressure and with CRYSTAL, a program for crystal equilibrium structures at zero pressure. Application of MNP to the elements Y and Cd, which have hcp ground states at zero pressure, finds minima of E at face-centered cubic (fcc) structure for both Y and Cd.

40|$|Hysteretic energy {{dissipation}} in a structure during an earthquake {{is the key}} factor, besides maximum displacement, related {{to the amount of}} damage in it. This energy demand can be accurately computed only through a nonlinear time-history analysis of the structure subjected to a specific earthquake ground acceleration. However, for multi-story structures, which are usually modeled as multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) systems, this analysis becomes computation intensive and time consuming and is not suitable for adopting in seismic design guidelines. An alternative method of estimating hysteretic energy demand on MDOF systems is presented here. The proposed method uses multiple 'generalized' or 'equivalent' single degree of freedom (ESDOF) systems to estimate hysteretic energy demand on an MDOF system {{within the context of a}} 'modal pushover analysis'. This is a modified version of <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> using a single ESDOF system. Efficiency of the proposed procedure is tested by comparing energy demands based on this method with results from nonlinear dynamic analyses of MDOF systems, as well as estimates based on the previous method, for several ground motion scenarios. Three steel moment frame structures, of 3 -, 9 -, and 20 -story configurations, are selected for this comparison. Bias statistics that show the effectiveness of the proposed method are presented. In addition to being less demanding on the computation time and complexity, the proposed method is also suitable for adopting in design guidelines, as it can use response spectra for hysteretic energy demand estimation.

We have operated on 73 patients with idiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis, have confirmed its mode of presentation and response to surgical therapy, and have established long-term follow-up. MethodsCharts of 73 patients treated surgically for idiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis between 1971 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsAll patients were treated with a single-staged laryngotracheal resection, with (36 / 73) and without (37 / 73) a posterior membranous tracheal wall flap. Nearly all were women (71 / 73), {{with a mean age of}} 46 years (range, 13 - 74 years). Twenty-eight (38 %) of 73 had undergone <b>a</b> <b>previous</b> <b>procedure</b> with laser, dilation, tracheostomy, T-tube, or laryngotracheal operations. After laryngotracheal resection, the majority of patients (67 / 73) were extubated in the operating room, and 7 required temporary tracheostomies, only 1 of whom was among the last 30 patients. All were successfully decannulated. There was no perioperative mortality. Principal morbidity was alteration of voice quality, which was mild and tended to improve with time. Sixty-seven (91 %) of 73 patients had good to excellent long-term results with voice and breathing quality and do not require further intervention for their idiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis. ConclusionIdiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis is an entity that occurs almost exclusively in women and is without a known cause. It is not a progressive process, but the timing of the operation is crucial. Single-staged laryngotracheal resection is successful in restoring the airway while preserving voice quality in more than 90 % of patients. Protective tracheostomy is now rarely required (1 / 30). Long-term follow-up shows a stable airway and improvement in voice quality...|$|E
