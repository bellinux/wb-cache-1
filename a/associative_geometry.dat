40|$|Though {{design for}} {{building}} performance is traditionally considered an evaluative act, current {{developments in the}} theory and technology of digital design are promoting new directions for performance-based models of design. This paper presents a theoretical basis for understanding the current shift in performance-based design and proposes a model of performance-based design in architecture, termed performative design. Automated processes related {{to the impact of}} environmental forces on form generation in digital design are the content of experimental processes upon which the paper reports. In the theoretical introduction the terms performative design and performative architecture are defined and discussed. Topics related to the current movement towards performance-based design in architecture, such as the role of topology, parametric design, <b>associative</b> <b>geometry,</b> and generative processes, are presented, and their implications for, and influence upon, performative design are discussed. An experimental design example in architectural design is demonstrated to illustrate various methodological issues in performative design. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{challenges of}} teaching computational geometry to architectural students, and proposes a multi-level pedagogical scheme introducing <b>associative</b> <b>geometry</b> and parametric modelling/design into architectural design education. It reports on two pedagogical experiences: one {{held in the}} context of a spatial geometry course in the first year of education, and another one, in a digital design studio with third-year architectural students. More specifically, it discusses the impact on design exploration of a library of interactive referents models introduced into the architectural studio. Situated in the'performance'paradigm of digital design methods, they allow for design object explorations based on modification of architecturally meaningful features (structural, environmental, functional, etc.). The form of a design object can thus'follow'function, structure, or even sustainability. The digital methods and the design knowledge transferred by the interactive models, together with their visual nature, are found to amplify the processes of'seeing-as'and the'reflective conversation with the situation'considered essential for creative design...|$|E

40|$|The Sagrada Familia Church has {{appointed}} {{two groups of}} consultants to assist the translation of Gaudi's 1 : 10 scaled models of the nave into coherent information from which to build. One team has been undertaking the static analysis of the nave roof vault structure and the other {{the study of the}} complexities of Gaudi's composition in order to provide full-scale production templates and models for the walls. Both teams had begun using the same basic CAD package and both have had to move onto high-end and very expensive solid-modelling software normally used by mechanical engineers and vehicle designers. Both groups are collaborating together with different accents despite an improbable geographical separation. The original problem, one of intersecting ruled-surfaces accurately to reflect the geometries of the surviving fragments of the original models, has led to surprising possibilities which were not anticipated at the outset. Currently the potential of parametric variation and <b>associative</b> <b>geometries</b> are being investigated as a mirror for some of the intuitive design process and finite element analysis is being considered as a means of interactively analysing the structural implications for each study. The software being used also has a powerful ray-tracing module, rather than being simply a tool to produce eye-catching'realistic'renderings it has proved to be invaluable in allowing the computer user to understand the spatial complexities of the components being studied. This paper discusses the merits of an architecture so demanding (despite having been designed {{at the beginning of this}} century) that it requires the most costly equipment in today's market and it will consider the proposition that in ordinary circumstances, an architecture too complex to be described using basic CAD tools is an architecture beyond our reach. The interdisciplinary nature of the diverse and powerful modules within the software referred to will be used to contest this proposition using the presence of both teams in schools of architecture as evidence...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} relationship between the shift in the focus of architectural modelling from object to system and philosophical shifts in the history of mathematics that are relevant to that change. Particularly {{in the wake of the}} adoption of digital computation, design model spaces are more complex, multidimensional, arguably more logical, less intuitive spaces to navigate, less accessible to perception and visual comprehension. Such spatial issues were encountered much earlier in mathematics than in architectural modelling, with the growth of analytical geometry, a transition from Classical axiomatic proofs in geometry as the basis of mathematics, to analysis as the underpinning of geometry. Can the computational design modeller learn from the changing modern history, philosophy and psychology of mathematics about the construction and navigation of computational geometrical architectural system model space? The research is conducted through a review of recent architectural project examples and reference to three more detailed architectural modelling case studies. The spatial questions these examples and case studies raise are examined in the context of selected historical writing in the history, philosophy and psychology of mathematics and space. This leads to conclusions about changes in the relationship of architecture and mathematics, and reflections on the opportunities and limitations for architectural system models using computation geometry in the light of this historical survey. This line of questioning was motivated as a response to the experience of constructing digital <b>associative</b> <b>geometry</b> models and encountering the apparent limits of their flexibility as the graph of dependencies grew and the messiness of the digital modelling space increased. The questions were inspired particularly by working on the Narthex model for the Sagrada Família church, which extends to many tens of thousands of relationships and constraints, and which was modelled and repeatedly partially remodelled over a very long period. This experience led to the realisation that the limitations of the model were not necessarily the consequence of poor logical schema definition, but could be inevitable limitations of the geometry as defined, regardless of the means of defining it, the ‘shape’ of the multidimensional space being created. This led to more fundamental questions about the nature of Space, its relationship to geometry and the extent to which the latter can be considered simply as an operational and notational system. This dissertation offers a purely inductive journey, offering evidence through very selective examples in architecture, architectural modelling and in the philosophy of mathematics. The journey starts with some questions about the tendency of the model space to break out and exhibit unpredictable and not always desirable behaviour and the opportunities for geometrical construction to solve these questions is not conclusively answered. Many very productive questions about computational architectural modelling are raised in the process of looking for answers...|$|E

40|$|This thesis "dualizes" Harvey and Lawson's {{notion of}} {{calibrated}} geometry on a Riemannian manifold to the semi-Riemannian category. By considering the appropriate spaces (with signature) {{analogous to the}} positive definite situations, we prove inequalities which in turn lead to analogues of the main examples discussed by the aforementioned. These are: complex geometry on Cp,q, special Lagrangian <b>geometry</b> on Rn,n, <b>associative</b> and coassociative <b>geometries</b> on the imaginary split octonians, and Cayley geometry on the split octonians. By nature of these inequalities, the ϕ-submanifolds {{in all of these}} examples are volume maximizing in an appropriate sense, which contrasts with the minimizing property in the positive definite situation. The PDE's associated with these geometries are derived, and are seen to resemble their positive definite analogues. Examples of ϕ-submanifolds are subsequently discussed. The contact sets {ϕ≡ 1 } ∩ Grassmannian in the positive definite and signature cases are also seen to exhibit a duality in the sense of Riemannian globally symmetric spaces. Indeed, the dual nature of the semi-Riemannian category with the Riemannian category is emphasized throughout. However, this "duality" is not precise. There are important calibrations in the positive definite category whose would-be-duals in the signature cases are not calibrations...|$|R
