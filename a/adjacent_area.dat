25|$|Opened in August 1961, it {{was used}} {{for the first half of}} its life by {{broadcasts}} from BBC Schools. There was an <b>adjacent</b> <b>area</b> used for schools programming that linked in with the studio. It was converted to colour around 1973, about the same time as schools broadcasts as a whole. It was closed briefly during the mid-1980s, and reopened in 1987 following a two-year refurbishment. It was the home of BBC Sport's programmes until 2012 when the Sports department moved to MediaCityUK. This studio was demolished during the redevelopment of Television Centre.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, a {{group of}} cave explorers from British Caving Association {{conducted}} survey in this park and adjacent areas. The biggest chamber of Sơn Đoòng is more than five (5) kilometers in length, 200 meters high and 150 meters wide. With these dimensions, Sơn Đoòng overtakes Deer Cave in Malaysia to take {{the title of the}} world's largest cave. At the same time they found new caves and grottoes in the park and <b>adjacent</b> <b>area.</b> In this survey, the cave British explorers discovered 20 new caves with total length of 56km, including world's largest cave, Sơn Đoòng.|$|E

The <b>adjacent</b> <b>area</b> of Winfield was largely {{incorporated}} into the post office serving Woodside and as a consequence Winfield lost much of its identity distinct from Woodside. However, with large-scale residential development in the 1860s, Woodside became the largest Irish American community in Queens, being approximately 80% Irish by the 1930s and maintaining a strong Irish culture today. In the early 1990s, many Asian American families moved into the area, with the population being 30% Asian American. South Asians and Latinos have also moved to Woodside in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Transnistria {{became an}} {{autonomous}} political entity in 1924 with the proclamation of the Moldavian ASSR, which included today's Transnistria (4,000km2) and an <b>adjacent</b> <b>area</b> (9,000km2) {{around the city}} of Balta in modern-day Ukraine, but nothing from Bessarabia, {{which at the time}} formed part of Romania. One {{of the reasons for the}} creation of the Moldavian ASSR was the desire of the Soviet Union at the time to eventually incorporate Bessarabia. The Moldavian SSR, organised by a decision of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 2 August 1940, was formed out of a part of Bessarabia (taken from Romania on 28 June, after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) and out of a part of the Moldavian ASSR roughly equivalent to present-day Transnistria.|$|E
25|$|The {{visit of}} Queen Maria I in 1787 {{brought about the}} {{restoration}} and redecoration of a few salons and chambers in the municipal buildings. The great festivities 1795 to celebrate the baptism of the Infante António, son of John VI, resulted in grand balls at the Palace of Queluz. In 1838 the King-Consort, Ferdinand II bought the Monastery of Nossa Senhora da Pena and a vast <b>adjacent</b> <b>area,</b> commissioning the architect José de Costa e Silva to construct an arch joining the two quarters of the Seteais Palace (owned by the Marquess of Marialva), to commemorate the 1802 visit of the princes and princess of Brazil, the InfanteJoão and Carlota Joaquina, and the subsequent visit of their son, the absolutist King Miguel, in 1830.|$|E

25|$|Hunting may be {{threatening}} {{populations of}} the tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and large primates in the north. Some habitat is threatened by expansion of the agricultural and pastoral frontier, gold mining, and selective logging that erodes the genetic diversity of a few valuable timber species. The economically important palm Euterpe precatoria is being depleted in some areas by unsustainable palm heart extraction. A dramatic problem {{that exists in the}} Brazilian State of Acre and in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>area</b> of Peru is the spread of the invasive Guadua bamboo forests. This highly competitive bamboo invades and dominates abandoned clearings and threatens to dominate the disturbed areas in this region. Logging along major rivers and near urban centers has decimated populations of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), tropical cedar (Cedrela odorata), and kapok (Ceiba pentandra).|$|E
25|$|Linden Hill was {{originally}} a rural estate {{owned by the}} Mitchell family. Ernest Mitchell owned an <b>adjacent</b> <b>area</b> known as Breezy Hill and his father owned the area now called Linden Hill. The two areas are {{sometimes referred to as}} Mitchell-Linden. A major change in the rural nature of Linden Hill occurred in the 1950s. Builders envisioned a cooperative project to be set on Linden Hill and landfill of an adjacent swamp which would provide middle-income housing to veterans of World War II and the Korean War. Under Section 213 of the Federal Housing Act of 1950, and at a cost of $15 million, the project was enacted. It provided homes for about 1400 residents in the 41 six-story buildings of the Linden Hill, Mitchell Gardens, Linden Towers, and Embassy Arms cooperatives.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to the}} {{enormous}} size of the Australasian strewn field, the impact crater has been conjectured to be significantly larger than the known ones. Schmidt and Wasson (1993) suggested {{it could be a}} 14–17km crater beneath the Mekong Valley, Schnetzler (1996) considered a 35–40km structure in southern Laos, Hartung and Koeberl (1994) proposed the elongated 100km x 35km Tonlé Sap lake in Cambodia (visible in the map at the side), while Glass (1994) estimated it to be between 32 and 114km in diameter in Cambodia. Glass (1999) also suggested southern Laos or an <b>adjacent</b> <b>area</b> as a possible source. More recently, Lee and Wei (2000) gave its size as 90 to 116km and P. Ma et al. (2001) using beryllium-10 postulated the crater as between southern Laos and Hainan, possibly within the Gulf of Tonkin.|$|E
