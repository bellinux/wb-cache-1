The {{basis of this}} approach is the ability to automatically extract features from large text databases, and identify statistically significant relationships or associations between those features. The techniques supporting thk approach are discussed, and examples from an appli-cation using these techniques, named the <b>Associations</b> <b>System,</b> are illustrated using the Wall Street Journal database. In this particular application, the features extracted are company and person names. The series of tests run on the <b>Associations</b> <b>System</b> demonstrate that feature extraction can be quite accurate, and that the relationships generated are reliable. In addition to conventional mea-sures of recall and precision, evaluation measures are currently being studied which will indicate the usefulness of the relationships identified, in various domain-specific contexts. ...|$|R

However, the <b>association</b> <b>system</b> can cope with false associations using two approaches. One is a passive approach {{that uses the}} property of a group association. If objects in relation with a false association collide inside or outside the coverage, a false association naturally becomes a group or incomplete group association. The other approach is to confirm the association by checking whether duplicated identifications exist in the <b>association</b> <b>system.</b> If the false association is confirmed, the falsely associated position changes to an unassociated position. Therefore, false associations are eventually resolved by a group association or checking the identification with duplicate registrations at the coverage of different identification sensors.|$|E

Therefore, the possibility is increased that an estimated position will be uniquely paired with its identification.

Levinson and Roberts (1981) tried to reconcile these two theoretical approaches, and considered a disk filled with discrete gas clouds.

The proposed conscious system consists of reason system, feeling system and <b>association</b> <b>system.</b> The three systems are modeled using Module of Nerves for Advanced Dynamics (ModNAD). Artificial neural network {{of the type}} of supervised learning with the back propagation is used to train the ModNAD. The reason system imitates behaviour and represents self-condition and other-condition. The feeling system represents sensation and emotion. The <b>association</b> <b>system</b> represents behaviour of self and determines whether self is comfortable or not. A robot is asked to perform cognition and tasks using the consciousness system. Learning converges to about 0. 01 within about 900 orders for imitation, pain, solitude and the association modules. It converges to about 0. 01 within about 400 orders for the comfort and discomfort modules. It can be concluded that learning in the ModNAD completed after {{a relatively small number of}} times because the learning efficiency of the ModNAD artificial neural network is good. The results also show that each ModNAD has a function to imitate and cognize emotion.

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} for dynamic object identification in heterogeneous sensor networks where two functionally different sensors are incorporated. Visual sensors associate objects and track them using the geometric relationship of multiple cameras [17, 18]. The visual sensor-based tracking system is assisted by identification sensors {{in identifying the}} estimated positions of objects. The coverage of identification sensors is assumed by its maximum sensing coverage and the <b>association</b> <b>system</b> applies the simple association strategy for the estimated position from the visual sensor and the identification from the identification sensor. The important issue in heterogeneous sensor networks is to provide the <b>association</b> <b>system</b> with a common reference information fusing heterogeneous data. The visual sensors-based tracking system utilizes the known coverage of the identification sensors to associate the heterogeneous data. The locations of identification sensors are known and they are jointly used with the locations of objects to check the object dynamics of entering and leaving the sensor coverage. The sets of estimated positions and identifications are defined for the coverage of each identification sensor. The association of them is established by checking the temporal change of the sets. In order to solve the association problem with the coverage uncertainty issue, a group and incomplete group associations are introduced. The group and incomplete group associations enable the <b>association</b> <b>system</b> to maintain identification candidates for the corresponding estimated positions until a single association is established. Also, a group association can stabilize the association performance against the inconsistent registration of identifications by an identification sensor. Additional association cases are investigated to increase the association performance by checking the object dynamics. We also identify more association problems with {{the discrepancy between the}} actual coverage by the identification sensor and the approximated coverage by the visual sensor and present a coverage adjustment scheme using the object dynamics. Finally, the proposed association method is evaluated with a realistic scenario and is analyzed to show the stability of the proposed method according to degree of the discrepancy between approximated and actual identification sensor coverage, variance of actual identification sensor coverage, and tracking performance.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates and introduces novel algorithms, theories, {{and supporting}} frameworks to significantly improve the growing problem of Internet security. A distributed firewall and active response architecture is introduced that enables any device within a cyber environment {{to participate in}} the active discovery and response of cyber attacks. A theory of semantic <b>association</b> <b>systems</b> is developed for the general problem of knowledge discovery in data. The theory of semantic <b>association</b> <b>systems</b> forms the basis of a novel semantic path merger packet classification algorithm. The theoretical aspects of the semantic path merger packet classification algorithm are investigated, and the algorithm's hardware-based implementation is evaluated along with comparative analysis versus content addressable memory. Experimental results show that the hardware implementation of the semantic path merger algorithm significantly outperforms content addressable memory in terms of energy consumption and operational timing.
