5|$|Apparently, by late 1968, no X-rays {{had been}} {{detected}} from the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy.</b> A balloon flight on October 20, 1970, set an upper limit for detectable hard X-rays from the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1950, radio {{emission}} from the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{was detected by}} Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory. The first radio maps of the galaxy {{were made in the}} 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group. The core of the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalog. In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy.</b> This was detected using a technique called microlensing, which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.|$|E
5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in the Milky Way is much higher, with <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy.</b> This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Milky Way and <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxies</b> are {{expected}} to collide in ~4.5 billion years, merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy or a large disc galaxy.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to it, <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> interstellar medium contains at least around [...] {{in the form}} of neutral hydrogen, at least [...] as molecular hydrogen (within its innermost 10 kiloparsecs), and [...] of dust.|$|R
5|$|<b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{was formed}} roughly 10 {{billion years ago}} from the {{collision}} and subsequent merger of smaller protogalaxies.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} {{distinct}} techniques {{have been used}} to estimate distances from Earth to the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Milky Way, the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{appears to}} have {{predominantly}} more old stars with ages >7 years. The estimated luminosity of <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> , is about 25% {{higher than that of}} our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> (including to propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21 or close).|$|E
5000|$|The disk of {{satellites}} problem: dwarf galaxies {{around the}} Milky Way and <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxies</b> are observed to be orbiting in thin, planar structures whereas the simulations predict {{that they should}} be distributed randomly about their parent galaxies.|$|R
5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of the Milky Way and <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxies</b> should be underway. Although this {{could result in the}} Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or planets.|$|R
5|$|Another massive {{globular}} cluster, named 037-B327 {{and discovered}} in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> interstellar dust, {{was thought to}} be more massive than G1 and the largest cluster of the Local Group; however, other studies have shown it is actually similar in properties to G1.|$|R
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the inner region of the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust ring that {{is believed to have}} been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> along the latter's polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxy</b> by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|Like the Milky Way, the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> has {{satellite}} galaxies, {{consisting of}} 14 known dwarf galaxies. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110. Based on current evidence, {{it appears that}} M32 underwent a close encounter with the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> in the past. M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{globular}} clusters of the Milky Way, which show {{a relatively low}} age dispersion, <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> {{globular clusters}} have a much larger range of ages: from systems {{as old as the}} galaxy itself to much younger systems, with ages between a few hundred million years to five billion years ...|$|R
50|$|The Xandarian Nova Corps were {{originally}} Xandar's militia and had 500 members. After their planet was devastated by Zorr and restructured into {{a network of}} inter-connecting domed cities the Xandarians guided by the Worldmind became a more proactive peace keeping force helping stop threats in the Milky Way and <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Later {{studies with}} the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope showed how <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> spiral {{structure}} in the infrared appears to be composed of two spiral arms that emerge from a central bar and continue beyond the large ring mentioned above. Those arms, however, are not continuous and have a segmented structure.|$|R
5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> are typically oblate spheroids in shape, while {{those in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.4, the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{is among the}} brightest of the Messier objects - making it {{visible to the naked}} eye on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.|$|E
5|$|A recent (2005) {{hypothesis}} is that the star of Bethlehem was a supernova or hypernova occurring in the nearby <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy.</b> Although {{it is difficult to}} detect a supernova remnant in another galaxy, or obtain an accurate date of when it occurred, supernovae remnants have been detected in Andromeda.|$|E

50|$|It {{is located}} 130,000 light-years (40 kpc) from <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> galactic core, {{and is the}} {{brightest}} (by absolute magnitude) globular cluster in the Local Group, having an apparent magnitude of 13.7. Mayall II is considered to have twice the mass of Omega Centauri, and may contain a central, intermediate-mass (∼ 2 M⊙) black hole.|$|R
5|$|Based on its {{appearance}} in visible light, the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> {{is classified as}} an SA(s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs–Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies. However, data from the 2MASS survey showed that Andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar oriented along its long axis.|$|E
5|$|M110 {{also appears}} to be {{interacting}} with the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> has a {{total of}} 15 {{satellite}} galaxies, including M32 and M110.

5000|$|While the {{previous}} album, Voyageur, contained minimal {{amounts of the}} project's signature sounds, A posteriori only contains the signature [...] "Enigma horn" [...] (a foghorn) during the opening minute of the album, and even then it is a fleeting glimpse.

5|$|The {{estimated}} {{distance of}} the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> from our own was doubled in 1953 when {{it was discovered that}} there is another, dimmer type of Cepheid. In the 1990s, measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the Hipparcos satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances.|$|E
5|$|The first {{professional}} astronomer {{to support the}} concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. The distance to the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxy,</b> and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|While earlier {{findings}} {{suggested that}} the Milky Way galaxy contained more dark matter than Andromeda, {{and that it could}} be the largest in the Local Group - the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope led to the revelation that the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxy</b> contains one trillion stars; at least twice the amount of the Milky Way’s stars, with the figure being estimated at 200-400 billion. It is also now evident that spanning approximately 220,000 light years across, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies. The mass of the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy</b> is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, whereas the Milky Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|E
50|$|The Virgo Supercluster (Virgo SC) or the Local Supercluster (LSC or LS) is a mass {{concentration}} of galaxies {{that contains the}} Virgo Cluster {{in addition to the}} Local Group, which in turn contains the Milky Way and <b>Andromeda</b> <b>galaxies.</b> At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years). It is one of about 10 million superclusters in the observable universe.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> {{satellite}} system consists of Messier 32 (M32), Messier 110 (M110), NGC 147, NGC 185, Andromeda I (And I), And II, And III, And IV, And V, And VI (also known as Pegasus Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy, or Pegasus DSph), And VII (also known as Cassiopeia Dwarf Galaxy), And VIII, And IX, And X, And XI, And XIX, And XXI and And XXII, plus several additional ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies.|$|R
5|$|This violent {{collision}} formed {{most of the}} galaxy's (metal-rich) {{galactic halo}} and extended disk. During this epoch, star formation {{would have been very}} high, to the point of becoming a luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy had a very close passage 2–4 billion years ago. This event produced high levels of star formation across the <b>Andromeda</b> <b>Galaxy's</b> disk– even some globular clusters– and disturbed M33's outer disk.|$|R
