5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where {{he happened to be}} at that time. His soul then left his body {{in the form of a}} snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

25|$|At 18:40, {{the head}} of the hospital's {{emergency}} department, Maria Teresa Fiandri made the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17, which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped working. Watkins later said that <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Senna's fully dilated pupils, he knew that his brainstem was inactive and that he would not survive.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Wisniewski was {{nineteen}} years old she was pitching for the Detroit Keller Girls, a team who gained attention {{during the early}} days of World War II, which earned her a solid prestige and consideration in national softball circles. Wisniewski possessed a blazing fastball thrown with a windmill-like underhand pitching motion and speeds in the 90 miles per hour range. Then, an advancing scout of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League grabbed her up <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her pitching. She was invited to a try out and later was allocated to the Milwaukee Chicks, an expansion team managed by former big leaguer Max Carey.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jimmy Savile scandal, Newsnight investigated the North Wales child abuse scandal. On 2 November 2012, a former resident of the Bryn Estyn children's home was reported on Newsnight claiming that a prominent, but unnamed, former Conservative politician had sexually abused him during the 1970s. The rumour was spread by users of Twitter and other social media which identified the politician. After The Guardian reported a possible case of mistaken identity, Lord McAlpine issued a strong denial that he was in any way involved, asserting that the allegations were wholly false and seriously defamatory. The accuser unreservedly apologised, admitting that, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a photograph of the individual, he realised he had been mistaken. The BBC also apologised.|$|E

25|$|However, on 12 December, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet {{ratified}} the Belevezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It was now {{apparent that the}} momentum towards dissolution could not be stopped. Shortly after the RSFSR {{ratified the}} Accords, Gorbachev hinted that he was considering stepping aside. On 17 December, he accepted the fait accompli and reluctantly agreed with Yeltsin to dissolve the Soviet Union. Four days later, the leaders of 11 of the 12 remaining republics—all except Georgia (the Baltic states had already seceded in August)—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol which formally established the CIS. They also preemptively accepted Gorbachev's resignation. When Gorbachev learned what had transpired, he told CBS that he would resign <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that the CIS was indeed a reality.|$|E
500|$|Blaine {{is portrayed}} by actor Darren Criss, who had auditioned for Glee several times for several roles before the {{character}} Blaine was created. He originally auditioned to play Finn Hudson. Criss made several audition videos for Glee, {{of which he}} posted only one to the social networking website MySpace where he sang a cover of Bill Withers' song Lean on Me. Although the series writers have seen them, he considers them supplemental to his main audition, which was for series creator Ryan Murphy. Murphy had not seen any of Criss's previous auditions, but knew he was the right actor for Blaine <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> this one. The actor cut his long hair before auditioning, to suit the [...] "serious and preppy" [...] role.|$|E
2500|$|These {{events had}} {{important}} consequences. The Portuguese chroniclers unanimously stated what [...] Rui de Pina synthesized this way: [...] " ... king D. Ferdinand ... <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> defeated {{his first and}} big battles , and believing the same fate would happen to his own battles {{at the hands of}} King Afonso's battles, was counselled to withdraw as he did to Zamora".|$|E

2500|$|The conductor, W. C. Powers, {{also gave}} a statement. [...] He said {{the car was}} not going very fast as it started across the bridge. [...] <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the red light, he opened the trolley's door and alerted the {{passengers}} to jump from the car. [...] The conductor then jumped himself, just before the car struck the wooden gate before the open draw. [...] He saw a number people jump off the car.|$|E
2500|$|The Ring {{slowly but}} inevitably {{corrupted}} its bearer, {{regardless of the}} bearer's initial intent. [...] For this reason the Wise, including Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, refused to wield it themselves, but determined instead {{that it should be}} destroyed. The corrupting power of the ring was apparently stronger on individuals more inclined to evil and selfishness: it took almost immediate hold of the greedy Sméagol <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it, and corrupted Boromir after a few months of near proximity, while its effects were only starting to be seen in the well-meaning Bilbo after his sixty [...] years' possession.|$|E
2500|$|Smalls {{applied the}} {{emergency}} brakes <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the vehicle. After the crash, {{he went back}} into the burning train several times to rescue passengers. [...] "He did everything he could," [...] said Anthony Bottalico, head of Association of Commuter Rail Employees, the labor union which represents Metro-North workers. Despite that, the train knocked Brody's SUV [...] up the tracks, which dislodged more than [...] of the third rail, breaking it into thirteen [...] segments, most of which accumulated in the front car's passenger compartment, and then into the second car. The New York Daily News reported that injuries from them were responsible for most of the deaths on the train.|$|E

2500|$|... "Cold Openings" [...] – The Cold Openings {{would appear}} at the {{beginning}} of each episode, and would officially introduce the guest star. During the first series, Kermit would introduce the guest star during the opening theme. His introduction would be followed by a clip of the guest star, usually surrounded by a group of Muppets. Beginning the second series, the Cold Openings would appear before the opening theme song. Scooter would visit the guest star in his/her dressing room, usually saying [...] "Fifteen seconds to curtain". This would then be followed by a brief joke. In the fifth series, the guest star would enter the Muppet Theater and would be greeted by Pops the Doorman. Pops would always say [...] "Who are you?" [...] <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the guest star. After the guest star introduced himself/herself to Pops, a joke would follow.|$|E
2500|$|Ramin Djawadi {{had been}} a fan of the {{character}} Iron Man as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes [...] "that actually don’t have any superpowers". After Iron Man director Jon Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film, Djawadi sought out the role himself. Filming on Iron Man had already been completed by the time Djawadi joined the production, and rather than wait until he could see the completed film, as he usually would, Djawadi began [...] "playing with ideas" [...] <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the first trailer. Due to time constraints and the final cut of the film changing until [...] "the last possible minute", Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions. Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 September 1931, Celtic {{were playing}} their Old Firm rivals Rangers at Ibrox Park in Glasgow {{in front of}} 80,000. Early {{in the second half}} Thomson and a Rangers player, Sam English, went for the ball at the same time. Thomson's head {{collided}} with English's knee, fracturing his skull and rupturing an artery in his right temple. Thomson was taken off the field in a stretcher; most people assumed that he was just badly concussed, but a few people who had seen his injuries suspected worse. One source said, [...] "There were gasps in the main stand, a single piercing scream being heard from a horrified young woman"; this was believed to be the scream of 19-year-old Margaret Finlay, who was watching with Jim Thomson (brother of John). One Rangers player, also a medical student, said later that <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him he gave little chance for his survival.|$|E

2500|$|The force left Ramdam at 2am on 12 February, {{with only}} 4,000 {{horsemen}} {{rather than the}} 8,000 he had expected to have, but French {{felt he had to}} push on rather than wait for straggling units to catch up (the brigades’ staffs were all new, and brigadiers only joined their units {{in the course of the}} march). De Kiel’s Drift on the Riet was seized by mid afternoon—French ordered his cavalry to gallop for it <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the way was clear—but the crossing was soon in what Haig called [...] "an indescribable state of confusion" [...] as Roberts had neglected to order priority for Cavalry Division baggage. Kitchener, arriving in the evening, ordered French to seize Waterval Drift, another crossing a few miles to the northwest where he had left a brigade masking a small Boer force under de Wet. Although this was done, the advance could not be resumed until 10.30am—with the sun high in the sky—on 13 February, and accompanied by five baggage wagons which had managed to get through the logjam at De Kiel’s Drift.|$|E
