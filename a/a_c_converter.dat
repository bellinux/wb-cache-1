40|$|SPIRAL 2 International audienceBased on the "LINAG Phase 1 " {{conceptual}} design, a {{two years}} detailed study on a ISOL-type facility {{for the production}} of high intensity exotic beams, named SPIRAL 2, has been launched. The radioactive isotope beams are produced via the fission process, with the aim of 1013 fissions/s at least, induced in a UCx target either by fast neutrons from <b>a</b> <b>C</b> <b>converter</b> or by direct bombardment of fissile material. Fusion-evaporation residues, using heavy ions beams in different targets can also be produced in this facility. The driver, with an acceleration potential of 40 MV will accelerate deuterons (5 mA) and q/A = 3 ions (1 mA) Even heavier ions will be possible at a later stage. The driver consists in high-performance ECR sources, an RFQ cavity and independent phase superconducting resonators. Further upgrade will be possible in the future...|$|E

The SPIRAL 2 project {{is based on a}} multi-beam Superconducting Linac Driver delivering 5 mA deuterons up to 40 MeV and 1 mA heavy ions up to 14. 5 MeV/u. Different Radioactive Isotope Beams (RIB) production methods are foreseen: 1) by fission process (up to 1014 fissions/s, induced in an UCx target by fast neutrons from <b>a</b> <b>C</b> <b>converter</b> bombarded by deuterons), 2) by fusion-evaporation residues or transfer products, using p, D, 3, 4 He and heavy ions beams in different targets.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{involving the}} further development and refinement of {{a mathematical model}} of an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), together {{with the development of}} an associated real-time multi-rate simulation that includes both high-speed power electronic subsystems and slower components. The chosen vehicle uses a battery as its energy source and this feeds an a. c. motor drive through a d. c. to <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>converter.</b> The drive powers the vessel which is modelled as a six-degree of freedom vehicle with control surfaces. Tests carried out indicate that a careful choice of frame rates can increase the speed of solution by factors of several hundred over solution times when the shortest frame rate is used throughout. These multi-rate solutions were executed faster than real time on a typical laptop even when using 3 -D graphical output for visualisation of vehicle motion. The conclusions of the paper are that the modelling and simulation of the UUV has provided a useful test-bed for ideas on multi-rate simulation and has demonstrated that multi-rate real-time simulation is feasible and useful for an application of this kind that includes very fast power electronic subsystems and relatively slow systems such as the vehicle and battery...|$|E
40|$|The RFX {{power supply}} system is a {{combination}} of electrical devices, such as <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> -d. <b>c.</b> <b>converters,</b> direct current interrupters, large capacitor banks and fast closing switches, whose coordinated operation allows the investigation of plasmas in the reverse field pinch (RFP) configuration. The large electrical power, required for the pulses, is derived partly from the 400 kV high voltage Italian grid and partly by the transfer to the plasma of energy stored before the pulse in the capacitor banks or in the machine magnets. The circuit operation phases to obtain RFP configurations are initially described: after premagnetizing the machine and charging the capacitor banks, the plasma current start-up follows (between 5 and 50 ms long) during which the energy stored is transferred to the plasma. Then, by means of the <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> -d. <b>c.</b> <b>converters,</b> the steady state of the plasma configuration is sustained for a maximum duration of 0. 25 s. In the design of the power supply units a few aspects have been taken into account which have a great impact on the technical solutions: the possible fault conditions, which can in a few cases heavily damage the devices; the presence of high electromagnetic interference (EMI) which can induce noises in signals and errors in the circuit operations; the request for easy reconfigurations of the circuits, to cope with different types of plasma investigations. The fault protection led in RFX to the development of an active logic able to command the required protective actions, which have to operate within 1 ms of the fault. The EMI reduction was obtained with a careful analysis of the EMI source, related to the magnetic stray field caused by the machine magnetizing winding and by the operation of converters, capacitor banks, interrupters and ignitrons; screening of the area with control equipment, the signal insulation and a particular solution for the ground system was adopted. Finally, a high level of plant flexibility was reached by adopting a modular solution {{in the design of the}} <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> -d. <b>c.</b> <b>converter</b> system and of the toroidal capacitor bank.

40|$|International audienceTo {{pursue the}} {{investigation}} of a new territory of nuclei with extreme N/Z called " terra incognita" several projects, all aiming at the increase by several orders of magnitude of the RIB intensities are now under discussions worldwide. The main goal of SPIRAL 2 is clearly to extend {{our knowledge of the}} limit of existence and the structure of nuclei deeply in the medium and heavy mass region (A= 60 to 140) which is to day an almost unexplored continent. SPIRAL 2 is based on a high power, CW, superconducting driver LINAC, delivering 5 mA of deuteron beams at 40 MeV (200 KW) directed on <b>a</b> <b>C</b> <b>converter</b> Uranium target and producing therefore more 10 ^ 13 fissions/s. The expected radioactive beams intensities for exotic species in the mass range from A= 60 to A= 140, of the order of 10 ^ 6 to 10 ^ 10 pps will surpass by two order of magnitude any existing facilities in the world. These unstable atoms will be available at energies between few KeV/n to 15 MeV/n. The same driver will accelerate high intensity (100 μA to 1 mA), heavier ions up to Ar at 14 MeV/n producing also proton rich exotic nuclei. In applied areas SPIRAL 2 is considered as a powerful variable energy neutron source, a must to study the impact of nuclear fission and fusion on materials. The intensities of these unstable species are excellent opportunities for new tracers and diagnostics either for solid state, material or for radiobiological science and medicine.

Computer simulations and experiments are performed to capture the effects of variation of some chosen parameters on the qualitative behaviour of the system. In particular, it is found that variation of some parameters leads to Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Analysis is presented to establish the possibility of the bifurcation phenomena.
