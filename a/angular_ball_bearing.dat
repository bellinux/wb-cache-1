40|$|Abstract: A {{rotor system}} {{supported}} by an <b>angular</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> displays very complicated non-linear behaviour due to non-linear Hertzian contact force. The non-linear force and moment {{caused by the}} ball bearing are calculated {{on the basis of}} the relationship between deflection, and five-degree-of-freedom dynamic equations of the rotor ball bearing system are established. The Newmark-β method and the Newton–Raphson method are used to solve the non-linear equations. The dynamic characteristics of angular ball bearings are computed, considering the non-linear vibration of the rotor system. Taking <b>angular</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> QJS 208 ACQ 4 C 1 /HNP 4 as an example, the effects of the vibration of the rotor system on bearing dynamic characteristics are analysed. The results show that the spin-to-roll ratio of balls, the slide ratio of the cage, and stiffness of the bearing all vary obviously with the non-periodic vibration range of the rotor; initial contact angle and axial load of the ball bearing change the non-linear dynamic nature of the rotor system and dynamic characteristics of the bearing. The rotor ball bearing system can work stably by choosing the structural and operation parameters reasonably...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 81 Double row <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in ANSI type end suction centrifugal pumps and other fluid machinery. The double row <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> supports combined axial and radial loads, provides high shaft stiffness and limits {{the movement of}} the pump impeller, shaft, and seal. Recent studies, tests, and analysis of double row <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> operating in various conditions have both confirmed and contradicted some long held opinions, regarding the application of these bearings in centrifugal pumps. The studies indicate the Conrad type (e. g., without filling slot) double row <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> operate at lower temperatures than the maximum capacity failing slot type double row bearings at 3, 600 rpm rotational speed. These lower operating temperatures result in longer bearing and lubricant life and greater pump reliability. The filling slot of the modern design maximum capacity double row bearing has been redesigned so that it seldom has direct influence n the bearing life and performance when correctly applied in the pump. Double row <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> having moderate to high contact angle and normal axial internal clearance operate at lower temperature and have better internal motion than bearings having lower contact angles and greater clearances in typical pump application conditions. The results and conclusions of the studies made with the double row <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> are discussed.

40|$|International audienceThe aeronautic {{industry}} requires {{high speed}} and high power spindles to obtain high material removal rates during long rough milling operations. The weakness of HSM spindle is the bearings, although high precision hybrid ball bearings {{have been developed}} to achieve this critical application. Inadequate use of spindles inevitably leads to shortened lifetimes. Choosing the operating conditions is a required step before machining applications. It can be achieved through either experimental tests or numerical modeling that leads to stability lobe diagrams. Stability of cuts relies on the dynamic behavior of the spindle, which is particularly due to the eigenfrequencies of the tool-shaft assembly. The frequencies depend on bearing stiffness that can change under operating conditions. That is why the impact of cutting conditions and bearing parameters on its stiffness are studied in the paper. A five degrees of freedom model of <b>angular</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> is briefly presented. A complete bearing model is introduced. The originality of the approach is the complete technological modeling, notably of the radial expansions of inner and outer rings of bearing. A non-linear expression is established from continuum mechanics model.

Then, modal analyses of the tool-spindle assembly are carried out in relation to the varying bearing stiffness.

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringHigh-speed {{machining}} is {{a particularly}} important industrial process during which material is removed using a cutting tool with rotational and translational motion. The rotating unit is {{a major part of}} the machine tool, and is composed of a bearing, spindle, and associated surrounding components. During machining, the rotating unit is exposed to large mechanical loads, as well as significant heat generated due to friction in the bearings, which can lead to thermal deformation and failure of the spindle. To achieve reliability of the spindle system, an accurate description of the thermo-mechanical behavior of the system is useful to predict the thermal effects during the design phase. Existing methods to simulate the thermo-mechanical behavior of rotating parts require significant computational resources because of the geometric complexity of the models. In this dissertation we discuss a finite element method (FEM) approach for calculating the thermo-mechanical behavior of the rotating unit using the commercially available software package ANSYS. We modeled the heat generated in <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> and applied the heat transfer of a rotating cylinder to calculate thermal load. We explored the characteristics of the spindle system, specifically <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> which are commonly used in machine tools. We carried out a geometric simplification process for <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> out to overcome the divergence phenomenon in the FEM simulation, which may occur because of contact between rolling elements and bearing races. We used Matrix 27 elements to simulate the stiffness/damping characteristics of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> and used the ‘close gap’ function in the contact elements to implement heat transfer between the inner and outer races of the bearing. We used the thermal contact conductance to describe heat transfer between the surfaces of the bearing using the close gap function. We also determined a constant describing the thermal contact conductance for several types of bearing using a parametric simulation study, and compared the results with experimental data to determine the value of the constant. We determined the fraction of the heat flux to the inner and outer races empirically via comparisons with experimental data. Next, we carried out simulations of the rotating unit using the results of this simulation. We analyzed the thermo-mechanical behavior of the rotating unit, and compared the simulated temperature distribution and thermal deformation of the spindle tip with experimental data. We investigated three types of <b>angular</b> contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> each with three different preloads.
