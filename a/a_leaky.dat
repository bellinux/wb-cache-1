5|$|SM U-21 {{was built}} at the Pola Navy Yard and was {{launched}} on 15 August 1916, {{and was the first}} of the class to be launched. U-21 was damaged in a diving trial in January 1917, requiring seven months for repairs. The U-boat was commissioned on 15 August 1917. In early October, U-21 conducted patrols off the Albanian coast, but a mid-October Mediterranean patrol was cut short by <b>a</b> <b>leaky</b> seal on her main hatch. After an additional eight months of repairs, U-21 again conducted patrols off Albania. A broken piston in her diesel engine cut short her war career. At Pola at the war's end, U-21 was ceded to Italy in 1920 as a war reparation and broken up. U-21 did not have any successes during the war.|$|E
5|$|Sivanandam interrogates Usha, {{who tells}} him {{how she and}} Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using <b>a</b> <b>leaky</b> {{fountain}} pen in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all of the suspects at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All the suspects shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E

25|$|By 1859 most of {{the extreme}} {{clippers}} had been dismasted more than once after half {{a decade or more}} of relentless hard driving. All were in <b>a</b> <b>leaky</b> condition, and {{most of the}}ir owners were by then in dire financial straits and could not afford expensive repairs to clippers that could not find a paying cargo to justify such expenses. Their masts were cut down, their yards shortened and their sails reduced as they were refitted and re-rigged with the new Howes rig to make them easier to handle by smaller crews. Other less fortunate clippers were discarded outright and sold for a pittance.|$|E
25|$|In 1808 William Balfour {{replaced}} Balderston. He {{wrote to}} his uncle {{and some of his}} letters were later published. He described her as <b>a</b> <b>leaky</b> and that she should be taken out of service. He reported that the owners had hired her out for 15s/month/ton (or £1795 per annum, based on a burthen of 195 tons). The owners also had agreed to provide 45 men at a rate of £5 10s each, per month. However, Balfour further reported that the owners were rarely able to provide half that many. At the time of writing, Cockatrice had a crew of 30 including Balfour and his servant. Lastly, Balfour reported that it was his understanding that Balderston had, in his 16 months in command, amassed some £2000 in prize money.|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{stochastic}} neuron models {{employed in}} the neurobiological literature generate renewal point processes, i. e., successive intervals between spikes are statistically uncorrelated.

We study <b>an</b> <b>leaky</b> integrate-and-re (LIF) model with a dynamical threshold or an adaptation current both of which lead to negative correlations.

25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. <b>A</b> <b>leaky</b> capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Napoleonic Wars Ferrier was active in the Channel in command of a 74-gun ship, before being sent to the East Indies. He helped to escort a valuable convoy of East Indiamen, which had narrowly escaped from a French squadron, and spent four years on the station, frustrating French ambitions in the Persian Gulf and surviving an arduous voyage back to England through gales and aboard <b>a</b> <b>leaky</b> ship. Promoted to flag-rank in 1810 he was given an assignment with the fleet in the North Sea, flying his flag on a number of ships, before retiring ashore after the wars. He settled at Deal, Kent, and was a frequent visitor to the Duke of Wellington's residence, Walmer Castle, having made friends of the Duke and naval officers like Admiral Lord Exmouth during his career. He was promoted to the rank of admiral of the blue, and died in London in 1836, two days after an operation to relieve an internal complaint.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{cause of}} the Sultana disaster {{was determined to be}} mismanagement of water levels in the boiler, exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} vessel was severely overcrowded and top heavy. As the steamboat made her way north following the twists and turns of the river, she listed severely to one side then the other. Her four boilers were interconnected and mounted side-by-side, so that if the boat tipped sideways, water would tend to run out of the highest boiler. With the fires still going against the empty boiler, this created hot spots. When the boat tipped the other way, water rushing back into the empty boiler would hit the hot spots and flash instantly to steam, creating a sudden surge in pressure. This effect of careening could have been minimized by maintaining high water levels in the boilers. The official inquiry found that the boat's boilers exploded due to the combined effects of careening, low water level, and a faulty repair to <b>a</b> <b>leaky</b> boiler made a few days earlier.|$|E

25|$|Parma's squad {{was further}} {{improved}} {{by the summer}} arrival of Colombian striker Faustino Asprilla and they managed a first major international trophy in 1993 when an early volley from captain Lorenzo Minotti from a corner, an Alessandro Melli header and a late Stefano Cuoghi strike helped Parma to a 3–1 victory in the Cup Winners' Cup over Belgian side Royal Antwerp at Wembley Stadium in England on 12 May 1993. They also managed a record high finish of third place, but slipped to defeat in the 1992 Supercoppa Italiana against A.C. Milan. The following season, the club were successful in the European Super Cup; winning an all Italian final against AC Milan. Having lost the first leg at home by a single goal to nil, victory was nonetheless secured after goals from new boys Nestor Sensini and hard man Massimo Crippa. The same season, however, they lost the Cup Winners' Cup 1–0 in the final against Arsenal and slipped to 5th in the league due to <b>a</b> <b>leaky</b> defence, despite new signing Gianfranco Zola scoring eighteen league goals as part of Parma's three-pronged forward line, alongside Brolin and Asprilla.|$|E
