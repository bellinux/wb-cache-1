5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried to learn <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things}} that made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E

25|$|Oroonoko is {{the first}} English novel to show Africans in a {{sympathetic}} manner. At the same time, this novel is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of kingship {{as it is about}} the nature of race. Oroonoko is a prince, and he is of noble lineage whether of African or European descent, and the novel's regicide is devastating to the colony. The theatrical nature of the plot follows from Behn's previous experience as a dramatist. The language she uses in Oroonoko is far more straightforward than in her other novels, and she dispenses {{with a great deal of}} the emotional content of her earlier works. Further, the novel is unusual in Behn's fictions by having a very clear love story without complications of gender roles.|$|E

500|$|Caesar A. Montevecchio of the University of Notre Dame {{published}} a theological {{assessment of the}} spiritual themes in the film concentrating on the act of priestly renunciation depicted towards the end stating: [...] "This climactic scene of Rodrigues trampling the fumie makes clear that Silence is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> object of Christian faith {{as it is the}} experience of that faith. As ambient and live sound are washed out entirely, Rodrigues hears the voice of Christ telling him to trample, that it was to be trampled upon that Christ came into the world. The object of faith becomes a Christ who is a hero of pity, who takes up the weakness and suffering of humankind as his cross, rather than a hero of triumphant resolve. The Jesus of Silence is one of utter kenosis (self-emptying), and one who in the mercy of that kenosis radically sympathizes with the weakness, and frailty, of human beings, even ones like Judas and Kichijiro." ...|$|E

500|$|Eight years {{previous}} to the Once Upon a Time pilot (the two {{had just}} completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairytales out of a love of [...] "mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different worlds." [...] They presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastical nature. The two learned from their time on Lost {{to look at the}} story in a different way, that [...] "character has to trump mythology"; they expanded, [...] "as people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to care about them... For us, this was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke– going at it that way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'" [...] Despite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows. To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about [...] "hope".

500|$|... "Machine Gun" [...] {{is another}} song that Hendrix had {{spent more time}} developing. [...] By the Fillmore East concerts, it became an {{extended}} guitar improvisational piece, which [...] "would completely change the perception of Hendrix's capabilities as an improviser and musician", according to Shadwick. [...] Although based on a [...] "minor drone-blues" [...] {{in the line of}} [...] "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", Hendrix's performance has been compared to jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's approach to improvisation. [...] Miles Davis, with whom Coltrane had recorded several albums in the 1950s, including the influential Kind of Blue, noted the connection: [...] "Jimi liked what I had done with Kind of Blue and some other stuff and wanted to add more jazz elements to what he was doing. [...] He liked the way Coltrane played with all those sheets of sound, and played his guitar in a similar way". [...] From Hendrix's dedication of the song [...] "to all the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York, oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam", [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s American race riots as the war in Vietnam. [...] Guitarist Vernon Reid describes it as [...] "like a movie about war without the visuals. [...] It had everything—the lyrics, the humanism of it, the drama of it, the violence of it, the eeriness of it, [...] the unpredictability of it". [...] In many commentaries about Band of Gypsys, [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is singled out as the highlight of the album. [...] Both McDermott and Shadwick call it one of Hendrix's greatest achievements, which sets a standard {{that the rest of the}} album does not approach.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Blackmun, {{writing for}} the majority, began his opinion by giving a brief {{overview}} of the Virginia pharmacy regulation statutes, and then distinguished previous challenges to such regulations, explaining that such previous cases had been based on economic due process under the Fourteenth Amendment rather than on free speech grounds. [...] Blackmun reasoned that this case concerned not only commercial regulation, but the free flow of information. [...] This case was just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> consumers’ right to receive information as it was about the pharmacists’ right to provide it, and that the right to free speech is just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> “listener” as it is about the “speaker”.|$|E

2500|$|As the PBS series Frontline explored, MTV was {{a driving}} force that catapulted music videos to a {{mainstream}} audience, turning music videos into an art form {{as well as a}} marketing machine that became beneficial to artists. Danny Goldberg, chairman and CEO of Artemis Records, said the following about the art of music videos: [...] "I know when I worked with Nirvana, Kurt Cobain cared <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> videos as he did about the records. He wrote the scripts for them, he was in the editing room, and they were part of his art. And I think they stand up as part of his art, and I think that's true of the great artists today. Not every artist is a great artist and not every video is a good video, but in general having it available as a tool, to me, adds to the business. And I wish there had been music videos in the heyday of The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. I think they would've added to their creative contribution, not subtracted from it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the trial}} was ostensibly about the {{obscenity}} of the [...] "Nausicaa" [...] episode, a number of scholars, such as Holly Baggett, Jane Marek, and Adam Parkes, argue that {{the trial was}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> iconoclastic character of the magazine and its [...] "politically radical lesbian" [...] editors. Though Quinn defended Anderson and Heap in the trial, in his letters to Ezra Pound, Quinn expressed distaste for his defendants. In a letter from October 16, 1920 Quinn wrote, [...] "I have no interest at all in defending people who are stupidly and brazenly and Sapphoistically and pederastically and urinally, and menstrually violat the law, and think they are courageous". Anderson and Heap faced not only a hostile prosecution and judges indifferent to the literary merits of Ulysses, but also a defence attorney who, in some ways, sided with the prosecution. In Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity: A Cultural Biography, Irene Gammel argues that the trial was ultimately a battle over women’s issues and the paternalist functions of obscenity laws at the time [...] Gammel asserts that Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, a prolific contributor of poetry to The Little Review, became the magazine's figurehead in a fight for authority in determining the subject matter women {{should be able to}} write about and read. Gammel writes, “If Heap was the field marshall for The Little Review’s vanguard battle against puritan conventions and traditional sexual aesthetics, then the Baroness was to become its fighting machine”.|$|E
