5|$|In {{the same}} year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, {{as a young}} American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the {{outbreak}} of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters. He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, <b>and</b> (<b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time) Growing Pains.|$|E

5|$|The Bharat Ratna, {{along with}} other {{personal}} civil honours, was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during {{the change in the}} national government; <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several public-interest litigations challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communiqué announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.|$|E

Having lost the talents of Sam Young, DeJuan Blair and Levance Fields, the Panthers were picked in a pre-season Big East poll to finish ninth in the conference. Instead, Pitt earned a 13–5 Big East record, good enough for a second seed in the Big East tournament, received a third seed in the NCAA Tournament, and finished 25–9 overall record. In 2010–11, Pitt won the regular season Big East title <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time in the program's history, earned a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
25|$|The Arab chroniclers of Sindh (an Arab {{province}} from 712 CE onward), narrated {{the campaigns}} of Arab governors on Jurz, the Arabic term for Gurjara.

The country was first conquered by Mohammad bin Qasim (712-715) <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time, by Junayd (723-726). Upon bin Qasim's victory, Al-Baladhuri {{mentioned that the}} Indian rulers, including that of Bhinmal, accepted Islam and paid tribute. They presumably recanted after bin Qasim's departure, which made Junayd's attack necessary. After Junayd's reconquest, the kingdom at Bhinmal {{appears to have been}} annexed by the Arabs.|$|E

25|$|After a {{disastrous}} fire leveled {{much of the}} downtown core in 1904, the fledgling municipal government passed an ordinance requiring all buildings {{in the area to}} be built of 'fireproof' materials like brick and stone. Consequently, a new city centre rose from the ashes sporting brick buildings along broad avenues that would have looked more at home in a sedate and refined Victorian city than a rough-and-tumble frontier coal town. They were short-lived, however, as a second, larger inferno swept through the city on August 1, 1908. Whipped up by sudden winds, a nearby forest fire burnt its way into a lumber yard {{on the edge of the}} community and sparked a Dresden-style firestorm that melted brick and mortar and essentially erased the entire city in an afternoon. There were few casualties, however, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time a stately brick downtown core rose from the ashes. Today, these historic buildings, most of which still stand, are a treasured and distinctive feature of the community.|$|E
25|$|The Dynamo {{then had}} to face New York Red Bulls who had bested them {{during the regular season}} in all three meetings, and it looked like they would thrash the Dynamo in the playoffs as well after the Red Bulls jumped out to a 2–0 lead during the first leg in Houston. Ricardo Clark was able to get on the board at the 50', and Omar Cummings, {{recently}} returned to full form, scored in stoppage time to complete the Dynamo exciting comeback. The 2nd leg in New York proved to be just as exciting. Bradley Wright-Phillips put the Red Bulls in the series lead again in the 23', but Brad Davis punished a mistake from the Red Bull defense to level the score before the half. Enter Omar Cummings for a second time, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time, he scored a thrilling stoppage time goal to put the Houston Dynamo into the Conference Championship for the 3rd consecutive year.|$|E
25|$|By the {{midpoint}} of the 2009 season, things had improved both on and off field for Melbourne. They had secured a record number of members, re-merged with the MCC, knocked-off more debt and were starting to show some fight on field. Players such as Liam Jurrah had begun to emerge as top young talents and were catching the eye of the footballing public. However, {{on the eve of the}} Round 14 clash against West Coast, influential president Jim Stynes announced that he had cancer, this evoked a very emotional response from the footballing public and the club lifted from three embarrassing defeats the weeks before to convincingly beat West Coast in front of a passionate MCG crowd. At the end of the season, Melbourne finished 16th on the ladder <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> year in a row won no more than four games which granted them a Priority Pick in the National Draft. Melbourne therefore had picks 1 and 2 in the draft to build on their young talent. At the end of the season fan favourites Russell Robertson, Matthew Whelan and Paul Wheatley announced that they would no longer be playing for Melbourne in 2010 and beyond. During September 2009, midfielder Brock McLean asked to be a traded and a deal involving Carlton's pick 11 in the National Draft was agreed to.|$|E

Sinatra later said of this concert [...] "I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting".|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Yad Vashem {{historian}} Avraham Milgram {{published a}} study where {{he asserted that}} [...] "the discrepancy between the reality and {{the myth of the}} number of visas granted by Sousa Mendes is great." [...] According to Milgram it was probably Harry Ezratty who was the first to mention in an article published in 1964 that Sousa Mendes had saved 30,000 refugees, of which 10,000 were Jews, a number which has since then been repeated automatically by journalists and academics. Milgram says that Ezratty, imprudently, took the total number of Jewish refugees who passed through Portugal and ascribed it to the work of Aristides de Sousa Mendes. To make his point Milgram cross checked the numbers from the Bordeaux ‘s visa register entry books with those of the HICEM reports and although he acknowledged that visas delivered in cities of Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse cannot be exactly determined, Milgram asserted that the numbers are exaggerated. Again in 2011, Milgram published a densely researched book, “Portugal Salazar and the Jews” <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time he asserted that: [...] "authors, especially those who wish to sing the praises of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, tend to overstate the number of visas with figures that not satisfy research criteria, but rather correspond to their wishful thinking".|$|E
