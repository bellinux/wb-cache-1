By the 14th century, the defences had been long abandoned, and the land was being used for <b>arable</b> <b>crops.</b> Dunstanburgh formed part of the barony of Embleton, a village that lies inland to the west, traditionally owned by the earls of Lancaster.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{factors that}} influenced fertilizer use intensity among <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in Abak agricultural zone in Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria. Primary {{data were obtained}} from 150 <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in the zone. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis were used to analyze data collected. The result reveals that majority of farmers were getting old and there is low social capital accumulation among <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers. Also, age, gender, household size, farm size, perceived price of fertilizer, value of farm output, extension agent visit, number of goats and sheep own by farmers, and decision to own poultry by farmers {{as well as the}} distance to fertilizer selling point are significant factors affecting fertilizer use intensity among <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in Abak agricultural zone in Akwa Ibom state. The study recommends that Akwa Ibom state government should further subsidize the price of fertilizer to make fertilizer more affordable to small holder farmers. In addition, <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farming households in the state should be sensitized on the current method of family planning as this would help to reduce non-farm cost and help increase fertilizer procurement. Furthermore, the extension unit of the state ministry of Agriculture should be strengthened to educate <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers more on fertilizer usage...|$|R

5|$|This species' {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} shallow water is naturally susceptible to {{problems such as}} drought or the encroachment of vegetation, but this duck's habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change. Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to <b>arable</b> <b>crops,</b> depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas. Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities, and a Canadian study showed {{that more than half}} of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{depend on}} plants for food, either {{directly}} or as feed for domestic animals. Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for <b>arable</b> <b>crops,</b> horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analysed}} the {{determinants of}} income distribution among <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in Ekiti State, Nigeria. It was carried out using a structured questionnaire to collect data in six Local Government Areas of Ekiti State through a multi-stage sampling technique. Descriptive statistics, Line chat, Gini decomposition and regression analyses were {{used to analyze the}} data collected from the field survey. It was revealed in this study that mechanization, educational level, household size, number of crops grown and secondary occupation all have significant effect on the household income distribution among the <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farm households in Ekiti State, Nigeria. It was revealed that the average age was about 54 years and standard deviation of 9. 9. Also, majority of the respondents are males and are married and having about 19 years as average years of farming experience. This study however recommended that agricultural activities should be promoted among rural households in Nigeria. Policy makers, therefore, must concentrate on measures to increase agricultural productivity through targeted efforts such as making mechanization facilities available to the rural <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers. Similarly, large scale farming and mixed cropping system should be encouraged to further help in increasing the income of the <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farm households in rural and urban of the study area...|$|R

5|$|Horse {{ownership}} {{was widespread}} by the 12th century. Both tenant farmers and landlords {{were involved in}} the harrowing of land for <b>arable</b> <b>crops</b> in the relatively new open field system, and employed horses for this work. Horses and carts were increasingly used for transporting farm goods and implements; peasants were obliged to transport such items in their own carts, though the poorest may have had to rely on one horse for all their farm work. The necessity for carting produce revolutionised communication between villages. Horse-breeding as an enterprise continued; in the 14th century, Hexham Priory had 80broodmares, the Prior of Durham owned two stud farms, Rievaulx Abbey owned one, Gilbert d'Umfraville, Earl of Angus, in Scotland, had significant grazing lands for mares, and horse-breeding was being carried out both east and west of the Pennines.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{have been}} raised in the Llŷn Peninsula for over a {{thousand}} years, and Aberdaron has produced and exported wool for many years. The main product locally was felt, produced by soaking the cloth in water and beating it with large wooden paddles until the wool formed a thick mat which could be flattened, dried and cut into lengths. There were two fulling mills on the Afon Daron, in addition to three corn mills, and lichen was gathered around Y Rhiw, from which a grey dye was extracted. <b>Arable</b> <b>crops</b> consisted mainly of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. The field boundaries date back several centuries and are marked by walls, cloddiau and hedgerows; important habitats {{for a variety of}} wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon <b>arable</b> <b>crops,</b> such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|E

40|$|Quantification of soil {{physical}} quality (SPQ) and {{pore size}} distribution (PSD) can assist understanding of how changes in land management practices influence dynamics of soil structure, and this understanding could greatly improve the predictability of soil physical behavior and crop yield. The objectives {{of this study were}} to measure the SPQ index under two different land management practices (the continuous <b>arable</b> <b>cropping</b> system and natural bush fallow system), and contrast the effects of these practices on the structure of PSD using soil water retention data. Soil water retention curves obtained from a pressure chamber were fitted to van Genuchten&# 8217;s equation, setting m (= 1 - 1 /n). Although values for soil bulk density were high, soils under the continuous <b>arable</b> <b>cropping</b> system had good SPQ, and maintained the capacity to support root development. However, soils under the natural bush fallow system had a worse structure than the continuous arable system, with restrictions in available water capacity. These two management systems had different PSDs. Results showed the inferiority of the natural bush fallow system with no traffic restriction (which is the common practice) in relation to the continuous <b>arable</b> <b>cropping</b> system in regard to physical quality and structure...|$|R

40|$|Competitiveness of {{traditional}} <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> system of Alentejo region of Portugal {{has been questioned}} for long. Discussion and research on the sustainability of the system has evolved on two contrasted alternative options for production technologies to traditional system. On the one hand reduced and no tillage systems aim to more extensive technical operations reducing costs and maintaining production, or even to increase it {{in the long run}} as soil fertility improves. On the other hand, input intensification using irrigation, as a complement in the last stage of crop cycle or always when needed, aimed to increase system production levels. To evaluate competitiveness and sustainability of <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> system we evaluated traditional rotation technology and alternative no tillage and irrigation systems and analyze their farm economic results as well as their energy efficiency and environmental impacts. The analysis of the impact of no tillage and irrigation on arable land production system showed that both alternatives contributed to cost savings and profit earnings, energy savings and reduced GHG emissions, increasing physical and economic factor efficiency. Research and technological development of both options are worthwhile to promote competitiveness and sustainability of <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> production systems of the Alentejo region in Portugal...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Delta State, Nigeria, to investigate the effect of rural-urban remittances on <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> production. Twenty percent (20 %) of the registered <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in Delta State were selected to arrive at 131 respondents for the study. Questionnaire and structured interview schedule were used to collect data from the respondents. Descriptive and inferential statistics and contingency tables were used to treat the collected data. It was discovered that most (69. 5 %) of rural-urban migrants were in the 11 - 30 age bracket. The remittances from rural farm households were far higher than the remittances from rural-urban migrants. The little remittances from the rural-urban migrants were added to the funds of the rural farm household, farm labour and inputs. The remittances from rural-urban migrants did not make any meaningful contribution to <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> production. It was recommended that governments should make the rural areas attractive to young school learners/graduates, embark on enlightenment programme to expose the youths to agriculture related self-employment opportunities in the rural areas; and create enabling environment for the youths to operate as self-employed individuals in the rural areas...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} carried out to model an optimal <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> plan that {{minimizes}} child farm labour use in Ogun State, Nigeria. A multistage sampling technique was used to select a total of 400 rural households from the State. The household survey involves an interview of 594 children, 400 household heads and a focus group discussion section in four locations. The data collected were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics {{in line with the}} study objectives. The linear programming model was used to develop an optimal <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farm that maximizes economic returns to the farmers while simultaneously allowing for maximum school attendance and involvement. The optimal farm model revealed that a restructuring of the crop enterprise plan could increase the annual farm income by about 15. 3 percent, {{while at the same time}} minimizing the child farm labour involvement in the State. The study recommends that reducing child labour, will require facilitating access to credit to the resources-poor rural households. Also, that government should provide assistance to <b>arable</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in the areas of subsidizing the costs of production inputs (seeds, tractor hiring, fertilizers and other agrochemicals), and that research efforts should be geared towards developing simple, affordable, and adaptable machines/implements, and other farm labour-saving devises...|$|R

Job cuts have reduced the acreage of this crop, although feasibility studies have shown that sugar beet could be used commercially to produce cleaner car fuel. Pocklington is bisected by the largely culverted Pocklington Beck, a small brook that feeds into the Pocklington Canal. The beck and canal are usually good fishing grounds but a sewerage overflow in 2003 killed thousands of fish and severely damaged the ecosystem, from which it is now recovered.|$|E
25|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of the country, farmers in Penwith have in recent years been put under {{financial}} pressure, due to a withdrawal of subsidies from the EU Common Agricultural Policy, pressure from supermarkets and crises such as foot and mouth in 2001. Agriculture in Penwith is predominantly dairy with some <b>arable</b> <b>crops</b> such as potatoes, cauliflower and broccoli (confusingly these are locally called broccoli and calebrese, respectively). Cornwall's mild climate and an absence of hard winter frosts mean that these cold-sensitive crops can be produced much earlier than in the rest of the country, and early Cornish new potatoes are a lucrative source of income. Unfortunately this cash crop has come under pressure in recent years due to globalization, which means competition with cheap imports from Egypt.|$|E
