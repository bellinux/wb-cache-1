40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{automated}} generation of test cases from contract-oriented specifications. The static analysis we develop rely on original constraint minimization and satisfaction techniques (CSP). We propose a flexible CSP architecture that can apply not only on integer or bounded domains but also on arbitrary types. The original notion of type builders is used to establish {{the connection between the}} type semantics and the CSP framework. We illustrate this aspect by developing a string builder that can automatically generate string instances depending on combinations of constraints based on string sizes and substrings. The scope of these techniques goes beyond the generation of test cases. They are used in other static analyzes, most notably a symbolic <b>animation</b> of <b>contracts</b> that can detect inconsistencies early in the development cycle...|$|R

5000|$|The film is {{produced}} in a style of limited animation that intentionally parodies the low budget, low quality television Saturday morning cartoons that aired regularly during {{the era of the}} 1950s and 1960s. During this time, television <b>animation</b> studios were <b>contracted</b> to turn out high quantities of product on low budgets, and this resulted in a large number of television cartoons that have been derided and mocked by television critics, film and animation historians, and audiences in general. Mr. Incredible and Pals provides examples of this style of low budget television animation, which produced such stereotypical fare as: ...|$|R

In 1987, DiC moved production of Dennis the Menace to a Canadian animation firm for grants and tax breaks from the Canadian government. The company started moving some work to Korea and Taiwan.

After Osamu Tsuchida (originally of Hōsō Dōga) left Studio Yuni (not {{to be confused}} with the anime background art company of the same name), he founded Tsuchida Production in 1976 to do animation, production, finish <b>animation,</b> and other <b>contract</b> work related to the production of anime.

Some of the employees went on to form Studio Comet.|$|R

Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live action and animation would [...] "save" [...] Disney's <b>animation</b> department. Spielberg's <b>contract</b> included an extensive amount of creative control and {{a large percentage of the}} box office profits. Disney kept all merchandising rights. Spielberg convinced Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, King Features Syndicate, Felix the Cat Productions, Turner Entertainment, and Universal Pictures/Walter Lantz Productions to [...] "lend" [...] their characters to appear in the film with (in some cases) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed; for example, Disney's Donald Duck and Warner's Daffy Duck appear as equally-talented dueling pianists, and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene. Apart from this agreement, Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of Roger Rabbit. Additionally, the producers were unable to acquire the rights to use Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu, Casper the Friendly Ghost or the Terrytoons for appearances from their respective owners (King Features, Turner, Western Publishing, Harvey Comics and Viacom).|$|R
