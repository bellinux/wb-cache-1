5|$|Arguably {{the most}} notable game of Heisman's career was the most {{lopsided}} victory in college football history. In 1916, Cumberland College ended its football program and attempted to cancel a scheduled game with Heisman's Jackets. Heisman, however, was seeking vengeance for a 22–0 baseball loss to Cumberland {{in the spring of}} 1916, <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Heisman suspected Cumberland of hiring professional players to pose as Cumberland students. Heisman refused the game's cancellation and Cumberland mustered up a group of commonfolk to play Tech. Tech won 222–0. Neither team achieved a first down other than a touchdown, as Cumberland either punted or turned the ball over before a first down and Tech scored on almost every play from scrimmage. Jim Preas, Tech's kicker, kicked 16 point after tries, which is still a record for a single game.|$|E

It proved to be his only goal during his time at Forest Green, making 14 appearances, all of which in the league. Odubade returned to Gateshead following the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, and was told he was one of seven players released by the club in April 2013.|$|E

5|$|He {{introduced}} massages {{and changed}} the canteen and team kit for the 1979–80 campaign. With no money available for transfers {{he was forced to}} turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|His initial {{appearance}} of the 1914season was in relief on April 17, <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he pitched 4innings, and gave up three runs in 6–5victory over the Reds. He followed that with two consecutive strong games as the starting pitcher, allowing just one unearned run in each game; the second was a complete game against the Reds. On June12, he started the game against New York, only to be injured {{in the third inning}} when he was hit in the hand by a ball batted by Fred Merkel, and had to leave the game. The injury did not cause Lavender to lose much playing time. He pitched a four-inning relief appearance on June19, followed by a complete game shutout on June27 against the Reds. On August17, he pitched a second shutout during the season, a 3-0victory over the Brooklyn Robins.|$|E

It {{was to be a}} scoring debut for Walker, scoring a free-kick that went in off the post to give Stevenage the lead in a 2–0 victory. He made his first league appearance for Stevenage in the club's 1–0 home loss to Northampton Town in December 2010, <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Walker hit the crossbar from a free-kick. Despite being due to stay at Stevenage until the beginning of January 2011, Walker was recalled by his parent club Watford on 23 December, in order to provide cover for the injured Stephen McGinn. Walker made two appearances for Stevenage, scoring one goal, as his loan spell at the club was disrupted by fixture postponements.|$|E
