5|$|Throughout 2013, the World Affairs Councils of America hosted Not My Life {{screenings}} in {{a variety}} of cities across the United States, funded by the Carlson Family Foundation. That same year, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency gave Worldwide Documentaries a grant to do <b>anti-human</b> trafficking work over a three-year period. Not My Life was screened at the Mexican film festival Oaxaca FilmFest in November 2012; BORDEReview in Warsaw, Poland, in May 2013; and the Pasadena International Film & New Media Festival in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{started on}} May 23 in Lethbridge {{and went on}} to the other Canadian cities of Saskatoon, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, London, Winnipeg, Calgary, Victoria, Vancouver, Kelowna, Edmonton, and Red Deer. London was added mid-tour because of popular demand. The London {{performances}} were hosted by Men Against Sexual Trafficking and the London <b>Anti-Human</b> Trafficking Committee. The final performances of the tour were conducted at the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer from October 2 to 6. After the Saturday matinée in each city, a panel discussion was held with both the audience and anyone else who wanted to attend, the purpose being to raise awareness about human trafficking in Canada and elsewhere. The final talkback panel in Red Deer was attended by about 70 people.|$|E
5|$|While {{he reads}} the diary {{over the course of}} several months, Jake is confronted by his {{siblings}} about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister’s human fiancée and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father’s diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‘’Gallus Rex’’, an <b>anti-human</b> chicken group. Their actions colored Jake’s perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about their effect on Jake in his diary.|$|E

25|$|The confirmatory HIV test {{employs a}} western blot to detect anti-HIV {{antibody}} {{in a human}} serum sample. Proteins from known HIV-infected cells are separated and blotted on a membrane as above. Then, the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step; free antibody is washed away, and a secondary <b>anti-human</b> antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added. The stained bands then indicate the proteins to which the patient's serum contains antibody.|$|E
25|$|Crithidia luciliae are haemoflaggelate single celled protists. They {{are used}} as a {{substrate}} in immunofluorescence {{for the detection of}} anti-dsDNA antibodies. They possess an organelle known as the kinetoplast which is a large mitochondrion with a network of interlocking circular dsDNA molecules. After incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies and fluorescent-labelled <b>anti-human</b> antibodies, the kinetoplast will fluoresce. The lack of other nuclear antigens in this organelle means that using C.luciliae as a substrate allows for the specific detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies.|$|E

25|$|Before {{forming the}} band, Daniel Vahnke studied {{anthropology}} in Toronto {{while working on}} piano pieces based on Chinese character stroke analysis. After the purchase of his first Roland S-50, Daniel became fascinated with Sample Based Composition, considering it a cleaner, safer, and more efficient method of creating music. In 1988 he created Vampire Rodents with his friend Victor Wulf, who had been writing experimental pop music, {{as a form of}} entertainment. However, the band soon developed into a creative outlet for Daniel's darkly humorous lyrics as well as his somewhat <b>Anti-human</b> ideals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages, Nazi {{policies}} targeting Jews (whether directly or through aryanization) treated them as sub-human, {{but with a}} right to live under such conditions that this status affords. In the later stages, policy was formulated to define the Jews as <b>anti-human,</b> with extermination being viewed as an increasingly urgent necessity. The growing Nazi momentum of destruction, began with the murdering of Jews in German and German-annexed and occupied countries, and then intensified into a search for Jews to either exterminate or use as forced labour from countries allied with Nazi Germany as well as neutral countries.|$|E
25|$|From 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis before {{returning}} to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969). In 1970, Foucault {{was admitted to the}} Collège de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of left-wing groups involved in anti-racist campaigns, <b>anti-human</b> rights abuses, and penal reform. Foucault later published Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society. Foucault died in Paris of neurological problems compounded by HIV/AIDS; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease. His partner Daniel Defert founded the AIDES charity in his memory.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses antigen-coated microtitre plates for the {{detection}} of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively. The antigens are either from cell extracts or recombinant. Blood serum is incubated in the wells of the plate and is washed out. If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then they will remain after washing. A secondary <b>anti-human</b> antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen. There are significant differences in {{the detection}} of ANA by immunofluorescence and different ELISA kits and there is only a marginal agreement between these. A clinician must be familiar with the differences in order to evaluate the outcomes of the various assays.|$|E
25|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used tests for ANAs. Typically, HEp-2 cells are used as a substrate to detect the antibodies in human serum. Microscope slides are coated with HEp-2 cells and the serum is incubated with the cells. If antibodies are present then they will bind to the antigens on the cells; in the case of ANAs, the antibodies will bind to the nucleus. These can be visualised by adding a fluorescent tagged (usually FITC or rhodopsin B) <b>anti-human</b> antibody that binds to the antibodies. The molecule will fluoresce when a specific wavelength of light shines on it, which can be seen under the microscope. Depending on the antibody present in the human serum and the localisation of the antigen in the cell, distinct patterns of fluorescence will be seen on the HEp-2 cells. Levels of antibodies are analysed by performing dilutions on blood serum. An ANA test is considered positive if fluorescence is seen at a titre of 1:40/1:80. Higher titres are more clinically significant as low positives (≤1:160) are found in up to 20% of healthy individuals, especially the elderly. Only around 5% of the healthy population have ANA titres of 1:160 or higher.|$|E
500|$|Critic Allan Raible of ABC News {{compared}} the song to earlier Radiohead songs [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] and [...] "Pyramid Song" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} compositions Thom Yorke and company have ever released." [...] Richardson gave the song a score of seven out of ten in Pitchforks song review feature The Playlist, and wrote that while it could be criticized as [...] "a noble but failed experiment, overly maudlin and sentimental even if it is surface-level pretty", the song's [...] "simplicity and unsubtle affect, especially coming from this band, wind up being strengths." [...] In a later column, Richardson would further defend the song from charges of excessive sentimentality and attributes the song's emotional success to its severe subject, death: [...] "If these pieces were connected to thoughts of breaking up with a girlfriend or getting fired or lamenting cold weather or any of a million other of life's tragedies, they wouldn't work, {{at least not in the}} same way. They need that huge weight [...] on the other end to balance them out." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV.com called the song a [...] "slow, florid affair" [...] and placed its [...] "typically dark" [...] lyrics in the context of Radiohead's previous political activism, such as their participation in the <b>anti-human</b> trafficking MTV EXIT campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Historical and anthropological {{research}} suggests that nearly all societies have developed {{the idea of a}} sinister and <b>anti-human</b> force that can hide itself within society. This commonly involves a belief in witches, a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in incest, murder, and cannibalism. Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society. For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms, to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals, or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems.|$|E
2500|$|Ahead of the {{occasion}} of Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland in May 2011, Higgins asked Enda Kenny in the Dáil if [...] "the queen of England might be politely asked {{to contribute to the}} cost of her bed & breakfast during her visit to Ireland," [...] observing that [...] "the Irish people needed the financial help since they could soon be sleeping rough, as the country faced bankruptcy to pay off the debts of German and French banks which had recklessly gambled and lost in the Irish property bubble". On 4 May 2011, Enda Kenny was forced to apologise to Higgins in the Dáil after falsely accusing him of being a supporter of Osama bin Laden after Higgins offered criticism of his assassination by the CIA. Higgins had asked the Taoiseach: “Is assassination only justified if the target is a reactionary, anti-democratic, <b>anti-human</b> rights obscurantist like bin Laden?”.|$|E
2500|$|The {{church has}} been {{suspected}} of trafficking underage women across state lines, as well as across the US–Canada and US–Mexico borders, {{for the purpose of}} sometimes involuntary plural marriage and sexual abuse. The FLDS is suspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of having trafficked more than 30 under-age girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 to be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the FLDS's activities: [...] "In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity." [...] According to the Vancouver Sun, it's unclear whether or not Canada's <b>anti-human</b> trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS's pre-2005 activities, because the statute {{may not be able to}} be applied retroactively.

2500|$|Cuccinelli {{has been}} a staunch {{advocate}} against human trafficking during his time in office, describing it as [...] "one of the most egregious human rights violations". He has slammed popular media for portraying prostitution {{and other forms of}} selling sex as [...] "just another career choice". While in the state Senate he created a plan, which he has implemented as attorney general, to crack down on trafficking on the state and served on the Senate Human Trafficking Commission. As attorney general, he has devoted full-time staff in the attorney general's office to prosecute human trafficking, and in May 2013 one of his assistant attorneys general was honored by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for breaking up and prosecuting a sex trafficking ring in Fairfax County. The advocacy group Polaris Project named Virginia one of the most improved states in cracking down on human trafficking in 2010 under Cuccinelli's leadership. He made human trafficking legislation his priority in his efforts during the 2013 General Assembly session, teaming up with Democratic and Republican lawmakers in support of three <b>anti-human</b> trafficking bills, all of which were passed and signed into law.|$|E

[...] Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend seemingly <b>anti-human</b> measures, such as severe population control and the claim regarding the Third World that [...] "the best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve". However, Bookchin himself later admitted that [...] "statements made by Earth First! activists are {{not to be confused with}} those made by deep ecology theorists". Ecophilosopher Warwick Fox similarly [...] "warns critics not to commit the fallacy of 'misplaced misanthropy.'

60|$|I {{went over}} all the cases, and I found the key fitted so far. The fact that Swinburne was irritated at the {{unhappiness}} of Christians and yet more irritated at their happiness was easily explained. It {{was no longer a}} complication of diseases in Christianity, but a complication of diseases in Swinburne. The restraints of Christians saddened him simply because he was more hedonist than a healthy man should be. The faith of Christians angered him because he was more pessimist than a healthy man should be. In the same way the Malthusians by instinct attacked Christianity; not because there is anything especially anti-Malthusian about Christianity, but because there is something a little <b>anti-human</b> about Malthusianism.|$|E

The exhortation against moral complicity with “the basest and blackest outrages upon record within the present century, if not within the memory of man”; the branding of the Turkish race as “the one great <b>anti-human</b> specimen of humanity”; the talk of “fell satanic orgies”; the declaration {{that there was not}} a criminal in a European gaol nor a cannibal in the South Sea Islands, whose indignation would not rise at the recital of that which had been done, which remained unavenged, which had left behind all the foul and all the fierce passions that produced it, and might again spring up in another murderous harvest, from the soil soaked and reeking with blood, and in the air tainted with every imaginable deed of crime and shame,—all this vehemence was hailed with eager acclamation by multitudes who felt all that he felt, and found in his passionate invective words and a voice. Mr. Gladstone was not the man, his readers and his public were not the men, for mere denunciation. They found in him a policy. Indignation, he said in a thoroughly characteristic sentence, indignation is froth, except as it leads to action; mere remonstrance is mockery. There are states of affairs, he told them, in which human sympathy refuses to be confined by the rules, necessarily limited and conventional, of international law. Servia and Montenegro in going to war against Turkey might plead human sympathies, broad, deep, and legitimate, and that they committed no moral offence. The policy of the British government was the status quo, “as you were.” This meant the maintenance of Turkish executive authority. What was really needed was the total withdrawal of the administrative rule of the Turk. And here he used words that became very famous in the controversy:— ...|$|E
