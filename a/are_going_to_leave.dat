5|$|Tony begins {{grooming}} fourteen-year-old Lauren Branning, {{supporting her}} {{when her mother}} Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) is arrested for the attempted murder of her father. He plans {{to take her to}} a concert, but Lauren's father Max Branning (Jake Wood) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend. When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so they can run away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police. He is attacked by Bianca's ex-husband Ricky (Sid Owen) and re-arrested for breaking his bail conditions.|$|E
500|$|A review {{published}} in The Times {{shortly after the}} book's publication {{described it as a}} [...] "very charming philosophical tale", and in his paper the historian and lecturer Bob Barker praised the novel for being [...] "remarkable for its cool yet vivid style". Critic Orville Prescott, writing in The New York Times, although admitting that the novel was [...] "beautifully written" [...] and [...] "a triumph of delicate and suggestive mystification", nevertheless concluded that the story was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "vexatious". He ended his review with the words: [...] "One feels constantly that shining truths are about to be revealed; that there is something important, something significant, hidden in these pages. But it is never made clear, while the ridiculous details remain all too conspicuously in view." [...] Prescott was just as critical of Rexroth's preface to the first American edition, describing it as a [...] "pretentious introduction of uncommon density". Writing in The Independent in 1993, shortly after the 100th anniversary of Read's birth, critic Geoffrey Wheatcroft commented that Read may not have been a great novelist [...] "but The Green Child is the kind of book to write if you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> just the one novel behind: singular, odd, completely original".|$|E
2500|$|Carl D. Atkins insinuates {{that the}} final quatrain of Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 is the final stage in which youth disappears forever. [...] "As the fire goes out when the wood which has been feeding it is consumed, so is life {{extinguished}} when the strength of youth is past". He compares the burning fire that slowly {{goes out to the}} passing away of life, as old age prevails youth. Shakespeare is concerned with the reality of death, [...] "the fading out of life's energy". He realizes that what he has [...] "nourished" [...] but must now [...] "expire". [...] "The ashes of his youth doth lie" [...] –the ashes of his youth burn brightly, as he recognizes that what brightened up his youth is devoured by the fire burning away his old age. As a result, Shakespeare informs his audience that we must [...] "love more strongly", because in the end, we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it all behind and respond to death.|$|E

2500|$|Adele and Frank fall in {{love and}} plan to escape to Canada with Henry, packing the car and {{cleaning}} out the house. Meanwhile, Henry develops a friendship with a mature girl named Eleanor, and goes to see her one more time before they leave. She manipulates him into thinking Adele and Frank are going to abandon him and he accidentally reveals Frank's past. Adele assures Henry she would never leave him. [...] The morning they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> Henry takes a note to his father's house and leaves it in his mailbox. While he is walking home, a policeman offers to drive him home, and Henry accepts. The policeman is suspicious of the packed car and nearly-empty house, but eventually leaves. Adele goes to the bank to get all the money out of her account, and the bank staff, too, are suspicious. [...] While Adele is gone, the neighbor comes over and speaks to Frank. She, too, is suspicious of who he may be. Henry's father finds the note that Henry left, and calls the house. Before Adele, Frank, and Henry can escape, they hear police sirens approaching. [...] Frank ties Henry and Adele up before he goes out to surrender, so that they won't be charged with harboring a fugitive. [...] It is not revealed who called the police to report Frank's presence at the house. Adele wants to plead in Frank's case but is warned by the prosecutor himself that if she does, Henry might be taken away from her. She writes letters to Frank but to protect her he returns them all unopened.|$|E
