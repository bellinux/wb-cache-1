Months later, he is back on track with his life and has {{reconciled}} with Babe, though the two still do not continue their romance. On January 10, 2008, they {{go out for a}} snowday with Little Adam and have fun building a snowman, throwing snowballs and enjoying each other's company. The two express that they like being a family, just them and Little Adam. When JR talks of being a better man, one that Babe can possibly like again, the two nearly kiss. Babe stops the intimate encounter before it can happen and reminds JR that when they become romantic with each other, it never lasts and ends in destruction. JR tells Babe that he loves her and asks her to give them another chance, but as friends first <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it leads. Babe, hesitant at first, accepts his request.|$|E

Guitarist Munky described {{the writing process}} as, [...] "we didn't write nothin' for two years then we had creativity build up, like blue balls of creativity." [...] Doug Small, author of The Story of Korn (...) , said that [...] "the band's songwriting method — a sort of collective building process wherein four instrumentalists, with the input of Jonathan , develop each other's ideas until they've created a monster — is truly a group effort."

Ginger Fish, the band's drummer since 1995, quit in February 2011, explaining that he [...] "decided to step down as a member of Marilyn Manson <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> my life, and the knowledge of my availability cares to take me.

500|$|Tomb Raider III was {{designed}} {{more in line}} with the puzzle-solving gameplay of the original Tomb Raider as opposed to the more shooting-oriented style of Tomb Raider II. The levels were designed to be less linear than before with the goal of giving players multiple routes to complete each one. The game's five locations were decided upon before the plot was conceived. According to producer Mike Schmitt, the team opted to [...] "just take a globe, spin it, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it lands, and whether it's an interesting location or not." [...] Once the setting had been decided upon, a storyline linking all the locations was written. Lara's range of abilities was expanded with moves such as the duck, crawl, dash, and [...] "monkey swing". The 1995 film Desperado was an influence on Lara's gun play and new moves. Developers initially considered the possibility of implementing hand-to-hand combat, but the idea was rejected because it would have required giving enemies new combat animations.|$|E
500|$|Alexander Derek Dougan {{was born}} in Belfast on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan. His father worked at Belfast docks. His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for Linfield, and two of Sandy's {{brothers}} also played {{for some of the}} leading clubs in Belfast. As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street. His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that [...] "on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> you got the money from". As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys. He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams. He instead joined Distillery in 1953. Manager Jimmy McIntosh handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0–0 Irish Cup first [...] round draw with Glentoran. Maurice Tadman, who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.|$|E
500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of {{additional}} filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in [...] "15 to 25 takes" [...] as {{he did not feel}} the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's amazing how much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story." [...] Brooks's directing style [...] "drove [...] bats", especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as [...] "free-falling. You're not going for some result. It's just, throw it in the air <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it lands." [...] The film was poorly received and was a box-office failure.|$|E

[...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it again here <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it {{to the best of my}} ability <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios.

However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
