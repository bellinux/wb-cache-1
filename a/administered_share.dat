40|$|Objective – This paper aims {{to examine}} {{the extent of the}} {{personal}} representative‘s duties and liabilities in dealing with shares on the death of a shareholder. The paper also analyses the procedure to <b>administer</b> the <b>shares</b> and the available options to the estate beneficiaries with regard to their entitlements to the shares. Methodology/Technique – The discussion adopts the doctrinal analysis by examining the existing primary and secondary materials including statutory provisions as provided by the Probate and Administration Act 1959 and the Companies Act 1965, case law and other legal and non-legal literatures relating to the duties and liabilities of the personal representative in dealing with the deceased’s shares. Findings – The personal representative stands vulnerable to be sued for civil liability for the loss arising from his failure to promptly realize and convert the shares, or charged for criminal offenses in cases where he wastes or converts the shares to his own personal use. As for estate beneficiaries, their rights to the shares are subject to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of each company.

Current projects involve dozens of women in Sierra Leone receiving small loans to help them grow crops and raise livestock, but are part of RSWR’s long-term efforts in this country and in India and Kenya. The microfinance process includes training, mentorship and oversight and builds a support system and sense of community among women in a country traumatized by civil war and Ebola. Microfinance is a powerful and proven approach to economic development and it benefits a community overall by making needed goods and services available in the local marketplace, such as fresh, healthy food, which raises the overall health status of citizens. In terms of broader community engagement themes, the poster will emphasize the importance and impact of partnerships with organizations here in the U. S. and the host country, which are essential because no one individual or group can do it all. Based on many years of research and the presenters’ own experiences, the poster will highlight microfinance/women’s empowerment “done right” and the lessons learned through starting, expanding and advocating for their projects. The poster will feature the activities of two graduate students to redesign and rebrand the RSWR website and to develop a social media marketing strategy.

40|$|Many {{studies on}} probiotics {{are aimed at}} {{restoring}} immune homeostasis in patients to prevent disease recurrence or reduce immune-mediated pathology. Of equal interest {{is the use of}} probiotics in sub-clinical situations, which are characterized by reduced immune function or low-grade inflammation, with an increased risk of infection or disease as a consequence. Most mechanistic studies focus on the use of probiotics in experimental disease models, which may not be informative for these sub-clinical conditions. To gain better understanding of the effects in the healthy situation, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of two Lactobacillus probiotic strains, i. e. L. plantarum WCFS 1 and L. salivarius UCC 118, and a non-probiotic lactococcus strain, i. e. L. lactis MG 1363, in healthy mice. We studied the effect of these bacteria on the systemic adaptive immune system after 5 days of administration. Only L. plantarum induced an increase in regulatory CD 103 (+) DC and regulatory T cell frequencies in the spleen. However, all three bacterial strains, including L. lactis, reduced specific splenic T helper cell cytokine responses after ex vivo restimulation. The effect on IFN-gamma, IL 5, IL 10, and IL 17 production by CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells was dependent on the strain <b>administered.</b> A <b>shared</b> observation was that all three bacterial strains reduced T helper 2 cell frequencies. We demonstrate that systemic immunomodulation is not only observed after treatment with probiotic organisms, but also after treatment with non-probiotic bacteria. Our data demonstrate that in healthy mice, lactobacilli can balance T cell immunity in favor of a more regulatory status, via both regulatory T cell dependent and independent mechanisms in a strain dependent manner...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundUsers who access needle exchanges are {{sometimes}} recruited {{to act as}} secondary distributors {{in an effort to}} reach a broader range of individuals who inject drugs. Although evaluations have demonstrated the efficiency of such approaches, more recent research has begun to uncover particular challenges associated with assuming these intermediary roles. MethodsThis article provides insights drawn from four focus-group sessions with 17 volunteers, termed natural helpers, who have between 1 and 14 years experience acting as secondary distributors for an Atlantic Canadian needle exchange. ResultsFrom the perspective of the natural helpers involved in this research, medical professionals consider those who inject drugs to be undeserving of the care accorded to more “responsible” patients. As a consequence of such disenfranchisement, natural helpers find themselves drawn into many forms of informal “doctoring” that extend far beyond their official roles as secondary distribution agents. In addition to providing syringes, training new users in safe injection procedures and promoting the use of sterile equipment, natural helpers try to dissuade people from starting to inject, act as first responders for overdoses, test drug potency, <b>administer</b> first aid, <b>share</b> prescription drugs such as antibiotics, offer temporary housing, counsel on emotional/psychological issues, and support those who are striving to reduce their drug consumption. ConclusionThe practices that have arisen in response to the distancing from professional health care experienced by those who inject drugs pose serious dilemmas and risks for not only users and natural helpers but also the general public...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify how theme parks use events to attract new and returning visitors. This research will also investigate how the events establish consumer satisfaction, how important the theming of an event at a theme park is and what motivates people to visit these events. The topic of events and theme parks is a very broad area, but it lacks academic literature so the researcher decided to use a broad spectrum of literature in order to create background to the research. The key literature that will be discussed within the literature review are; Disneyization (Bryman, 2004), The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need (Schor, 1999),Value- Driven Marketing: From products to resources and competencies (Grönroos 1997), Customer advocacy and brand development (Knox and Lawer, 2006) and Marketing (Blythe, 2006). The research methods chosen by the researcher to collect the data are; online and paper questionnaires which were <b>administered</b> face-to-face and <b>shared</b> through online platforms such as Facebook and other fan sites of the events. From analysing the data it was concluded that theming is a very important factor in determining whether an individual will attend an event.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} behavioral characteristics of participants engaged in information exchange {{in the context}} of online communities. Online communities are defined as collectives of individuals that use computer mediated communication to facilitate interaction over a shared purpose and/or objective. It is argued that this interaction creates externalities, for example, in the form of codified information that others can use through web search tools. These externalities assemble a virtual form of social capital, a commonly shared resource. The research objective of this thesis is to examine how the behavioral tendencies of the participants in online communities are affected by the way this common resource is formatted, <b>administered</b> and <b>shared.</b> The dissertation consists of two parts: a theoretical part where the empirical background and the object of research inquiry is highlighted, and an empirical part which consists of four empirical studies carried out {{in the context of}} three online communities, namely, Google Answers, Yahoo!Answers and Amazon Online Reviews. The empirical part of this dissertation starts with a controlled experiment emulating a well known social dilemma: the public goods game. It provides substance as to whether and when participants in online communities behave (un) cooperatively. The next two studies focus on a special case of online communities where participants ask questions and other participants post answers conditionally on social and monetary incentives. The results of these two studies confirm that community participants do care about the contributions of others and engage in incentive compatible behavior. Yahoo!Answers participants exercise effort in the community by posting answers to questions conditionally on benefits provided by other participants. The empirical findings show that contributing participants in an online community receive answers faster, while those that do not contribute much effort are sanctioned in the form of longer response-time to their questions. In Google Answers this thesis, interactions can be observed that are based on monetary rewards (rather than social rewards {{in the form of a}} reputation index as in Yahoo Answers). Participants make use of voluntarily awarded payoffs (tips) along with stated rewards, in order to motivate those that provide answers (answerers) to provide better quality in their responses. The findings of this study confirm the symmetric effect between monetary rewards and quality. However, this study also identifies cases where social norms have a significant effect on response behavior. When participants seek to get better service with less effort (in terms of total cost), a reputation index which is constructed by the history of their previous interactions supports such an attempt. In other words, reputation history influences information sharing behavior in online communities. The last chapter of the empirical part focuses on another crucial aspect of information as a shared resource: Clarity and understandability. The study examines online product reviews on Amazon. com. The results suggest that participants do care about the clarity of this codified form of experience which increases a helpfulness index accordingly. The thesis overall finds symmetric effects between participation in online communities and output of interaction, but also identifies the ability of the participants to interact strategically as they seek to minimize the effort they provide in order to find the information they seek. The results underline the importance of signaling and quality evaluation mechanisms as counter-balancing control that can enhance activity on online communities...|$|R
