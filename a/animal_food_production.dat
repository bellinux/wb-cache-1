40|$|Purpose – Food {{products}} developed using {{genetically modified}} (GM) animals {{may soon be}} introduced in Europe and beyond. Their successful commercialisation depends on consumer acceptance, {{and so it is}} timely to review the existing literature in this respect. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic review identified 42 English language peer reviewed papers assessing public opinion of GM <b>animals</b> associated with <b>food</b> <b>production.</b> Thematic analysis was applied to the results to identify and explain consumer attitudes. Findings – Publication peaked in 2004, and declined thereafter. European consumers were less accepting of GM animal technology than the US and Asian consumers, although the latter reported more ethical concern. Risk and benefit perceptions, ethical concerns (e. g. related to animal welfare) may explain negative consumer attitudes towards <b>animals</b> in <b>food</b> <b>production.</b> Research limitations/implications – There is a lack of data on consumer attitudes to GM <b>animals</b> applied to <b>food</b> <b>production,</b> in particular in relation to consumers in emerging economies and developing countries. This is problematic as applications of GM animal products are about to enter the market. Practical implications – There is a need to track changes in public opinion as GM <b>food</b> <b>production</b> <b>animals</b> are further developed. The introduction and commercialisation of applications with specific characteristics may further shape consumer attitudes. Social implications – Methods need to be developed to involve consumers and other stakeholders in shaping future applications of agri-food applications of GM animals. Originality/value – The review collates existing quantitative and qualitative knowledge regarding the drivers of consumer attitudes towards GM <b>animals</b> used in <b>food</b> <b>production</b> using systematic review methodology...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{production}} systems {{in pursuit of}} sustainability production, have to integrate several elements such as: environmental protection, food safety, animal welfare, and benefits to local producers. The objectives of the study were: 1) identify the attitudes of consumers in three districts of Mexico City towards sustainable attributes; 2) identify their perceptions regarding the production of animal food products; 3) determine {{if there is an}} effect of the social-demographic variables. In this sense, one thousand two hundred consumers were surveyed in markets of three districts of Mexico City with different social-economic levels. Results show that attitudes and perceptions of consumers differ mainly according to the district where they reside. In relation to the sustainable attributes, consumers considered food safety as the most important attribute of an animal product, followed by environmental protection. Regarding <b>animal</b> <b>food</b> <b>production</b> in Mexico, consumers perceived in first place that this benefits local producers, that they are safe products, that it improves animal welfare, and, finally, that it conserves the environment. These results revealed that consumers in Mexico City show positive attitudes towards sustainable <b>animal</b> <b>food</b> <b>production</b> attributes, which could represent new opportunities for the food industry in Mexico...|$|E

40|$|Many {{emerging}} {{infectious diseases}} in human populations {{are associated with}} zoonotic origins. Attention has often focused on wild animal reservoirs, but most zoonotic pathogens of recent concern to human health either originate in, or are transferred to, human populations from domesticated animals raised for human consumption. Thus, the ecological context of emerging infectious disease comprises two overlapping ecosystems: the natural habitats and populations of wild animals, and the anthropogenically controlled habitats and populations of domesticated species. Intensive <b>food</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> systems and their associated value chains dominate in developed countries and are increasingly important in developing countries. These systems are characterized by large numbers of animals being raised in confinement with high throughput and rapid turnover. Although not typically recognized as such, industrial <b>food</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> generates unique ecosystems-environments that may facilitate the evolution of zoonotic pathogens and their transmission to human populations. It is often assumed that confined <b>food</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> reduces risks of emerging zoonotic diseases. This article provides evidence suggesting that these industrial systems may increase animal and public health risks unless there is recognition of the specific biosecurity and biocontainment challenges of the industrial model. Moreover, the economic drivers and constraints faced by the industry and its participants must be fully understood in order to inform preventative policy. In order to more effectively reduce zoonotic disease risk from industrial <b>food</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production,</b> private incentives {{for the implementation of}} biosecurity must align with public health interests. © 2009 International Association for Ecology and Health...|$|R

However, as animal production continues to evolve towards larger, more concentrated operations, odor emissions from AFOs have caused persistent public concern and complaints.

Therefore, air emissions have become a limiting factor for the viability and sustainability of large scale animal productions.

40|$|At least 32 Amerindian {{groups in}} the Amazon basin use {{terrestrial}} invertebrates as food. Leaf- and litter-consuming invertebrates provide the more important, underestimated food sources for many Amerindian groups. Further, litter-consuming earthworms are also an important food resource for the Ye'Kuana (also known as Makiritare) in the Alto Orinoco (Amazonas, Venezuela). By selecting these small invertebrates the Amerindians are choosing their animal food from those food webs in the rainforest which have the highest energy flow and which constitute the greatest renewable stock of readily available nutrients.

40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the scope}} of protection for patents regarding processes {{for the production of}} farm animals. There is a rapidly growing number of process patent applications in the farm animal breeding sector. Patent law is general in form and is seldom adapted to single areas of innovation. It was initially created for the purpose of granting exclusive rights to technical inventions; it was taken for granted that higher <b>animals,</b> <b>food</b> <b>production</b> and pharmaceuticals were too important for mankind to be included under exclusive private rights. When patent law now is increasingly used in the animal sector, the question of how the law will apply to this particular field of innovation is unanswered. Some inventions are still left out of the patentable subject matter by exemptions from patentability. The scope of these exemptions is therefore also of importance for determining to what extent protection on inventions in the protection of farm animals is obtainable. The relevant exemptions from patentability will thus also be analysed in the report. A natural point of departure for this kind of analysis i...|$|R

We also summarise the major approaches used to control sex in fish and discuss their application in commercially important species.

For years, attempts have been made to make that connection, with a view to restricting antibiotic use in agriculture. Establishing a link has not been truly successful, yet we frequently hear about how antibiotic use should be restricted. The underlying assumption here is that the direct use of antibiotics leads to the development of antibiotic resistance in the animal, which can then be transferred to important human pathogens. On the face of it, the argument seems reasonable, but I suggest it could not be further from the truth. Itmust be rememberedwhere these antibiotics came from.
