5|$|On this basis, an anti-drug {{campaign}} was initiated by Baba lovers in the United States, Europe and Australia. Although the {{campaign was}} largely unsuccessful, it created a wave of new followers, and some of Baba's views {{found their way into}} academic debate on the merits <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of hallucinogens.|$|E
5|$|Angband (1990) was {{developed}} by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand while attending the University of Warwick. Having played UMoria, they wanted to expand the game even further. Working from UMorias code, they {{increased the number of}} levels and monsters, flavored the game based on Angband, the massive fortress controlled by Morgoth from Tolkien's fiction, and incorporated more of the deadlier creatures described within the Middle Earth mythology. They kept the Balrog as a difficult creature that must be overcome at a mid-game level, while Morgoth became the final boss the player must defeat to win the game. Following Cutler and Astrand's graduation, Sean March and Geoff Hill took over the development to see the game through to a public release outside of the university, adding in elements such as giving the player a sense of the rewards <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of a level when they entered it the first time.|$|E

25|$|Although it was {{marketed as}} being safer, {{meprobamate}} has {{most of the}} pharmacological effects <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of the barbiturates and acts at the barbiturate binding site (though it is less sedating at effective doses).

25|$|Transhumanist thinkers {{study the}} {{potential}} benefits <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human as well as ethical limitations of using such technologies. The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the natural condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.|$|E
25|$|Canaan {{was hailed}} {{by the media}} as the first “rock star” of the Middle East. Since her first public appearance, Canaan held over 25 {{sell-out}} concerts in the country from 1984–1988, and despite the risks <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of warring militias and armies, recorded her songs for radio, and topped the charts in Lebanon. Her last concert with Equation was held in 1986.|$|E
25|$|One find {{from such}} a program was the sour gas {{discovery}} at the village of Caroline, Alberta in south-central Alberta, in the mid-1980s. This discovery brought the industry into a new era. Because of the costs <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> involved in developing sour gas, producers in the past had often shut in these discoveries. In the case of Caroline, this was unthinkable.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of honeydew honey has some complications <b>and</b> <b>dangers.</b> This honey {{has a much}} larger proportion of indigestibles than light floral honeys, thus causing dysentery to the bees, resulting {{in the death of}} colonies in areas with cold winters. Good beekeeping management requires the removal of honeydew prior to winter in colder areas. Bees collecting this resource also have to be fed protein supplements, as honeydew lacks the protein-rich pollen accompaniment gathered from flowers.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{after all}} the other {{politicians}} departed without reaching a decision, Evangelos Averoff remained in the meeting room and further engaged Gizikis. He insisted that Karamanlis was the only political personality who could lead a successful transition government, taking into consideration the new circumstances <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> {{both inside and outside}} the country. Gizikis and the heads of the armed forces initially expressed reservations, but they finally became convinced by Averoff's arguments. Admiral Arapakis was the first, among the participating military leaders, to express his support for Karamanlis.|$|E
25|$|Many urban {{legends and}} misconceptions about drugs {{have been created}} and {{circulated}} among young people and the general public, {{with varying degrees of}} veracity. These are commonly repeated by organizations which oppose all classified drug use, often causing the true effects <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of drugs to be misunderstood and less scrutinized. The most common subjects of such false beliefs are LSD, cannabis, and MDMA. These misconceptions include misinformation about adulterants or other black market issues, as well as alleged effects of the pure substances.|$|E

25|$|In China, the Ministry of Public Security has {{established}} a department that solely focuses on child trafficking. Recently the department has instituted a hotline where the public dials 110 to report suspected incidences of forced begging, which law enforcement officials are expected to investigate further. The police are trained to take the children into custody if a blood relationship with their guardian cannot be established, and educate parents on the illegality <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of begging if they are {{those responsible for the}} child's action. This policy instituted in April 2009 has since led to the recovery of 9,300 children.|$|E
25|$|Grey was {{determined}} to end the threat of an independence movement and presented a case to the Colonial Office in London that emphasised the threats <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of the King Movement, claiming that the European settlement {{was in danger of}} being wiped out. As evidence. he pointed to the theft of large amounts of gunpowder from Kawau Island in 1856 and the attack on Auckland City from the sea that was only stopped by a British warship and troops from Fort Britomart. To meet the danger, the British Government sent out 14,000 troops, commanded by Cameron.|$|E
25|$|The {{journey of}} the “Five German Boys,” as Heinrich Lienhard and his four companions were {{called by the}} other emigrants, lasted six months and led them from Independence, Missouri, to New Helvetia, also called Sutter's Fort, in California. In 1846, there was no fully {{established}} trail yet to that Mexican domain for emigrants, let alone for their oxen-drawn wagons, so that especially {{the second half of}} the way required the utmost effort and skill of humans and animals alike. In his reminiscences Lienhard describes the exact route and various aspects of daily life on the trail such as the shifting relationships among the emigrants, the encounters with the Indians, the changing landscapes as well as the trials <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> travelers faced on difficult passages such as the Great Salt Lake Desert and the Sierra Nevada.|$|E

25|$|Psychologically {{traumatic}} experiences often involve physical {{trauma that}} threatens one's survival {{and sense of}} security. Typical causes <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of psychological trauma include harassment, embarrassment, abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, sexual abuse, partner battery, employment discrimination, police brutality, judicial corruption and misconduct, bullying, paternalism, domestic violence, indoctrination, being the victim of an alcoholic parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in childhood), life-threatening medical conditions, and medication-induced trauma. Catastrophic natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, large scale transportation accidents, house or domestic fire, motor vehicle accident, mass interpersonal violence like war, terrorist attacks or other mass tortures like sex trafficking, being taken as a hostage or kidnapped can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme poverty or milder forms of abuse, such as verbal abuse, exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.|$|E
25|$|Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, a magnate {{active in}} royal court circles, {{represented}} the conceptismo current. He wrote romantic poetry and expert translations of foreign work. Zbigniew Morsztyn {{was a soldier}} and poet connected with the Polish Brethren. He had to spend half {{of his life in}} exile in Prussia and produced realistic poetry concerned with the hardships <b>and</b> <b>dangers</b> of military life. Another poet and member of the Polish Brethren, Wacław Potocki, converted to Catholicism. His poetry depicts the life of Polish landed gentry and historic events. He wrote the epic poem The Conduct of the Khotyn War (of 1621) and was deeply troubled by the social injustice in the Commonwealth and its decline. The szlachta apologist Wespazjan Kochowski expressed no such misgivings, but even he could not conceal the progressive degeneration of his class. In the era of constant warfare the writing of memoirs had become an often practiced art. Jan Chryzostom Pasek was one of the leading in Europe representatives of this genre.|$|E
25|$|A {{previous}} negative social {{experience can}} be a trigger to social phobia, perhaps particularly for individuals high in 'interpersonal sensitivity'. For around half of those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, a specific traumatic or humiliating social event appears {{to be associated with}} the onset or worsening of the disorder; this kind of event appears to be particularly related to specific (performance) social phobia, for example regarding public speaking (Stemberg et al., 1995). As well as direct experiences, observing or hearing about the socially negative experiences of others (e.g. a faux pas committed by someone), or verbal warnings of social problems <b>and</b> <b>dangers,</b> may also make the development of a social anxiety disorder more likely. Social anxiety disorder may be caused by the longer-term effects of not fitting in, or being bullied, rejected or ignored (Beidel and Turner, 1998). Shy adolescents or avoidant adults have emphasised unpleasant experiences with peers or childhood bullying or harassment (Gilmartin, 1987). In one study, popularity was found to be negatively correlated with social anxiety, and children who were neglected by their peers reported higher social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation than other categories of children. Socially phobic children appear less likely to receive positive reactions from peers and anxious or inhibited children may isolate themselves.|$|E
