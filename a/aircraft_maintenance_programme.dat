40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} "Aircraft Maintenance Engineering: Developing an <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Programme</b> using Reliability Centred Maintenance/ MSG 3 Analysis Taking into Consideration ETOPS and Low Utilisation", It brings together and explains {{an area that}} the author feels is not well documented or published today {{in the world of}} aviation maintenance management, yet it is fundamental on the continued airworthiness of an aircraft, it can be considered as the building block for maintaining the inherent reliability and airworthiness of the design. It is the author's experience that too many times operators have attempted to carry out the function of maintenance engineering with out full understanding of the reasons and implication of their actions, thus ending up with an ineffective and non applicable collection of maintenance activities that can only add to the expense of the technical operation and even at times contribute to the possibility of occurrences. The thesis also goes on to develop new decision tree diagrams based upon Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) / Maintenance Steering Group 3 (MSG 3) analysis for the use in developing the Maintenance and Reliability Programme and incorporating new aspects of aircraft operation...|$|E
40|$|How does an {{organization}} that is mainly used to conduct maintenance to its aircraft according to manufacturers prescriptions adapt a method with which they can change and optimize their maintenance policies? This thesis report describes {{the state of the}} art in maintenance- and related reliability engineering that is used to obtain a step-by-step method for ’in house’ <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Programme</b> (AMP) alterations. A summary of the proposed method in a single figure can be found in fig. 5 - 1. The method first contains a business part where organizational alterations and regulations are mirrored against some common Maintenance Steering Group (MSG) and Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) approaches to combine into a Maintenance Review Board (MRB) -cycle that can be applied to the Royal Netherlands Airforce (RNLAF). Secondly, a reliability analysis part that uses RNLAF life data from all 8 types of aircraft is designed with use of Weibull and Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) theory. This combines into a 11 -step model that closely follows aviation regulations and that should give the associated reliability engineers within the RNLAF the necessary tools to start assessing the AMP of aircraft that fall under their responsibility. Finally, the model is tested with two cases. The 125 hrs lead-lag link inspection of the AH- 64 Apache and the hydraulic pumps of the CH- 47 Chinook proved to be sufficient examples to apply and verify the method. Life data is analyzed and all the steps of the model are performed, which has resulted in advice to change the 125 hrs interval to 250 hrs and to apply an inspection/replacement interval to the hydraulic pumps in order to proactively monitor the wear and preventively replace the pumps to reduce corrective downtime.

These second privileges allow the CAMO to conduct airworthiness review on aircraft, issue (or recommend for issue) Airworthiness Review Certificates and issue 'permit to fly' for maintenance check flights.|$|R

40|$|The air {{transport}} business is large in its operations, integrated, automated and complex. Air carriers are constantly striving to achieve {{high standards of}} safety and simultaneously to attain an increased level of availability performance at minimal cost. This needs to be supported through an effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> which has {{a major impact on}} the availability performance and which ultimately can enhance the aircraft’s capability to meet market demands at the lowest possible cost. The development of a <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> is challenging, but can be enhanced by supporting methodologies and tools. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop decision support methodologies and tools for <b>aircraft</b> scheduled <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> development within the framework of Maintenance Review Board (MRB) process. To achieve the purpose of the research, literature studies, case studies, and simulations have been conducted. Empirical data have been collected through document studies, interviews, questionnaires, and observations from the aviation industry. For data analysis, theories and methodologies within risk, dependability and decision making have been combined with the best practices from the aviation industry. One result of the research is the identification of potential areas for improving the use of MSG- 3 methodology in <b>aircraft</b> scheduled <b>maintenance</b> development. Another result is the development of a systematic methodology guided by the application of an Event Tree Analysis (ETA) for the identification and quantification of different operational risks caused by aircraft system failures, to support decision making for maintenance task development. A third result is a proposed methodology, based on a combination of different Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, for selecting the most effective <b>maintenance</b> strategy for <b>aircraft</b> scheduled <b>maintenance</b> development. Finally, the fourth result is a proposed Cost Rate Function (CRF) model supported by a graphical approach. The approach can be used to identify the optimum maintenance interval and frequencies of Failure Finding Inspection (FFI) and to develop a combination of FFI and restoration tasks for the aircraft’s repairable items which are experiencing aging. These results are related to some of the specific industrial challenges, and are expected to enhance the capability of making effective and efficient decisions during the development of maintenance tasks. The results have been verified through interaction with experienced practitioners within major aviation manufacturers and air operators.

40|$|Background Although {{lifestyle}} interventions {{have shown}} {{to be effective in}} reducing the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, maintenance of achieved results is difficult, as participants often experience relapse after the intervention has ended. This paper describes the systematic development of a <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> for the extensive SLIMMER intervention, an existing diabetes prevention intervention for high-risk individuals, implemented in a real-life setting in the Netherlands. Methods The <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> was developed using the Intervention Mapping protocol. Programme development was informed by a literature study supplemented by various focus group discussions and feedback from implementers of the extensive SLIMMER intervention. Results The <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> was designed to sustain a healthy diet and physical activity pattern by targeting knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control of the SLIMMER participants. Practical applications were clustered into nine programme components, including sports clinics at local sports clubs, a concluding meeting with the physiotherapist and dietician, and a return session with the physiotherapist, dietician and physical activity group. Manuals were developed for the implementers and included a detailed time table and step-by-step instructions on how to implement the <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme.</b> Conclusions The Intervention Mapping protocol provided a useful framework to systematically plan a <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> for the extensive SLIMMER intervention. The study showed that planning a <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> can build on existing implementation structures of the extensive programme. Future {{research is needed to determine}} to what extent the <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> contributes to sustained effects in participants of lifestyle interventions...|$|R
