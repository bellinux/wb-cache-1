5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Highland Airways {{looked into the}} {{possibility}} of including Stroma in the hospital <b>ambulance</b> <b>plane</b> service that was then in operation. On 19 August 1937, Captain Fresson of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of Stroma, and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland {{on the west side}} of the island to create an airstrip. The first official flight landed in June 1938. However, the Second World War prevented any further developments and a regular service was not established. After the war, Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways, which abandoned any interest in serving the island.|$|E
5000|$|The company's {{aeroplanes}} were labelled [...] "KZ" [...] for Kramme and Zeuthen, {{the first}} being the KZ I from 1937. The KZ IV was built as an <b>ambulance</b> <b>plane</b> for Zone-Redningskorpset and introduced in 1944. Post-war sales never reached the company's expectations, and production turned unprofitable {{in the early}} 1950s, driving the company to shut down. In total, about 200 planes were built by the company.|$|E

50|$|With America's {{entry into}} World War II, {{most of the}} {{civilian}} Howards were commandeered by the military. The Army used them as officer transports and as <b>ambulance</b> <b>planes.</b> They were used variously as an officer's utility transport and for instrument training. The Howard was and is an excellent instrument platform, very stable and solid, especially compared to modern light aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the remote}} {{towns and villages}} in Scotland often being hours away from {{advanced}} medical treatment, Scotstar (paediatrics) and the Emergency Retrieval Service were set up. The Scotstar service was {{set up on the}} 1 April 2014 and transported 2,654 patients 2014/2015. The teams are composed of Paediatricians and PICU nurses. The service has access to multiple vehicles including: Specialist ambulances, 2 air ambulance helicopters and 2 air <b>ambulance</b> <b>planes.</b> The service is based at Glasgow Heliport.|$|R
5000|$|As World War II loomed, {{a number}} of Model B17Ls were pressed into service as bombers by the FARE, the air forces of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. China ordered {{a number of}} Staggerwings to use as <b>ambulance</b> <b>planes</b> in its fight against Imperial Japan. Finland had one C17L as a liaison {{aircraft}} between 1940-1945. On October 2, 1941, Beech shipped a special camouflaged D17S to Prince Bernhard of Lippe, who was in exile in London after the German invasion of the Netherlands. He used it for refugee work in and around London.|$|R
25|$|Losses grew in {{the face}} of a more {{aggressive}} enemy flying newer aircraft. One of their last missions was to protect Junkers Ju 52 <b>ambulance</b> <b>planes</b> filled with wounded veterans from swarms of attacking Soviet interceptors. The last major action was on 17 January 1943: 25 C.200s strafed enemy troops in the Millerovo area. The aviation of the ARMIR was withdrawn on 18 January, bringing 30 C.200 and nine C.202 fighters back to Italy and leaving 15 unserviceable aircraft behind. A total of 66 Italian aircraft had been lost on Eastern Front – against, according to official figures, 88 victories claimed during 17 months of action in that theatre.|$|R
50|$|The Avro Anson V aerial {{photography}} {{aircraft was}} in 1951 replaced with four Airspeed Oxford from the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Starting 21 May, the airline commenced its first scheduled service in Northern Norway, from Narvik via Svolvær to Bodø. The following year the company established itself at Trondheim Airport, Lade with a Seabee taxi- and <b>ambulance</b> <b>plane</b> {{as well as}} school activity. The Northern Norway-route was expanded to also serve Gravdal. A de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver was bought in 1953 for use in Finnmark. In an effort to diversify its portfolio, Widerøe started manufacturing emergency rafts, refrigerated garages in aluminum and industrial thermo elements. The company signed a subcontract in 1954 with SAS, the successor of DNL, to operate a seaplane route from Tromsø via Alta, Hammerfest and Kirkenes to Vadsø, resulting in the airline purchasing its first de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter. That year the airline had 21 mechanics in Oslo and 14 in Tromsø and signed a contract to service the Air Force' Norseman aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed as}} the successor to the obsolete Lublin R-XIII army cooperation plane. First sketches were drawn in 1936 by Zbysław Ciołkosz, the chief designer of the LWS factory (Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów). It {{was similar to the}} earlier light <b>ambulance</b> <b>plane</b> LWS-2, which itself was inspired by the STOL plane RWD-9 wing design. After Ciołkosz had left LWS in 1937, the project, named LWS-3 Mewa, was modified and further developed at the LWS bureau. In the same year, the Polish Air Force ordered three prototypes. The first prototype LWS-3/I was flown in November 1937. It revealed some handling deficiencies, but otherwise a good performance. Following tests, the design of the {{aircraft was}} improved. In 1938, the second prototype LWS-3/II was flown. It had a crank mechanism to lower tailfin and rudder in order to increase angle of the rear machine gun fire, but as it proved impractical, the next prototype LWS-3/III from autumn 1938 again had a classic tailfin design. The third prototype, with some further changes, among others to the engine cover and canopy, was the pattern for serial production. The first prototype was exhibited at the 16th International Paris Aviation Salon in November 1938 (as [...] "PZL Mewa"), where it met with interest.|$|E

50|$|During World War One, {{aviation}} {{moved from}} experimentation to a powerful military force, {{and following the}} war, with a surplus of aircraft in circulation, new uses were found for the aircraft. This included the conversion of planes throughout the world into <b>ambulance</b> <b>planes.</b> Although in 1917, Lieutenant Clifford Peel, a medical student, outlined a system of fixed-wing aircraft and ground facilities designed to provide medical services to the Australian Outback; the first custom-built air ambulances did not come into existence until the late 1920s. These ideas became reality {{under the guidance of}} the Very Reverend John Flynn in 1928 when the Australian Inland Mission service established the Aerial Medical Service, a one-year experimental program. Physicians in this program had several responsibilities, one of which was to fly out to a patient, treat the patient, and fly the patient to a hospital if the physician could not deliver adequate care on scene. Eventually, this experiment became the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia.|$|R

50|$|HOH, {{through the}} public health {{insurance}} agency AZV, has agreements with selected tertiary referral hospitals in Colombia and sends out several patients a year for specialized treatment to nearby cities like Bucaramanga, Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla. Common referrals are related to intervention-cardiology, thoracic surgery, cardiovascular surgery, complex neurosurgery, neonatological intensive care, high risk obstetry and perinatology, some cases of oncology, complex trauma surgery and reconstructive surgery and treatment {{that can only be}} given in a burn center. Oncological cases are sent to the radio-therapy facility of the Sint Elisabeth Hospital in Curaçao. Divers with decompression sickness are sent to Bonaire to the Fundashon Mariadal in Bonaire. Candidates for organ transplantation or complex maxillofacial surgery and patients with growth and puberty disorders are also referred to the mainland or the Netherlands.At the same time, HOH frequently receives patients from smaller hospitals on nearby islands like Bonaire, St. Martin, Saba, Statia and occasionally from Curaçao as particularly intensive care beds and neonatology incubators are limited in this region. HOH also receives daily referrals from the Intituto Medico San Nicolas (IMSAN), a large out-patient facility in the San Nicolas area, which attends approximately 16.000 patients through its emergency department. Patient transfer from and to Aruba are conducted by Colombian, American or Aruban air <b>ambulance</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R

Initial reports of the crash identified Luis Morales as [...] "L Marael".|$|R
50|$|There {{was early}} {{speculation}} that {{something other than}} a mechanical problem or pilot error was responsible, since the in-air explosion was so incredibly intense. The November 2 edition of The New York Times reported a witness to the tragedy describing what he heard:"Conrad Hopp, a farmer who lives near the crash scene, said he and members of his family 'heard a big explosion — it sounded like a big bomb went off and I ran out and I saw a big fire right over the cattle corral.

While studying Mant worked as an <b>ambulance</b> driver and <b>plane</b> spotter, and after graduating in 1943 started work in obstetrics and gynaecology at St Mary's. In January 1944 Mant was called up for service in the British Army, and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps.
