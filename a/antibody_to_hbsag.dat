Recently, adoptive transfer of immunity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) was documented in BMT recipients receiving bone marrow from 'naturally' HBV-infected individuals who recovered spontaneously, or those transplanted with bone marrow cells obtained from actively immunized donors. Furthermore, reconstitution of the immune system in a BMT recipient who was a hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg) +/HBV DNA+ carrier with HBV immune bone marrow cells led to clearance of the replicating virus, presumably through adoptive cell-mediated immunotherapy. We report three cases of induction of immunity to HBV by selective adoptive transfer by i. v. injection of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) obtained from BMT donors who were actively immunized against HBV after harvesting of bone marrow. All three BMT recipients developed anti-HBs antibodies. In one BMT case in whom <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBsAg</b> developed following adoptive transfer of immune PBL, a mild booster effect was documented in the BMT recipient upon immunization with a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine.

40|$|AbstractIn {{regions where}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is endemic, perinatal transmission is common. Infected newborns have a 90 % chance of developing chronic HBV infection, and 1 in 4 will die prematurely from HBV-related liver disease. In 2010, the Hepatitis B Foundation and the Haimen City CDC launched the Gateway to Care campaign in Haimen City, China to improve awareness, prevention, {{and control of}} HBV infection citywide. The campaign included efforts to prevent perinatal HBV transmission by screening all pregnant women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), following those who tested positive, and administering immunoprophylaxis to their newborns at birth. Of 5407 pregnant women screened, 185 were confirmed HBsAg-positive and followed until delivery. At age one, 175 babies were available for follow up testing. Of those, 137 tested negative for HBsAg and positive for <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBsAg,</b> indicating protection. An additional 34 HBsAg-negative babies also tested negative for <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBsAg</b> or had indeterminate test results, were considered to have had inadequate immune responses to the vaccine, and were given a booster dose. A higher prevalence of nonresponse to HBV vaccine was observed among babies born to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -positive mothers and mothers with high HBV DNA titers. The remaining 4 babies tested positive for HBsAg and negative for antibodies, indicative of active HBV infection. The mothers of all 4 had viral loads ≥ 8 × 106 copies/ml in the third trimester. Although inadequate response or nonresponse to HBV vaccine was more common among babies born to HBeAg-positive and/or high viral load mothers, these risk factors did not completely predict nonresponsiveness. All babies born to HBV-infected mothers should be tested {{upon completion of the}} vaccine series to ascertain adequate protection. Some babies of HBeAg-positive mothers with high viral load may still become HBV infected despite timely immunoprophylaxis with HBV vaccine and HBIG...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in 14 347 Indochinese refugees was 11. 6 %; the rate {{was significantly higher}} (P less than 0. 01) in males (14. 0 %) than in females (8. 8 %). Most of the HBsAg-positive refugees were in the age group 20 to 29 years. <b>Antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBsAg</b> was detected in 50. 9 % of the males and 46. 6 % of the females, a significant difference (P less than 0. 01). Antibody to core antigen alone was found in 2. 4 % of the males and 2. 2 % of the females. The cumulative {{prevalence of}} one or more hepatitis B markers was significantly higher (P less than 0. 001) in the males (67. 3 %) than in the females (57. 5 %). The hepatitis B e antigen and its antibody were detected in 54. 8 % and 39. 2 % respectively of 1050 HBsAg-positive blood samples. The adw, adr and ayw determinants of HBsAg were found in 23 %, 35 % and 42 % respectively of 74 samples...|$|E
40|$|Cloned DNA probes {{were used}} to test for {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) DNA in the liver and serum of 14 asymptomatic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers and two former carriers. The results were compared with serological markers of HBV infection and liver histopathology. Three groups of carriers were distinguished. In group I, HBV DNA was present in both liver and serum. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), a marker of viral replication, was uniformly positive in serum. In one individual in this group, viral DNA was also integrated into liver genomic DNA. In group II, lower levels of nonintegrated HBV DNA were detected in the liver, but no HBV DNA {{was found in the}} serum. HBeAg was negative and with one exception there were <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> HBeAg. Integrated viral DNA was present in each case. In group III, there was no detectable nonintegrated viral DNA in serum or liver, but one individual had integrated sequences. All carriers lacked <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBsAg</b> and had <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> hepatitis B core antigen and demonstrated nonspecific histological abnormalities in the liver. These findings indicate significant quantitative and qualitative differences among asymptomatic HBsAg carriers and suggest that their infectivity may be highly variable...|$|R
40|$|See the {{editorial}} commentary by Gerlich on pages 1170 – 2) Background. The coexistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (<b>HBsAg)</b> and <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBsAg</b> (anti-HBs) {{in patients with}} chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been explained {{by the presence of}} viral escape mutants. Yet, no systematic analysis of such patients has been performed. We analyzed both the HBV strains and the nature of anti-HBs in such patients. Methods. Four hundred eleven patients with chronic HBV infection were tested for the presence of anti-HBs. The sequences of the HBsAg coding region were analyzed. Anti-HBs were purified and examined in commercial assays alone and with 3 different HBsAg subtypes. Results. Twenty patients had positive results for anti-HBs. This serological status remained stable for 12 months (as tested thus far). Amino acid substitutions and/or variations on HBsAg were found in 13 patients, and the HBV isolates from 4 others were wild types. Importantly, {{no significant difference in the}} occurrence of amino acid substitutions within the HBsAg was found in HBV isolates from patients with and without anti-HBs. Purified immunoglobulin fractions from serum samples from patients were reactive <b>to</b> <b>HBsAg</b> but had a lower specific activity, compared with those taken from immunized persons. Anti-HBs in patients were directed <b>to</b> the <b>HBsAg</b> subtypes other than the coexisting one. No circulating immune complex could be detected in these patients...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{we have identified}} endonexin II (E-II) on human liver plasma membranes as a specific, Ca(2 +) -dependent, small hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -binding protein. In this article, we describe the spontaneous development of anti-HBs antibodies in rabbits immunized with native or recombinant human liver E-II and in chickens immunized with the F(ab') 2 fragment of rabbit anti-human liver E-II immunoglobulin G. Anti-HBs activity was not observed in rabbits immunized with rat liver E-II. Cross-reactivity of anti-E-II <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBsAg</b> epitopes was excluded, since anti-HBs and anti-E-II activities can be separated by E-II affinity chromatography. The existence of an anti-idiotypic antibody is further demonstrated by competitive binding of human liver E-II and this <b>antibody</b> (Ab 2) <b>to</b> small <b>HBsAg,</b> suggesting that Ab 2 mimics a specific E-II epitope that interacts with small HBsAg. In addition, it was demonstrated that anti-HBs antibodies developed in rabbits after immunization with intact human liver E-II or in chickens after immunization with F(ab') 2 fragments of rabbit anti-human liver E-II immunoglobulin G recognize the same epitopes on small HBsAg. These findings strongly indicate that human liver E-II is a very specific small HBsAg-binding protein and support the assumption that human liver E-II is the hepatitis B virus receptor protein...|$|R
