2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje.

2500|$|Along {{with his}} writings, Chomsky also became {{actively}} involved in left-wing activism. Refusing to pay half his taxes, he publicly supported students who refused the draft, and was arrested for being part of an anti-war teach-in outside the Pentagon. During this time, Chomsky, along with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald, also founded the anti-war collective RESIST. Although he questioned {{the objectives of the}} 1968 student protests, he gave many lectures to student activist groups; furthermore, he and his colleague Louis Kampf began running undergraduate courses on politics at MIT, independently of the conservative-dominated political science department. During this period, MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam and, as Chomsky says, [...] "a good deal of [...] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus". As Chomsky elaborates, [...] " [...] about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> was {{right in the middle of}} it. I was in a military lab... the Research Laboratory for Electronics." [...] By 1969, student activists were actively campaigning [...] "to stop the war research" [...] at MIT. Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but he also thought it best to keep such research on campus and he proposed that it should be restricted to what he called [...] "systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character". During this period, MIT had six of its anti-war student activists sentenced to prison terms. Chomsky says MIT's students suffered things that [...] "should not have happened", though he has also described MIT as [...] "the freest and the most honest and has the best relations between faculty and students than at any other... quite a good record on civil liberties". In 1970 he visited the Vietnamese city of Hanoi to give a lecture at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology; on this trip he also toured Laos to visit the refugee camps created by the war, and in 1973 he was among those leading a committee to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the War Resisters League.|$|E
