There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporized, creating <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E

25|$|After {{the middle}} of May and in {{particular}} from mid June {{to the end of}} July the heat in the Sinai desert ranged from extreme to fierce. Even worse were the Khamsin dust storms which blow once every 50 days for a few hours or several days, turning the atmosphere into <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> of floating sand particles flung about by a hot southerly wind. The troops and their commanders, unused to the conditions, suffered considerably from heatstroke and thirst during these early patrols. One such patrol, returning during the hottest part of the day after a sleepless night far from base, and very little water, suffered casualties of 160 men who collapsed from heat exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|The landing party {{left the}} Endymion for the rock by boat. Whilst {{they were on}} the rock, the Endymion, which was taking depth {{measurements}} around Rockall, lost visual contact with the rock as <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> descended. The ship drifted away, leaving the landing party stranded. The expedition made a brief attempt to return to the ship, but could not find the frigate in the haze, and soon gave up and returned to Rockall. After the haze became a fog, the lookout sent to the top of Rockall spotted the ship again, but it turned away from Rockall before the expedition in their boats reached it. Finally, just before sunset, the frigate was again spotted from the top of Rockall, and the expedition was able to get back on board. The crew of the Endymion reported that they had been searching for five or six hours, firing their cannon every ten minutes. Hall related this experience and other adventures in a book entitled Fragment of Voyages and Travels Including Anecdotes of a Naval Life.|$|E

500|$|Some {{scientists}} have suggested using aerosols {{to stave off}} the effects of global warming as an emergency geoengineering measure. In 1974, Mikhail Budyko suggested that if global warming became a problem, the planet could be cooled by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create <b>a</b> <b>haze.</b> [...] An increase in planetary albedo of just 0.5 percent is sufficient to halve the effect of a CO2 doubling.|$|E
500|$|In his 1998 book The Women of Coronation Street, Daran Little {{describes}} Betty as an archetypal mother figure. He compares her {{to one of}} Coronation Streets original characters Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), as she is [...] "warm {{and comforting}} [...] loves cats and has had her share of lodgers"; however, Little notes that [...] "while Minnie wandered through life in <b>a</b> <b>haze,</b> Betty is sharp-witted, blessed with insight and wisdom". Discussing her evolving characterisation, Little writes: [...] "She hasn't always been the incarnation of lovable joviality: when she arrived in the Street in 1969, she was loud, brash and a vicious-tongued gossip." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Hung Up" [...] is a dance-pop and disco song. According to The New York Times, {{the song}} has vaguely {{familiar}} hooks, sustained overlays of the string arrangement and acoustic guitar enfolding {{the music to}} create <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> like sound. Billboard described the music as frothy, nonsensical and joyous. The instant familiarity of the sampled music is changed by Stuart Price and Madonna by adding a chugging groove and a chorus which singles it out as an independent song. Besides the ABBA sample, Rolling Stone said that the song also incorporated Madonna's older songs like [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Holiday" [...] and features fleeting quotes from bands like S.O.S. and the Tom Tom Club.|$|E

500|$|Turbulence at Triton's surface {{creates a}} {{troposphere}} (a [...] "weather region") rising to {{an altitude of}} 8km. Streaks on Triton's surface left by geyser plumes suggest that the troposphere is driven by seasonal winds capable of moving material of over a micrometre in size. Unlike other atmospheres, Triton's lacks a stratosphere, and instead has a thermosphere from altitudes of 8 to 950km, and an exosphere above that. The temperature of Triton's upper atmosphere, at , is higher than that at its surface, due to heat absorbed from solar radiation and Neptune's magnetosphere. <b>A</b> <b>haze</b> permeates most of Triton's troposphere, thought to be composed largely of hydrocarbons and nitriles created {{by the action of}} sunlight on methane. Triton's atmosphere also has clouds of condensed nitrogen that lie between 1 and 3km from its surface.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} of the railway and pipeline had not been greatly affected by the fighting on 23 April and by 29 April, four trains a day were running regularly to the railhead, manned by No. 276 Railway Company, and the main line to Romani was opened on 19 May. A second standard gauge railway line from Romani to Mahamdiyah on the Mediterranean coast was completed by 9 June. But conditions on the ground were extreme; after the middle of May and in particular from mid June {{to the end of}} July, the heat in the Sinai Desert ranged from extreme to fierce when temperatures could be expected to be in the region of [...] in the shade. The terrible heat was not as bad as the Khamsin dust storms which blow once every 50 days for between a few hours and several days; the air is turned into <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> of floating sand particles flung about by a strong, hot southerly wind.|$|E
500|$|Letter 65 {{describes}} {{the summer of}} 1783 as [...] "an amazing and portentous one, and full of horrible phenomena; for, besides the alarming meteors and tremendous thunderstorms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze, or smoky fog, that prevailed for many weeks in this island, and {{in every part of}} Europe, and even beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything known within the memory of man... The sun, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting. All this time the heat was so intense that butcher's meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed..." [...] This was caused by the eruption of the Laki volcano in Iceland between 8 June 1783 and February 1784, killing up to a quarter of the people of Iceland and spreading <b>a</b> <b>haze</b> as far as Egypt.|$|E
