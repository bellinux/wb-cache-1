To test whether different populations of these reportedly very similar species could be discriminated using morphometric methods, we examined the morphometry of four different populations representing different mitochondrial clades. Twenty five point-to-point measurements, including five new characters of the <b>attachment</b> <b>hooks,</b> were recorded from three Norwegian laboratory populations (G. salaris from the Rivers Lierelva and Rauma, and G. thymalli from the River Rena), and from one wild population of G. thymalli from the River Test, UK. The Norwegian populations were kept under identical environmental conditions to control for the influence of temperature on the haptoral <b>attachment</b> <b>hooks.</b> Data were subsequently subjected to univariate and linear stepwise discriminant analyses. The model generated by the linear stepwise discriminant analysis used 18 of the 25 original variables, the first two roots accounting for 96. 6 % of the total variation between specimens. The hamulus shaft length accounts for 66. 7 % of the overall correct classification efficiency. Based on morphometry, all specimens {{were assigned to the}} correct species. Apart from three specimens of G. salaris from the River Lierelva population which were misclassified as belonging to the G. salaris Rauma population, all specimens were assigned to the correct population. Thus, populations of Gyrodactylus identified by mtDNA can also be discriminated using morphometric landmark distances...|$|R

50|$|The type D helmet was {{decorated}} with gilded motifs, yet {{appears to have been}} mass-produced. A second very similar cheek piece has been found, as well as a complete helmet (Imperial Italic E) which appears to have had the same style decoration, though most had been stripped off when it was discarded. This helmet is often depicted in modern artwork as a centurion's headpiece, but the surviving fore and aft crest <b>attachment</b> <b>hooks</b> suggest it belonged to a regular soldier. Because it is so distinctive, it is sometimes stated that {{it may have been a}} special item for a particular unit such as the Praetorian Guard. More likely, the Italic D was the product of a single workshop producing a more decorative type for soldiers who might wish to shell out a bit more for splashy headgear. Since the Italic D has integral brass cross-braces placed flat against the skull, providing a double-thickness of metal at a critical point, it is tempting to speculate that the superior performance of this type versus the Dacian falx is what led to the decision to retrofit cross bracing to all helmets in the Dacian theatre.|$|R

(total body length 61. 4 ± 4. 9 mm; range 55 - 70) is reported from the north-western Mediterranean coast of Spain {{for the first}} time. A sample of 12, 600 glass eels, caught by professional fishermen operating {{in the mouth of}} the rivers Fluvià, La Muga and Ter (north-east Spain), was subject to mortalities of ∼ 1. 75 % of stock/day following transfer to a research facility. Subsequent losses over a 31 -day period amounted to 56 % of the initial stocked biomass. Although the moderate burdens of G. anguillae/host (20. 2 ± 6; range 11 - 32) were the primary reason for a subsequent treatment, a simultaneous infection with Trichodina jadranica Raabe, 1958, Trichodina anguillae Wu, 1961 and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis Fouquet, 1876, makes it impossible to attribute the high mortality of glass eels in this case to a single pathogen.

It is the first marine Gyrodactylus species reported from the African continent. The new species is compared to the three known Gyrodactylus species affecting syngnathiform hosts (G. pisculentus Williams, Kritsky, Dunnigan, Lash et Klein, 2008, G. shorti Holliman, 1963, and G. syngnathi Appleby, 1996).

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{percutaneous}} steel Greenfield filter (PSGF) {{is similar}} in appearance to the titanium Greenfield filter (TGF) but differs in the length and orientation of the <b>attachment</b> <b>hooks</b> and in the over-the-wire delivery system. Because these differences improve ease of insertion and attachment, they may affect patient outcomes and physician practices. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the performance of the PSGF relative to the TGF and to determine whether there had been a change in physician practices. Methods: The Michigan Filter Registry contains data for a prospective cohort of 2188 patients with Greenfield filters. Procedural and long-term outcomes for patients with a PSGF were abstracted. These events were compared with rates for Registry patients who had a TGF. Trends for indication for placement, delivery route, and filter location were also compared with published series. Results: Since 1995, 600 PSGFs have been placed in 599 patients. A 1 -year mortality rate of 42 % left 349 patients available for annual follow-up, and studies were completed for 231 (66 %). Periprocedural events occurred in 2. 5 % of cases with associated morbidity in 1. 5 %. The rate of new pulmonary embolism was 2. 6 %, and vena caval patency was 98. 3 %. The combined rate of new venous thromboembolic events was 12. 5 %. Left-sided femoral vein placements increased to 20 %, and the major indication for filter placement has become prophylaxis (46 %). Conclusions: The PSGF is similar to the TGF with respect to patient outcomes, and it provides decreased rates of asymmetry along with excellent fixation. The flexible carrier system has allowed more frequent access through the left femoral vein. The ease of use and favorable patient outcomes have resulted in more frequent placement for prophylactic indications. (J Vasc Surg 2000; 32 : 888 - 93. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} Gyrodactylus species recognition, making use of machine learning classification and feature selection techniques, and explores image feature extraction to demonstrate proof of concept for an envisaged rapid, consistent and secure initial identification of pathogens by field workers and non-expert users. The design of the proposed cognitively inspired framework is able to provide confident discrimination recognition from its non-pathogenic congeners, which is sought in order to assist diagnostics during periods of a suspected outbreak. Accurate identification of pathogens {{is a key to}} their control in an aquaculture context and the monogenean worm genus Gyrodactylus provides an ideal test-bed for the selected techniques. In the proposed algorithm, the concept of classification using a single model is extended to include more than one model. In classifying multiple species of Gyrodactylus, experiments using 557 specimens of nine different species, two classifiers and three feature sets were performed. To combine these models, an ensemble based majority voting approach has been adopted. Experimental results with a database of Gyrodactylus species show the superior performance of the ensemble system. Comparison with single classification approaches indicates that the proposed framework produces a marked improvement in classification performance. The second contribution of this thesis is the exploration of image processing techniques. Active Shape Model (ASM) and Complex Network methods are applied to images of the <b>attachment</b> <b>hooks</b> of several species of Gyrodactylus to classify each species according to their true species type. ASM is used to provide landmark points to segment the contour of the image, while the Complex Network model is used to extract the information from the contour of an image. The current system aims to confidently classify species, which is notifiable pathogen of Atlantic salmon, to their true class with high degree of accuracy. Finally, some concluding remarks are made along with proposal for future work...|$|R

The gyrodactylids collected from the skin, fins and gills of pipefish were subjected to a morphological analysis of the <b>attachment</b> <b>hooks</b> and the morphometric data were compared to the four species of Gyrodactylus previously described from syngnathid hosts, namely G. eyipayipi Vaughan, Christison, Hansen et Shinn, 2010, G. pisculentus Williams, Kritsky, Dunnigan, Lash et Klein, 2008, G. shorti Holliman, 1963 and G. syngnathi Appleby, 1996. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the morphological data indicated six clusters; two discrete groups among the specimens taken from the pipefish held in the Italian aquarium and four further groups representing G. eyipayipi, G. pisculentus, G. shorti and G. syngnathi. Molecular sequences of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and ITS 2) and the 5. 8 S gene for the new species considered here were then compared with those available for other species in GenBank. The comparison did not reveal any identical match, supporting the morphological analysis that Gyrodactylus corleonis sp. n. from S. typhle and Gyrodactylus neretum sp. n. from S. scovelli represent distinct species. Both G. corleonis and G. neretum possess robust hamuli, marginal hook blades that curve smoothly from their sickle base to a point beyond the toe and, ventral bars with a broad median portion and a reduced membrane.

These statistical methods {{were applied to}} morphometric measurements made on the gyrodactylid <b>attachment</b> <b>hooks.</b> The mean estimated classification percentages of correctly identifying each species were 98 ± 1 % (LDA) and 97 ± 9 % (KNN) for G. salaris and 99 ± 9 % (LDA) and 73 ± 2 % (KNN) for G. thymalli. The analysis was expanded to include another 2 closely related species and the new classification efficiencies were 94 ± 6 %(LDA) and 98 ± 0 % (KNN) for G. salaris; 98 ± 2 % (LDA) and 72 ± 6 % (KNN) for G. thymalli; 86 ± 7 % (LDA) and 91 ± 8 % (KNN) for G. derjavini; and 76 ± 5 % (LDA) and 77 ± 7 % (KNN) for G. truttae. The higher correct classification scores of G. salaris and G. thymalli by the LDA classifier in the 2 -species analysis over the 4 -species analysis suggested {{the development of a}} 2 -stage classifier. The mean estimated correct classification scores were 99 ± 97 % (LDA) and 99 ± 99 % (KNN) for the G. salaris±G. thymalli pairing and 99 ± 4 % (LDA) and 99 ± 92 % (KNN) for the G. derjavini±G. truttae pairing. Assessment of the 2 -stage classifier using only marginal hook data was very good with classification efficiencies of 100 % (LDA) and 99 ± 6 %(KNN) for the G. salaris±G. thymalli pairing and 97 ± 2 %(LDA) and 9 ± 2 %(KNN) for the G. derjavini±G. truttae pairing. Paired species were then discriminated individually in the second stage of the classifier using data from the full set of hooks. These analyses demonstrate that using the methods of LDA and KNN statistical classification, the discrimination of closely related and pathogenic species of Gyrodactylus may be achieved using data derived from light microscope studies...|$|R

A test campaign was performed on a simplified counter-rotating turbine stage. A test article which reproduces the dynamic behavior of a real CRT stage was purposely designed and constructed. The test article is composed of 24 segments, each one with 3 blades. As in the real case the segments are constrained at the outer radius and mounted with interlocking with friction contacts at the inner radius. The segments are connected to an outer ring by means of a double <b>hook</b> <b>attachment</b> with contact surfaces which can be characterized by sliding or sticking depending on the constraint which can be tight or loose.

Additionally, we also describe and extend the locomotive principles of six-braided-tubes locomotive devices. Moreover, we propose a novel <b>attachment,</b> termed steering <b>hook,</b> to enable steering in various types of branched systems.

40|$|Background and Objectives: We present 2 {{cases of}} laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS) {{splenectomy}} performed with a conventional laparoscope and instruments, {{and the use}} of a novel internal retraction device. Methods: One patient underwent LESS splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), and a pediatric patient with sickle cell disease underwent LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. In each case, a 2 -cm vertical incision was made {{within the confines of the}} umbilical ring, and a SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk CT) inserted. A 5 -mm, 30 -degree laparoscope and standard 5 -mm instruments were used. After isolation of the splenic hilum, one 5 -mm trocar of the SILS port was upsized to 12 mm, and a laparoscopic stapler was used to divide the splenic artery and vein. An internal retractor consisting of a laparoscopic bulldog clamp with a <b>hook</b> <b>attachment</b> was used to retract the gallbladder, and to secure the specimen retrieval bag during splenic extraction, which eliminated the need for a fourth trocar. Results: Total operative time was 160 minutes for the LESS splenectomy, and 216 minutes for the LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Both procedures were successfully completed with conventional instrumentation and a SILS port, without the need for additional incisions or trocars. No complications occurred, and both patients had an uneventful recovery. Conclusions: LESS splenectomy is a feasible procedure that can be performed safely.

40|$|In {{species of}} the monogenean {{helminth}} Gyrodactylus, the opisthaptor is the main organ of attachment to the host. The opisthaptor comprises two large centrally positioned hooks or hamuli and sixteen peripherally distributed marginal hooks. This paper describes the functional morphology and the mechanism and sequence of attachment in this species. Information on the attachment process was gathered from observations of live gyrodactylids, from transmission electron microscopy, from scanning electron microscopy of skeletal elements, and by histochemical and X-ray elemental analysis of hook chemical composition. The marginal hooks provide the principal force of attachment whilst the hamuli are not actively employed {{in the process of}} attachment. Instead, the hamuli provide a system preventing accidental dislodgement and assist the action of the marginal <b>hooks.</b> <b>Attachment</b> is achieved by the alternating action of two systems of muscles attached respectively to the hamuli and to the marginal hooks. Relaxation or contraction of the muscles connected to the hamuli manoeuvres the hamuli over the extremities of the accessory ventral bar and allows them to pivot around their longitudinal axis, effectively raising or lowering the opisthaptoral dome. Under reduced opisthaptoral tension, the independent gaffing activity of the marginal hooks ensures a secure attachment to the host's epidermis. Repositioning of the hamuli then raises the opisthaptoral dome to tension the peripheral marginal hooks. The sequence of attachment is complete when all the muscles associated with the hooks {{are in a state of}} relaxation but are held securely and under tension by the surrounding, stretched, opisthaptoral dome...|$|R

Yeast bread was made using three methods (hand + oven, bread machine, mixer with dough <b>hook</b> <b>attachment</b> + oven). Flat bread was made using four methods (hand + oven, hand + griddle, mixer + oven, mixer + griddle). Data on all inputs (active time, passive time, mass and volume of ingredients and equipment, power) were measured and used to calculate ESM. Assumptions were based on data in NASA documents. Data were analyzed using PC-SAS with significance at P 0. 05. Grain mill type significantly (P 0. 05) influenced the ESM of making both bread types; and the Brabender Quadrumat Jr. contributed significantly (P 0. 05) more mass than the Kitchen-Aid grain mill to the ESM for producing both types of bread. Results can be used by systems analysts to define energy and volume requirements for the food system and by researchers to select and modify food production scenarios. Description: 12 page...|$|R
40|$|This {{review is}} the first to draw {{together}} knowledge about bioadhesives secreted by a group of parasites. Mechanisms of mechanical attachment are well known among parasites, but some can also attach to host surfaces by chemical means using a thin layer of adhesive material secreted at the parasite-host interface. Attachment by adhesives to living surfaces has not been studied in detail previously. A significant volume of research has determined much about the chemistry and nature of bioadhesives secreted by various marine macroinvertebrates from different phyla for attachment to inert substrates. Mussels and barnacles are sessile and adhere permanently, whereas starfish display temporary but firm adhesion during locomotion, feeding and burrowing. We focus on the Platyhelminthes that comprises the largely free-living Turbellaria and the wholly parasitic Monogenea, Cestoda, Digenea and Aspidogastrea. The term tissue adhesion is introduced to describe attachment by adhesives to epithelial surfaces such as fish epidermis and the lining of the vertebrate gut. These living layers regenerate rapidly, secrete mucus, are a site for immune activity and are therefore especially hostile environments for organisms that inhabit them, presenting a significant challenge for adhesion. Not all platyhelminths adhere to living surfaces and types of adhesion to inert substrates by the free-living turbellarians are also reviewed. Tissue adhesion is particularly well exemplified by monopisthocotylean monogeneans, parasites that are especially mobile as larvae, juveniles and adults on the epidermis of the body and gill surfaces of fish. These monogeneans secrete adhesives from the anterior end when they move from site to site, but some have secondarily developed adhesives at the posterior end to supplement or replace mechanical <b>attachment</b> by <b>hooks</b> and/or by suction. The temporary but tenacious anterior adhesives of monogeneans display remarkable properties of instant attachment to and detachment from their host fish surfaces. In contrast to the mobility of turbellarians and monopisthocotylean monogeneans and the simplicity of their direct life cycles, the largely endoparasitic Cestoda and Digenea are considered to be less mobile as adults. The complex cestode and digenean life cycles, involving intermediate hosts, place different demands on their various stages. Diverse, mostly anterior, gland cells in larvae, metacestodes and adults of the true tapeworms (Eucestoda), and in larval and adult Gyrocotylidea and Amphilinidea are reviewed. Conspicuous gland cells, mostly but not exclusively at the anterior end, in miracidia, cercariae and adults of digeneans and in cotylocidia and and adults of aspidogastreans are also reviewed. Unlike turbelarians and monogeneans, accounts of unequivocal adhesive secretions in the Cestoda, but especially in the Digenea and Aspidogastrea, are relatively rare. The primary purpose of many conspicuous glands in the different stages of these mostly endoparasitic flatworms in for penetration into, or escape from, different hosts in their life cycles. We provide a detailed review of current knowledge about adhession (in the sense of a thin layer of chemical material) in the Platyhelminthes including uses among eggs, larval, juvenile and adult stages. Information on structure, morphology and ultrastructure of the various adhesive systems that have been described is reviewed. Application of the ‘duo gland’ models is discussed. Comparisons are made between the little that is known about the chemistry of flatworm adhesives and the significant knowledge of the chemical nature of other invertebrate bioadhesives, especially those from marine macroinvertebrates. The potential importance of adhesives in parasitism is discussed. Phylogenetic considerations and evolutionary implications are covered and we conclude that insufficient structural and chemical evidence is available to determine homology or otherwise between the adhesive syste [...] .
