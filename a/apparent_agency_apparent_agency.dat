40|$|Cars {{in police}} drama signify performatively, and do {{important}} work {{to contribute to}} programmes’ form, meaning and distinctive identity. They are things that come {{to have a life}} of their own within the fictional world of a television police series. They are endowed with <b>apparent</b> <b>agency,</b> character and personality that conceal their nature as objects. The chapter suggests that the significance of cars in television police drama is also dependent on an industrial history in which changing production circumstances affect how cars can appear on screen. Studio-based programmes, programmes using filmed inserts of car action in combination with studio drama, then filmed or digitally recorded programmes, deploy cars differently because of what can be achieved with available cameras and technologies of sound recording. Within the police genre, there are differences between character-focused dramas versus action-focused ones that affect how often, and in what ways, cars appear in programmes. But in each case, cars are narrative vehicles and drive the narrative, at the same time as they are relatively passive components of setting. Cars are an aspect of aesthetic style, and contribute to its definition as a marker of the programme’s distinctive identity. In association with the protagonists, and as a result of the car’s continuity through an episode across sequences and across commercial breaks, cars specific to a series are important to its brand identity. Structurally, car sequences work as a kind of glue, linking places in the fictional world and linking segments of storyline. In as much as they are a tool for, and extension of, the police protagonist, the police’s cars signify the ideological function of law enforcement and its ability to control physical space.

Church-afﬁliated social service agencies were deﬁned as those that either use Christian terminology or denominational names in their title, that require church representation at a board or corporate membership level, or that receive regular, committed ﬁnancial or volunteer support from a church body. Ten agencies that ﬁt this description were studied, with interviews conducted with agency representatives as well as four church representatives from organizations representing three different models. An interview was also held with another church-afﬁliated institution which had connections with many of the agencies studied. A qualitative analysis of these interviews determined that there are ﬁve models of relationship between church bodies and church- afﬁliated social service <b>agencies</b> <b>apparent</b> in the Region of Waterloo. These models are expressed on a continuum of involvement based on degree of formality of the relationship to the church at the administrative level, and closeness to the church as determined by {{the presence or absence of}} theology and religious values in programming at the service delivery level.

40|$|We {{are almost}} {{halfway through the}} period that has been {{described}} as ‘the critical decade’ (Hughes and Steffen, 2013), being the time in which our decisions and actions on climate change will determine whether we succeed globally to limit temperature rise to less than 2 degrees. It is increasingly recognised that the main focus for global action in this decade will be cities. More than half the world’s population now reside in cities and their contribution to global greenhouse gas production is estimated at 75 %, even though they occupy only around 2 % of the global land area. Nearly half of the world’s cities are already experiencing the effects of changing climate (UNEP 2011). The implication is clear – over the coming decade cities will be engaged in a significant and rapid process of transformation, of existing urban infrastructure and established pattern of living, as they de-carbonise their economies and to adapt to climatic changes that are already becoming evident. In this period of climate transformation, it is the very essence of what makes cities so socially and culturally successful –their complexity – that presents the greatest challenge and, importantly, offers the greatest hope for success. Cities are a human invention; as they grow, their infrastructure, their physical form, their cultural characteristics become intertwined systems – complex and embedded, forming together the very essence of a particular city – making rapid transformation very difficult. These tightly interlinked systems support urban life, giving each city its particular cultural and economic identity (or in more current parlance, its liveability). The ‘de-carbonisation’ of the city involves, for example, a process of ‘dis-embedding’ of all its fossil fuel energy dependencies – reducing total energy consumption and switching to noncarbonaceous energy sources. That will require changes to many physical elements of the city (most obviously buildings and transport). Also, the infrastructure and form of any city reflects the climate conditions of its location. New climate patterns and extremes weather events can threaten the resilience of established infrastructure. Climate responses – mitigation and adaptation – means transforming the infrastructures of provision of cities (e. g. energy, water, food, transport, shelter, waste, products and services and information). One characteristic of the development of the infrastructures of provision for most cities is an increasing separation of consumption from production; most of the resources on which city life depends are produced well beyond the city boundaries, isolating them from the lived experience of urban citizens. Sometimes the very idea of the city {{is that it is a}} ‘refuge from nature’, obscuring the real bio-physical dependence of the city on natural eco-systems (as well as the social processes that turn those ecosystems into goods and services). In the last decades, interest in cities as a focus for action on climate change has derived more from a recognition of their <b>apparent</b> <b>agency</b> –the expression of interest, willingness and ability to make changes. The process that resulted in the application and selection of Leeuwarden as an EU Cultural Capital is an example of a wider phenomenon – the increasing evidence of the social, cultural and political interests of cities as actors in national and even international affairs. Cities (and networks of cities) are active in adopting greenhouse reduction targets and investing in programs to reach them. The contribution of cities to national economies in many nations is disproportionally significant and that reflects their success in providing the conditions that support creativity and innovation.

One was that Phoumi Nosavan, who was then the Lao head of state, was a first cousin to General Sarit. The prospect of his rival Phao losing influence as casualties sapped the PARU seems to have been another reason for Sarit's acquiescence. And even as Sarit supported intervention by the PARU, Lair briefed his CIA superiors. Lair's main selling points for leading his paramilitaries into Laos was the sheer secretiveness possible because his troopers could blend seamlessly into the Lao population.

Under securitization, agents perform functions (for fees) that would alternatively be performed by a vertically integrated lender with ownership of a whole loan. We examine how outsourcing impacts performance using data on 357 commercial mortgage-backed securities deals with over 46, 000 individual loans. To alleviate agency conflicts in managing troubled loans, underwriters often sell the first-loss position to the special servicer, the party who is charged with handling delinquencies and defaults. When holding the first-loss position, special servicers appear to behave more efficiently, making fewer costly transfers of delinquent loans to special servicing, but liquidating a higher percentage of loans that are referred to special servicing. Special servicers are also more likely to own the first loss position in deals that require additional effort (deals with higher delinquencies). Market pricing reflects the existence of <b>agency</b> costs. Despite the <b>apparent</b> reduction of <b>agency</b> costs, the first-loss position is increasingly owned by a party other than the special servicer. We pose a number of explanations, including conflicts between junior and senior securities holders (the asset substitution problem) and risk aversion among special servicers. Consistent with asset substitution, we show that special servicers delay liquidation when they hold the first-loss position in deals with more severe delinquency problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa's {{past and}} present {{contribution}} to the build-up of greenhouse gases has been low; the region therefore does not pose {{a major threat to}} the global climate. Nonetheless, the occurrence of climate change might pose formidable challenges to already deteriorating conditions of human development in that region. Both national contributions to emissions of greenhouse gases and the presence of considerable size of forest cover as sinks nevertheless vary within Africa. Much remains uncertain as to how climate change will affect Africa; and the probable responses by countries, sub-national actors and external actors to several issues in the regime. The relatively recent emergence of the issue and the uncertainties facing key actors in Africa have limited policy making on climate change. Moreover, since climate has not yet figured as a priority issue area for countries actors, little nuances in differences among countries have emerged. The impact of international measures, rather than the actual occurrence of climate change, might stimulate and define policy-making and the development of strategies on climate change. In the pre-regime formulation stage, the stake and obligations of industrialising countries were, and indeed continue to be, ill-defined. As the threat to national interests was not <b>apparent,</b> state <b>agencies</b> were not adequately mobilised. After the first COP in Berlin, March 1995, we have seen an increasing degree of tangible international decisions. Of importance to African countries is the initiation of the pilot phase of Joint Implementation and the adoption of the Global Environmental Facility as the key financial transfer mechanism. Depending on the volume of financial and technological transfer that industrialised countries are ready to make available, states in Africa are likely to step up activities in wooing investments in energy and land-use sectors. Should post-Berlin developments stimulate demand for emerging markets in the South to set emission reduction targets, an incentive will arise for South Africa and Nigeria to engage in active climate diplomacy. Finally, the integration of climate concerns into development assistance would probably herald the emergence of climate conditionality on debt and aid. This scenario will probably ring the wake up call for most Sub-Saharan countries, and would mark the incorporation of climate politics into mainstream African international economic relations...|$|R

The social case worker was also conscious of the clients’ emotional conflict which evolved from the necessity of clients visiting the agency’s clothing room to collect the needed items.

40|$|Pentecostal Christianity {{has gained}} many {{followers}} {{in the developing}} world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite a corpus of anthropological scholarship {{on the impact of}} following Pentecostalism on identities and social change, less has been written {{from the perspective of the}} believer, and little from within the field of development studies. In this thesis, which is based on 14 months of research in Kampala, Uganda, I explore how followers of this religion appropriate a discourse of prosperity and blessings, and how they utilise certain religious practices and relationships that are forged from the Pentecostal community in their efforts to mediate their futures and ‘move on up’ from a state of poverty. In particular, I discuss whether these practices and relationships can be seen as engendering transformative agency for these individuals. In doing so, I explore three themes that were prevalent in my data analysis: an everyday non-ecstatic speech act which is called ‘positive confessions’, ways of understanding poverty and dealing with situations of injustice, and patronage relationships between more wealthy and poorer members of the Pentecostal community. I suggest that despite readily <b>apparent</b> displays of <b>agency,</b> in effect these religious practices and relationships do little to enable positive transformations in the lives of these believers, and instead, might actually uphold existing issues of disenfranchisement, through an emphasis on the individual as a force for change, a reorientation in ideas of time, and a prohibition of doubt and questioning. In addition, a more limited exploration of a group of non-Pentecostals sheds light on the potential for Pentecostal Christianity to be influential on the wider religious milieu than may have originally be thought, and hints at the need for a re-fashioning of our research methods when understanding the lives of those who are ‘Pentecostal’, in Uganda at least...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} thirty years, the {{shareholder}} conception of corporate governance has established itself {{as the foundation of}} the power structure and management principles of the corporation. It is based on a specific theorization of the firm: agency theory. Our aim is to explain the full significance of this theorization, by considering the context in which it was developed and the project – of a fundamentally political nature – that it conveys. For that purpose, we return to the questions raised {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, in the seminal book of Berle and Means and in subsequent works by Berle; questions of a much broader scope that the relationship between shareholders and managers. We will show that agency theory can be considered a response to the most important ideas advanced by Berle and Means, and then by Berle (and others), after the New Deal and the Second World War. Comparison of these two themes of reflection leads us to identify two theorizations, and two radically different conceptions of the firm and the corporation. To address these issues, we start by considering the questions raised in the early twentieth century about the nature of the corporation and the status of managers; and how, in response to these questions, Berle constructed a certain conceptualization of the corporation and of managerial capitalism; we shall then revisit the contract-based approach of Jensen and Meckling, to assess the theoretical and ideological content and show how it was actually strongly opposed to Berle’s vision. Lastly, by way of conclusion, we shall endeavor to show how the opposition between these two theorizations should be seen, above all, as an opposition between two theories that are both “performative” rather than positive, and that the <b>apparent</b> success of <b>agency</b> theory and the dominance of shareholder primacy in corporate governance can only be understood in an institutional and political perspective...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{legality}} and {{wisdom of the}} FDA’s effort to persuade courts to find most failure-to-warn claims preempted. The article first analyzes the FDA’s justifications for reversing its long-held views to the contrary and explains why the FDA’s position cannot be reconciled with its governing statute. The article then examines why the FDA’s position, if ultimately adopted by the courts, would undermine the incentives drug manufacturers have to change labeling to respond to newly-discovered risks. The background possibility of failure-to-warn litigation provides important incentives for drug companies to ensure that drug labels reflect accurate and up-to-date safety information. The article next explains why the agency’s view that {{it is capable of}} singlehandedly regulating the safety of drugs is unrealistic. The agency does not have the resources to perform the Herculean task of monitoring the performance of every drug on the market. Both the Institute of Medicine and the Government Accountability Office have explained the shortcomings in the FDA’s recent performance, and they express doubt that the FDA is in capable of facing an increasingly challenging future. The article then explains how state damages litigation helps uncover and assess risks that are not <b>apparent</b> to the <b>agency</b> during a drug’s approval process, and why this “feedback loop” enables the agency to better do its job. FDA approval of drugs is based on clinical trials that involve, at most, a few thousand patients and last a year or so. These trials cannot detect risks that are relatively rare, affect vulnerable sub-populations, or have long latency periods. For this reason, most serious adverse effects do not become evident until a drug is used in larger population groups for periods in excess of one year. Time and again, failure-to-warn litigation has brought to light information that would not otherwise be available to the FDA, to doctors, to other health care providers, and to consumers. And failure-to-warn litigation often has preceded and clearly influenced FDA decisions to modify labeling, and, at times, to withdraw drugs from the market...|$|R
40|$|THIS PAPER IS CIRCULATED FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES AND ITS CONTENTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PRELIMINARY AND CONFIDENTIAL. NO REFERENCE TO MATERIAL CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE MADE WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE AUTHORS. Annual bonus is a {{controversial}} but under-researched dimension of executive pay. Bonus packages have the chameleon-like ability to suit CEOs, shareholders or both. In other words, {{they may be}} consistent with executive power theory {{and the notion of}} “fat cats” and/or agency theory. As with many other components of executive pay, the “devil may be in the detail”, and trends in the particular architecture of schemes may prove to be at least as important as aggregate relationships. This paper presents new results on executive bonuses in the UK’s large firms. The agency perspective on the role of executive bonus is supported by the significant, aggregate, positive relation between CEO bonus pay and a firm’s financial performance. Results for the UK during a unique period of slack capital markets produces measures of bonus pay-performance responsiveness that are broadly in line with earlier studies. Transparency in bonus schemes (in the sense of simplicity in targets) is positively associated with firm performance, as agency theorists would predict. This all suggests that CEO bonuses offer a strong and consistent basis for the alignment of principals’ and agents’ interests. However, this <b>apparent</b> support for <b>agency</b> theory should be viewed with caution. While bonus simplicity is associated positively with performance, it would appear that detailed bonus scheme characteristics are generally insensitive to this relationship. Bonus schemes in the UK are becoming more complex in terms of the use of multiple targets. There appears to be a trend towards the abandonment of simple schemes with unpublished targets, in favour of schemes with more targets, and unpublished ones at that. Of course “Individual Performance Evaluation”, where Boards have some discretion over the amount of bonus paid against unpublished or undisclosed targets, may succeed in theory, especially where the nature of the business makes it advisable to keep CEO targets confidential. Nevertheless, the implication of this paper is that, on balance, transparency in the form of simplicity (and associated published targets) is positively associated with firm performance...|$|R

Such literary criticism posits a continuous and universal female immigrant identity as well as an immutable, inescapable immigrant status. Consequently, analyses of their literary works frequently represent their immigrant experiences as those of perpetual victims trapped at the juncture of an absolute cultural divide between static cultures: that of their culture of origin and of their "guest country. " Other essentializing readers suggest that, in spite of the immigrant woman's <b>apparent</b> lack of <b>agency,</b> she has felicitous options: after resolving her ethnic conflicts, which include a formulaic critique of the guest country's culture, these critics presume that the immigrant woman achieves a joyful assimilation or, more accurately, a state of felicitous hybridity in which she consciously chooses the best aspects from each discrete culture and finds fortuitous personal resolution. In this project, I explore writing by the Jewish Argentine writers Cecilia Absatz (1943 -) and Nora Glickman (1944 -), the Turkish German writers Seyran Ates (1963 -) and Yade Kara (1965 -), and the Chinese American writers Gish Jen 1955 -) and Sigrid Nunez (1951 -). By examining their works through a non-binary rather than a binary lens, this research complicates the logics of incommensurability and stereotypical facile hybridity that have prevailed in the literary analysis of narratives of immigrant women. The readings offered here avoid such dichotomies as inclusion vs. exclusion, majority vs. minority, oppressor vs. oppressed, or the center vs. periphery/margin/fringe/interstice of nations and endeavors, in order to instead enhance the literary criticism of minority writing, to portray minority women as integral members of the nations that many of them have come to view as their home countries. These women writers, as instigators of change who are capable of refashioning the circumstances of their lives, also fashion narratives that present their own critical perspective on their own situation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{sustainability}} assessment (also known as ‘integrated’ or ‘triple-bottom-line’ assessment) is to simultaneously analyse {{the impacts of}} a proposal {{on a combination of}} environmental, social and economic receptors. This paper presents some challenges for sustainability assessment. It is based on recent experience in Western Australia where the State government is attempting to develop the capacity to implement sustainability assessment. A number of challenges will be addressed as follows. (i) How will sustainability assessment of projects be undertaken? Capacity for social and economic impact assessment and overall sustainability criteria may need to be developed to complement existing environmental impact assessment processes. (ii) When should trade-offs between environmental losses and socio-economic gains occur in the assessment process? (iii) In sustainability assessment of projects, how will mitigation and management actions that transcend the proponent's project site and its responsibilities (e. g., provision of social infrastructure and issues such as equity in employment and wealth distribution) be treated? A role for government <b>agencies</b> is <b>apparent</b> here. (iv) How will strategic proposals and regional land use planning be treated during sustainability assessment? Developing regional sustainability strategies and management plans may offer a practical solution. (v) How will existing unsustainable practices (e. g., current land uses and activities that degrade land, water and air resources) be remedied? Establishing agency based sustainability action plans and State of Sustainability Reporting may provide solutions here. In exploring these challenges for the implementation of sustainability assessment, implications for institutional reform and capacity building will be addressed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} a pilot service offering therapy specifically to adults {{with a history}} of child sexual abuse. DESIGN [...] Questionnaire survey. SETTING [...] Specialised therapy unit, Breakfree, which offers care, therapy, and support. SUBJECTS [...] 116 clients presenting to the service who were offered therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Scores from three psychological questionnaires [...] the social activities and distress scale, the general health questionnaire, and the delusions, symptoms, and states inventory [...] and from questionnaires about the clients' abuse, previous use of health services, and opinion of the Breakfree service. RESULTS [...] Clients had received previous help from health services and other <b>agencies</b> without <b>apparent</b> effect; they were highly distressed according to their psychological scores; and they were very frequent users of the health services. The clients showed significant improvement in their psychological scores (Wilcoxon's matched pairs signed ranks test) : social activities and distress scale, z = - 3. 3, P = 0. 001; general health questionnaire, z = - 5. 8, P < 0. 00001; delusions, symptoms, and states inventory, z = - 4. 8, P < 0. 00001). This was most pronounced for those who had completed therapy {{by the end of the}} study. Whereas 82 / 88 clients had a score for the general health questionnaire that indicated clinical distress at the start, only 28 / 58 did so at the end of the study (only 17 / 35 among those who had finished therapy). CONCLUSIONS [...] This group of adults {{with a history of}} child sexual abuse were highly disturbed and previous high users of the health service. The specialist service Breakfree was effective in the short term and, if the benefits are sustained, would yield a net cost saving to the health service...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the mid-twentieth century}} attempts to create integrated and therefore 'ideal' Maori citizens. These attempts, in turn, led to the re-imagining of the cities and ultimately of New Zealand as an integrated nation. In investigating the creation of integrated citizens and the integrated nation, this thesis asks four central questions: why the policies of integration and urbanisation were pursued; who pursued these policies; how these policies were implemented; and where integration occurred, examining houses/homes, hostels, and bodies as crucial sites where the policies were implemented. In answering these questions, I argue {{that the creation of}} both integrated citizens and the integrated nation were gendered processes. In particular, this thesis focuses on the role of women. Playing out stereotypically maternal roles within supposedly 'apolitical' and 'private' domestic spaces, Maori women became the target of state policy. In recognition of their importance to integration, the state aided Maori women in the establishment of their own voluntary organisation, the Maori Women's Welfare League. In addition to aiding the state, this organisation provided pivotal leadership in the urban environments. Through their organisation Maori women not only assumed leadership positions that were formerly the domain of Maori men, but also adopted many 'cultural missionary' roles formerly the domain of Pakeha women. Shifting the focus to young, single women and their bodies, I further argue that bodies and beauty became crucial to constructions of ideal citizens, and that women's bodies became emblematic of the integrated nation. Maori, however, were not simple victims of the policy of integration. Maori women, in particular, negotiated the policies and found <b>agency.</b> Through <b>apparent</b> complicity with the state, the women were able to exploit the aspects of the policy aimed at retaining aspects of Maori culture. Furthermore, urbanisation and integration are not presented as solely North Island phenomena; instead, the focus is extended to include the South Island, and in particular to the city of Christchurch...|$|R
