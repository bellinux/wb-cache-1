5|$|They {{finished}} second in the league in 1998–99 and 2001–02. With Harry Dixon's death in 2002, Harry Hodgson took up the post of President. In 2004, John Flynn stood down as chairman, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> a year long period, Hodgson took up the title of club chairman as well. At the end of the 2004–05 season, he retired from the club. His replacement, Sandra Gordon, is still Chair at the club. She is the first ever female Chair of the club, and only the third {{in the history of the}} Northern League. In 2007, Bernard Fairbairn, who had followed his father and grandfather into the job, stood down as club secretary, a post he had held since 1961, giving him a total of 46 years in his position. Stephen Moralee has now taken over as club secretary.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{also wanted}} the {{lighting}} to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured {{the physics of}} being underwater with Finding Nemo <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> WALL-E, he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, lens flare, and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70mm camera, {{and then trying to}} replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.|$|E

25|$|Disney had Ub Iwerks {{secretly}} begin animating a new cartoon {{while still}} under contract with Universal. The cartoon was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks {{was the main}} animator for the short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it. In fact, Iwerks was the main animator for every Disney short released in 1928 and 1929. Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising also assisted Disney during those years. They had already signed their contracts with Charles Mintz, {{but he was still}} in the process of forming his new studio <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> the time being they were still employed by Disney.

25|$|Baekje forces {{attempted}} a brief restoration movement but faced Silla-Tang joint forces. A Buddhist monk Dochim (도침, 道琛) {{and the former}} Baekje general Buyeo Boksin rose to try to revive Baekje. They welcomed the Baekje prince Buyeo Pung back from Japan to serve as king, with Juryu (주류, 周留, in modern Seocheon County, South Chungcheong) as their headquarters. They put the Tang general Liu Renyuan (劉仁願) under siege in Sabi. Emperor Gaozong sent the general Liu Rengui, who had previously been demoted to commoner rank for offending Li Yifu, with a relief force, and Liu Rengui and Liu Renyuan were able to fight off the Baekje resistance forces' attacks, but were themselves {{not strong enough to}} quell the rebellion, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> some time the armies were in stalemate.|$|E
25|$|The {{negotiations}} were getting nowhere and frustration now led Drake to repeat his tactic from Santo Domingo, and so {{parts of the}} city were set on fire. Over a period of time 250 houses or public buildings were destroyed before the Spanish reluctantly offered a compromise, and a deal was finally reached. Drake was offered 107,000 pesos in return for sparing the rest of the city. Drake and his men also managed to extort all the smaller individual payments {{from the rest of the}} Spanish prisoners, of the kind he had demanded of Alonso Bravo. A total of 250,000 pesos was brought in, the majority of which had been gleaned from the Church. Drake accepted the governor's offer, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> several days mule trains carrying silver and gold guarded by the English soldiers arrived in the town plaza.|$|E
25|$|The 20th Battalion {{was raised}} in March 1915 in Liverpool, New South Wales, {{as part of the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF). A small number of its {{original}} recruits had already served with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in New Guinea in 1914. After undertaking initial training, the battalion left Australia in June and after a further period of training in Egypt they landed at Anzac Cove on 22 August 1915 as part of the 5th Brigade, 2nd Division. They played only a minor part in the fighting during the August Offensive which was coming to a close by the time they arrived <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> the majority of time that they were at Gallipoli, the battalion was deployed in the defence of Russell's Top. They remained on the peninsula until the evacuation on 20 December 1915.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{at a fixed}} {{temperature}} {{below the}} critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external magnetic field is applied which {{is greater than the}} critical magnetic field. This is because the Gibbs free energy of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts {{in the absence of a}} field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of the electrons in the superconducting band and consequently a longer London penetration depth of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.|$|E
500|$|Much of Oldham's {{history is}} {{concerned}} with textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution; {{it has been said}} that [...] "if ever the Industrial Revolution placed a town firmly and squarely on the map of the world, that town is Oldham." [...] Oldham's soils were too thin and poor to sustain crop growing, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> decades prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure of}} the Crawford {{expedition}} caused alarm along the American frontier, as many Americans feared that the Indians would be emboldened enough and launch {{a new series of}} raids. More defeats for the Americans were yet to come, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> Americans west of the Appalachian Mountains, 1782 became known as the [...] "Bloody Year". On 13 July 1782, the Mingo leader Guyasuta led about 100 Indians and several British volunteers into Pennsylvania, destroying Hannastown, killing nine and capturing twelve settlers. It was the hardest blow dealt by Indians in Western Pennsylvania during the war.|$|E

500|$|In August 1909, the Reichstag {{stated that}} it would {{tolerate}} no increases in cost over the Moltke-class battlecruisers, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> a time, the Navy Department considered shelving the new design and instead to build a third Moltke-class ship. Admiral Tirpitz was able to negotiate a discount on armor plate from both Krupp and Dillingen; Tirpitz also pressured the ship's builder, Blohm & Voss, for a discount. These cost reductions freed up sufficient funds to make some material improvements to the design. On 27 January 1910, the Kaiser approved the design for the new ship, ordered under the provisional name [...] "Cruiser J".|$|E

500|$|The Protected Village Programme {{started on}} 27 July 1974, when Operation Overload {{began in the}} Chiweshe Tribal Trust Lands, where {{according}} to Reid-Daly [...] "apparent support for the ZANLA cause was, without doubt, overwhelming". Over the course of six weeks, 49,960 rural people were moved into 21 protected villages. People in the northern Chiweshe area had been subject to violent political intimidation by ZANLA, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>for</b> the most part moved willingly, but {{in the southern part}} of the area, where support for the cadres was stronger, resistance was encountered. The security forces destroyed the old huts after their occupants had moved. [...] "In the short term, benefits seemed substantial," [...] says Cilliers, [...] "as insurgent activities were severely disrupted in Chiweshe for the following six months." [...] The security forces immediately set about a similar operation called Overload Two in the Madziwa Tribal Trust Lands, which met with further success. This combined with the effectiveness of the recently formed Selous Scouts to reduce ZANLA influence in the area and force the cadres back to the north, towards Mozambique. After their lapse in concentration the security forces had begun to regain control.|$|E
