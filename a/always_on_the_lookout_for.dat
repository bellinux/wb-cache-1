Remick's music publishing company, in 1916. Fred had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas. Their chance meeting was to deeply affect the careers of both artists. Astaire was <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his ceaseless quest for novelty and perfection. The Astaires broke into Broadway in 1917 with Over the Top, a patriotic revue, and performed for U.S. and Allied troops at this time as well.|$|E
25|$|Kosovan art {{was unknown}} to the {{international}} public {{for a very long}} time, because of the regime, many artists were unable to display their art in art galleries, and so were <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> alternatives, and even resorted to taking matters into their own hands. During the Kosovo War, many studios were burned down and many artworks were destroyed or lost. Until 1990, artists from Kosovo presented their art in many prestigious worldwide renowned centers.

60|$|Bragg was {{a remarkably}} {{intelligent}} and well-informed man, professionally and otherwise. He was also thoroughly upright. But he was possessed of an irascible temper, and was naturally disputatious. A {{man of the}} highest moral character and the most correct habits, yet in the old army he was in frequent trouble. As a subordinate he was <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> to catch his commanding officer infringing his prerogatives; as a post commander he was equally vigilant to detect the slightest neglect, even of the most trivial order.|$|R
500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, was <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> {{someone who}} could bring to a broader {{audience}} {{the sound of the}} black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E

But they were problematic because of the censorship code. Anita, however, {{could be counted on}} to supply the delicate double entendre, the telling innuendo. Whenever we had a Jean Harlow picture on the agenda, we always thought of Anita first." [...] – MGM producer Samuel Marx ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th Century, he amassed timber rights {{approaching}} [...] in Central and Northern Ontario which he would harvest for his mills. He often went to his Algonquin timber limits in his own private railway car, working beside his men during the day and on business affairs most of the night, seldom sleeping for more than a few hours. He was <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> opportunities to reduce costs, and in 1894 he began investing in tugboats in order to accelerate the delivery of log booms to the Chaudière mill.|$|E

2500|$|In early series, reviews were {{primarily}} conducted by one host, {{with the other}} not required to play the game. In more recent series, both of the hosts equally present the review, with certain games being reviewed by only one host – such as Bajo's review of Dark Souls II or Goose's review of Fract OSC. Gameplay footage is shown while the game is discussed, and is used to illustrate points {{as well as provide}} humorous punchlines. The crew are often sent games by developers or studios ahead of their release date for them to play and review. The date they arrive comes down to the platform, game, publisher, and how persistent the show is with their requests. Bajo explains, [...] "We never review the game unless we're told it's 'review code'." [...] The crew have a few determining factors in choosing games for review, and aim to look at games relevant to their audience. This includes AAA titles, and any releases that are generating buzz. The team are <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> experimental or indie games, especially if they are generating interest within the Good Game offices or wider gaming community.|$|E
2500|$|Major Gowen, {{played by}} Ballard Berkeley, is a {{slightly}} senile, amiable old soldier {{who is a}} permanent resident of the hotel. [...] He {{is one of the}} few guests whom Basil seems to like. This is because he has the establishment status that Basil craves. He usually wears the Royal Artillery jagged-striped tie, and once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir being in France in 1918. He often is introduced as their [...] "oldest resident" [...] and in the episode [...] "Waldorf Salad" [...] Basil reveals that the Major has lived there for seven years. He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and workers' strikes (the frequent strikes at British Leyland during the time of the series' original transmission were often mentioned), and is <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> the newspaper. In the episode [...] "The Germans" [...] he shows he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars. The best he can say is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between [...] "wogs" [...] and [...] "niggers"—but in a manner innocent of malice or bigotry. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's plans to go awry, notably in the episode [...] "Communication Problems" [...] in which Basil tries his best to keep the money he won in a bet a secret from Sybil.|$|E

His guardian, old Jacob Morton, died, leaving him a small sum of money and a written {{confession}} that Tom, instead of being of humble origin, was the son and heir of a deceased Western merchant, and had been defrauded out of his just rights by an unscrupulous uncle. The lad started for Cincinnati to look up his heritage. But three years passed away before he obtained his first clue. Mr. Grey, the uncle, did not hesitate to employ a ruffian to kill the lad. The plan failed, and Gilbert Grey, once Tom the bootblack, came into a comfortable fortune. This is one of Mr. Alger's best stories.|$|R

60|$|From {{that time}} his {{degeneration}} was rapid. The white people {{gave him the}} cold shoulder. They were only prevented from cutting him completely by disdainful pity and by a certain dread of his angry violence when he was drunk. He became extremely susceptible and was <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> affront.|$|E
50|$|The {{first baseman}} is the {{position}} {{to the left side}} of the diamond when facing home plate. The major role of the first baseman is to receive throws from other defensive players in order to get a force play at first base. Another role they play is to make fielding plays on all balls hit towards first base. The first baseman is usually involved in every play that occurs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field. Individuals at first base have quick hands and good reach, and are <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> to catch <b>the</b> player off base. They are also generally taller and left-handed throwing, which gives them an extended reach. First basemen however, can be both left and right handed. Just like the catcher, first basemen may wear specific first base mitts, usually having a longer web allowing them to reach the taller throws over their head.|$|R

His training was led by the talented masters of Soviet war art whose idea was to promote the Red Army heroic past by a new cohort of artists. Among them were Khrystophor Ushenin, Vasyl’ Swarog, Yevhen Katsman, Oleksander Herasymov.

40|$|People are {{the most}} {{important}} resource of a Software Company. Software companies especially have always had to compete for the best and brightest. Facing growing competition for the talent they need, they work harder and longer at keeping their best, developing skills internally, and <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> to attract <b>the</b> best and brightest. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an in-depth look into where retailers are succeeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> talent front – and where they are coming up short. The research design used in this study is descriptive and conceptual framework of this research is based on theoretical and design principles. This paper draws on a survey of 112 organizations to investigate how talent management strategies affect organizational performance in software companies. The findings from this study are talent management practices with a strong focus on business strategy and its alignment with overall business goals. These practices have statistically highly significant impact on corporate profits; one that is greater than that of any other focus of talent management practices. This research paper suggested that the management and individuals need to establish metrics and communicate the impact of the organization’s talent management efforts...|$|R

60|$|You {{remember}} I had {{a glimpse}} of him once. He was not an imposing personality: tall, thin, straight, stiff, faded, moving with short steps and with a gliding motion, speaking in an even low voice. When the sea was rough he wasn't much seen on deck--at least not walking. He caught hold of things then and dragged himself along {{as far as the}} after skylight where he would sit for hours. Our, then young, friend offered once to assist him and this service was the first beginning of a sort of friendship. He clung hard to one--Powell says, with no figurative intention. Powell was <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> to assist, and to assist mainly Mrs Anthony, because he clung so jolly hard to her that Powell was afraid of her being dragged down notwithstanding that she very soon became very sure-footed in all sorts of weather. And Powell was the only one ready to assist at hand because Anthony (by that time) seemed to be afraid to come near them; the unforgiving Franklin always looked wrathfully the other way; the boatswain, if up there, acted likewise but sheepishly; and any hands that happened to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poop (a feeling spreads mysteriously all over a ship) shunned him as though he had been the devil.|$|R

There are many islands and coves on this body of water. This can sometimes make it difficult for new visitors to navigate the lake. There are also many hazards to look out for, and boating should be done with caution. These hazards include prop-chewing stumps that lie just beneath the surface, along with shallow rocks.
