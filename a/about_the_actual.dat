5|$|Chinese books {{had reached}} Japan since circa 400 AD {{and had been}} {{imported}} in large quantities {{through a number of}} missions during the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Official missions ended after 894, but books continued to reach Japan in the mid to late Heian period through commercial exchange or via priests travelling to China. Imported Chinese books were copied at Japanese libraries, but unlike sutra copying little is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> copying process of Chinese secular works in Japan. The Japanese aristocracy and clergy sponsored the transcription of religious and government texts on a large scale by the Nara period.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN {{notes that}} {{very little is}} known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> status of the great white shark, but as it appears {{uncommon}} compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit. As of March 2010, {{it has also been}} included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range. According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2000 great white sharks near the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.|$|E

25|$|We know {{relatively}} little <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> purpose of meganucleases.

25|$|Most of what {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> {{proceedings}} of the meetings comes from notes kept by Durant which were later submitted as a memo to the NSC and commonly referred to as the Durant Report.

25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} academic debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> dates of reigns of the Israelite kings.

25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
25|$|Sources differ <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> {{number of}} nobles in France, however, proportionally, it {{was among the}} {{smallest}} noble classes in Europe. For the year 1789, French historian François Bluche gives a figure of 140,000 nobles (9,000 noble families) and states that about 5% of nobles could claim descent from feudal nobility before the 15th century. With a total population of 28 million, this would represent merely 0.5%. Historian Gordon Wright gives a figure of 300,000 nobles (of which 80,000 were from the traditional noblesse d'épée), which agrees with the estimation of historian Jean de Viguerie, or a little over 1%. In terms of land holdings, {{at the time of}} the revolution, noble estates comprised about one-fifth of the land.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was {{the first}} single-celled, {{eukaryotic}} organism to have its entire genome sequenced. This sequencing helped confirm the nearly century of work by mycologists and enologists in identifying different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that are used in}} beer, bread and winemaking. Today there are several hundred different strains of S. cerevisiae identified. Not all of the strains are suitable for winemaking and even among the strains that are, there is debate among winemakers and scientists <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> magnitude of differences between the various strains and their potential impact on the wine. Even among strains that have demonstrated distinctive difference when compared among young wines, these differences seem to fade and become less distinctive as the wines age.|$|E
