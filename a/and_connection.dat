5|$|The Association of Shinto Shrines is {{politically}} active in encouraging {{support for the}} Emperor, including campaigns such as distributing amulets from Ise Shrine. Ise Shrine {{was one of the}} most important shrines in State Shinto, symbolizing Amaterasu's presence <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> to the Emperor. In contrast, the Meiji-era Yasukuni Shrine is frequently the target of State Shinto controversies, mostly owing to its enshrinement of Japanese war criminals.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{nickname}} <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> to the foundry, John McGraw named McGinnity the starter for the Giants' March 23, 1904 exhibition {{game against the}} Southern Association's Birmingham Iron Men which was scheduled {{to raise funds for}} the Vulcan statue then being cast for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition that summer in St. Louis, Missouri. At his own request, McGinnity was allowed to visit the downtown foundry and personally pour some of the iron into the moulds for the statue.|$|E

5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E
5|$|Rabearivelo {{struggled}} {{throughout his}} life to reconcile his identity as Malagasy with his aspiration toward French assimilation <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> with the greater universal human experience. He has been depicted as a martyr figure {{as a result of}} his suicide following the refusal of French authorities to grant him permission to go to France. He has been the subject of a significant number of books and conferences; on the fiftieth anniversary of his death, his work was commemorated at events organized in North America, Europe and Africa, including a week-long conference at the University of Antananarivo. Recent scholarship has questioned Rabearivelo's elevation as a colonial martyr, arguing that the poet was by and large an assimilationist who did not view himself as African.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, {{opened in}} 1975, {{allowing}} better facilities <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport. During {{the summer of}} 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny-Ålesund Airport to support their expeditions. During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-Ålesund, but the air strip was kept operational for the few groups of researchers who did visit. A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-Ålesund receiving a telephone connection. A radio beacon was subsequently installed at the airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{passenger}} transport to Mæl {{was performed by}} connecting passenger wagons to the freight trains. Up to ten trains were operated each direction each day, and up to five would correspond with the ferry; at Tinnoset trains would operate to Skien, <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> at Hjuksebø allowed for transport to Oslo Vestbanestasjon. In 1928 Norsk Transport and NSB agreed to operate a weekly night train service from Rjukan to Oslo; the service lasted until 1933. During the 1930s NSB and Norsk Hydro initiated an attempt to attract tourists to Rjukan, through discounted direct trains from Oslo, Drammen and Skien. They were taken up again after the war, and remained until 1969.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{has three}} {{scheduled}} flights to the Vancouver International Airport every day, with one fewer on Sunday, provided by Air Canada Express. There {{is also a}} daily flight to the Calgary International Airport provided by WestJet Encore. The airport typically also has a few flights a week leaving Calgary at 8:45 PM and arriving in Penticton {{later on in the}} night, the plane then stays at the Penticton Airport and leaves for Calgary at 7:00 AM and arrives in Calgary around 9:00 AM. However, these flights were cancelled due to runway safety issues (See Airlines and destinations, below). Kelowna International Airport has affected traffic at the Penticton Regional Airport, with the former providing more direct flight <b>and</b> <b>connection</b> options for travellers. Penticton Regional Airport also recently underwent an expansion to add more seating area in the main terminal building as an addition to the extra WestJet Encore flights on certain days coming in and out of Penticton.|$|E
