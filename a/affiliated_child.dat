40|$|The Article {{analyzes}} {{both the}} meaning and the constitutionality of Child Care Development Block Grant 2 ̆ 7 s church-and-state-related provisions in light of existing Supreme Court Establishment Clause jurisprudence. The CCDBG 2 ̆ 7 s church-and-state-related provisions represent a legislative effort to perform the type of Establishment Clause line drawing that the Supreme Court has traditionally undertaken and continues to undertake in cases involving aid to religious institutions. The congressional debate and the public controversy it engendered over line drawing between permissible and impermissible aid to religiously <b>affiliated</b> <b>child</b> care, and the resolution reached in the CCDBG, all achieve an important constitutional aim. They reflect and reinforce a public ideal expressed in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s existing jurisprudence, the ideal that religious liberty is safeguarded by {{the separation of the}} public sphere of government and the private sphere of religion. However imprecise the exercise, and wherever the line is drawn, the very act of drawing a line, of determining when aid is permissible, upholds the Establishment Clause ideal. The enactment of the CCDBG demonstrates that the line-drawing exercise is a feasible and useful task. With the statute 2 ̆ 7 s grant and contract aid provisions, Congress has constructed a scheme that allows substantial aid to religiously <b>affiliated</b> <b>child</b> care while drawing a workable line between prohibited aid that advances religion and permissible aid that does not. The Article argues that under existing Establishment Clause doctrines, the CCDBG measures allowing financial assistance to be paid by states to religiously affiliated nonsectarian child care programs are constitutional, whereas the requirement that the program 2 ̆ 7 s vouchers be redeemable for sectarian services is probably not. While the Court may very well modify and develop current Establishment Clause jurisprudence in ways that will allow the use of vouchers for religious programs, the Article maintains that such action by the Court would undermine the traditional Establishment Clause ideal of separation between church and state. The questions addressed in the Article regarding the CCDBG 2 ̆ 7 s church-and-state provisions are urgent ones. Federal and state agencies implementing the CCDBG must analyze the statute in light of current Establishment Clause mandates, just as Congress struggled to do in the process of its enactment. State and federal courts will have to do the same in any challenges to the statute. Furthermore, even if federal constitutional doctrines are reworked and relaxed, federal and state policymakers, as well as state courts interpreting state constitutional provisions, will have to decide whether to follow or to depart from federal Establishment Clause doctrine...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was a {{comparison}} of young children's intensity of task—involvement in child—selected activities. A group of 23 children, four to six years of age, was selected as the subjects from a university <b>affiliated</b> <b>child</b> development laboratory school. These children were observed during child-selected activities for five consecutive weeks. The instrument utilized to collect the data was the Intensity Of Involvement Scale, composed of seven categories of intensity from "Unoccupied" to "Complete. " To obtain reliable data, two observers were involved in the observation and a carefully planned procedure of observation was followed accurately. The comparison of children's intensity of task-involvement among child-selected activities, using statistical methods of mean and standard deviation, yielded a similar result among various groups of children. The learning centers in which children were involved most intensely were water play, family living, manipulative, and art centers. The children, however, were involved in the reading, block, and writing centers less intensely. In comparing children's intensity of task-involvement between age-groups and sex-groups, the analyses of two-way t-test revealed that age-differences were significant (p<. 05) but sex-differences were not significant in children's overall intensity of task-involvement. Also, the results showed that the significance of differences in children's intensity of task-involvement in each child-selected activity depended more upon the age than the sex of children. In addition, individual differences in children's intensity of task-involvement were examined using mean, frequency distribution, and range. The finding was that children differed from one another in their degrees and variability of intensity of task-involvement in child-selected activities...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a local fragmented model of services for children with autism in Hong Kong emerged gradually {{over the past three}} decades with lack of government funding or support. This had been due to increasing number of children with autism being detected and referred for earlier assessment. With increasing pressure from parents due to long waiting time for assessment and training services and the increasing polarization by mass media there had been a gradual increasing public awareness over the past five years. Though still highly fragmented in the availability of services, there is a growing 'business model' available in the community due to increasing need and lack of public funding for support. There is a lack of strategic planning for medical diagnostic and management issues in Hong Kong. Our University of Hong Kong based Autism Research Program was pioneered in 1985 based on the increasing load of autism cases referred for assessment for other developmental problems and diagnosed as Autism in the Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital. As the first author has been the staff of the University of Hong Kong, this program flourished as a research based program. The benefits of early identification and intervention of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had been increasingly recognized, and with the increased public awareness and increasing trend of earlier diagnosis, there has been a continuously high demand from parents for earlier assessment and training for children suspected to have ASD. This model had not received extra funding for this integrated program for research, teaching and training in autism. We had to apply for various donations and grants to support the development of this pioneer program. The research output and organization of forums for public education and awareness are reviewed. The latter part of the paper reports the summary of clinical profile of autism cases (N= 1441) assessed from 1985 to 2010 June under the University of Hong Kong. As the waiting time for initial developmental assessment for any children in Hong Kong is 12 - 24 months, we also report our preliminary experience with a newly launched triaging service provision for children suspected to be ASD since 2009, including multi-disciplinary assessment and parallel interim training in our university <b>affiliated</b> <b>child</b> assessment centre in Hong (N= 89). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

MethodsInfluenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as the presence of fever (axillary temperature 22 ̆ 030538 20 C) and cough or sore throat.

To calculate the incidence of influenza-associated outpatient visits, we conducted community-based healthcare utilization surveys to determine the proportion of hospital catchment area residents who sought care at SCH.
