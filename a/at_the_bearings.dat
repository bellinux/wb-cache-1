40|$|On publication, {{statement}} {{to be provided}} in the format: This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Structure and Infrastructure Engineering on 17 December 2015, available online: [URL] paper illustrates how long-term measurements can be analysed to understand bridge behaviour under changing environmental conditions and how the developed understanding can help explain the performance of its critical components. Measurements from the Cleddau Bridge, a structure that has been continuously monitored {{for more than two}} years, are used to investigate thermal effects in steel box-girder bridges and, in particular, their bearings. Observed temperature distributions are very different to the recommended distributions in design codes (BS EN 1991 - 5 : 2003). These temperature distributions create plan bending of the box girder, which in turn impose forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> that have contributed to its wear. This paper investigates bearing movements of the bridge using numerical models, and estimates the resulting forces at the supports. A physics-based model of the bridge is created to which temperature distributions inferred from in-situ measurements are supplied as input. Model predictions are validated against measured deformations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearings.</b> Subsequently the model is used to predict forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> due to plan bending and bearing locking. Results quantify the impact that thermal effects have on the performance of the bearings. They also highlight the significance of considering a range of temperature distribution scenarios that go beyond those given in the design codes in order to reliably evaluate thermal effects at the design stage...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Finite element {{analysis}} in aluminum extrusion is faced by several {{problems such as}} number of degrees of freedom, calculation time, large deformation and flow conservation. The problem of large deformation is overcome by applying the Eulerian formulation. The problems concerning number of degrees of freedom, calculation time can be overcome by simplifying <b>the</b> model especially <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> corner. On <b>the</b> one hand, detailed modeling of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> corner will increase {{the complexity of the}} analysis. On the other hand, simplified modeling of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> corner will face problems such as locking of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> corner node and loss of flow conservation. A sharp corner and modified corner geometry are examples of the simplified modeling. Moreover, boundary conditions will be applied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> corner node in order {{to solve the problem of}} its locking and to satisfy the flow conservation condition. These boundary conditions include specifying a normal or formulating a constraint equation. This paper focuses on the calculation of the normal or constraint equation that can be applied either at a sharp corner or after modifying the corner geometry. Different elements are checked in this study such as plane strain, axisymmetric and tetrahedron elements. Finally, the extrusion force and average exit velocity are investigated and compared with a reference model. In the reference model a round corner with 0. 5 mm radius is built, contact boundary condition is applied between the die and aluminum, and Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation is applied.
