40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{exist to}} account for granular behavior. The thermal one considers the total entropy, which includes microscopic degrees of freedom such as phonons; the <b>athermal</b> one (as with the Edward entropy) takes grains as elementary. Granular solid hydrodynamics (GSH) belongs to the first, DEM, granular kinetic theory and <b>athermal</b> statistical mechanics (ASM) to the second. A careful discussion of their conceptual differences is given here. Three noteworthy insights or results are: (1) While DEM and granular kinetic theory are well justified to take grains as elementary, any <b>athermal</b> entropic consideration is bound to run into trouble. (2) Many general principles are taken as invalid in granular media. Yet within the thermal approach, energy conservation and fluctuation-dissipation theorem remain valid, granular temperatures equilibrate, and phase space is well explored in a grain at rest. Hence these are abnormalities of the <b>athermal</b> approximation, not of granular media as such. (3) GSH is a wide-ranged continuum mechanical description of granular dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{advances have}} {{led to the creation of}} a unified phase diagram for the thermal glass and <b>athermal</b> jamming transitions. This diagram makes clear that, while related, the mode-coupling [...] -or dynamic [...] -glass transition is distinct from the jamming transition, occurring at a finite temperature and significantly lower density than the jamming transition. Nonetheless, we demonstrate a pre-jamming transition in <b>athermal</b> frictionless spheres which occurs at the same density as the mode-coupling transition and is marked by percolating clusters of locally rigid particles. At this density in both the thermal and <b>athermal</b> systems, individual motions of an extensive number of particles become constrained, such that only collective motion is possible. This transition, which is well below jamming, exactly matches the definition of collective behavior at the dynamical transition of glasses. Thus, we reveal that the genesis of rigidity in both thermal and <b>athermal</b> systems is governed by the same underlying topological transition in their shared configuration space...|$|E
40|$|While {{the glass}} {{transition}} at non-zero temperature {{seems to be}} hard to access for experimental, theoretical, or simulation studies, jamming at zero temperature has been explored in great detail. It is a widely discussed question whether this <b>athermal</b> jamming transition is related to the glass transition. Motivated by the exploration of the energy landscape that has been successfully used to describe <b>athermal</b> jamming, we introduce a new method to determine whether the configuration space of a soft sphere system can be explored within a reasonable timescale or not, i. e., whether the system is ergodic or effectively non-ergodic. While in case of <b>athermal</b> jamming for a given random starting configuration only the local energy minimum is determined, we allow the thermally excited crossing of energy barriers. Interestingly, we observe that a transition exists where the system becomes effectively non-ergodic if the density is increased. In the limit of small but non-zero temperatures the density where the ergodicity breaking transition occurs approaches a value that is independent of temperature and below the transition density of <b>athermal</b> jamming. This confirms recent computer simulation studies where <b>athermal</b> jamming occurs deep inside the glass phase. In addition, with our method we determined the critical behavior of the ergodicity breaking transition and show that it is in the universality class of directed percolation. Therefore, our approach not only makes the transition from an ergodic to an effectively non-ergodic systems easily accessible and helps to reveal its universality class but also shows that it is fundamentally different from <b>athermal</b> jamming.

40|$|We show that, {{at least}} at a mean-field level, the effect of {{structural}} disorder in sheared amorphous media is very dissimilar depending on the thermal or <b>athermal</b> nature of their underlying dynamics. We first introduce a toy model, including explicitly two types of noise (thermal versus <b>athermal).</b> Within this interpretation framework, we argue that mean-field <b>athermal</b> dynamics can {{be accounted for by}} the so-called Hébraud-Lequeux (HL) model, in which the mechanical noise stems explicitly from the plastic activity in the sheared medium. Then, we show that the inclusion of structural disorder, by means of a distribution of yield energy barriers, has no qualitative effect in the HL model, while such a disorder is known {{to be one of the}} key ingredients leading kinematically to a finite macroscopic yield stress in other mean-field descriptions, such as the Soft-Glassy-Rheology model.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{exist to}} account for granular dynamics: The <b>athermal</b> one takes grains as elementary, the thermal one considers the total entropy that includes microscopic degrees of freedom such as phonons and electrons. Discrete element method (DEM), granular kinetic theory and <b>athermal</b> statistical mechanics (ASM) belong to the first, granular solid hydrodynamics (GSH) to the second one. A discussion of the conceptual differences between both is given here, leading, among others, to the following insights: (1) While DEM and granular kinetic theory are well justified to take grains as <b>athermal,</b> any entropic consideration is {{far less likely to}} succeed. (2) In addition to modeling grains as a gas of dissipative, rigid mass points, it is very helpful take grains as a thermal solid that has been sliced and diced. (3) General principles that appear invalid in granular media are repaired and restored once the true entropy is included.

40|$|Dynamic {{networks}} {{designed to}} model the cell cytoskeleton can be reconstituted from filamentous actin, the motor protein myosin and a permanent cross-linker. They are driven out of equilibrium when the molecular motors are active.

We have here probed <b>athermal</b> fluctuations in such "active gels" using video microrheology. We have measured the full distribution of probe displacements, {{also known as the}} van Hove correlation function. The dominant influence of thermal or <b>athermal</b> fluctuations can be detected by varying the lag time over which the displacements are measured. We argue that the exponential tails of the distribution derive from single motors close to the probes, and we extract an estimate of the velocity of motor heads along the actin filaments. The distribution exhibits a central Gaussian region which we assume derives from the action of many independent motor proteins far from the probe particles when <b>athermal</b> fluctuations dominate.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{of waste}} activated sludge can be improved if hydrolysis of particulate substrates is enhanced and available substrate is made more accessible by both breakup of the sludge matrix floc and rupture of the cell wall. Microwave (MW) pretreatment was suggested and studied {{as a way to}} improve digestion efficiency. The work done focuses on the effects of MW pretreatment on the characteristics of the sludge, due to thermal and <b>athermal</b> effects. It also evaluates the effects some process variables in the activated sludge process have on the pretreatment efficiency as well as the effect operating conditions in the downstream anaerobic digestion process have on the biodegradability efficiency of those sludges. Effects of <b>athermal</b> and thermal MW radiation were measured by use of a customized MW oven capable of providing MW radiation with uncoupled thermal and <b>athermal</b> effects. <b>Athermal</b> radiation was capable of increasing substrate present in the soluble phase of sludge, and had a positive effect in the digestion of <b>athermal</b> samples. The increases in biogas production and substrate solubilisation were smaller in magnitude than the increases measured for MW thermal tests. Further refining of the tests with <b>athermal</b> and thermal sludge, involved separation by size class of the solubilized substrate by means of ultrafiltration (UF), and revealed that changes in particle size distribution were significant not only for MW thermal tests, but also for <b>athermal</b> tests, with a particular emphasis in proteins in <b>athermal</b> tests. These changes had an effect on the biodegradability of the sludges by class size, with thermally pretreated sludge producing more biogas for smaller particles size classes but also exhibiting more inhibition. Tests were made with several combinations of sludge with different ages and subject to different MW pretreatment temperatures. The work showed that sludge age or solids retention time (SRT) has a significant effect on the pretreatment efficiency with maximum biogas improvements measured at different MW pretreatment temperatures depending on the SRT of the sludge tested, and with different behaviour for mesophilic and thermophilic digestion. Mesophilic tests showed greater improvements in terms of digestion effiency on average, but thermophilic tests showed more uniform performance, with a higher baseline efficiency. The presence of an optimum of MW pretreatment temperature and sludge SRT for maximal biogas production is more defined for mesophilic conditions than for thermophilic conditions. Semi-continuous studies were conducted with several combinations of single and two stage mesophilic and thermophilic digestors treating MW pretreated sludge and non-pretreated sludge. Staging and thermophilic digestion allowed the maintenance of a stable digestion process with high biogas productions and high solids removal efficiencies with production of sludge with good bacteriological characteristics for an very low residence time (5 d) ...|$|E
