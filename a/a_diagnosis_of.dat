5|$|<b>A</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> {{hypothyroidism}} {{without any}} lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> {{psoriasis}} {{is usually}} {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
30|$|However, all the {{mentioned}} imaging {{characteristics are}} not specific {{enough to make}} <b>a</b> confident <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-fat-containing angiomyolipoma.

Patients assigned to MDC 25 (HIV Infections) must have <b>a</b> principal <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> HIV Infection or <b>a</b> principal <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> significant HIV related condition and <b>a</b> secondary <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> HIV Infection.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that bipolar disorders are diagnosed as depression in the primary care setting. This can lead to treatment failure of depression and worsening of bipolar disorder symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine if patients with a bipolar disorder have had <b>a</b> previous <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> depression by their primary care provider. METHOD: A retrospective chart review of outpatients with <b>a</b> new <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> bipolar disorder during the period of September 1, 2001 thru April 30, 2003 was performed. Past diagnostic and treatment information was obtained looking for <b>a</b> previous <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> depression. RESULTS: 25 patients were identified with a bipolar disorder. 8 patients had a self reported and 2 had <b>a</b> confirmed <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> depression prior to being diagnosed with a bipolar disorder.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{access the}} {{incidence}} of diagnostic errors in the initial evaluation of children with cardiac murmurs. METHODS: We evaluated our 7 -years of experience in a public pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic. Of 3692 patients who {{were sent to the}} hospital, 2603 presented with a heart murmur and were investigated. Patients for whom a disagreement existed between the initial and final diagnoses were divided into the following 2 groups: G 1 (n= 17) with <b>an</b> initial <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> innocent murmur and <b>a</b> final <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> cardiopathy, and G 2 (n= 161) with <b>an</b> initial <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> cardiopathy and <b>a</b> final <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> normal heart. RESULTS: In G 1, the great majority of patients had cardiac defects with mild hemodynamic repercussions, such as small ventricular septal defect and mild pulmonary stenosis. In G 2, the great majority of structural defects were interventricular communication, atrial septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis. CONCLUSION: A global analysis demonstrated that diagnostic error in the initial evaluation of children with cardiac murmurs is real, reaching approximately 6 % of cases. The majority of these misdiagnoses were in patients with <b>an</b> initial <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> cardiopathy, which was not confirmed through later complementary examinations. Clinical cardiovascular examination is an excellent resource in the evaluation of children suspected of having cardiopathy. Immediate outpatient discharge of children with <b>an</b> initial <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> innocent heart murmur seems to be a suitable approach...|$|R

5|$|Alprazolam may be {{quantified}} in blood or plasma to confirm <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or {{to assist in}} a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma alprazolam concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 10–100 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–300 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300–2000 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitation is usually performed using chromatographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) through examination of ultrahigh-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans {{of the temporal bone}} and attempted to verify the correspondence between <b>a</b> radiologic <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> SSCD and clinical signs of SSCD syndrome. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out on 191 consecutive patients who underwent temporal bone ultrahigh-resolution CT scans. Cases that matched the radiologic <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> SSCD were subsequently referred for a comprehensive audiological evaluation that might enable <b>a</b> final <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> SSCD syndrome.

Methods: Routine hospital data from a large urban area of South Wales, UK (with a population of approximately 435 000) were record-linked using probability matching algorithms to mortality data from the Office of National Statistics (1991 – 2005). Relative survival was compared using Cox proportional hazards models. Patients were selected with <b>a</b> primary <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> psoriasis.

A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.

Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm <b>a</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09.

Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA.
