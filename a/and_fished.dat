25|$|The {{ancestors}} of today's First Nations in Alberta {{arrived in the}} area at least 8,000 years BC, according to the Bering land bridge theory. Southerly tribes, the Plain Indians, such as the Blackfoot, Blood, and Peigans eventually adapted to seminomadic Plains Bison hunting, originally {{without the aid of}} horses, but later with horses that Europeans had introduced. More northerly tribes, like the Woodland Cree and the Chipewyan also hunted, trapped, <b>and</b> <b>fished</b> for other types of game in the aspen parkland and boreal forest regions.|$|E
25|$|Bridgeport's {{early years}} {{were marked by}} residents' {{reliance}} on fishing and farming. This {{was similar to the}} economy of the Paugusset, who had cultivated corn, beans, and squash; <b>and</b> <b>fished</b> and gathered shellfish from both the river and sound. A village called Newfield began to develop around the corner of State and Water streets in the 1760s. The area officially became known as Stratfield in 1695 or 1701, due to its location between the already existing towns of Stratford and Fairfield. During the American Revolution, Newfield Harbor was a center of privateering.|$|E

25|$|During the 6th {{millennium}} BC, southern Scandinavia was clad in lush {{forests of}} temperate broadleaf and mixed forests.

Like their predecessors, they also hunted seals <b>and</b> <b>fished</b> in the rich waters. North of the Kongemose people, lived other hunter-gatherers in most of southern Norway and Sweden, called the Nøstvet and Lihult cultures, descendants of the Fosna and Hensbacka cultures. These cultures still hunted, {{in the end of}} the 6th millennium BC when the Kongemose culture was replaced by the Ertebølle culture in the south.|$|E
