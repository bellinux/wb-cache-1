5|$|Ottavia bids a quiet {{farewell}} to Rome, {{while in the}} throne room of the palace the coronation ceremony for Poppea is prepared. The Consuls and Tribunes enter, and after a brief eulogy place the crown on Poppea's head. Watching over the proceedings is the god of Love with his mother, Venere, and a divine chorus. Nerone and Poppea sing a rapturous love duet ("I gaze <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> I possess you") as the opera ends.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile <b>at</b> <b>you?</b> Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
25|$|Aiki is {{different}} from the victory of sen sen, and is applied in situations of go no sen, such as when an opponent thrusts <b>at</b> <b>you.</b> Therein lies the essence of katsujinken and setsuninken. You block the attack when an opponent approaches; at his second attack you break his sword and spare his life. This is katsujinken. When an opponent strikes <b>at</b> <b>you</b> and your sword pierces his stomach it is setsuninken. These two concepts are the essence of the sword.|$|E

25|$|As with Dennis Brookes, it is {{impossible}} to evaluate Brian Reynolds' contribution to Northamptonshire solely in terms of his performances for the first team. They are impressive enough, but all the runs and catches, the twenty stumpings as stand-in wicket-keeper and overlook these <b>at</b> <b>you</b> peril, the four wickets., must be supplemented with thirteen seasons' work as Chief Coach in charge of the Second XI, and a further eleven years in the specially-created role of Cricket development Officer.|$|E

25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot <b>at</b> <b>you</b> from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell they were looking <b>at</b> <b>you.</b> Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located {{at the tip of}} a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} militaristic in nature, with each enemy sprite having a {{corresponding}} information {{section in the}} pause menu, relating details {{of the real world}} weapon (or a fictionalized version, in the case of non-existent weapons, such as the Mohican helicopter from Urban Strike). The next generation titles, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, featured plots based heavily on present day geopolitics, such as the instability of post-USSR states, or tensions at the DMZ between North and South Korea. However, in contrast, the games often displayed a quirky sense of humor, featuring numerous appearances by Elvis including outside a castle where he cannot be killed or even harmed, he just laughs <b>at</b> <b>you</b> and even Santa Claus, as well as wisecracks from the player character in the earlier games (in Urban Strike, the player's character, on being told the villain is an evil genius, comments: 'Great, another evil genius. Why can't I ever fight an evil idiot?') Although ostensibly serious in nature, the games were often quite tongue-in-cheek in their execution.|$|E

25|$|In the jousting match Lancelot easily defeats {{all three}} knights. He wounds Sir Lionel, who fights him last, {{so badly that}} the crowd thinks he is dead. But the dismay of the crowd turns to awe as Lancelot's distraught cries for Sir Lionel to live {{seemingly}} resurrect a dead man. Reflecting the adoration of the crowd, Guinevere finds herself {{falling in love with}} Lancelot. She does not wish to violate her marriage vows, however, and wishes Lancelot would leave Camelot ("Before I Gaze <b>at</b> <b>You</b> Again"). By some unfortunate twist of fate, Lancelot, in spite of his boasts that he is immune to pleasures of the flesh, is also madly in love with Guinevere, and is similarly torn by the conflict between this love and his devotion to Arthur. Arthur makes Lancelot a Knight of the Round Table. As it happens, the shrewd King Arthur guesses that Lancelot and Guinevere have feelings for each other, but hopes it will blow over, as he does not wish to upset the tranquility of Camelot. He soliloquizes to his sword Excalibur, that they will rise to the challenges they will all face, together.|$|E

500|$|Several {{others were}} quick to join Hill in his {{criticism}} of Fielding and the Grub Street campaign. Bonnell Thornton, a poet and essayist, was responsible for Have <b>at</b> <b>you</b> All; or, the Drury Lane Journal, a production that satirised Fielding and his works. Particular {{attention was paid to}} Amelia in Have <b>at</b> <b>you</b> All; the fifth number, for example, featured [...] "a new chapter in Amelia, more witty than the rest, if the reader has but sense enough to find out the humour." [...] On 15 January, Tobias Smollett [...] published a disparaging twenty-eight-page pamphlet entitled A Faithful Narrative of the base and inhuman Arts that were lately practised upon the Brain of Habbakuk Hilding, Justice, Dealer and Chapman, who now lies at his own House in Covent-Garden, in a deplorable State of Lunacy; a dreadful Monument of false Friendship and Delusion. The pamphlet was notorious for its viciousness, and variously accused [...] "Habbakuk Hilding" [...] (Fielding) of literary theft, scandalousness, and smuttiness, while deriding his marriage to Mary Daniels. It also posited that Fielding founded The Covent-Garden Journal to further the ambitions of politician and statesman George Lyttelton, with whom Fielding had recently formed a friendship; the source of this inference remains unclear, since Lyttelton received no particular mention in the first few numbers.|$|E
500|$|Wogan {{introduced}} the 1991 segment with [...] "The {{world as we}} know it is about to end". Amid laughter from the audience, Icke prevaricated when asked if {{he was the son of}} God, replying that Jesus would have been laughed at too, and repeating that Britain would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes. Without these, [...] "the Earth will cease to exist". When Icke said laughter was the best way to remove negativity, Wogan replied of the audience: [...] "But they're laughing <b>at</b> <b>you.</b> They're not laughing with you." ...|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "I send you, I look <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and jöluns wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself." [...] According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription [...] "seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon {{the recipient of the}} charm rather than the baleful valkyrie", and they posit the final line appears [...] "to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman".|$|E
