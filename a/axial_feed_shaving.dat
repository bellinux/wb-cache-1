Advances in FEA and FEM in recent years has enabled hydroform processes to be more widely engineered for varieties of parts and materials. Often FEM simulations must be performed in order to find a feasible process solution and to define the correct loading curves: pressure vs. time and <b>axial</b> <b>feed</b> vs. time. In the case of more complex tube hydroformed parts the tube must be pre-bent prior to loading into the hydroforming die. Bending is done sequentially {{along the length of the}} tube, with the tube being bent around bending discs (or dies) as the tube length is fed in. Bending can be done with or without mandrels. This additional complexity of process further increases the reliance on FEM for designing and evaluating manufacturing processes.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} dynamic {{process model}} has been developed to investigate features of the inherently transient hot radial forging process, taking account of complex process kinematics, thermo-elastoplastic material behaviour and microstructural evolution. As an input to this model, a fully systematic thermomechanical testing matrix was carried out on a Gleeble 3800 including temperature (20 - 1100 °C), strain (up to a true strain of 1) and strain rates (from 0. 1 to > 50 s- 1). The proposed model can accurately capture vibration characteristics due to the high frequency short strokes during radial forging, which {{have been found to}} have a strong effect on material flow, forging load. Numerical analyses were performed to investigate the effect of different axial spring stiffnesses on forging load, strain distribution in the workpiece, and maximum <b>axial</b> <b>feeding</b> rate. It has been found that forging load increases significantly with increasing stiffness of the axial spring. The axial spring stiffness was also found to have a strong effect on determination of <b>axial</b> <b>feeding</b> rate and reduction ratio of workpiece by limiting the axial vibration amplitude of workpiece under the maximum compression of spring coil to avoid hard stop of workpiece in the axial direction during forging.

Rocket & missile casing, rocket motor case, cartridge case, rocket nose cones are few examples of flow forming process. The nature of process is non linear with complex deformation behavior. There are mainly two strategies used during the process viz. forward and backward/reverse. In forward method, the direction of roller feed and material deformation is same and in reverse method, the direction of roller feed and material deformation is opposite. Usually there are three force components encountered during the process i. e. axial, radial and circumferential. The understanding and knowledge of forces are crucial for tooling design for various geometrical and material conditions. The online force measurement during the process is quite difficult in commercial machines. Therefore, a simulation model is developed to estimate forces during the process.

As a result, in practice, one has to manually choose processing modes which presents no {{solution to the problem of}} low productivity, as this method generates losses, particularly in relation to automated production intra grinding processing on CNC machines in series production. To solve this problem the research, primarily, proposes a methodology for the design of optimal multivariable stepwise cycles internal grinding processing, allowing to calculate as follows: optimal values of the radial flow at all stages of the cycle; the optimum value of the <b>axial</b> <b>feed</b> at all stages of the cycle; optimal allocation deduct allowance on the steps of the cycle for radial and <b>axial</b> <b>feeds,</b> which provide the minimum cycle time, given the technological constraints of the objective function. As a mathematical method of optimization of grinding cycles, applied dynamic programming method (DPM) is used. The application of the DPM is permissible due to the fact that this method does not require constructing an a priori bounds of the permissible restrictions and is not sensitive to the properties of management models and constraints. The optimality criterion is adopted, the minimum cycle time of grinding. The optimality criterion is adopted being the minimum cycle time of grinding. The use of DPM allows taking into account any number of technological limitations of the objective function (limitations on the accuracy and other quality indicators; performance properties of a circle; design parameters of the machine). The designed internal grinding cycles of processing are multi-dimensional and reflect the dependence interdependence speed axial flow, radial flow and amount of removed stock.
