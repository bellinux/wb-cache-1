50|$|Since a holon is {{embedded}} in larger wholes, it is <b>influenced</b> by <b>and</b> <b>influences</b> <b>these</b> larger wholes. <b>And</b> since a holon also contains subsystems, or parts, it is similarly <b>influenced</b> by <b>and</b> <b>influences</b> <b>these</b> parts. Information flows bidirectionally between smaller and larger systems as well as rhizomatic contagion. When this bidirectionality of information flow and understanding of role is compromised, for whatever reason, the system begins to break down: wholes no longer recognize their dependence on their subsidiary parts, and parts no longer recognize the organizing authority of the wholes. Cancer may be understood as such a breakdown in the biological realm.|$|R

As health-related behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol abuse, increased or became more resistant to change, so did the recognition that these behaviors are influenced by factors such as the media, politics, and businesses, which are outside the direct control of the individuals. Hence more [...] "ecological" [...] methods were needed to identify <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> <b>these</b> environmental and social determinants of health behaviors.

5000|$|Well-planned {{family home}} evenings {{can be a}} source of {{long-lasting}} joy <b>and</b> <b>influence.</b> <b>These</b> evenings are times for group activity, for organizing, for the expressions of love, for the bearing of testimony, for learning gospel principles, for family fun and recreation, and of all things, for family unity and solidarity. [...] Family home evenings should be scheduled once a week as a time for discussions of gospel principles, recreation, work projects, skits, songs around the piano, games, special refreshments, and family prayers. Like iron links in a chain, this practice will bind a family together, in love, pride, tradition, strength, and loyalty. [...] Monday evenings should be reserved for family home evening. Local leaders should ensure that Church buildings and facilities are closed, that no ward or stake activities are planned for Monday evenings, and that other interruptions to family home evenings be avoided. The primary emphasis of family home evening should be for families to be together to study the gospel. We remind all that the Lord has admonished parents to teach their children the gospel, to pray, and to observe the Sabbath Day. The scriptures are the most important resource for teaching the gospel.|$|E
5000|$|Why {{employees}} leave- By {{understanding the}} reasons behind why employees leave, organizations can better cater to their existing workforce <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> <b>these</b> decisions in the future. Oftentimes, it is low satisfaction and commitment that initiates the withdrawal process, which includes thoughts of quitting in search of more attractive alternatives. If administered correctly, exit interviews can provide a great resource to why employees leave. Typically, employees are stock in their responses because they fear being reprimanded or jeopardizing any potential future reference. [...] The most common reasons for why employees leave are better pay, better hours and better opportunity. These typical answers for leaving, often signal a much deeper issue that employers should investigate further into. By asking relevant questions and perhaps utilizing a neutral third party provider to conduct the interview, employers can obtain more accurate and quantifiable data. Contrary to what most organizations believe, employees often leave due to relationships with manager and/or treatment of employees and not compensation, as this is often a response that employees are uncomfortable expressing to their organization directly. [...] Retention Diagnostic is a rapid benchmarking process that identifies the costs and can help uncover what affects employee loyalty, performance and engagement.|$|E

30|$|Given the {{importance}} of parental behaviors (especially those of mothers) on children’s eating habits, {{it is important to}} understand this phenomenon not only by investigating family dietary practices, which have been studied extensively in recent years (Blissett & Fogel, 2013; Hart et al., 2010; Kröller et al., 2013), but also by focusing on parental perceptions and beliefs that support <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> <b>these</b> practices (behaviors and choices). In psychology, perception is more than just the reception of a stimulus. It is also comprised of the attribution of meaning to such stimuli, and its importance lies mainly in the fact that people’s behavior is based on their interpretation of reality and not necessarily of reality itself (Michner, Delamater, & Myers, 2005).|$|E
