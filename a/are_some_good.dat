Original host and executive consultant for Double Dare 2000 Marc Summers said that [...] "there were issues" [...] with the revival. In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, {{he said that he}} felt the length of the Triple Dare Challenge took away from the game and that [...] "if we would have done it the way we originally did it, we would have been fine, but unfortunately, it didn't happen".|$|E

Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get away from those kind of songs, but like I said before, those <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed to negative reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that the}} episode [...] "feels like an amalgamation of elements from prior holiday programs and never really elicits much humor. Christmas is commercialized and corporations use and abuse their customers? Those aren’t exactly rich insights, so [...] {{comes across as a}} below average episode." [...] In his review of the DVD Christmas With the Simpsons, Digitally Obsessed critic Joel Cunningham wrote that the episode [...] "comes from Season 11, well past the point when the series had sacrificed character for absurdist humor. Unless you don't think evil toy marketers, sentient Furbys, and Gary Coleman qualify. Anyway, after the school nearly goes bankrupt, Principal Skinner signs a contract with corporate backers who use the kids to conduct market research. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> gags, but the story doesn't hang together very well." [...] Adam Tyner of DVD Talk argued that the episode [...] "has a couple of good gags (Gary Coleman chatting on the phone being my favorite) but is quickly forgettable". Brian James of PopMatters described Coleman's cameo as [...] "hysterical" [...] in 2004, and Meghan Lewit of the same website listed [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] at number eight on her 2009 list of the [...] "10 best holiday themed TV episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club reviewed the episode positively, rating it a B. He considered the episode [...] "entertaining to watch" [...] with [...] "nifty direction from Tucker Gates", despite being formulaic {{and with the}} same problems he found in the previous episode penned by John Shiban, season three's [...] "Teso Dos Bichos". Handlen had much praise for the second half, which he noted was filled with dark humor, and featured a [...] "bizarre ending". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it a 2 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode is a disastrous combination of political commentary and stereotypical “Mexican soap opera” caricatures. Mulder and Scully {{have nothing to do}} with the resolution of the episode, and in fact, the writers fail to provide that resolution. There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> character moments, but they are too far and few between." [...] Author Keith Topping criticized the episode in his book X-Treme Possibilities, calling it an [...] "awful episode with a heavy-handed, clod-hopping attempt at social comment that hardly sits well with the themes on display in the rest of the episode." [...] He called it the worst episode of the fourth season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five and wrote that it was [...] "trying very hard to be clever". Despite this the two explained that [...] "if cleverness were only about intent, then we could all be geniuses". Shearman and Pearson derided the episode's use of social criticism, referring to it as [...] "rubbish [...] only works if it isn't underlined each time it's made." [...] Furthermore, the two criticized the story's [...] "Mexican soap opera" [...] style, noting that it drowned out the themes in [...] "unengaging melodrama". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She wrote that [...] "'El Mundo Gira' is so overloaded with ideas that it falls over and can't get up".|$|E
2500|$|Further {{frustrating}} fans, {{it seemed}} as though ABC had seemingly removed all references to McClain and Dixie from their official All My Children website earlier that month, which further outraged fans. To this, McClain responded, [...] "I really am only the actor. I don't think they will ever bring me back, especially if they have removed the Dixie CHARACTER bio from the website," [...] McClain relayed. [...] "It's over. It's all done. AMC is going to become something totally different than it once was. It will be all new, all different. Why? I can only conjecture." [...] Thinking of her fellow actors, she later urged viewers not to give up on the show: [...] "Do not stop watching All My Children," [...] McClain stated. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> actors on that show, the producers are trying new and innovative things, and the writers are trying out lots of concepts and ideas that you may ultimately find very entertaining." ...|$|E

A very gay {{cavalier}} {{with a broad}} bright battle-axe {{was pointed}} out to me as an eminent distiller, and another knight in the black coarse armour of a cuirassier of the 17th century stalked about as if he thought himself the very mirror of chivalry. He {{was the son of a}} celebrated upholsterer, so might claim the broad axe from more titles than one. There <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> dancing; Cluny Macpherson footed it gallantly.|$|R
60|$|It is so with Sammy Jay. Yes, Sir, {{it is so}} with Sammy Jay. You {{may think}} that because Sammy Jay is vain, a trouble-maker and a thief, he is all bad. He isn't. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> in Sammy Jay, just as there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> in everybody. If there wasn't, Old Mother Nature never, never would allow Sammy Jay to go his mischievous way through the Green Forest. He dearly loves to get other people into all kinds of trouble, {{and this is one}} reason why nobody loves him. But if you watch out sharp enough, you will find that hidden under that {{beautiful}} blue and white coat of his there really <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>good.</b> You may have to look a long time for it, but sooner or later you will find it. Johnny Chuck did.|$|R
2500|$|Captain Australia covered every Australian skipper (except for Ricky Ponting) since Test cricket began. Each chapter {{carried a}} mini-biography of the 41 leaders. Each {{reviewer}} {{seemed to have}} a chapter that stood out for them. For The Age, Melbourne ‘the most interesting’ was on the 34th captain, Ian Chappell, entitled Larrikin Leader, which notes cultural and political connections between Chappell, Bob Hawke, the advertising guru John Singleton, 1970s ‘ockerism,’ and the promotion of WSC (World Series Cricket, sponsored by Kerry Packer.) The Herald Sun Melbourne noted: [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> stories in Captain Australia... The chapter on Greg Chappell [...] gives wonderful insight into the genius of Sir Donald Bradman." [...] Cricket magazine Inside Edge wrote: [...] "The appeal of Captain Australia... will be the detail on captains most of us never saw such as Murdoch, Blackham, Armstrong, Woodfull and Richardson... It’s a valuable addition to our cricketing canon." [...] Robin Marlar wrote in The Cricketer International: [...] "Perry is a prolific, stylish writer... What lifted this book for me was the 24-page prologue on a fascinating character, Charles Lawrence, the immigrant from England who took on the embryonic Australian establishment and brought the first, if not quite the only team of Aboriginals to England in 1868." ...|$|E
2500|$|Time observed, [...] "Porgy and Bess {{is only a}} {{moderate}} and intermittent success as a musical show; {{as an attempt to}} produce a great work of cinematic art, it is a sometimes ponderous failure [...] [...] [...] On the stage the show has an intimate, itch-and-scratch-it folksiness that makes even the dull spots endearing. On the colossal Todd-AO screen, Catfish Row covers a territory that looks almost as big as a football field, and the action often feels about as intimate as a line play seen from the second tier. What the actors are saying or singing comes blaring out of a dozen stereophonic loudspeakers in such volume that the spectator almost continually feels trapped {{in the middle of a}} cheering section. The worst thing about Goldwyn's Porgy, though, is its cinematic monotony. The film is not so much a motion picture as a photographed opera [...] [...] [...] Still, there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> things about the show. Sammy Davis Jr., looking like an absurd Harlemization of Chico Marx, makes a wonderfully silly stinker out of Sportin' Life. The singing is generally good — particularly the comic bits by Pearl Bailey and the ballads by Adele Addison [...] [...] [...] And the color photography gains a remarkable lushness through the use of filters, though in time [...] [...] [...] the spectator may get tired of the sensation that he is watching the picture through amber-colored sunglasses." ...|$|E
