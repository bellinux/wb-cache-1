5|$|However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul {{basketball}} coach Ray Meyer, who saw {{potential in the}} bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy, freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, {{because at the time}} it was believed that tall players were too <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> ever play basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.|$|E
5|$|Ice {{was also}} transported by {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the {{first use of}} the technique being on the track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company. A special railroad car was built to insulate the ice and equipment designed to allow the cars to be loaded. In 1842 a new railroad to Fitchburg was used to access the ice at Walden Pond. Ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> transport. By the 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across the North American continent.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover {{does not have to be}} <b>awkward.</b> <b>To</b> refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better.|$|E

5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and anti-armour weapon. However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy and <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> manhandle, particularly over rough ground and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high curved trajectory, making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for training, a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, {{married the}} couple on 10 March 1863 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The choice of venue was criticised widely. As the {{ceremony}} took place outside London, the press complained that large public crowds {{would not be}} able to view the spectacle. Prospective guests thought it <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> get to and, as the venue was small, some people who had expected invitations were disappointed. The Danes were dismayed because only Alexandra's closest relations were invited. The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac or mauve. As the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College, including Lord Randolph Churchill.|$|E

5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first Bleach {{character}} he introduced, was {{originally intended to}} be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having dark hair and softer eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing the glasses. During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time. In later chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. According to Kubo, Ichigo, along with Orihime Inoue, are the most arduous characters to sketch. While illustrating one of Ichigo's scenes, Kubo found it <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> draw him with a cheerful smile.|$|E
25|$|Nude female {{swimming}} was {{not allowed}} in most schools, both for modesty reasons and {{because it would be}} <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> accommodate menstruating girls. The Detroit public schools briefly allowed nude female swimming in 1947; this policy was revoked after three weeks due to protests from parents.|$|E

25|$|The {{hospital}} was particularly busy during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) which, when {{the project was}} further encouraged by Queen Victoria, provided the impetus for extending the railway line. The extension terminated at a station behind the hospital but was <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> operate, having gradients which were steep for the locomotives of the time. Some trains needed a locomotive at each end to travel that 3/4 of a mile.|$|E
25|$|Gunpowder as a gun {{propellant}} {{suffered from}} several weaknesses inherent to its composition. It {{was subject to}} passivation by moisture and was <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> load and ignite in a weapon. Sulfur oxides and moisture produced corrosion on metal gun components and the smoke gave away {{the position of the}} shooter. The development of cartridges and explosive primers were a major improvement in the use of gunpowders in the field.|$|E
25|$|The fixed diamond can be {{replaced}} with a switched diamond, which eliminates the gap in rails at the K-crossing, which allows a higher speed if the geometry is poor. However, switched diamonds are not a perfect solution to the K-crossing problem, as the switches are very coarse compared to the finer switches of a turnout, and require high maintenance. The additional ends are also <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> control unless power operated point machines are used.|$|E

25|$|However, the Unicode hyphen is <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> {{enter on}} most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus {{character}} remains very common. They {{are often used}} instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key, unmemorable keyboard shortcuts), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash in ASCII text.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} echinoid fossils date to {{the upper}} part of the Ordovician period (circa 450 Mya), and the taxon has survived to the present as a successful and diverse group of organisms. Spines may be present in well-preserved specimens, but usually only the test remains. Isolated spines are common as fossils. Some echinoids (such as Tylocidaris clavigera, from the Cretaceous period's English Chalk Formation) had very heavy, club-shaped spines that would be difficult for an attacking predator to break through and make the echinoid <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> handle. Such spines simplify walking on the soft sea floor.|$|E
25|$|Euclid's {{presentation}} was {{limited by the}} mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles, the number 1 was sometimes treated separately from other positive integers, and as multiplication was treated geometrically he {{did not use the}} product of more than 3 different numbers. The geometrical treatment of number theory may have been because the alternative would have been the extremely awkward Alexandrian system of numerals.|$|E

25|$|He {{was known}} for his {{determination}} to achieve goals that were seemingly beyond his reach. As a child, he wanted to join the baseball team that would win the Utah territorial championship, but others believed him to be too physically <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> be successful. In response, he purchased a baseball and practiced throwing the ball for hours against his barn to improve. The team he joined later won the championship. In similar fashion, Grant expressed a desire to be a successful bookkeeper although many of his associates criticized his penmanship. He practiced his writing to the point that he was invited to teach penmanship at one of the local academies.|$|E
25|$|This {{method has}} gained {{influence}} within North America, as most common computer filesystems make {{the use of}} slashes difficult or impossible. DOS, OS/2 and Windows simultaneously support both \ and / as directory separators, but / {{is also used to}} introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in DOS). Unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and, while \ is legal in filenames, it is <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> use as the shell uses it as an escape character. Unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches. Apart from the separator used the non-year form of the date format is also identical to the standard American representation.|$|E
25|$|If in {{fact there}} was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and <b>awkward</b> <b>to</b> turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.|$|E
