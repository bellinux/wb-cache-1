5000|$|After having {{returned}} to Battery Wharf, Adelante got underway for Portland, Maine, {{the following day}} and arrived at Portland an hour before midnight. The following morning, she moved to Damariscove Island where she helped to establish one {{of a network of}} <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> stations along the Maine coast. Such a system had originally been installed during the war to detect enemy submarines operating off the coast, to [...] "home in" [...] on their radio transmissions and to determine their direction and distance. Wartime experience with those stations showed that the concept held great promise for peacetime use. As Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels reported in 1919, [...] "The system of <b>radio</b> <b>compasses</b> on shore ... proved such a useful aid to navigation that during the past year additional stations have been constructed." ...|$|R
5|$|Two-seat trainer version. Armament {{reduced to}} a single 20mm gun and the oil cooler was {{relocated}} underneath the engine cowling. Fitted with a <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> and gun camera.

WHBY's studios and transmitters are located on College Avenue in Appleton.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} flight {{date was}} postponed to 1935 because modifications {{were needed to}} strengthen the aircraft's structure due to the installation of extra fuel tanks and a more powerful engine. New equipment was added, which Darius and Girėnas did not have, such as a variable-pitch propeller to improve engine performance and a <b>radio</b> <b>compass.</b> Lituanica II was test-flown extensively to ensure its success.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{vehicles}} {{are used by}} Doc Savage during Death in Silver. From his hidden garage, he drives an [...] "expensive but unostentacious blue roadster", carrying a radio tracking device and <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> (as well as an automatic transmission and almost silent engine), and an armoured truck disguised as a [...] "shabby laundry truck" [...] complete with fake engine noise and artificially bad suspension.|$|R
5000|$|... 13 November 1943: Lieutenant E. M. Jones and {{his crew}} were forced to ditch at sea after their <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> failed. Jones had taken the wrong bearing until too much fuel had been {{consumed}} to make landfall. After the squadron searched the area for six days, hope was given up of ﬁnding the crew. Finally, on the seventh day, the crew drifted ashore and was saved.|$|R

5000|$|Frederick A. Kolster (January 13, 1883 - 1950) was Swiss-born United States {{electrical}} engineer and inventor. [...] He {{worked at the}} National Bureau of Standards from 1911 to 1921. While at the NBS, he pioneered a number of developments in radio signal detection and <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> work, including the Kolster Decremeter. In 1913, he convinced the Bureau of Lighthouses to install radio beacons at all important lighthouses and light ships. Kolster also patented in 1915 a radio direction finder, used in the subsequent World War I by U.S. destroyers at sea to locate German submarines. In 1921, he left the National Bureau of Standards to join the Federal Telegraph Company as chief research engineer, {{as part of the}} company's bid to commercialize the <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> technology to ships. Products manufactured under his research name came under the Federal-Brandes name (after November 1926). The commercial efforts failed, however, and the subsidiary of Federal Telegraph was spun off in April 1928, when the name was changed to Kolster Radio Corporation and a new stock offering was issued. The new company continued until dissolution in 1931.|$|R
50|$|The SCR-277 {{was used}} as a {{navigation}} aid. It included the BC-467 transmitter with an RF output power of 800 watts, the BC-468 Goniometer, and BC-342 receiver. Frequencies utilized were 200-400 KHz for transmission and 1.5-18 MHz for reception. Radio range homing equipment transmitted tone identification signals to aircraft that lacked a <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> but were equipped with command sets. Range was approximately 300 miles. It was powered by a single PE-90 generator.|$|R
500|$|McKenzie told a {{journalist}} that, after the war, [...] "All the airmen {{came back and}} wanted to join Qantas, but they needed to build up their Morse speed and learn to use the modern equipment." [...] The Department of Civil Aviation fitted out {{a room at the}} school with transmitters, receivers and <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> so that pilots could train for their wireless ticket at the school. From 1948, McKenzie held a First Class Flight Radio Telephony Operator License.|$|R
2500|$|At sunset, Maitland {{climbed the}} Bird of Paradise to an {{altitude}} of [...] to place it above the clouds, where Hegenberger could frequently check their position by star sightings. At 1:00a.m. Hegenberger made another attempt to acquire a <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> reading {{and picked up the}} signal from the Maui transmitter. He found that the Bird of Paradise was south (left) of its course, instead of north (right) as they had thought. The Maui signal guided them for forty minutes before cutting out entirely.|$|R
50|$|Breck {{served with}} the Atlantic Fleet, {{attached}} to Destroyer Squadron 1 and for six months operated in the Caribbean area. From 15 July 1920 until June 1921 she was at Newport, Rhode Island, in reserve commission, having only limited duty training Naval Reserves on the Atlantic coast. In June 1921 she rejoined the Destroyer Force and participated in scheduled drills and exercises along the Atlantic coast {{and for a time}} had special duty in connection with the calibration of coastal <b>Radio</b> <b>Compass</b> Stations.|$|R
50|$|Crewed by four or five, the BR.20's two pilots sat side by {{side with}} the engineer/radio operator/gunner behind. The radio operator's {{equipment}} included a R.A. 350-I radio-transmitter, A.R.5 receiver and P.3N <b>radio</b> <b>compass.</b> The navigator/bomb-aimer had a station in the nose equipped with bombsights and a vertical camera. Another two or three crew members occupied the nose and the mid-fuselage, as radio-operator, navigator and gunners. The radio operator was also the ventral gunner while the last crew member was the dorsal gunner.|$|R
5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} {{despatching}} personnel {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with <b>radios,</b> <b>compasses</b> and speed indicators. British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|R
500|$|The {{navigation}} and bombing system (NBS) comprised an H2S Mk9 radar and a navigation bombing computer (NBC) Mk1.

50|$|Doyen was recommissioned 26 September 1923 {{and resumed}} a {{schedule}} of training and tactical exercises along the west coast, in the Panama Canal Zone, and the Hawaiian Islands. She sailed from San Diego 20 August to escort HIJMS Tama and to provide <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> and communication for a nonstop west coast-to-Hawaii flight. Exercises were again conducted in the Canal Zone and the Caribbean in 1926, and later that year Doyen cruised to Bremerton, Washington for overhaul and to Ketchikan, Alaska, and Duncan Bay, British Columbia, for visits.|$|R

5000|$|... 27 August 1944: Lieutenant (jg) C. W. Bleicher and {{his crew}} were {{returning}} from a patrol and lost their bearings while en route to base due to <b>radio</b> <b>compass</b> failure. With {{only a few minutes}} of fuel left, the pilot set the Ventura down in shallow water off the beach approximately 70 mi south of Fortaleza, Brazil. Only one crew member was injured in the crash and all exited the aircraft safely. An Army B-25 spotted the wreckage 10 minutes later and the crew was eventually rescued.|$|R
2500|$|The other {{possibility}} of mistaken location {{was supported by}} statements of other Aero O/Y pilots who claimed that the radio transmitter beacon [...] "Locator S" [...] had given wrong readings to the airplane <b>radio</b> <b>compass.</b> This wrong reading may have given an impression that the airplane has passed the beacon earlier {{than it did in}} reality. However, the investigation board had stated it was unlikely as Flight 217 flew very close to the beacon which meant the signal must have been strong and that the likely reason was the pilots' misconception of the altitude instead.|$|R
50|$|The US Navy {{acquired}} 8.4 {{acres of}} the Reservation from the US Government and by 1936 the Navy was operating a <b>Radio</b> <b>Compass</b> Station at Jupiter {{as an aid to}} navigation. The station broadcast weather information and monitored distress signals as well as naval ship-to-shore and aircraft frequencies. On July 1, 1939 all US lighthouses became the responsibility of the US Coast Guard. In the same year, the US Navy established an Intelligence Listening Post at the Naval Radio Station and constructed the barracks building for naval personnel and their families.|$|R
