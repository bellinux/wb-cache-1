5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. <b>A</b> <b>batter</b> against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. <b>A</b> <b>batter</b> against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (<b>A</b> <b>batter</b> may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its {{first few years of}} existence.|$|E

40|$|Using data {{collected}} from 271 women participating in <b>a</b> <b>battered</b> women’s program, this study examines whether pornography use increases the probability that <b>a</b> <b>battered</b> woman will be sexually abused by her partner. The analysis also examines whether indi-vidual and certain disinhibitory factors, such as alcohol use, mediate or exacerbate the effects of pornography on sexual violence. Results of a logistic regression indicate that pornography use significantly increases <b>a</b> <b>battered</b> woman’s odds of being sexually abused. Compared to batterers who do not use pornography and alcohol, the combination of alcohol and pornography does increase the odds of sexual abuse...|$|R

5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (<b>A</b> <b>batter,</b> particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E

5|$|The ground out: {{recorded}} against <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> (in this case, batter-runner) who hits a {{ball that}} lands in fair territory which, before the batter-runner can reach first base, is retrieved by a fielder who touches first base while holding the ball or relays {{it to another}} fielder who touches first base while holding the ball.|$|E
5|$|When <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> {{attempts}} {{a sacrifice}} bunt {{and the resulting}} bunt is so well-placed that he safely reaches first base, the official scorer may elect to credit the batter with a hit instead of a sacrifice {{if there is no}} error on the play and an ordinary effort by the defense would not have recorded an out.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). <b>A</b> <b>batter</b> with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E

5|$|Deep-fried {{butter is}} a snack food {{comprising}} butter that is coated with <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> or breading and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa; {{and now it}} is served worldwide. It has a significant buttery flavor, which has been compared to that of French toast. Fried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rules}} of baseball, aside from the rare case of {{interference}} or obstruction, <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> who puts a ball into play and safely reaches first base is ruled to have reached {{in one of three}} possible ways: a hit, an error, or by fielder's choice. Fielder's choice is primarily discussed in rules 10.05 and 10.06, and it generally occurs when it is judged that a batter-runner would have been put out had the defense chosen to do so.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, Howard's home run {{following}} a walk issued to Utley brought {{the game to}} 7–3. After Ibáñez hit a double into right field, Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte, allowing no further runs in the inning. In {{the top of the}} eighth inning, Dámaso Marte struck out Howard, which set a new World Series record for most strikeouts by <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> in a single series (13). After the strikeout, Marte was relieved by Rivera in a non-save situation, who allowed one hit and one walk before closing out the game and the Yankees' 27th championship.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{defeated}} the Phillies, four games to two, {{to win the}} franchise's record 27th World Series championship. The Yankees had home field advantage for the series, due to an American League victory in the 2009 All-Star Game. In addition to the 27th championship for New York, several records were tied, extended, or broken during the Series, including postseason wins (Andy Pettitte with 18), home runs in a World Series (Utley with 5), strikeouts by <b>a</b> <b>batter</b> in a World Series (Howard with 13), World Series saves (Mariano Rivera with 11), and RBI in a single World Series game (Hideki Matsui with 6).|$|E

Young did not get his first perfect game or first no-hitter, but he did end up with the first complete game of his career after 114 starts. Two starts later he hit his first home run as a major league batter.|$|E
