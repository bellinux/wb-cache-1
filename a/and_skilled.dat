40|$|Processes {{of taking}} a gap- � lling test: {{comparison}} of <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> EFL readers Junko Yamashita Nagoya University, Japan The present study investigates how <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> readers answered a gap- � lling (or rational deletion cloze) test {{in order to examine}} whether such tests can measure text-level processing ability. Twelve Japanese EFL students (six <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> six less <b>skilled</b> readers) completed a gap- � lling test while thinking aloud about their test-taking processes. Their verbal protocols were categorized according to the classi � cation of cloze item types developed by Bachman (1985). Results showed that both <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> readers used text-level information more frequently than other types of information. The skilled readers, however, used text-level information more frequently than the less skilled readers. Qualitative analysis of the protocols revealed further differences in the use of different types of information between the groups. Although there were several cases where the items were answered correctly with local grammatical clues and extra-textual background knowledge, overall, the gap- � lling test generated textlevel processing and differentiated well between <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> readers. The present study, therefore, supports the claim that a gap- � lling test {{can be used as a}} test to measure higher order processing ability. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{described}} the way teachers used questions with <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> readers during reading instruction. The cognitive level {{and functions of}} questions were analyzed based on data collected through direct observation within the natural environment of the classroom. In addition, the patterns of questioning which included wait-time and sequencing of questions were identified and reported. Twenty sixth grade teachers randomly selected from a metropolitan school district were observed while instructing <b>skilled</b> readers <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> readers. Data collected during non-participatory observation of reading instruction through audiotape recordings, a low-inference observation instrument, and field notes were analyzed using the chisquare statistic, log-linear analysis, and descriptive statistics. Each question/response/response loop which occurred during the eighty observations was analyzed as to the cognitive level and function of the question, designation and wait-time of the student's response, the appropriateness, type, and length of the student's response, {{and the content of}} the teacher's response. Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions have been formulated. 1. Teachers use different cognitive levels of questions for particular functions as dictated by the specific needs and characteristics {{of the students in the}} skill level. 2. Although teachers ask the majority of questions at the cognitive-memory and convergent levels rather than the higher divergent and evaluative levels among both <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> readers, the primary function is that of extending. It appears that teachers use questions as a way of encouraging student participation during reading instruction. 3. Among both <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> readers, teachers practice a fast pace approach to questioning, waiting an average of one to two seconds for a response. 4. Paths of sequence for question/response/response loops are similar for both <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> less <b>skilled</b> reading groups. The function of extending typically followed focusing and clarifying, demonstrating the teacher's apparent effort to include as many students as possible during instruction...|$|R

Substitution possibilities between differently qualified employees are investigated at the establishment level. The derived substitutional relationships within the blue-collar workers were {{very similar to those}} within the white collar workers. <b>Skilled</b> employees <b>and,</b> to a lesser extent, highly skilled employees are substitutes for the unskilled. This could at least partly explain the rise in unemployment amongst the unskilled.

The frequently cited results that the own-wage demand elasticity decreases with skill, can be confirmed between <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> highly <b>skilled</b> employees, but not between <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> unskilled employees. The elasticities of substitution between blue collar and white collar workers are relatively low; unskilled, <b>skilled</b> <b>and</b> highly <b>skilled</b> blue collar workers are found to be complements to the analogue group of white-collar workers.
