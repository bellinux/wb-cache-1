5|$|The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is an all-breeds {{conformation}} show. It {{has been}} held in New York City, New York annually since 1877. It was held at Madison Square Garden {{for the first time}} in 1880, and is currently held in the modern arena of the same name. Dogs are first placed in breed specific classes for Best of Breed, with the winners moving on to the respective breed group. Winners from each group then compete for the title of Best in Show. In each class, the individual dogs <b>are</b> <b>judged</b> against the breed standard of each dog breed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes <b>are</b> <b>judged</b> on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E
5000|$|But farther, this question, (Who shall <b>be</b> <b>judge?)</b> cannot mean, {{that there}} <b>is</b> no <b>judge</b> at all: for {{where there is}} no {{judicature}} on earth, to decide controversies amongst men, God in heaven <b>is</b> <b>judge.</b> He alone, it <b>is</b> true, <b>is</b> <b>judge</b> of the right. But every man <b>is</b> <b>judge</b> for himself, as in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him, and whether he should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as Jeptha did.|$|R

5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial closure (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → fricative → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both fricative and approximant; affricates may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells <b>are</b> <b>judged</b> to be implausible.|$|E
5|$|The Calcutta High Court is {{the oldest}} High Court in the country, {{established}} on 2 July 1862. High Courts that handle {{a large number of}} cases of a particular region have permanent benches established there. Benches are also present in states which come under the jurisdiction of a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit benches established. Circuit benches (known as circuit courts {{in some parts of the}} world) are temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period <b>are</b> <b>judged</b> when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bengaluru-based NGO Daksh on 21 high courts in collaboration with Ministry of Law and Justice (India) in March 2016, it was found that average pendency of a case in High courts in India is 3 years.|$|E
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death where they <b>are</b> <b>judged.</b> However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared {{the justice of}} Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E
40|$|Can’t one truly <b>judge</b> {{that one}} <b>is</b> <b>judging?</b> Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: One cannot truly <b>judge</b> that one <b>is</b> <b>judging.</b> After briefly criticizing his account of one’s awareness that one <b>is</b> <b>judging,</b> I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly <b>judging</b> that one <b>is</b> <b>judging.</b> Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief that one is believing that p despite not believing that p, one’s non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> now <b>judging</b> that p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p, one has a non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R

5|$|The senior project {{consists}} of four main P's project, paper, portfolio and presentation. The {{students are required to}} work on a project outside of class that takes at least 15 hours of their time. This project can be anything. Their paper then has to relate in some way to their project, so if the project is creating a bird house the paper could be able the best type of bird house. The portfolio then brings everything together with evidence to prove that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together. All the projects <b>are</b> <b>judged</b> throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E

5000|$|Stevens's main {{assertion}} {{was that}} using magnitude estimations/productions respondents {{were able to}} make judgements on a ratio scale (i.e., if x and y are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant k such that x = ky). In the context of axiomatic psychophysics, [...] formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions p and q, and three stimuli, x, y, z, if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times y, then t = pq times x should be equal to z. This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected ( [...] , [...] ). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, [...] formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times y, and if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times y, then z should equal z.
