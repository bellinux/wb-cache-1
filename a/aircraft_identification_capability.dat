5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on {{the location of the}} Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all {{but a few of the}} U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks, Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{flagship}} for the RCN, Uganda {{served in the}} Pacific War with the British Pacific Fleet joining the British Pacific Fleet at Sydney, Australia in February 1945. Assigned to Task Force 57, British Pacific Fleet because her radar and <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification</b> <b>capabilities</b> were amongst {{the best in the}} fleet, owing to her 1944 refit in Charleston. On 10 April 1945, the strike against Sakishima Gunto was cancelled and the task force was ordered to attack Formosa instead. From 11-13 April 1945, Uganda, as part of Task Force 57 in the Pacific, she attacked airfields and installations in northern Formosa, before being redirected back to Sakishima Gunto. The cruiser took part in the bombardment of the Japanese airbases on Sakishima Gunto between 15-20 April before the fleet was tasked to Leyte Gulf. During her time with Task Force 57, Uganda came under kamikaze attack. [...] She received battle honours for operations during the Battle of Okinawa and was involved in attacking Truk, Formosa and Sakishima Gunto.|$|R

50|$|A {{key feature}} of this {{interface}} is to produce top quality EI spectra from compounds dissolved in a liquid phase. In this case, quality is intended {{as a measure of}} the degree of success in a virtual comparison with thousands of spectra stored in the electronic libraries. <b>Identification</b> <b>capability</b> in real-world applications, when peaks are small and noise is high, can be greatly influenced by the quality of ionization. A NIST library version 2.0d was used for comparison. In this case, <b>identification</b> <b>capability</b> is not compromised by the presence of solvent vapor residues and matching quality tops that of a typical GC-MS system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A video <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification</b> algorithm, {{based on}} the tail number recognition, is {{proposed}} {{as a part of}} a global airport surveillance video system. The recognition procedure searches and detects the presence of the tail number in the image and then recognises the tail number using pattern matching techniques. The identification system has been designed to deal with airport real images, taking into account letter sizes differences and potential deformations. Finally, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>identification</b> system calculates the joint probability of each tail number in the airport database. The tail number maximising the joint probability is selected. Results show that the identification procedure achieves a robust identification using the database...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the sensitivities {{of static}} and dynamic {{parameters}} to damage occurring in plate-like structures are investigated systematically, and corresponding damage indices are proposed to analyse their <b>identification</b> <b>capabilities.</b> For static analyses, damage indices are formulated using the out-of-plane deflection, and its slope and curvature {{based on a}} finite element model; for dynamic analyses, two damage indices related to the curvature mode shape (CMS) and the strain frequency response function (SFRF) are proposed. Compared with the existing results, {{the effects of the}} numbers of the selected modes and defective areas on the CMS index and the influence of the "natural frequency shift" on the SFRF index are investigated. Numerical simulations and experimental tests are performed to verify the <b>identification</b> <b>capability</b> of the proposed indices, and guidance on selecting the proper parameters for damage detection is given.
