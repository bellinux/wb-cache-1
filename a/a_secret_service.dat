5|$|The plot only {{lasted a}} few months. On 24 July 1915, Heinrich Albert's briefcase, {{containing}} {{details about the}} phenol plot, was recovered by <b>a</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> agent. Although the activities were not illegal—since the United States was still officially neutral and still trading with Germany—the documents were soon leaked to the New York World, an anti-German newspaper. The World published an exposé on 15 August 1915. The public pressure soon forced Schweitzer and Edison to end the phenol deal—with the embarrassed Edison subsequently sending his excess phenol to the U.S. military—but {{by that time the}} deal had netted the plotters over two million dollars and there was already enough phenol to keep Bayer's Aspirin plant running. Bayer's reputation took a large hit, however, just as the company was preparing to launch an advertising campaign to secure the connection between aspirin and the Bayer brand.|$|E
