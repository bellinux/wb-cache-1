50|$|A person chooses, or {{realizes that}} they are destined to become <b>a</b> <b>curer</b> by “signs” that curing is one’s destiny.

The person will then enter rigorous training and apprenticeship with <b>an</b> accomplished <b>curer</b> in the community, from which many don’t graduate. The process is a complicated and arduous one, in which the master imparts knowledge on the student in exchange for gifts over six or seven years. The training, in all, consists of the learning of chants, altar construction, making suitable offerings to the spirits depending on the situation and knowledge of plants and their uses. Once a student has completed the training, they then must start their own practice and develop a loyal clientele, as daunting a task as completing the training.
