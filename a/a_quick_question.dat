You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, our fireman {{with the}} epaulettes, who was foreman of that district, went about like a general in action, {{watching}} the flames sternly,--giving a quiet order to one, indicating {{a point of}} vantage to another, giving a helping hand here and there with the hose, answering <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>question</b> promptly, and doing his utmost to dispose his force {{in such a way}} as to quell the raging fire. All this time he moved about among smoke and flames and falling materials as if he bore a charmed life--which, indeed, he did: for, as he afterwards said himself, the hand of God shielded him, and nothing on earth could kill him till his work on earth was done; and nothing on earth could save him when his time to die should come. This sentiment was, partly at least, the secret of the fireman's cool courage in the midst of danger.|$|E

Mrs. Farrinder, who was decidedly a woman of the world, came to his assistance, or to Miss Chancellor's, and said she hoped very much Olive wouldn't stay--she felt these things too much.

40|$|In many low-income countries, where {{computer}} {{ownership and}} home and business internet access is rare, public access venues, {{especially in the}} form of business-operated cybercafés, are how most people access computers and the internet. This form of public access is often viewed as having been born of economic necessity and considered to be a second-best alternative when compared to private, individualized access. In this study, we interrogate this assumption, finding that public access can support forms of collaboration and knowledge sharing that enhance learning and productivity and offer rich opportunities for interaction and co-work. In this way, public shared access is not necessarily second-best to private, individualized connection, but may, in some contexts, be a preferred access method. In order to better understand the forms of collaborative co-present sharing in cybercafés, as well as the advantages and disadvantages associated with this sharing, we conducted a survey of users in two cybercafés in Accra, Ghana. Survey results reveal that public access enables forms of sharing and collaboration among patrons that range from the most simplistic (such as asking a café employee <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>question),</b> to the more formalized (such as meeting business partners and working together around a single computer), to the fleeting and voyeuristic (such as glancing at a stranger’s computer screen and noticing an interesting website). Contrary to the belief that resource constraints drive public shared access, the participants surveyed who do share computers highlighted the learning benefits of working together much more frequently than the economic grounds for sharing. Following these surveys, we designed a system to promote opportunities for co-located sharing and collaboration between users at an internet café. ...|$|E
40|$|Even though {{access to}} water has been {{recognized}} as a human right and is important for human development, still in the year 2008 about 884 million people lacked access to improved water sources. Most of these people live in the developing regions of the world. This study will be focusing on an area in west Showa zone in Ethiopia. The purpose is to study the status of water security for households in Chitu, its surrounding areas and Mete Walga kebele. The point of departure is the analytical framework of the Millennium Development Goals, Howard and Bartram’s water service level and the Rapid Assessment of Drinking Water Quality method for sanitary risk inspections. This offers a framework when examining the water security in the studied area. By combining both quantitative and qualitative methods the study aims at providing a deeper knowledge about the water situation. Water sampling, GPS mapping, sanitary risk inspections, <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>question</b> survey and semi-structured interviews are all methods used. The findings show that the study area has a basic access (i. e. consumption should be assured) to water according to Howard and Bartram’s service level in relation to time spent on walking to the water source. With regards to the quantities of water used the people using Meti well have no access according to Howard and Bartram´s service level. Five improved water sources were located in Chitu and three improved water sources were located in the rural area. One unimproved water source was identified and studied. At {{the time of the}} study there was no water quality problems in the area that could cause any health problems when the water was consumed by the population. However there can be a water quality problem during the rainy season. It was the water sources in the rural areas that had the highest sanitary risk scores. In relation to the Millennium Development Goal seven to “halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe water and basic sanitation” and how it is measured it is apparent that more aspects needs to be included when defining water access e. g. water quality and water quantities per capita a day. If the access to drinking water should be sustainable and safe in the long run, more than just the distance to an improved water source is important. This study has also showed that an improved water source can have water quality problems and an unimproved source might not have water quality problems...|$|E
