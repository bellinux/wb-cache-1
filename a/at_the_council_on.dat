25|$|Between June and July 2011, Pakistan Chitral Scouts {{and local}} defence militias {{suffered}} deadly cross border raids. In response the Pakistani military reportedly shelled some Afghan villages in Afghanistan's Nuristan, Kunar, Nangarhar, and Khost provinces {{resulting in a}} number of Afghan civilians being killed. Afghan sources claimed that nearly 800 rounds of missiles were fired from Pakistan, hitting civilian targets inside Afghanistan. The reports claimed that attacks by Pakistan resulted in the deaths of 42 Afghan civilians, including children, wounded many others and destroyed 120 homes. Although Pakistan claims it was an accident and just routine anti Taliban operations, some analysts believe {{that it could have been}} a show of strength by Islamabad. For example, a senior official <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>on</b> Foreign Relations explained that because the shelling was of large scale it is more likely to be a warning from Pakistan than an accident.|$|E

2500|$|A Financial Times interviewer, Emily Stokes, {{wrote in}} 2013 that Silvers viewed editing as [...] "an instinct. You must choose writers carefully, having {{read all of}} their work, rather than being swayed by 'reputations that are, shall we say, overpromoted', and then {{anticipate}} their needs, sending them books and news articles" [...] while seeking greater clarity, comprehensiveness and freshness in the writing. Stokes commented that Silvers [...] "radiates a genial warmth [...] {{it is part of}} the editor's role ... not to be swayed by friendships with authors but to let reviewers express their genuine views." [...] Silvers described some of the diplomatic aspects of the job: [...] "The act of reviewing can have a deep emotional effect. People get hurt and upset. You have to be aware of that, but you can't flinch. [...] sometimes. You say, 'No, I'm terribly sorry, I can't visualise that in the paper. I don't think it's adequate to the subject.'" [...] James Atlas wrote of a typical day for Silvers: [...] "In the late afternoon, he'd rush out to a lecture <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>on</b> Foreign Relations, show up at a dinner party, and then head back to the office to deal with the next breaking crisis." [...] His New York Times obituary noted: [...] "Silvers brought to [...] a self-effacing, almost priestly sense of devotion. ... loath to grant interviews. ... He arrived at the office early and left late, if at all, to the kind of heavyweight cocktail party that was, for him, a happy hunting ground for writers and ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|For drone strikes to be effective, the United States must obtain consent {{from the}} host country they are {{operating}} in. The growing chorus of objections from host countries, most notably emanating from Pakistan, seriously inhibits drones’ effectiveness. [...] "Host states have grown frustrated with U.S. drone policy, while opposition by non-host partners could impose additional restrictions {{on the use of}} drones. Reforming U.S. drone strike policies can do much to allay concerns internationally by ensuring that targeted killings are defensible under international legal regimes that the United States itself helped establish and by allowing U.S. officials to openly address concerns and counter misinformation." [...] Micah Zenko <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>on</b> Foreign Relations believes the United States should [...] "end so-called signature strikes, which target unidentified militants based on their behavior patterns and personal networks, and limit targeted killings to a small number of specific terrorists with transnational ambitions. He wants more congressional oversight of drone strikes and stricter regulation on armed drone sales. Finally, he recommends the United States work with international partners to establish rules and norms governing the use of drones. Zenko believes the U.S. government has not been transparent regarding how non-battlefield drone strikes are reconciled with broader foreign policy objectives, the scope of legitimate targets, and their legal framework. While drones may be a critical counterterrorism tool that advances U.S. interests, their [...] "lack of transparency threatens to limit U.S. freedom of action and risks proliferation of armed drone technology without the requisite normative framework." [...] Zenko thinks current drone policy might share the same fate of the Bush-era enhanced interrogation techniques and warrantless wiretapping, both of which were unpopular, illegal and ultimately ended.|$|E

2500|$|Matthew Kroenig, Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>on</b> Foreign Relations, and Special Adviser in the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense from July 2010 to July 2011, {{argues that}} skeptics of {{military}} action fail to appreciate the threats posed by a nuclear Iran. If managed carefully, Kroenig believes that a surgical military strike targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities [...] "could spare {{the region and the}} world a very real threat and dramatically improve the long-term national security of the United States." [...] A nuclear-armed Iran would not only limit U.S. leverage in the Middle East, but Iran's rivals like Saudi Arabia would probably seek nuclear weapons and subsequently spark an arms race. Once Iran had a nuclear device, Tehran could [...] "choose to spur proliferation by transferring nuclear technology to its allies—other countries and terrorist groups alike" [...] in order to contain its regional rivals. In the midst of a global economic downturn, Kroenig believes that containing a nuclear-armed Iran would be a massive financial, political, and military burden for the United States. A surgical strike would be less costly. Kroenig notes that airstrike skeptics are concerned that military planners will not know the location of some key facilities. Kroenig thinks this concern is overblown: [...] "U.S. intelligence agencies, the IAEA, and opposition groups within Iran have provided timely warning of Tehran's nuclear activities in the past—exposing, for example, Iran's secret construction at Natanz and Qom before those facilities ever became operational." [...] In other words, Kroenig believes there is a high chance of Washington catching Iran before the latter hypothetically brings a nuclear facility online. To mitigate the global economic fallout from a military strike, Washington could [...] "offset any disruption of oil supplies by opening its Strategic Petroleum Reserve and quietly encouraging some Gulf states to increase their production {{in the run-up to the}} attack." [...] He also believes the United States could manage war-time escalation levels by indicating to the Iranians that they are not interested in government change. Finally, Kroenig addresses the skeptics who claim that even if a surgical strike against Iran were successful, it would only delay Iran's nuclear program. Kroenig believes that if a surgical strike was successful, the devastation could be so significant that Iran would abandon its nuclear ambitions forever.|$|E
