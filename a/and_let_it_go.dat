25|$|The text of {{the first}} of the three books of the Principia was {{presented}} to the Royal Society at the close of April 1686. Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay. When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> forward to publication. Samuel Pepys, as President, gave his imprimatur on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication. The Society had just spent its book budget on a History of Fishes, and the cost of publication was borne by Edmund Halley (who was also then acting as publisher of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society): the book appeared in summer 1687.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{started the}} season with a 27â€“20 home win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out {{training}} camp and the preseason in a contract dispute, linebacker Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble. The Giants' defense forced three turnovers and held the Eagles to 83 rushing yards. The Giants' offense scored three touchdowns in a 13-minute span in the third and early fourth quarters, but head coach Bill Parcells felt the offensive performance was lackluster overall: [...] "Our runners didn't run the way we wanted them to. They were a little impatient. There were five or six vivid examples of cutting back too soon. You just have to give the play a chance <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> where it's supposed to." ...|$|E

It is time {{for the rest of the}} country to sit up and take notice. For Detroit can either blow up Hitler or it can blow up the U.S." [...] Mayor Edward Jeffries was outraged: [...] "I'll match Detroit's patriotism against any other city's in the country. The whole story in LIFE is scurrilous ... I'd just call it a yellow magazine <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> at that." [...] The article was considered so dangerous to the war effort that it was censored from copies of the magazine sold outside North America.|$|E

40|$|With a Disciple background, {{the writer}} of this thesis has quite {{naturally}} been very much interested in the subject of Christian baptism.
