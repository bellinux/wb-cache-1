30|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{chemicals}} {{in drinking water}} could be beneficial or detrimental health effects depending on its concentration, and total amount ingested. And yet, {{there is some evidence}} that magnesium can have protective effects <b>against</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> or an inverse relation with cardiovascular diseases in general. The important effects of magnesium (Mg) on humans among the numerous study variables involved in the water story are that Mg appears preeminent. Also, its importance is both quantitative and qualitative intakes of water; magnesium (Mg) may palliate an “absolute” Mg deficit and its multiple consequences, particularly on the nephron-cardiovascular apparatus (Durlach et al. 1989). However, if the concentration of sodium exceeds from the recommended amount, it may cause to increase blood pressure (FDEP 2014). Though recent findings suggest that high sodium intake could result in high blood pressure (hypertension) that causes cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> and mortality. Reducing salt intake lowers blood pressure and also reduces the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (Geleijnse et al. 2003; Bochud et al. n.d.; WHO 2012).

40|$|Objectives—To {{investigate}} the associa-tions between natural selection to sports {{at a young}} age, continuity of physical activ-ity, and occurrence of coronary heart dis-ease. Design—Prospective cohort study. Setting—Finland. Participants—Former top level male ath-letes participating {{at a young age}} (1920 – 1965) in diVerent types of sport (endur-ance (n = 166), power speed (n = 235), “other ” (n = 834)) and controls healthy at the age of 20 years (n = 743). Main outcome measures—Data on the occurrence of coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> were obtained from death certificates, three nationwide registers, and questionnaire studies in 1985 and 1995, and data on later physical activity were obtained from the questionnaires. Results—In 1985 all groups of former ath-letes were more physically active than controls (p< 0. 001). Despite similar total volumes of physical activity, compared with power speed athletes, former endur-ance athletes participated more often in vigorous activity (p = 0. 006) and had less coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (adjusted odds ratio 0. 34, 95 % confidence interval 0. 17 to 0. 73; p = 0. 004).

From 1986 to 1995, the incidence of new coron-ary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> was lower among those who participated in vigorous physical activity in 1985. Conclusions—Both a previous aptitude for endurance athletic events and continu-ity of vigorous physical activity seem to be associated with protection <b>against</b> coron-ary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> but an aptitude for power speed events does not give protec-tion <b>against</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R

Consequently the health care cost for these diseases will increase.

N- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids seem to have a protective effect on coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> occurrence independent of their effect on cholesterol.
