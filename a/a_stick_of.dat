5|$|Basingstoke was {{fortunate}} during the Second World War to suffer very little bomb damage. <b>A</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> German bombs did {{fall in the}} Church Square area on 16 August 1940. The same day bombs destroyed part of a row of houses in Burgess Road. Six {{people were killed in}} the raid. After the war, the town had a population of 25,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1916 mines {{were laid}} in the {{vicinity}} of the rock by the German submarines SM U-71 and SM U-78. In July 1940 during World War II <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> bombs was dropped by a passing German plane. The explosion cracked two lantern panes and shattered one of the incandescent mantles.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E

5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E
5|$|A giant {{meteoroid}} {{approaches the}} earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the Aurora, is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> dynamite on the Aurora, but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run a hose from Chester's ship, Sirius, to the Aurora, and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice {{to refuse to}} shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.|$|E

5|$|The {{security}} forces {{set up a}} JOC at Mangula at 09:30 on 19 January with 1 Commando present. A tracking team led by Lieutenant Nigel Henson first made contact around noon on 21 January, when concealed ZIPRA cadres from Gang 2 fired upon them with an RPD machine-gun and AK-47 and SKS rifles. Henson's men withdrew and 1 Commando set up stop points around the contact area to contain the guerrillas during the day; night-ambush positions were then set up as darkness fell. The RLI moved up again at dawn {{the next day and}} met the insurgents at 07:30, when <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> five 1 Commando men led by Lieutenant Bruce Snelgar was sighted in an area of thick bush by three guerrillas from Gang 2. The cadres caught Snelgar's stick by surprise, opening fire with a heavy burst of RPD bullets. Snelgar and Trooper McMaster were wounded and Trooper Anthony Brading was shot dead. In the battle which ensued all three ZIPRA fighters were killed with no further loss to the RLI.|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} raid to Italy on 8/9 November 1940 was aborted when a Junkers Ju 88 of the Luftwaffe dropped <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> bombs {{along the}} length of the flare path as four Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys, including James's aircraft, were waiting to take off at RAF Honington, Suffolk.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War ninety high {{explosive}} bombs were {{dropped on the}} town by the Luftwaffe.

25|$|The oldest manmade {{landmark}} {{in the park}} is an 1816 naval cannon located near Brockton Point. The Nine O’Clock Gun, {{as it is known}} today, was fired {{for the first time in}} 1898, a tradition that has continued for more than 100 years. The cannon was originally detonated with <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> dynamite, but is now activated automatically with an electronic trigger.|$|E

In sawing metal with a bandsaw, it is common to periodically run <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> paste against the blade. This product is similar in form factor to lipstick or beeswax. It comes in a cardboard tube, which gets slowly consumed with each application.|$|E

Other incidents occurred, though some suspect that Jones himself may have been involved in at least some of them.|$|E

25|$|Leaving Childs on guard, {{the others}} {{head out to}} test Blair, {{only to find that}} he has {{tunneled}} out of the tool shed. They realize that Blair is assimilated and has been scavenging equipment to build a small escape craft. Discovering that Childs is missing and the station's power generator is destroyed, MacReady speculates that the Thing now intends to hibernate until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to dynamite the complex, hoping to destroy the Thing. As they set the explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Blair transforms into a much larger monster and attacks, destroying the detonator, but MacReady still triggers the blast with <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> dynamite, destroying the base.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{the law of}} {{conservation}} of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system in a given frame of reference remains constant — {{it is said to}} be conserved over time. In other words, this law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed from one form to another. For instance, chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> dynamite explodes. If one adds up all the chemical energy that is expended in the explosion, one will get the exact amount of kinetic energy that is generated. Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass; however, special relativity showed that mass could be converted to energy and vice versa by E = mc2, and science now takes the view that mass–energy is conserved.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor's {{clothing}} {{has been}} equally distinctive, from the distinguished Edwardian suits of the First Doctor to the Second Doctor's rumpled, clown-like Chaplinesque attire to the dandyish frills and velvet of the Third Doctor's era. The Fourth Doctor's long frock coat, loose fitting trousers, occasionally worn wide-brimmed hat and trailing, multi-striped scarf {{added to his}} somewhat shambolic and bohemian image; the Fifth's Edwardian cricketer's outfit suited his youthful, aristocratic air {{as well as his}} love of the sport (with <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> <b>of</b> celery on the lapel for an eccentric touch, though in The Caves of Androzani it is revealed to turn purple when exposed to gases the Doctor is allergic to); and the Sixth's multicoloured jacket, with its cat-shaped lapel pins, reflected the excesses of 1980s fashion. The Seventh Doctor's outfit – a straw hat, a coat with two scarves, a tie, checked trousers and brogues/wing-tips – was more subdued and suggestive of a showman, reflecting his whimsical approach to life. In later seasons, as his personality grew more mysterious, his jacket, tie and hatband all grew darker.|$|E
