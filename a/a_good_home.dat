5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>home</b> and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.|$|E

25|$|On 17 October 2010 Sammy {{was named}} {{captain of the}} West Indies Test team for its tour to Sri Lanka and {{until the end of}} the 2011 season, {{replacing}} Chris Gayle. At the time Sammy had played 8Tests and 41ODIs. The previous captain and vice, Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo respectively, had chosen not to sign central contracts with the West Indies Cricket Board and were replaced. Between January 2004 and the start of the tour to Sri Lanka in November, the West Indies had won just five of their previous 62Tests and were expected to lose the three match series against a team with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>home</b> record. In a series shortened by poor weather Sammy scored 10 runs and took two wickets at an average of 75.50, and while he said he wanted to improve his own performance Sammy stated that he was pleased with the 0–0 result of the series. In the 2–0 defeat to Sri Lanka in the subsequent ODI series, Sammy scored 28runs and sent down 19wicketless overs.|$|E

There is also an application that must be filled out which asks very thorough in-depth questions to ensure that the cat will go to <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>home.</b> The applications are reviewed first by staff to see if the applicants are a good fit for the cat. Afterwards, a home visit is required to see if the house is suitable for the cat.|$|E
500|$|The Goathouse Refuge also {{provides}} alternative solutions {{for those who}} wish to see a particular cat go to <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>home,</b> but cannot adopt the cat themselves. There is the option to sponsor a cat by donating to cover their adoption fees so that the cat may have a higher chance of being adopted. The refuge {{also provides}} [...] "virtual cats" [...] as gifts and will send the donor a photo of a cat of their choice as well as a behind-the-scenes story about him/her.

500|$|In {{her book}} Free to <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Home,</b> author Catherine Deveny criticised the {{reaction}} to Charlie and Joey's same sex relationship. She called the first kiss between the couple the [...] "TV disappointment of the year" [...] and she nicknamed the soap Homo Go Away because the scene in which the kiss featured were diluted to suit certain viewers. Of the decline in ratings during the storyline, Deveny said [...] "Since the lesbian plotline began two weeks ago, 100,000 people have turned off. Wow! Turned off. That must {{be the first time}} the words 'lesbian' and 'turn off' have occurred in the same sentence. And all we'd seen until Tuesday was lingering touches and intense stares." [...] Deveny then explained that she would rather let her children watch lesbians on television than Christians. She highlighted that only mothers complained to the network about their children being exposed to a same-sex relationship during a family show, not fathers.|$|E
500|$|The Etonians {{took the}} lead in the final when Harry Goodhart scored during the first half, however Arthur Matthews {{equalised}} for Olympic in the second half.

The scores remained level at the end of the regulation ninety minutes. Under the regulations of the FA Cup, thirty minutes of extra time could be played in the event of a draw, at the referee's discretion, and in response to the fervent mood of the crowd the captains asked to play on to try to secure a result. [...] During the extra period, Olympic's superior stamina began to show. [...] Around twenty minutes into extra time, Jimmy Costley received a pass from John Yates and kicked the ball past Etonian goalkeeper John Rawlinson to score the winning goal.

While they were elated that things were going so well, they were exhausted. That changed with the establishment of [...] "off-duty" [...] time to refresh oneself. [...] "It became possible to read, to write a letter, to go away for a few hours or a weekend without being interrupted or missed" [...] wrote Hanna Bergas.
