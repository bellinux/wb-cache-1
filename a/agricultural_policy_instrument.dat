40|$|Grant funds {{specifically}} {{targeted to}} smallholder farmers to facilitate innovation are a promising <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument.</b> They stimulate smallholders {{to experiment with}} improved practices, and to engage with research, extension and business development services providers. However, evidence on impact and effectiveness of these grants is scarce. Partly, because attribution of changes in practices and performance to the grant alone is challenging, and the grant is often invested in innovation processes that benefitted from other support in the past. We discuss three modalities: vouchers, business development matching grants and farmer-driven innovation support funds. Our review points to an important and transversal outcome area of innovation grant systems: the creation of human and social capital to sustain creative thinking and innovative practices. Harmonising measurement on these outcomes could enhance the usefulness and comparability of impact studies and facilitate benchmarking of different policy options for smallholder innovation...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} sectors’ {{contribution to}} the provision of energy is a central issue in Horizon 2020 strategies and has shaped the public and research debates {{on the future of}} the bioeconomy. The common agricultural policy (CAP) has been one of the main drivers of farmers’ behavioural changes and represents the main <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> to address viability of rural areas and maintaining the profitability of the agricultural sector. To contribute to the ongoing policy debate towards CAP reform, this paper will provide an empirical model to simulate the impact of an alternative CAP mechanism on the provision of renewable energy. By applying a dynamic mathematical programming model, the paper tests the impact new policy measures will have on the provision of a second-generation of bio fuel crops that represent a relevant option for Tuscan farmers. Results show that CAP reform positively impacts the supply of energy crops mainly due to the introduction of greening payments, which allows an enlarging of crop diversification. Model results stress also the income stabilisation effects of energy production introduction at farm level, due to reduction of farm exposure to market prices fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|With clear {{evidence}} of major increases in the global market for organic food, the organic 'growth narrative' has evolved as both the central facet ofcontemporary academic examination of organic agriculture and as the dominant discourse for the organic movement itself. However, this narrative masks a dynamic complexity as changes in the organic sector have not just been ofscale but are complicit in changes to the qualitative characteristics of 'organics', The new economic, social and political contexts in which organics are now being constructed means {{that it is an}} increasingly contested term. In this context, the thesis is primarily concerned with the transformation of British organics towards being a successful market commodity and an <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument.</b> With a particular focus on the political sphere, the thesis examines the evolving engagement of the British government with the UK organic movement since 1980 and the materialisation of particular policy outcomes for organic agriculture. Given the organic movement's critique of 'conventional' farming, support from government has been mixed, although the study records a progressive shift in favour of organics. It is essential to establish why organic agriculture has become a policy issue for government and, crucially, how government has dealt with the criticism of mainstream agriculture that organics contains. The thesis identifies several 'organic agricultural policy networks' to conceptualise the changing relations between the government and other interests. The study draws on the insights of an interpretative tradition which contends that policy networks are enacted by individuals. Together, these actors have constructed three different organic 'storylines' that are constituted in the particular memberships of the policy network in temporally specific sets of circumstances. An important focus, therefore, is the'tay in which the actors in the network have 'acted on organics' in the making of organic policy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} changes in {{legislation}} and practice of the Land Consolidation Courts (LCC) in the period from the current Land Consolidation Act entered into force on 01. 01. 1980. The research {{is based on a}} document survey of court records, rulings and case documents as well as various reports and preparatory works. The sample of cases comprises a total of 283 claims handled by four LCC in respectively 1985 and 2005. Findings conclude that the LCC has changed from being an agrarian reformer - "the classic land consolidation" - to be a tool for most types of property and land rights. Its origin as a special court and an <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> is central to understanding and explaining the LCC development. Urbanization, social change and structural rationalization in agriculture have created new frameworks but also new responsibilities. Meanwhile, court reforms with the establishment of the Norwegian Courts Administration, and transfer of administrative responsibility of the LCC from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Court Administration has also been of significant importance. It has also been a period with many changes in the legislation with new Civil Proceedings Act, changes in the Planning and Building Act and the new Land Registration Act. Research shows that the overarching institutional framework has been of great importance for the LCC development. I have investigated the possibility for a discontinuity {{in the development of the}} LCC during this period, for example signaled by the transfer to the court administration. New tasks have been added to the original tasks. There is, however, a growing bias related to tasks such as boundary dispute resolution and land consolidation in urban areas. There are also a growing number of cases in which joint use and new land management organizations are the primary issues. The number of agricultural land rearrangements has decreased. The proceedings of the court have also been modernised and professionalised. Even though more changes in land use require permission from the public authorities, there are relatively few cases where a land consolidation court needs to ask for permission from public bodies. However, this is an area that may need closer regulation. Hopefully this thesis contributes to the discussion about development of the LCC courts. I would also argue that despite the many legislative changes there has not been a discussion about the more fundamental conditions for use of land consolidation...|$|E
40|$|Since {{introduction}} with {{accompanying measures}} of MacSharry Reform, Agri-Environmental Schemes (AESs) represents the main <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> which address environmental objectives in Common Agricultural Policy. In spite of twenty years application and its high share of RDP budget, several evaluation reports and scientific literature have measured a low environmental impacts {{compared with the}} expectations. Economic literature has identified in low target level of schemes, low participation rates, spatial distribution heterogeneity and asymmetric information between farmers and public administration {{the main reasons for}} such AESs lower impact. AESs are compensation payments, aimed to encourage farmers to adopt agricultural practices/prescriptions which affect positively environment. The agri-environmental payments are designed in order to cover (on the average) income foregone, and operational and transaction cost increase due to AESs farm implementation. Agricultural economic literature has highlighted positive effects of incentive mechanisms in increasing farmers? participation. Such literature has identified farm, farmers and household characteristics which determine an expected compliance cost lower than compensation payments, and then are determinant of participation. The agricultural economics literature has also highlighted how uncertainty in market and climatic condition {{is one of the main}} driver of adoption of AESs. Due to farmers? risk aversion, farmers prefer to receive lower but with certain payments (i. e. payments by landscape measure or twenty years set-aside) instead of uncertain income (even if is higher). A growing literature has investigated the role of transaction costs and social capital as determinants of AESs participation. Such literature branch has identified elements of trust and networking, as main motivational factors which affect AESs participation. The objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of determinants of agri-environmental adoption. The objective is pursued combining results of farm level adoption analysis with spatial analysis of participation rate. The first analysis is undertaken applying farmers? behavior choice model, in order to identified the main farm, farmer and household (micro) characteristics which positively or negatively affect the probability to participate in Tuscany AESs. Data are obtained by Tuscany 2010 Census. The second model is undertaken applying spatial analysis (ESDA and spatial econometrics) in order to identifies alternative spatial patterns and to investigate meso determinants of participation to AESs. Data are obtained by ARTEA (regional RDP payments agency) and are referred to the entire RDP 2007 - 2013. Preliminary results shown that both micro and meso characteristics strongly affect participation to AESs. In fact, farm and household structure, quality of advice services and territory endogeneity, significantly affect AESs adoption. Altogether results allow to better understand the participation mechanism. Results will support an improvement of selection mechanism which is aimed to better target AESs measures...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} {{of renewable energy}} by agriculture – so called agroenergy – {{is a key element}} of the Europe 2020 Strategy and has sparked the public and research debates on the bio-based economy. Hot topics involve direct and indirect land use change, as well as the ability of agroenergy to foster or hinder food and energy security. Worldwide research has dealt with those and other issues associated with the sustainability of the diffusion of agroenergy generation systems, but the subject is still open. The agricultural sectors’ contribution to the {{provision of}} energy is central issue in Horizon 2020 strategies and has shaped the public and research debates on the future of bio economy. The common agricultural policy (CAP) {{has been one of the}} main drivers of farmers’ behaviour changes and represents the main <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> to address viability of rural areas and maintaining the profitability of the agricultural sector. In addition, the European Commission backs the agricultural knowledge and innovation system (AKIS), being the key to successful implementation of a bioeconomy in the EU. AKIS-specific measures are also included in the rural development policy of the CAP 2014 - 2020. Then, studying the AKIS is important for policy planning in the EU. Chapter 2 analyses the AKIS behind the adoption of farm biogas in an area of central Italy, thereby describing adopters’ and business typologies. The methodology relies on social network analysis of primary data, collected via questionnaire to plant adopters, and focuses on the estimation of three network attributes: cohesion, knowledge co-creation, and brokerage. We highlight three business models: i. e. multifunctional farm, entrepreneurial farm, and Energy Service Company. The latter is the most widespread. Self-education, upstream industry, agronomists, farmer/biogas unions, university, public-funded projects, and public research centres are AKIS’ stakeholders, which provide information and know-how. Upstream industry is the most influential node, the one that can help knowledge diffusion across adopters, regardless of their background. Self-accessible resources are the main providers of information at the adoption-decision stage. The networks are centralized on self-education tools, while upstream industry and the Research Centre on Animal Productions is the broker. Policy intervention aimed at improving AKIS in the biogas sector should involve the upstream industry in decision making, while considering the duality self-accessible information vs. physical advisors. To contribute to the ongoing policy debate towards CAP reform, Chapter 3 provides an empirical model to simulate the impact of alternative CAP mechanism on the provision of renewable energy. By applying a dynamic mathematical programming model the paper tests the impact new policy measures design on provision of second-generation of bio fuel crops that represent a relevant option for the Tuscany farmers. Results show that CAP reform positive impacts on the supply of energy crops mainly due to the introduction of greening payments, which allows an enlarging of crops diversification. Model results stress also the income stabilisation effects of energy production introduction at farm level, due to reduction of farm exposure to the market prices fluctuations. Chapter 4 contributes to the ongoing debate on the sustainability of agroenergy. We propose an empirical model to simulate the diffusion of farm biogas installations and estimate a set of indicators covering the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability at the regional level. Model results show that agroenergy production can help farmers stabilise their income and keep viable rural areas, despite some trade-offs among socio-economic and environmental indicators.

These are more significant after 1986, coinciding with the implementation of several Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>instruments</b> focused on increasing the modernization and productivity capacity of farm systems. Conclusions. The results show some unintended effects of <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> mechanisms on ecosystem service provision and highlight the need for context-based policies, tailored to the environmental constrains and potentials of each region.

40|$|The Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> (CAP), {{a system}} of market support instruments, direct income transfers, and rural {{development}} measures, has been put through an ongoing reform process in recent decades. This paper introduces three policy impact assessment tools (SIAT, SEAMLESS-IF, MEA-Scope tool) and analyses how these tools have responded {{to a number of}} challenges for integrated assessment modelling as reported in the international literature. Significant progress has been made with regard to modelling linkages whereas other challenges, particularly those related to issues of scale and uncertainty management, require further efforts. It is also analysed which CAP instruments are represented and what kinds of effects can be analysed at different scales. Market instruments and direct payments are comparatively well represented, while the ability to model rural development measures is mostly beyond the scope of these tools. Because each tool has found a different solution for coping with the common challenges of integrated assessment modelling, the choice of one of the tools for a particular application depends strongly on the policy questions being asked. The SIAT provides the big picture via its ability to represent broad changes in <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> with EU-wide cross-sector impacts. The most comprehensive analysis of <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> can be obtained with SEAMLESS-IF. The MEA-Scope tool complements the other two approaches with detailed regional profile...|$|R
40|$|The Swiss {{agriculture}} {{is considered to}} be one of the more subsidized in the world. Using an applied general equilibrium model, we study the effects of two reforms of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> on the welfare of various categories of households. Our framework of analysis allows to take into account the high number of <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> set up by the government. The analysis of the reform AP 2002 shows that, in spite of almost non-existent aggregate welfare gains, great disparities appear between the various households considered. The farmers are by far the losers whereas the pensioners and the wealthy employees profit largely from the reform. With regard to project AP 2007, the effect of an auction of the tariff quotas is positive for most of the households in the sense that it increases their welfare gains compared to the reform AP 2002. However, the farmers, the pensioners as well as some other households do not improve their situation compared to AP 2002. As a whole, the project AP 2007 is nevertheless positive for the population except for the farmers and the some other households. agricultural policy; applied general equilibrium; welfare...|$|R

It {{is well known that}} there can be major unintended consequences, especially where policies are not tailored to regionally specific contexts. Objectives In this paper we assess the implications of 60 years of <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> on soil erosion prevention (SEP) by vegetation, an essential regulating ecosystem service in Mediterranean Europe. Objectives In this paper we assess the implications of 60 years of <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> on soil erosion prevention (SEP) by vegetation, an essential regulating ecosystem service in Mediterranean Europe. Methods To assess these implications we produced and analysed a time series of land cover/use and environmental conditions datasets (from 1951 to 2012) in relation to changing <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> for a specific region in the southern Portugal. Set of indicators related to SEP allowed us to identify that land use intensification as increased soil erosion in the last 60 years.

40|$|The WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) is the {{predominant}} multilateral legal framework governing agricultural trade. The {{objective of the}} AoA is to liberalise trade in agriculture through reductions in tariffs, domestic support and export subsidies. The AoA has not, however, ‘levelled the playing field’ and has not resulted in the equitable distribution of food, particularly for the poorer developing countries. On the other hand, support for small farmers does not ensure food security for the poor. While food security has no simple solutions such as “free trade is good for you”, reform proposals for trade rules which only address <b>agricultural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> fail to account for consumer and other interests: neither tariff reductions and subsidy disciplines, nor safeguards and other measures of producer protection can automatically increase food security. Rather, {{what is needed is}} the full and proper implementation of a number of commitments which the international community has already entered into in various human rights treaties, but which even the envisaged results of the now failed Doha Round negotiations could not ensure without revisiting relevant multilateral trade and investment rules...|$|R
40|$|The European {{consumer}} exigencies, {{the mechanisms}} of the Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy,</b> the European norms and standards, the ecological productions are as many challenges to which the producers, processors, traders and decision makers in the agro food field, and specifically for our research, in the cereals field, must face {{in order for the}} Romanian products to be present on an external market, as well as on an internal market that are increasingly competitive. In this paper we have concluded a brief analysis of the cereals market nationally and on a European level, and of the common support policies in this sector, of the common market organizations, {{as well as of the}} implications of the accession over the trade of cereal products. Also, we have made several recommendations within this paper targeting the specific sectorial aspects of the cereals sector: in order to fully profit from the possibilities offered by the Common <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>instruments</b> and from the demand and prices growth its necessary that Romanian producers organize and make, together, major investments in cereals conditioning and storage systems; the majority of Romanian producers sell the cereals immediately after harvest, when prices are at their lowest level; storage in good conditions of the harvest could allow a substantial increase of profit...|$|R
