The result was that Panther tank production was far higher than what was possible for the Tiger tanks, but not much higher than what had been accomplished with the Panzer IV. At the same time, the simplified final drive became the single major cause of breakdowns of the Panther tank, and was a problem that was never corrected.|$|R

30|$|First, authors with {{addresses}} in Norway {{were never}} listed on papers {{about the relationship}} between MSTN and athletic performance (Table  4). Consequently, they were disproportionately found listed on papers about MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  4). However, the sample size of authors with addresses in Norway was small (n[*]=[*] 10). Second, authors with addresses in the United Kingdom were equally likely as those with addresses in the USA to be found on papers {{about the relationship between}} DR and athletic performance (Table  6). However, probably because of small sample sizes, the difference was not statistically significant (Table  6). Third, authors that listed <b>addresses</b> in <b>Germany</b> were never found on papers about MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  3). As a consequence, authors with <b>addresses</b> in <b>Germany</b> were less likely than authors with USA addresses to be found on papers about the relationship between MSTN and athletic performance (Table  5). This was the only instance of authors with USA addresses having a significantly greater proportional representation on papers about the relationship between an innate factor and athletic performance. Last, authors with Japanese addresses were about twice as likely to be found on papers about the innate factors independent of athletic performance than on papers about the relationship between the innate factors and athletic performance (Table  4). Nevertheless, authors with Japanese addresses were more likely than those with USA addresses to be found on the pooled sample of papers that examined the relationship between the innate factors and athletic performance (Table  6). Taken together, these patterns suggest that authors based in these countries were more likely than authors with USA addresses to publish papers that examined questions about the roles of these innate factors in athletic performance.|$|R

As the results show, price competitiveness is, although significant, only one out of many explanatory variables. Instead, current account imbalances are substantially caused by divergent propensities to save. This does not only relate to public, but also to private savings. Accordingly, demands <b>addressed</b> to <b>Germany</b> and other countries for higher wage agreements alone would be unrewarding.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{public discourse}} on culture and integration and asks how do mediated public discussions about integration reproduce norms of national culture and identity that operate to represent and manage “Other” (immigrant, minority, etc.) {{populations in the}} German context? Through a case study approach, this dissertation uses critical discourse theory to analyze public campaigns, media events, and mediated controversies since the mid- 2000 s that sought to define the qualifications for cultural citizenship. Although in recent years {{an increasing number of}} publications have <b>addressed</b> <b>Germany’s</b> diverse and transnational population, examinations of processes and policies of integration have tended to focus either on the level of the government or on the level of everyday life. Although ideas about integration and multiculturalism are predominantly forged through events and the surrounding representations in the media, the mid-level processes of the media sphere have been neglected in scholarship. Using Foucault’s theories on biopolitics, I argue that integration discourse divides the population into normative nationals and candidates for integration, consisting of individuals with apparent immigrant heritage. This division sets up a neoliberal framework of perpetual evaluation that separates the productive from the threatening integration candidates while reinforcing normative foundations of Germanness. This dissertation includes three sections. The first outlines two major foundations of German national ideas: The Romantic nation represented by the idea of Heimat and the rational, Enlightenment notion of Germany as a bastion of Western values. This section examines the historical and theoretical underpinnings of these schemas of identity and the place of “new Germans” within them. The second section examines the construction of “the new Germany” {{in the first decade of}} the new millennium through the media’s celebration of immigrant patriots and the emergence of “soccer patriotism. ” The three chapters in this section examine three different cases in the media that illuminate the relationship between patriotism and productivity and the role of diversity in this new national formation. The third section analyzes media events that construct boundaries separating integration successes from failures. These cases expose the continuities linking celebrations and condemnations of immigrants and new Germans. ...|$|R
