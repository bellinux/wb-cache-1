Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousand</b> times more luminous.

In 1996, Chandler was hired by Beltway Park Baptist Church under pastor David McQueen. In 1999, Chandler started a non-profit called Waiting Room Ministries with close friend Shane Barnard. Chandler twice started seminary classes but dropped out both times because he felt that he had acquired the tools he was learning from seminary back in bible school. He married his wife, Lauren, on July 31, 1999, and they have three children: Audrey, Reid and Norah.|$|E
25|$|As Family First's sole incumbent, Bob Day was {{unexpectedly}} {{successful at}} the 2016 federal election, despite having unsuccessfully mounted a High Court challenge against newly implemented Senate voting reforms {{which included the}} removal of group voting tickets, a feature which was crucial to the election of Day at the previous election. Though the South Australian Senate Family First vote was reduced to just 2.9 percent (down 0.9 percent), as the election was a double dissolution, the quota to be elected was halved. Day got to the 7.7 percent quota largely from Liberal preferences when the Liberal's 5th candidate Sean Edwards was eliminated from the count, {{largely due to the}} fact the Liberal how-to-vote card recommended Liberal voters to preference Family First. Electing only six Senators per state at a non-double dissolution election, the 12th and last spot in South Australia at this election came down to a race between Day and Labor's 4th candidate Anne McEwen. McEwen solidly led Day for {{the overwhelming majority of the}} count, until count 445 of a total 457. However upon Edwards and then One Nation candidate Steven Burgess being eliminated at count 445 and 455 respectively, leaving only McEwen and Day remaining, Day had collected enough preferences to overtake and narrowly defeat McEwen − by just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousand</b> preference votes. The nationwide Family First Senate vote was 1.4 percent (up 0.3 percent). Elected to the 12th and final South Australian Senate spot, he was allocated a three-year term. Due to the failure of his home construction business, Day resigned from the Senate on 1 November 2016 and a replacement was expected to be selected in the following two to three weeks. In April 2017, the High Court found that he was invalidly elected to the senate at the 2016 election because the leasing arrangements for his electoral office had breached section 44 of the Constitution making him ineligible for the Senate, leading to a special recount of South Australian senate ballots to find a replacement.|$|E

50|$|Making {{investment}} {{for research and}} development work to design a new SST can be thought as an effort to push the speed limit of air transport. Generally, other than an urge for a technological achievement, the major driving force for such an effort is competition from other modes of transport. Competition between different service providers within a mode of transport does not typically lead to such technological investments to increase the speed. Instead, the service providers prefer to compete in service quality and cost. An example of this phenomenon is high-speed rail. The speed limit of rail transport had been pushed so hard to enable it to effectively compete with road and air transport. But this achievement was not done for different rail operating companies to compete between themselves. This phenomenon also reduces the airline desirability of SSTs, because, in very long distances (<b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> kilometers), competition between different modes of transport is rather like a single-horse race: air transport does not have a significant competitor. The only competition is between the airline companies, and they would rather pay to reduce cost and increase service quality than an expensive speed increase.|$|R
