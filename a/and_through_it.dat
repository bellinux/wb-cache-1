They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix <b>and</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E

25|$|Late in his life, {{the writer}} coined another term, daco-românism ("Daco-Romanianism"), which {{referenced}} the ancient territory of Dacia <b>and,</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> {{to the ideal}} of grouping together all territories inhabited by Romanians outside the Old Kingdom's borders. This allusion to Transylvania contributed to his polemic with Austro-Hungarian authorities, who came to regard the term with suspicion. At the same time, Urechia sought to build contacts with representatives of other Romance-speaking communities in the Balkans, Aromanians as well as Megleno-Romanians and Istro-Romanians, {{as well as with}} Romanian leaders from Bukovina and Bessarabia. After the Russo-Turkish War, when Romanian rule was extended to formerly Ottoman Northern Dobruja, he called for the region's Romanianization through colonization and changes in toponymy.|$|E
25|$|As railroads grew in popularity, {{the canal}} company {{recognized}} the importance of replacing the canal with a railroad. The first step of this was the Jefferson Railroad, a line from Carbondale north towards New York, chartered in 1864, built by the Erie Railroad in 1869 and opened in 1872. This was a branch of the Erie, running south from the main line at Lanesboro to Carbondale. Also built as part of this line was a continuation {{from the other side of}} the D's gravity railroad at Honesdale southeast to the Erie's Pennsylvania Coal Company railroad at Hawley. The Jefferson Railroad (<b>and</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> the Erie) obtained trackage rights over the D between its two sections, and the D obtained trackage rights to Lanesboro.|$|E

It subsequently circulated widely in South America, <b>and</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> Uruguayan national hero José Gervasio Artigas became familiar with and embraced Paine's ideas. In turn, many of Artigas's writings drew directly from Paine's, including the Instructions of 1813, which Uruguayans consider {{to be one of}} their country's most important constitutional documents; {{it was one of the}} earliest writings to articulate a principled basis for an identity independent of Buenos Aires.|$|E

The campaign was designed to raise sufficient funds, $85,000, to avoid pushing back the title from the planned mid-2015 release, and would be aided, if its goal is met, by personal loans and funding from the Indie Fund. The Kickstarter was successful, raising more than $100,000 from nearly 3,700 backers, <b>and</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> several funders shared with the Greens their own photos and stories of their losses of their children at young ages due to incurable or inoperable maladies, which will be included within the game.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with convention, the Governor-General, {{to maintain the}} stability of government, must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain {{the support of the}} House of Representatives: usually the leader of the political party with a majority in that house, but also when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a minority government situation), or other scenarios in which the Governor-General's judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play. The Governor-General also appoints to Cabinet the other ministers of the Crown, who are, in turn, accountable to the Parliament, <b>and</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> to the people. The Queen is informed by her viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister {{and other members of the}} ministry, and she holds audience with her Australian ministers where possible.|$|E
25|$|According to Zionist Moritz Moscovici, Zissu was {{contacted}} by the regime on August 22, 1944, that is two say {{two days after the}} beginning of a Soviet invasion in eastern Romania. Ion Antonescu, who faced the prospect of a full Soviet occupation upon his surrender, asked Zissu to contact the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee <b>and,</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> the Western Allies, urging for some Anglo–American guarantees; Zissu agreed and sent the Joint his letter early on August 23. Just hours later, Antonescu was deposed in a palace coup, and Romania capitulated to the Allies. During the democratic episode that followed, Zissu re-founded the Jewish Party, and became its president. Mântuirea reappeared in September of that year, as the weekly organ of Romania's Zionist federation, bringing in new talents such as Isidore Isou, while Zissu also reactivated the national chapter of the World Jewish Congress.|$|E

In this {{capacity}} he also held {{the post of}} Captain-General of Corfu and Butrint on the Albanian shore in 1286–90. In 1291/92, he participated with 100 knights in a campaign to aid the ruler of Epirus, Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, against the Byzantines who were besieging Ioannina, along with 400–500 cavalry from Achaea under Nicholas III of Saint Omer. In exchange, Nikephoros sent his daughter, Maria, as a hostage to Cephalonia. After the Byzantines were repelled, she was wed to Richard's son and heir, John I Orsini. This aroused the indignation of Nikephoros, {{who had not been}} consulted, and who was not mollified until 1295, when the young couple came to live at his court.|$|E
