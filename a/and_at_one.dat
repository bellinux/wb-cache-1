5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Taylor moved to Raleigh, North Carolina with his five daughters {{and worked as}} a UPS package handler, then worked as a beer distributor. By 2006, he had moved back home and was working as a bricklayer with his father. In January 2005, police charged Taylor with misdemeanor child abuse for allegedly leaving four of his children (ages from 2 to 11) alone for more than eight hours. He did not show up for his court date, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point there were four outstanding warrants for his arrest.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Taylor {{returned}} to swimming. He {{took part in}} the Morecambe Bay Race, winning eight times over a period of 20year <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point held the record. Taylor attempted to emulate Matthew Webb in swimming across the English Channel but failed due to bad weather. He annually took on the French champion, swimming in the River Thames and the River Seine and winning on every occasion. Taylor's last appearance in the Olympic Games was at Antwerp, Belgium, in 1920 when he again helped the 4×200m freestyle relay team to a bronze medal.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was only}} a Category 1 hurricane, Charley caused {{significant}} damage in southern Jamaica. Saint Elizabeth Parish sustained the worst damage. About 750 farmers reported damage, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point, flooding isolated 30 families. The only fatality in Jamaica occurred after a man attempted to rescue a family but was swept away by flood waters. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed to flooded regions. Days later, officials allocated roughly $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) to repair damaged roads. Residents in areas that sustained severe agricultural losses also requested assistance from the government.|$|E

During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E

5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} {{intrigued}} by the viewpoints of the two.

Lichtenstein {{felt that he was}} making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} British {{football}} {{stars of the}} late 20th century, Baxter drank to excess, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point {{was said to be}} consuming three bottles of Bacardi a day. Scotland teammate Dave Mackay unsuccessfully advised him to train harder and live more sensibly. Baxter often got falling-down drunk the night before a match, but this did not seem to hamper his play, and team managers took little notice of his drinking. After retiring from football Baxter became a pub licensee, an unsuitable career for a problem drinker. At the age of 55 he needed two liver transplants in four days, and promised to quit drinking.|$|E
