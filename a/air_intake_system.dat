2500|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Honda’s Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform using approximately 44% high-strength steel across the unibody and seven high-strength steel cross members to create a fully boxed ladder frame that is fully integrated into the unibody. [...] Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] According to Autoweek, The Ridgeline's [...] "unibody has many braces, brackets, and reinforced areas that require more welding than traditional pickups." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted an aluminum hood that supports a unique cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the radiator to support torque production and deep water fording which Honda attempted to patent. [...] This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that are also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to their size, Honda incorporated small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to reduce air turbulence which Honda also attempted to patent. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. [...] This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a rear garnish that shields the rear glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion. [...] The bed is built out of steel-reinforced Sheet Molding Composite (SMC) which is dent resistant, corrosion resistant, and is covered with a non-slip coating. [...] It is supported by high-strength steel crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support heavy loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail or during collisions that would try to force that load into the cab.|$|E

50|$|The term is {{also used}} to refer to “Cool Power” <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>systems</b> for {{turbocharged}} engines. These systems provide cooler air to the turbocharger and engine, instead of the potentially too-warm air from the engine compartment. Cooler <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> is denser, which means that the engine can produce the same power with less fuel. Cooler air also gives the engine more power for applications such as towing heavy loads up driving up steep grades during the summer. Cooler air drawn into the engine compartment lowers the temperature under the hood, which allows plastic, rubber and electronic parts to last longer. Lastly, cool power systems will supports larger turbochargers by creating additional air flow to the engine.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>systems</b> of {{internal}} combustion engines are comprised of ducts and air boxes (e. g. air cleaner). The lengths of the ducts induce resonances {{that may be}} excited by the air pulsations generated by the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> valves of the engine. In cases of loud <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> noise, when acoustic devices cannot be used to counteract resonances, a common solution is to use porous ducts: non woven ducts, or ducts with slits (considered as local porosities). Such a solution has an important drawbacks: (1) Dust can fill the pores, leading to loss of effectiveness; (2) The acoustic power radiated along the duct increases. The last issue is addressed here with measurements: the acoustic power radiated along the duct is compared to the acoustic power radiated by the nozzle, in different conditions (with or without porosity, homogeneous or discrete porosity, various airflow velocities). The aim is to validate that porosities give a good balance between the decrease of nozzle noise resonances and the increase of radiated noise along the duct...|$|R
