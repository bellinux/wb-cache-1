500|$|Filmed in Los Angeles, {{the music}} video reunited Carey with Paul Hunter, {{director}} of the video for her 1997 single, [...] "Honey". Since its release, Carey claimed it {{to be one of}} her favorite videos, due to its complex scenery and fun nature. She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time, and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described her feelings regarding the video, as well as sentiments towards the video's director, Hunter: [...] "But I was so happy to work with him again 'cause ever since 'Honey' I've been trying to relive the splendor of that moment. It's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones, but it was great to work with Paul again." [...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon). When questioned regarding a possible relationship with Monzon, Carey said [...] "Erm, how do we play this? OK, he’s a very nice guy, he's been in a fabulous Dolce & Gabbana advert - did you see it? And we’ve had some nice conversations and, um, <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>time.</b> OK, I'll say he definitely {{did a very good job}} in the video." [...] Additionally, Carey and Hunter placed several secrets within the video's scenery, that would be intended for the [...] "die-hard fans". Following the video's completion, it premiered on MTV and several other music video channels on November 1, 2005. Aside from the video's script, Carey channeled Marilyn Monroe, one of her icons growing up. During a pool scene, Carey re-enacts a part from Monroe's film Something's Got to Give (1962). In an interview with MTV News, Carey spoke of the re-enactment: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi revealed he attempted to brake as late as possible to prevent Vergne from overtaking him {{at the start of}} the race but had used more electrical energy than expected when he established an advantage. He stated that he lost some time under full course yellow conditions but when Vergne retired, he [...] "was having <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>time,</b> as he was putting me under pressure." [...] Buemi believed the victory would not have happened if his team had not made repairs to his car's powertrain in their technical headquarters in Viry-Châtillon. However he felt his team deserved the victory more than him due to them overcoming the preceding year's problems with track conditions. López said from the beginning of the season, his car was good, but was not yet experienced enough to be competitive. However, he stated his team [...] "worked hard" [...] in the event at a track which he liked and felt it played a role in his second-place result. Third-place finisher Heidfeld stated it felt [...] "great" [...] to have achieved his second consecutive podium result, and that it was [...] "another exciting race", and his team were more competitive than they were in Monaco. He said it was [...] "a great result" [...] for Mahindra, and that they would not stop until they had achieved their objective of securing their first victory.|$|E
