This committed Syria not to use chemical weapons, to destroy its chemical weapons within 10 years, and to convert or destroy all of its chemical weapons production facilities.|$|E
5|$|Design {{management}} {{is not a}} standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of <b>applying</b> <b>it</b> that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different industries and enterprises with different sizes and traditions, whilst having different target groups and markets to serve. Design {{management is}} multifaceted, {{and so are the}} different applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.|$|E
5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, <b>applying</b> <b>it</b> to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E

5|$|Black currawongs {{are found}} singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been {{observed}} digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and <b>applying</b> <b>it</b> all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they {{did not appear to}} wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs {{have been observed}} wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After <b>applying</b> <b>it,</b> they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E

25|$|By 3–5 years, {{children}} {{usually have}} difficulty using words correctly. Children experience many {{problems such as}} underextensions, taking a general word and <b>applying</b> <b>it</b> specifically (for example, 'cartoons' specifically for 'Mickey Mouse') and overextensions, taking a specific word and <b>applying</b> <b>it</b> too generally (example, 'ant' for any insect). However, children coin words to fill in for words not yet learned (for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because a child may not know what a chef is). Children can also understand metaphors.|$|E

It also requires precise calculation to successfully arrive at the target destination without destroying the ship.|$|E
25|$|This method {{works well}} for cubic and quartic equations, but Lagrange {{did not succeed in}} <b>applying</b> <b>it</b> to a quintic equation, because it {{requires}} solving a resolvent polynomial of degree at least six. This is explained by the Abel–Ruffini theorem, which proves that such polynomials cannot be solved by radicals. Nevertheless, the modern methods for solving solvable quintic equations are mainly based on Lagrange's method.|$|E
