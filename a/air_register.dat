50|$|Ducts, {{especially}} in homes, must often allow air to travel vertically within relatively thin walls. These vertical ducts are called stacks and are formed with either very wide and relatively thin rectangular sections or oval sections. At {{the bottom of}} the stack, a stack boot provides a transition from an ordinary large round or rectangular duct to the thin wall-mounted duct. At the top, a stack head can provide a transition back to ordinary ducting while a register head allows the transition to a wall-mounted <b>air</b> <b>register.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary <b>air</b> <b>register</b> {{supplies}} primary air, {{which is}} the first to be introduced in the burner. Secondary air is added to supplement primary air. Burners may include a pre-mixer to mix the air and fuel for better combustion before introducing into the burner. Some burners even use steam as premix to preheat the air and create better mixing of the fuel and heated air. The floor of the furnace is mostly made of a different material from that of the wall, typically hard castable refractory to allow technicians to walk on its floor during maintenance.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{expansion}} {{during early}} 1976 saw the airline add three ex-American Airlines Boeing 707-120B's to the fleet. One of these aircraft was {{converted to a}} freighter and operated between Medellin and Miami in the lucrative flower export market. The airline began disposing of its L-188 Electras with two passenger aircraft being sold to VARIG Brazilian Airlines whilst one freight and two passenger were retained. By this stage Aerocondor had grown to become Colombia's second international airline and was competing against the country's national flag carrier Avianca Colombia. In 1977 the airline entered the wide-body era when it acquired a factory fresh Airbus A300, named [...] "Ciudad de Barranquilla" [...] {{in honor of the}} company's port of origin. This was the first A-300 to be operated within the Latin American region, entering service on highly competitive routes to Miami. Plans for the introduction of a second A300 failed to materialize due to fiscal underachievement under the airline's new management. Aerocondor was again sold during 1979 to the Cotes and Calderon brothers and shortly afterward the financially strapped carrier entered a period of major crisis, due to poor control and internal corruption rather than market forces. The airline's A-300 was returned to its lessors and during May 1980 the company entered bankruptcy and ceased operations. Hope remained that services would be reinstated but negotiations between the pilots, liquidators and the Colombian government were unsuccessful. The airline's fleet of B707's and B720's remained grounded and were eventually stricken from the Colombian civil <b>air</b> <b>register</b> as the colorful identity of Aerocondor Colombia receded into civil aviation history.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Swirl stabilized burners are widely used in industrial combustion processes due to their benefits in terms of wider flame stability limits, improved mixing and high turbulence level [1]. However, swirl flows are prone to hydrodynamic instabilities at critical operating conditions, {{which can lead to}} local velocity and pressure oscillations. These oscillations can modulate the heat release, giving rise to a space-temporal coupling between heat release and pressure, (Rayleigh criterion), leading therefore to thermo-acoustic oscillation. Industrial experience has shown that swirl stabilized wood powder burners can sometimes cause pressure fluctuations that result in high amplitude structural vibrations in the boiler and increased emissions. The qualitative experiments with a 150 kW wood powder burner that was perturbed with a loudspeaker in the secondary <b>air</b> <b>register</b> showed that a strong effect on the flame characteristic occurred when the perturbation frequency was about 17 Hz. Flame visualisations indicated that one or more processing vortices were present during stable combustion and that these vortices became unstable when the excitation frequency and amplitude had a critical value. ej 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Combustion {{optimization}} {{has been}} deployed on a 670 MW wall fired unit at Duke Energy’s Gibson Generating Station. The goals {{achieved by the}} deployment include 1) control of NOx to a desired setpoint, 2) balancing of combustion and reheat steam temperatures across the boiler, and 3) maximization of boiler efficiency. The combustion optimization approach is based upon building a dynamic model of the unit that represents the effects of changes in manipulated variables, such as O 2 bias, burner register biases, over-fire <b>air</b> <b>register</b> biases, and fuel burner biases, {{on a set of}} controlled variables including NOx, O 2 profile, and reheat steam temperatures. An optimizer uses the dynamic model to control NOx and maximize boiler efficiency while maintaining safety and operational constraints such as excess O 2 and reheat temperature profiles. To provide prompt response to external, unmeasured changes (such as changes in fuel characteristics or ambient conditions), an adaptive feedback algorithm updates the models every 30 seconds. The combustion optimization system uses the updated models to compute new set points or biases for the manipulated variables at each execution to achieve the desired goals while also respecting operational constraints. The underlying combustion optimization technology, its implementation, and operational results are presented...|$|E

40|$|For {{residential}} {{forced air}} {{heating and cooling}} systems conventional thinking is that air supply registers should be located under exterior windows. There were good reasons for this in the past (primarily to counteract the cold downdraught from the window) but new construction standards (well-insulated walls, better glazing and air tight wall/window interface) mean that there is now less downdraught. Positioning the supply <b>air</b> <b>register</b> away from a window could have a large impact for new construction as duct lengths could be shortened (saving materials and construction time). This could also allow greater architectural freedom as the forced air system would {{not need to be}} ducted to the building perimeter. This paper presents results from experiments conducted in a new, well-constructed building to evaluate whether the supply registers can be moved away from the traditional location without impacting indoor air quality or predicted thermal comfort. The physical experiments showed that in both traditional and non-traditional placement: (1) there are minimal changes in predicted thermal comfort (a measure of thermal discomfort - vertical air temperature difference much lower than 3 K), and (2) contaminant-removal effectiveness (a measure of indoor air quality) values were in the same range.

40|$|Problems of {{combustion}} instability {{and the need}} for wider range in firing rates have drawn attention to the need for more fundamental knowledge of the performance and the characteristics of pressure-jet atomized oil flames. A secondary problem is the complication and inconvenience of measurements on full scale equipment. In the present study various operational conditions for a typical modern burner with a pressure-jet atomizer and a swirled air supply were investigated. The variables chosen were fuel rate and spray angle. Data obtained consisted of gas composition, velocity and temperature measurements. The development of a laboratory unit was considered desirable to provide a means of facilitating measurements on flames of this type and a rig was constructed which consisted of a suitable combustion box and 3 / 10 ths scale burner. It was shown that the matching of the spray angle to the <b>air</b> <b>register</b> aerodynamics affected the flame characteristics very markedly, Regions of high unburnt fuel occurred due to fuel penetration and poor mixing outside and downstream of {{the main part of the}} flame. The effect of widening the spray angle which usually occurs with wide range types of pressure-jet atomizers at the lower fuel rates was shown to be particularly unsatisfactory, and to effect the black smoke limit. The general course of mixing and the progress of combustion through the flame was deduced from calculation from the gas composition results. The distribution and effects of recirculation were shown from the velocity measurements. These were related to data for simple jets. In particular, it was deduced that internal recirculation in the core was largely responsible for flame stabilization. Theoretically derived scaling criteria were investigated by comparing full scale and model results. These showed that reasonable comparisons were possible between the two, with flames scaled either on the basis of similarity in velocity and relative momentum between spray and air, or on similarity in residence times in the flame. The former was thought probably to be better, Cold flow measurements were made, and showed differences in the size of the central recirculation core between hot and cold but not in the peak velocity to peak velocity diameter early in the flame. Combustion oscillation measurements on a marine boiler produced data which suggested strongly that these were of the "non-acoustic" type. None of the theories so far suggested appear to - ii - account with much accuracy for the observed data. In the course of experimental work various special Instruments for flow measurement were developed. It was concluded that the choice of spray distribution to suit a particular aerodynamic pattern was vital to the optimum performance of the burner. In all the cases investigated this was found to be to some extent imperfect. It is considered that decided improvements could be made to the air distribution in burners of this type. The following possibilities are suggested solutions, the use of a higher degree of swirl and a confining quarl, upstream air injection or the use of multiple oil nozzles and by avoiding devices where the spray angle varies widely over the operating range...|$|E

50|$|The {{radiators}} {{are designed}} to heat {{the air in the}} room using convection to transfer heat from the radiators to the surrounding air.

30|$|The {{international}} {{factors were}} analyzed based {{on the presence of}} internationally competitive Related and Supporting Industries. (1) Cotton exports and (2) yarn exports were used to indicate how strong these industries were in the global market through its expansion into related and supporting international industries (Table  1). These two proxies were adopted also because cotton and yard consumption is heavily driving G&T industry. In addition, infrastructure for international transportation are important for improving international competiveness because they facilitate international trade transactions and increase the levels of multinational activities with higher efficiency (Daniel 2000; ITS Global 2008).

40|$|Abstract. HVAC systems {{account for}} 38 % of {{building}} energy usage. Studies have indicated at least 5 - 15 % waste due to unoccupied spaces being conditioned. Our {{goal is to}} minimize this waste by retrofitting HVAC systems to enable room-level zoning where each room is conditioned individually based on its occupancy.

In order to achieve this goal, the effect of opening or closing <b>air</b> vent <b>registers</b> on room temperatures has to be predicted.
