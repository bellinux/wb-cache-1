25|$|Following his wife's death, {{he began}} discerning a {{vocation}} {{to join a}} monastery, perhaps in France. One day, while discussing his vocation with the sister of Thomas Hussey, the Bishop of Waterford, a band of ragged boys passed by. She pointed to them, and cried:"What! Would you bury yourself in a cell on the continent rather than devote your wealth <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> to the spiritual and material interest of these poor youths?"After settling his business affairs in 1802, Rice {{devoted his life to}} prayer and charitable work, particularly with the poor and marginalised of Waterford. In 1802, when he established a makeshift school in a converted stable in New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so difficult to manage that the teachers resigned. This prompted him to sell his thriving business to another prominent Roman Catholic merchant, a Mr. Quan, and devote himself to training teachers who would dedicate their lives to prayers and to teaching the children free of charge. Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund's classes were so popular that another temporary school had to be set up on another of his properties, this time in nearby Stephen Street.|$|E
