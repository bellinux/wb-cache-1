40|$|AbstractThe {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of many pore-forming toxins, in particular, {{the rate of}} increase in the membrane conductance induced by the channel-forming domain (P 178) of colicin E 1 is maximum at an acidic pH. However, after P 178 binding at acidic conditions, a subsequent pH shift from 4 to 6 {{on both sides of the}} planar bilayer lipid membrane caused a large increase in the trans-membrane current which was solely due to an increase in the number of open channels. This effect required the presence of anionic lipid. Replacing the His 440 residue of P 178 by alanine eliminated the pH-shift effect thereby showing that it is associated with deprotonation of this histidine residue. It was concluded that alkalinization-induced weakening of the electrostatic interactions between colicin and the membrane surface facilitates conformational changes required for the transition of membrane-bound colicin molecules to an <b>active</b> <b>channel</b> <b>state...</b>|$|E

The power density spectra of current fluctuations induced at various concentrations of GTP ([GTP]) were well fitted by the sum of two Lorentzian functions. Because the channel has one open state, the open-close transitions of the channel gate represented by the spectra could be described as C 2 C 1 O. As [GTP] was raised, the channel activity increased in a positive cooperative manner. The powers of the two Lorentzian components concomitantly increased, while the corner frequencies and the ratio of the powers at 0 Hz remained almost constant. This indicates that G protein activation did not affect the gating of each channel but mainly increased the number of functionally <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> in the patch to enhance the channel activity. Regulation of the number of functionally <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> could be described by a slow transition of the <b>channel</b> <b>states,</b> U (unavailable) A (available), which is independent of the gating.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{a number}} of {{techniques}} have been intro-duced to improve sum-rate performance of a wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC). However, previous works have ignored the rate overhead associated with feedback of MIMO BC <b>channel</b> <b>state</b> information (CSI), which increases {{in proportion to the}} number of users in multi-user MIMO communications. Considering the limited amount of feedback signaling in a practical system, the effective feedback transmission as a form of partial CSI is required. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed, of which the sum-rate performance approaches extremely close to the sum capacity of MIMO BC as the number of users increases, while the feedback overhead is designed to be reduced down to the number of <b>active</b> <b>channel</b> vectors. In our proposed scheme, multi-channel selection diversity (MCSD) is exploited to send partial CSI back to the transmitter. I...|$|R

40|$|Shannon's Capacity Theorem is {{the main}} concept behind the Theory of Communication. It says that if the amount of {{information}} contained in a signal is smaller than the channel capacity of a physical media of communication, it can be transmitted with arbitrarily small probability of error. This theorem is usually applicable to ideal channels of communication in which the information to be transmitted does not alter the passive characteristics of the channel that basically tries to reproduce the source of information. For an <b>active</b> <b>channel,</b> a network formed by elements that are dynamical systems (such as neurons, chaotic or periodic oscillators), it is unclear if such theorem is applicable, once an <b>active</b> <b>channel</b> can adapt to the input of a signal, altering its capacity. To shed light into this matter, we show, among other results, how to calculate the information capacity of an <b>active</b> <b>channel</b> of communication. Then, we show that the channel capacity depends on whether the <b>active</b> <b>channel</b> is self-excitable or not and that, contrary to a current belief, desynchronization can provide an environment in which large amounts of information can be transmitted in a channel that is self-excitable. An interesting case of a self-excitable <b>active</b> <b>channel</b> is a network of electrically connected Hindmarsh-Rose chaotic neurons.

The place pitch sensitivity is typically measured using the stimulation of single channels. However, all current cochlear implant devices stimulate multiple channels simultaneously or with pulses temporally interleaved. The primary goal {{of the present study}} is to test whether the sensitivity of a cochlear implant recipient to changes in perceived pitch associated with changes of place of excitation improves or deteriorates when the number of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> is increased, compared with stimulation with only one <b>active</b> <b>channel.</b> Place pitch sensitivity was recorded in four Nucleus CI 24 subjects as a function of number of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> (from 1 to 8). Just noticeable differences were estimated from a constant stimuli 2 AFC pitch-ranking experiment with roving loudness. Reference and comparison stimuli contained the same number of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> but were shifted one or two electrodes toward the base or toward the apex. The place pitch sensitivity was measured using monopolar stimulation at two locations along the electrode array. To minimize cues related to loudness, the multichannel stimuli were loudness balanced relative to the single-channel stimuli presented at C-level. The number of <b>active</b> <b>channels</b> did not affect place pitch sensitivity. This is consistent with a model that compares the edges of the excitation pattern irrespective of the overlap between excitation patterns.
