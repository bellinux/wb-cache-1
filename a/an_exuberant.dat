His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, Thème et variations in C major, and Huit pièces brèves.

25|$|Federico Fellini {{brought to}} the screen <b>an</b> <b>exuberant</b> imagery shaped by his {{encounter}} {{with the ideas of}} Jung, especially Jungian dream interpretation.

25|$|The Mediterranean climate, {{influenced}} by the Atlantic and characterized by moderate temperatures and wet winters, is typical of continental Portugal. Although the climate {{in the area of}} Cabo da Roca is semi-arid, the Sintra Mountains are considered moderately humid: precipitation in the mountains is higher than in the surrounding areas. The position of the town in the natural landscape of the Sintra Mountains (consisting of <b>an</b> <b>exuberant</b> natural patrimony), is {{influenced by}} the existence of a micro-climate. For different reasons (the climate here has been moderated by the Sintra Mountains; the fertility of the soils; and its relative proximity to the Tagus estuary) the region attracted considerable early settlement. Due to its micro-climate, a huge park has developed full of dense foliage with a rich botanical diversity.|$|E

25|$|Patel's first {{opportunity}} for acting {{came in the}} form of an offer from her father's schoolmate, Rakesh Roshan, to star opposite his son, Hrithik Roshan, in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000). The offer came immediately after she graduated from high school, but she refused the project because she wanted to continue her education in the US. Afterwards, Kareena Kapoor replaced her, but luckily, Kapoor dropped out a few days into the principal photography and Patel was given the opportunity once again during a family lunch. She readily agreed to do the project this time. The role of <b>an</b> <b>exuberant</b> college girl in love, undergoing a tortuous time at losing her lover and rediscovering a more mature relationship gave Patel scope to perform. The film was a smashing success and established Patel as a rising star, earning her awards for Best Debut at a number of award ceremonies.

However, the adult cases reported are mostly malignant and commonly arise in the thyroid. We report {{a case of a}} 31 -yr-old female with a huge neck mass. Pathologic examination revealed it to be malignant teratoma composed of primitive neuroepithelial tissue with primitive neural tubes and loose myxoid to fibrous immature mesenchymal stroma. The patient underwent extensive evaluation of the thyroid gland with computed tomography (CT) scan and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, which revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. She underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral modified radical neck dissection, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy. At 22 -months of follow-up, the patient has remained euthyroid and showed no evidence of recurrence.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, City fans started a craze of {{bringing}} inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas.
