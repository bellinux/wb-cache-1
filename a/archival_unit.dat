50|$|In modern archival practice, the fonds is {{generally}} {{the highest level}} of arrangement, and is usually used to describe the whole of the archives of an organisation or the papers of an individual. It may be divided into sub-fonds, generally the records of different branches of an organisation or major themes within the papers of an individual. These are in turn further subdivided into series (which may in a smaller archive come directly below a fonds without the presence of a sub-fonds), usually used for groupings of individual types of documents (minutes, correspondence files, deeds, etc.), sub-series, files, and items. An item is the smallest <b>archival</b> <b>unit,</b> and is usually physically indivisible (a single volume or letter, for instance).

40|$|For a folklorist it is {{difficult}} to think about oral tradition other than through the perspectives provided by our discipline. It is oral communication that links people into those small groups who create and re-create folklore, while reading is a solitary activity. Walter Ong has shown how literacy has penetrated our oral discourses, but it is also possible to see elements of orality in written texts (1982). A folklore performance that has been transformed into an <b>archival</b> <b>unit</b> still remains a manifestation of oral tradition. The main problem in reading these texts lies in our ability to discern them {{as a part of the}} tradition, which remains invisible. Oral tradition always implies going beyond the borders of individual creation and single performances; it means relying upon the words that have already been spoken and on a dialogical relationship, as noted by Mikhail Bakhtin (1986). Our object of research is not the text as a singular unit but its relationships with the rich phenomena beyond its written form, such as the generic, situational, cultural, and performative contexts.

Navode se aktivnosti u prikupljanju, sređivanju i obradi, opisu, digitalizaciji i web prezentaciji gradiva. Također pružene su i informacije o organizaciji skupova, izdavačkoj i izložbenoj djelatnosti. Posebno se razmatra pitanje statusa arhivskoga gradiva i pokušaji lokalne samouprave da se u Veloj Luci pokrene rad aktivne arhivske jedinice Državnog arhiva u Dubrovniku. U radu se nastoji vrednovati sabrano gradivo i to u kontekstu omjera uništenog i sačuvanog, kao i prikazati zalaganje lokalne sredine da u nedostatku sustavnog prisustva nadležnog državnog arhiva pokrene inicijativu i konkretne poteze. Stoga je bilo važno dati i pregled stvaratelja, očuvanosti i odnosa prema arhivskoj baštini do 2006. Zaključeno je kako je, usprkos neuspjehu u namjeri oživotvorenja aktivne jedinice u sklopu državne arhivske mreže, Vela Luka primjer uspješnog pionirskog pothvata lokalne samouprave da sačuva arhivsku baštinu. Vela Luka {{was formed}} as a {{settlement}} in the late 17 th century. In the middle of 19 th century it gained its parish independence and, as the century came to end, its political independence. Its pronounced potential as a harbour drew many immigrants (at {{the dawn of the}} 20 th century the population amounted to over 5 thousand) and public service offices, economic plants and societies are opened. Today the population of Vela Luka ranks second place among Adriatic islands with the significant number of creators. The history of Vela Luka chronicles numerous intentional and unintentional ravages of records of continuing value, most noted being when the partisans burned the municipal record office in 1943. Neglecting of records continued until the beginning of the 20 th century, partly as a consequence of disorganized inspection and inability of the responsible State Archives in Dubrovnik. By June 2011 the majority of existing and collected records (total amount of approximately 122 meters) has been arranged and basically described. Over 780 pages of the inventories have been written by that time. Together with 34 basically described fonds (total amount of 97 meters), another 8 have been described analytically (11 meters). About 3. 800 items of various records have been listed in the collections. Archival records date mostly from the socialist era; half of the holdings belong to administrative and public services, while the fonds are mostly small in their size. In average they have about 3, 4 meters of records, while even ¾ of fonds has less than 2 meters. About 9. 730 records have been digitalised, most of which are private records collections. Municipal website gives basic information on the Archives, as well as descriptions and inventories. So far about 100 requests have been received for accessing the records, mostly building permits, buying and selling or grants. The records have been repeatedly quoted in local history yearbooks. Some efforts have also been made in presenting the records through the form of exhibitions, symposiums, publications and lectures. Exhibition entitled „The 1930 -is in Vela Luka“ has been co-organised with local institutions, together with the symposium „ 150 years of schooling in Vela Luka“. The latter produced the proceedings in printed form. A contribution was also given to organize an international symposium on meteorological tsunamis, which produced a booklet „Notes on tidal wave in Vela Luka on June 21 st, 1978 “. A book collection „Izvori“ has also been initiated. In collaboration with the State Archives in Dubrovnik ways are sought to enhance archival activities in the area of Vela Luka County and to initiate the work of Korčula-Lastovo remote storage and distinct archival repository in Vela Luka. Despite the failure of the local community’s starting goal to initiate an active <b>archival</b> <b>unit</b> responsible to the State Archives in Dubrovnik, County of Vela Luka has made a pioneer undertaking in preserving archival heritage. </p...|$|E

This work continued into the 1950s, during which time the library acquired significant collections related to American history and diplomacy, including those of John Jay. Over the years, the library has acquired archival materials in several key collecting areas—economics and banking, graphic arts, history, human rights, literature, performing arts, printing history, and publishing.

40|$|The topic {{explores the}} {{personal}} archives of an Italian Capuchin monk, Antonio Cioffi (Cioffo), {{better known as}} Bernard Maria of Naples (1628 - 2. 02. 1707). The only information we have had about his archives until today is that provided by Hugo Schuchardt and Michele Tamarati. As is well known {{about the life of}} this monk, a missionary in the Kingdom of Kartli from 1670 to 1677, Bernard Maria of Naples had learnt the Georgian language fluently and had become accustomed to the life and the customs of the Georgians; in addition, he left a unique body of materials in Georgian and Italian about the Georgia of his age. We have examined: the unpublished "Historical and Chronological News about the Minor Capuchin Brothers in the Naples Province" (mid- 18 th cen.) by Emmanuel of Naples, the 3 rd volume of the "History of the Capuchins' Mission" (1873) by Rocco of Cesinale, which is based on Emmanuel of Naples's work, the "Library of the Capuchin Brothers of the Naples Province" (1886) by Appolinarius of Valencia, Hugo Schuchardt's study in two different versions (1896), as well as the lists of manuscripts and printed materials compiled by Francesco Castaldi (1896), Michele Tamarati (1902), two unknown Italian archivists of the 19 th century, Vincenzo Di Donna (1912), and, finally, the documents, preserved in the AS collection under the superintendence of the National Library of Naples, that concern the collocation of Bernard Maria's manuscripts and printed materials within the library. A comparative study of various lists of the manuscripts and the printed books from the personal archives of Bernard Maria of Naples, compiled by various scholars, as well as of other documentary material has led us to the conclusion that between the years 1886 - 1936, five <b>archival</b> <b>units</b> were lost. Among them is a very important historical source: a 38 -page excerpt from the "Hundred Years Chronicle" by Zhamtaaghmtsereli which had been copied by Bernard Maria of Naples.

40|$|Methodological {{approach}} view on collecting science archives: the « metaprotocole » as {{new point}} of view". Over {{the last two}} decades, archivists who are dealing with scientific archives have had {{to face up to}} rather radical changes of their surroundings: the archival world and the laboratories. The highlighted difficulties are generally attributed to the modification of scientific know-how process on the one hand, and to alterations to the preservation and diffusion methods of this know-how on the other hand. These technical changes are often assimilated to the generalisation of computer techniques and the resulting development of electronic communication. For some time, the primary question connected to those modifications seemed to be the one about the preservation of the data of those “new archives”, and the support on which it is stored. However, the managers of the information and the archivists have worked out technical solutions in order to resolve the preservation of electronic documents. Several problems are outstanding, as there are :the matter of the authenticity of the documents, the technical problems related to the objects of the laboratories, the databases, and so on. Yet, the main difficulty is situated elsewhere … Many historians, sociologists and philosophers of science have proved it necessary to penetrate into the interior of the laboratory in order to comprehend the activity :the scientific know-how is not a “neutral” one, it is subject to its fabrication process. Gradually, the archivists have adopted this way of proceeding. It seems clear to us that the major problem consists in understanding how today’s science functions. The question “how can we study the scientific phenomenon if we are not even able to put together the documentary tracks it produces ?” can be inverted to a different question :”how can we assemble the tracks of an activity of which we do not understand the elaboration process ?”. An overall understanding of the scientific activity and its institutional and social aspects is to be developed. If we fail to carry through this double action, we will end up with <b>archival</b> <b>units</b> of which we will have lost the context of the production. The units will thus have lost all meaning and will have become virtually useless. The management and use of today’s and tomorrow’s scientific archives mostly depend on whether or not {{we will be able to}} familiarise ourselves with those interdisciplinary actions, adapt them to the classical treatment of archives and integrate them in the continuum record process. In this point of view, a close link will appear between archivals methods applied in the Australian Science Archives Project and lessons coming from modern philosophy and history of contemporary sciences[URL]...|$|R
40|$|As the {{structure}} of organizations which developed {{in the direction of}} the needs of the society has become more complicated, the problems stemming from human factor increased and there arose a need o investigate these problems. Employees spend a period of eight hours at their workplaces. Therefore, the personel considentions of employees about their jobs becomes an important issue to be looked into. Inadequate organization of the State's <b>archival</b> <b>units</b> in Turkey is a by-product of their ineffective status in the institutions to which they are attached. Further more, it seems that the qualifications and professional formation of the personnel employed in these units are not adequately taken into account. This study aims at establishing how the personal qualifications and lack of professional formation of the staff employed in the public archival institutions affect their assessment of job satisfaction. In the light of this, our hypothesis is as follows: In our country, the expectations of staff working in public institutions and organization archives in relation to job satisfaction in the out of the criteria which consist of "belief in the significance of the work done", "finding the work done worth doing", "appropriateness of the work to the knowledge and skills", individual properties and work safety. These criterias are (physical) working conditions, wages, appreciation, possibility of promotion, the facility of obtaining information about work from administrator and colleageus, group work and individual work, social facilities provided by the institution (such as nursery, camp, consumption cooperation, etc.), distribution of authority and responsibility and participation in decision-making. It can be looked for the reasons of that situation in the staff working in public institutions and organizations archives have not taken enough education of archives studies. In our study 197 out of 234 members of staff in seven public institution archives, were surveyed the institutions are Turkish Republic Prime Ministry Undersecretariat of Treasury, General Documents and Branch Directorate; Turkish Republic Prime Ministry, Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade, General Documents and Branch Directorate; Foundations General Directorate Culture and Registration Office Directorate Archives; State Planning Institution General Documents and Branch Directorate; Ministry of Agriculture General Documents and Branch Directorate, Hacettepe Hospital Medical Documentation Center and Archives). As a result of our study, it was established that the job satisfaction of personnel working in public institution archives was affected not by factors like individual properties (gender, age, marital status, education level, status, seniority in public work etc.) fear of losing one's job, belief in the significance of the work, the worth doing, but by wage, appreciation, the opportunity of obtaining information from administrator and colleagues, authority- responsibility balance, opportunity of promotion and the facilities provided by the institutions...|$|R

The tormented sequel of events characterising this mining site have resulted in a conspicuous documentary production later stored in a number of archive groups partitioned amongst various archival institution: the Archivio Storico del Comune di Iglesias (Historical Archive of the Council of Iglesias), the Archivio Documentale della Miniera di Montevecchio (Documentary Archive of Montevecchio Mine) and the Archivio del Distretto Minerario della Sardegna (Archive of the Mining District of Sardinia). The in-depth archival research resulted in the retrieval of 476 units, including fascicules and registries covering the time frame from 1990 to 1991 : The first seeach step was that of outlining an analytic data sheet, which would allow the researcher to identify the relevant data for a census of the documents, while a second step consisted in a more detailed analysis of the documentary sources, divided according into two main strands: documents on work-related injuries and documents on industrial disease (“scadenziari” of injuries, court records, patients’ lists, etc.) For each document another data sheet has been produce in order to describe any data useful for the research. The results have been ‘normalised’ and transcribed in the documentary appendix, resulting into two fairly complete instruments to conduct further research: the first one contains the <b>archival</b> <b>units</b> on work-related injuries and supplies the consultation indexes catalogued and divided within each single mining site; the second one focuses on ‘techno-pathologies’ (pathologies whose origin comes from the typology of job) and, as in the first case, enriched by consultation indexes divided according to the categories of mining sites, industrial diseases, job tasks and names of the workers. At the same time that the archival research was conducted, a study on the norms regulating the mining sector from 1865 to 1959 has been conducted with the aim of verifying whether any specific norm concerning the prevention of injuries and industrial diseases existed at the time. Finally, the last phase of the research included the analysis of the documents in light of the main literature on the subject. The situation of the injury paths in Sardinian mining contexts has been traced back with a focus on the years 1880 - 1970, and particularly on the situation of Montevecchio mine. Regarding the latter, all fatal injuries occurred between 1863 and 1996 have been identified listed. For what concerns industrial diseases, though a study on the medical literature dealing with heath issues for workers employed in mining sites, a list of pathologies afflicting Montevecchio’s workers form the 1930 s to the 1980 s has been drafted. Given the results produced, this research can be considered a paradigm to be used in the future to conduct further studies on base metals mines within broader Italian and international scenarios and, at the same time I t can be intended as a first step towards a clearer definition of the characteristic of mining compartment within Sardinia...|$|R

U samoj, pak, muzikologiji, odnosno znanosti o glazbi, situacija je donekle povoljnija, ali kad se uzme u obzir da je riječ o redu veličine od jedva tristotinjak specijalista, to je samo kap znanja u moru našega poslovičnog i gotovo posvemašnjeg ignoriranja svih vrijednosti glazbeno-kulturnih artefakata stvorenih ili prenesenih, a sačuvanih na tlu današnje Republike Hrvatske. While {{the actual}} {{collection}} {{and preservation of}} musical artefacts (sheet music, books about music and musical instruments) started sporadically in the Middle Ages, from the 10 th and 11 th centuries onwards (church codices furnished with various types of musical notation) and then much more vigorously and systematically from the 1750 s, awareness of their scholarly and archival articulation and the first campaign systematically to list them date from 1930. At {{the beginning of the}} 1980 s the newly founded Institute for Musicological Research of the JAZU Research Centre carried out a second extensive questionnaire of the kind, {{and for the first time}} undertook a series of systematic campaigns to find, identify, put in order and catalogue musical collections throughout Croatia. This questionnaire was addressed to more than 1200 ecclesiastical and secular institutions (private collections, apart from one previously known, were not considered) and the response was surprisingly good. Answers arrived from more than 50 % of the places, that is, from more than 600 addressees. Of these, 213 were positive answers, i. e., the questionnaire helped to reveal previously unknown information about the existence of 213 musical collections and archives in Croatia. As against the previous knowledge of some 50 of them, this was a revolutionary turn in our knowledge about the factual foundations of written musical culture in Croatia. It should be pointed out at once that these were mostly not organised collections, open to the public, rather localities (parish and cathedral archives, monastic collections, museums) that, according to the answers on the questionnaires, had manuscript or printed sheet music or books about music, in either good or poor order. At the moment the questionnaire was carried out, most of the collections were actually not properly ordered according to the standards of libraries and archives, and only a few of them had been catalogued, in various mutually incompatible ways, with catalogue cards or obsolescent inventory books. Approximately estimated, these collections contained some 60, 000 <b>archival</b> <b>units,</b> with a much larger number of compositions, the age of the artefacts ranging from the 10 th and 11 th century to the 20 th, mainly from the period from 1750 to about 1960. In the last thirty years, that is, from the beginnings of the 1980 s until the present, taking this situation as a foundation, a number of actions were taken in Croatian historical musicological and archival studies that to an extent improved the situation in musical collections and archives. With a series of five successive projects funded by the Ministry of Science and in the last decade the Ministry of Culture too, as part of the Institute for Musicological Research of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, today the Section for the History of Croatian Music of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Croatian Musicological Society and the Music Academy, a systematic survey, arrangement and cataloguing of the musical collections discovered by the questionnaire began.

Participation restrictions were measured using the Community Integration Measure. Lifespan was considered in terms of age and time since injury. Regression analyses were employed to determine the relationship between quality of life and components of disability across the lifespan. The results revealed that perceived quality of life was not significantly different according to age or time since injury. The single most important predictor of quality of life was the presence of secondary conditions while the second most important predictor was the extent of participation. These findings suggest that rehabilitation services must focus on minimising secondary conditions and enhancing societal participation in order to optimise quality of life across the lifespan for people with SCI in Queensland...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{research project}} examines how contemporary academic bioethics in the U. S. balances the aspiration to guide biomedical {{research and practice}} {{with the need to}} become an institutionally legitimate influence in society. Since its inception three decades ago, to what extent has bioethics made biomedicine more socially accountable? At the same time, to what extent has bioethics been rendered a public-relations tool for academic and corporate biomedicine? This project investigates the co-production of the legitimacy and the logic of the academic field of bioethics by examining the activities of bioethicists in three professional arenas: the establishment of an academic bioethics unit, discourse on the legal liability of institutional review boards and health care ethics consultants, and the deliberations and recommendations of a federal bioethics commission. Bioethicists' efforts to legitimate their field are viewed as competition and collaboration with other professional groups to stake out an emblematic expertise, which is then tendered to various societal clients. A case study of an academic bioethics unit was conducted to reveal how the unit's efforts to secure material resources and organizational legitimacy shape the center's intellectual output, drawing on the <b>unit's</b> <b>archival</b> documents and interviews with the unit's director, faculty, staff, and graduate students. Discourse analysis was used to explore what anticipated legal liability reveals about the legitimacy of expertise claims and the shaping of those claims. The proceedings of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission related to the human stem cell research debate were used to examine the boundary-work conducted by the commission at the borders between science and ethics, and between ethics and public policy. The research described here shifts attention in the budding sociology of bioethics from clinical to academic bioethics, and highlights the institutional and power relationships amongst bioethics, biomedicine, and public policy. This study also contributes to the fields of higher education studies and science and technology studies, where ethics, and the relationship between legitimacy and expertise, have not been fully explored. The findings presented here provide useful insight into the challenges and opportunities bioethicists face in cultivating socially responsible biomedical science and technology...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on a {{research}} thesis that investigates the role of procurement practices in effective implementation of infrastructure projects in a developing country, i. e. Pakistan. The research investigated and explored the issues and barriers to effective implementation of different procurement methods, the environment and its suitability for implementing different forms of procurement in context of public sector in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach – The research was carried out in two stages in the first stage archival analysis was conducted of government documents, reports including reports by international organisations, policy documents and literature. During the second stage case studies were selected based on <b>archival</b> analysis. The <b>unit</b> of analysis is the basis for the case and for this study, it was the procurement of infrastructure projects in public sector in Pakistan and that was the boundary of the research. Eight project case studies were selected from six public sector organizations (organizational case studies). A total of 24 respondents participated from these six organisations. Findings – The research has identified the different procurement choices and reasons for a particular choice, the issues in procurement choice and the issues in procurement implementation in the public sector organisations in Pakistan. It has also described the impact of procurement practice on successful project outcomes. As a result multiple issues have been identified which affects the choice of procurement such as the need for efficiency and finances, client objectives, timely policy decisions, clarity of clients needs, delays in bidding and response, delays in approvals, proposal and bid evaluation procedures, need for relaxation of rules and project characteristics. The major barriers and constraints to implementation of procurement have been reported to be regulatory and legal, risks and contract management, principles of procurement, political, culture, inter and intra organisational issues, conditions of the country, lack of understanding, land acquisition, project revenue and finance issues. Procurement had a direct impact on successful outcomes of the project, the procurement systems in these organisations had a direct relationship and impact on performance and success of the project. Originality/value – As a result of this analysis a vivid big picture of road map of the ongoing processes and practice of procurement in public sector in Pakistan has been created which vividly portrays the issues and barriers of the procurement practice in Pakistan...|$|R
