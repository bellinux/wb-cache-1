One {{of the problems of}} natural gas pressure reduction stations (City Gate Stations; CGS) is blocking the gas passage due to reduction of temperature in the regulator. In order to prevent this problem, gas is heated in a gas heater before pressure dropping. The gas heater includes, gas passage pipes, intermediate fluid and hot fluid passage pipes. Hot fluid is combustion products of an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burner</b> and has high thermal energy. Since utilizing of porous media technology has many advantages in combustion systems, the idea of applying this type of burners instead of conventional burners has been widely considered. In this study, replacing of an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burner</b> with a porous burner in the gas heater of a CGS has been studied numerically. First, by modelling the gas heater with an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burner,</b> the values of produced heat fluxes at the different equivalence ratios have been studied. The results of these simulations determine the condition which leads to maximum efficiency of combustion in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burner.</b> The results indicate that maximum thermal efficiency of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burner</b> is obtained in 60 percent of the primary air. In the next step, by modelling the gas heater with a porous burner at various sizes and various equivalence ratios, produced heat fluxes were calculated and compared with those of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burner.</b> According to the results, although the gas heater of the pressure reduction station has not been designed for a porous burner, but utilizing a porous burner instead of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burner,</b> causes the thermal performance of the heater to increase. The increase of thennal performance at lean equivalence ratios is higher. ej 201...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of droplet evaporation {{in the overall}} fuel-air mixing process in liquid fuel spray flames is examined {{with a series of}} experiments in a simple <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>burner</b> burning a range of hydrocarbon fuels. Two types of fuel atomizers were studied—air-assist and pressure jet—which have substantially different operating characteristics. Fuel-air mixing rates were determined from time-average oxygen concentrations measured with overall burner operation stoichiometric. It is shown that with air-assist atomizers, the kinetic energy of the atomizer jet determines the mixing rate intensity for both liquid and gaseous fuels. Since the droplet evaporation time is much less than the mixing time, the details of the evaporation process are not important and the jet length scale and kinetic energy govern the mixing process. With pressure jet atomizers, the characteristic evaporation and mixing times are comparable. The evaporating fuel drops create fuel vapor concentration nonuniformities on a scale much smaller than the fuel jet scale. Mixing rate intensities comparable to those obtained with air-assist atomizers can, therefore, be achieved with much lower turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates.

40|$|Turbulent {{combustion}} occurs {{naturally in}} almost all combustion systems and involves complex dynamic coupling of chemical and fluid mechanical processes. It is considered {{as one of the}} most challenging combustion research problems today. Though buoyancy has little effect on power generating systems operating under high pressures (e. g., IC engines and turbines), flames in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burners</b> and the operation of small to medium furnaces and boilers are profoundly affected by buoyancy. Changes in burner orientation impacts on their blow-off, flash-back and extinction limits, and their range of operation, burning rate, heat transfer, and emissions. Theoretically, buoyancy is often neglected in turbulent combustion models. Yet the modeling results are routinely compared with experiments of open laboratory flames that are obviously affected by buoyancy. This inconsistency is an obstacle to reconciling experiments and theories. Consequently, a fundamental understanding of the coupling between turbulent flames and buoyancy is significant to both turbulent combustion science and applications. The overall effect of buoyancy relates to the dynamic interaction between the flame and its surrounding, i. e., the so-called elliptical problem. The overall flame shape, its flowfield, stability, and mean and local burning rates are dictated by both upstream and downstream boundary conditions. In steady propagating premixed flames, buoyancy affects the products region downstream of the flame zone. These effects are manifested upstream through the mean and fluctuating pressure fields to influence flame stretch and flame wrinkling. Intuitively, the effects buoyancy should diminish with increasing flow momentum. This is the justification for excluding buoyancy in turbulent combustion models that treats high Reynolds number flows. The objectives of our experimental research program is to elucidate flame-buoyancy coupling processes in laminar and turbulent premixed flames, and to characterize microgravity (micro g) premixed flames. The results are used to derive appropriate scaling parameters for guiding the development of theoretical models to include the effects of buoyancy. Knowledge gain from the analysis will also contribute to further understanding of the elliptical nature of premixed flames. Our current emphasis is to examine the momentum limit above which the effects of buoyancy would become insignificant. This is accomplished by comparing the flowfields and the mean properties of normal gravity flames (+g), and reversed gravity flames (-g, up-side-down flames) at different flow velocities and turbulence intensities. Microgravity (micro g) flames experiments provide the key reference data to reconcile the differences between flames in +g and -g. As flame configuration has significant impact on premixed flames characteristics we have studied axi-symmetric conical flames and plane-symmetric rod-stabilized v-flames. The two configurations produce distinct features that dictates how the flames couple with buoyancy. In a conical flame, the hot products plume completely envelopes the flame cone and shields the flame from direct interaction with the ambient air. The plume originates at the burner rim and generates a divergent flowfield. In comparison, the products region of v-flames forms between the twin flame sheets and it is convergent towards the center-plane. Interaction with ambient air is limited to the two end regions of the stabilized rod and beyond the flame sheets...|$|R

Additionally, integral scales are calculated for each of the combustion cases and from these, the Kolmogorov scales are derived. The flow field, imaged by PIV, show that the recirculation zone location along the major flow axis is strongly dependent on the presence of combustion.

Possible problems with sublimation, local gas heating or other multishot effects have been studied on an <b>atmospheric</b> co-flow <b>burner</b> prior to the engine experiments. It was found that, in this flame, fluences around 0. 1 J/cm 2 provide the best balance between signal-tobackground ratio, and soot sublimation. This fluence is well below the plateau regime of LII, which poses additional problems with interpretation of the signal. This is especially true when a wide span of temperatures and gradients is present, as encountered in diesel combustion.

To apply high-speed LII in an engine one should take utmost care with the selection of detection equipment (e. g. filters and detection gate) and settings to suppress the strong background radiation.

Three types of liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), namely pure propane, pure butane and a mixture (by weight) of 30 % propane and 70 % butane, were simulated at a fuel pressure of 300 mm WG. The CFD results show that for the same fuel supply pressure and gas orifice size, the mass flow rate of LPG fuel discharged into a burner was proportionate to its specific gravity. However, as compared to butane and LPG mixture, the propane fuel discharge velocity was the highest due to its lowest specific gravity. This subsequently produced the most negative static pressure values at a burner mixing tube throat and hence allowing the largest amount of primary air to be induced into an appliance. The amount of primary air required to initiate combustion by propane, LPG mixture and butane fuels was predicted to be approximately 72 %, 61 % and 54 % of stoichiometric requirement, respectively. These values are in good agreement with a typical range of primary air requirement for this type of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>burner.</b> The mixing rates of propane-air system were predicted to be much faster than that of LPG mixture-air and butane-air systems.

This project aims to investigate recent developments in combustion modeling and turbulence modeling in the context of engineering type Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis tools, applied to the main problem area of swirl-stabilized flexi-fuel flames. To perform a CFD simulation of reacting flows, kinetic information needs to be provided to the CFD code. Fully detailed kinetic mechanisms are expensive in terms of computer time when coupled with CFD and hence the use of global reaction mechanisms is preferable. Global mechanisms consist of a reduced number of reactions mostly one-way reactions which are governed by tuned Arrhenius rate expressions. The optimization at each equivalence ratio is here done by comparing results from Perfectly Stirred Reactor (PSR) calculations for both a detailed reference mechanism and the chosen multi-step global reaction mechanisms.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} 3 D {{turbulent}} reacting flow modeling of a SGT- 800 3 rd generation dry low emission (DLE) <b>burner</b> at both <b>atmospheric</b> and engine-like conditions. At <b>atmospheric</b> pressure the <b>burner</b> is fitted {{in a test}} rig with high pre-heating of the incoming air. To reduce the computational cost, the M 4 mechanism previously developed by Abou-Taouk et al. (2013) is used for operating pressure of 1 bar. A new novel optimized 4 -step reaction mechanism for methane-air mixture is developed in the present work at an operating pressure of 20 bar. The mechanism {{is based on a}} large sample of detailed chemistry solutions that are processed by an iterative optimization procedure. This leads to a reduced 4 -step mechanism, reproducing the targeted detailed chemistry solutions in terms of laminar flame speeds, species profiles and temperatures. The CFD simulations are performed using the combined eddy dissipation model / finite rate chemistry (EDM/FRC) turbulence chemistry interaction model. The turbulence is modeled using both the k-ω SST and the scale adaptive simulation (SAS) turbulence models. A comprehensive testing and measurement campaign carried out at atmospheric pressure for this burner was previously performed in a combustion test rig. The CFD results are compared to measurement data which includes for example flame position and pressure drop...|$|R
40|$|At low {{thermal power}} (< 5 kW) conditions, {{nitrogen}} {{and carbon dioxide}} were added as diluents to a premix of methane-oxygen in an <b>atmospheric</b> generic swirl <b>burner.</b> Results indicate that CO 2 -diluted oxy-methane flames have a wider stability range than N 2 -diluted flames in terms of overall oxygen concentration in the premix. Bulk flow Reynolds number, augmented by varying {{the size of the}} burner exit nozzle, was also found to increase the stability limits of flames diluted with both CO 2 and N 2, as the increased flow velocity offsets the higher burning velocity of the oxyfuel mixture. A combination of differing transport properties between diluents and the resulting flame chemistry produces a change {{in the structure of the}} premixed oxyfuel swirl flame, shown by combustion PIV to affect the observed lean and rich stability limits. Utilising the results at low thermal power conditions, enhanced-oxygen combustion of a methane-air flame was investigated in a pressurized generic swirl burner operating at higher thermal power (< 50 kW) conditions and pressures up to 3 bar absolute. Over a range of increasing thermal powers, it is seen that a relatively small amount of pure oxygen addition can shift the equivalence ratio at which the lean stability limit or rich stability limit are reached compared with the same phenomenon observed for a methane-air flame. Pressurised operation with CO 2 dilution up to 15. 5 mol...|$|R
