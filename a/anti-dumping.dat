5|$|The {{following}} day, April 22, 1920, the House reported {{its passage}} of the Maine bill to the Senate. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency; on April 28, Connecticut's George P. McLean reported it back with a recommendation that it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, fearing that though {{they were on the}} Senate's agenda for that day, they might not be reached, and believing urgent action was required. Utah Senator Reed Smoot objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an <b>anti-dumping</b> trade bill out of turn had just been objected to by Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the coin bills had not been reached by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' Charles Curtis asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Maine bill was enacted with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on May 10, 1920.|$|E

25|$|EC: Import tariffs {{as high as}} 31.2 {{percent were}} imposed on Indian {{exporters}} of ductile cast iron pipes by the European Commission. The measures, termed as <b>anti-dumping</b> tariffs, were decided by Brussels and aim to protect European Union manufacturers against low-cost imports.|$|E
25|$|The Revised Treaty {{also calls}} for {{harmonized}} regimes {{in a number of}} areas: <b>Anti-dumping</b> and countervailing measures, Banking and securities, Commercial arbitration, Competition policy, Consumer protection, Customs, Intellectual property rights, Regulation and labelling of food and drugs, Sanitary and phytosanitary measures, Standards and technical regulations & Subsidies.|$|E
25|$|Selected {{policies}} {{included the}} gradual {{reduction of tariffs}} (with the selective protection of certain key industries), an export financing mechanism {{through the creation of}} a Foreign Trade Bank (similar to the American Ex-Im Bank), reduction in customs duties, implementation of <b>anti-dumping</b> mechanisms and the use of government-generated demand for high-tech sectors.|$|E
25|$|The Commission {{reviewed}} {{these measures}} in December 2016 and proposed to extend them {{for two years}} until March 2019. However, in January 2017, 18 out of 28 EU member states {{voted in favor of}} shortening the extension period. In February 2017, the Commission announced its intention to extend its <b>anti-dumping</b> measures for a reduced period of 18 months.|$|E
25|$|China {{was the top}} {{exporter}} of steel {{in the world in}} 2008. Export volumes in 2008 were 59.23milliontons, a 5.5% fall over the previous year. The decline ended China's decade-old steel export growth. As of 2012 steel exports faced widespread <b>anti-dumping</b> taxes and had not returned to pre-2008 levels. Domestic demand remained strong, particularly in the developing west where steel production in Xinjiang was expanding.|$|E
25|$|As of November 2015, trade {{negotiations}} remained deadlocked {{after failing to}} resolve differences related to matters such as intellectual property rights (IPR), the levels of permissible FDI, market access, domestic-sourcing obligations in multi-brand retail, manufacture of generic medicines, <b>anti-dumping</b> safeguards, greenhouse gas emissions, civil nuclear energy generation legislation, farming subsidies, replacement of traditional cash-crops with sterile genetically engineered and patented variants, regulation & safeguards for the financial and insurance sectors, cooperation on controlling tax evasion & money laundering, overseas financing and monitoring of NGOs in India, work visa restrictions, technology transfer restrictions, cooperation on embargoes (Russia & Iran), etc.|$|E
25|$|Substantial {{investments}} {{were made}} in the manufacture of solar panels and wind generators by a number of companies, supported by liberal loans by banks and local governments. However, by 2012 manufacturing capacity had far outstripped domestic and global demand for both products, particularly solar panels, which were subjected to <b>anti-dumping</b> penalties by both the United States and Europe. The global oversupply has resulted in bankruptcies and production cutbacks both inside and outside China. China has budgeted $50 billion to subsidize production of solar power over the two decades following 2015 but, even at the sharply reduced price resulting from oversupply, as of 2012 cost of solar power in China remained three times that of power produced by conventional coal-fired power plants.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{applying}} in the UK, procedural {{legitimate expectation}} {{was approved by}} the Federal Court of Australia in GTE (Australia) Pty. Ltd. v. Brown (1986). In the case, the Minister of State for Administrative Services, acting on behalf of the Minister of State for Industry and Commerce, imposed <b>anti-dumping</b> duties on the applicant. The applicant brought legal proceedings claiming that the authorities had denied it natural justice by failing to comply with a promise to provide an opportunity for a hearing towards the close of the investigation on whether the duties should be levied, and by departing from certain procedures. Applying Ng Yuen Shiu and the GCHQ case, the Court agreed that the applicant's legitimate expectation had been frustrated by the failure to conduct a hearing, and that it had been unfair for the authorities not to follow the procedures.|$|E
25|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{went into}} effect on January 1, 1994, {{which led to the}} {{elimination}} of tariffs and other trade barriers between Mexico and the U.S. and serves as a multilateral platform for cooperation between both countries. The agreement increased trade volume and cooperation in both countries. The free trade agreement has been increasingly opposed by Mexican and U.S. farmers, with many groups and the political left presenting that it hurts the interest of traditional, small and local farmers in both countries. Allegations of violations of labor and environmental laws have been considered by the trilateral institutions. The Bush Administration argued that NAFTA had had modest positive impacts on all three member countries, but Mexican farmers have strongly criticized the effects of the agreement as they have become overshadowed by the large corporations benefiting from NAFTA. Notable bilateral trade disputes relate to trucking, tuna, sweeteners and <b>anti-dumping</b> measures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the factory tried to enter new markets with the {{production}} of bromine, but closed production after a fire destroyed the production facility only two weeks after completion in 1985. Due to increasing competition {{in the market for}} fertilizers and the lack of new products, company revenue fell from 570 million DM in 1985 to 370 million DM. The company posted increasing financial losses, partly due to its locational disadvantage as all raw materials and all final goods had to be transported by truck from the factory to Cologne's Rhine harbor. Another disadvantage was the location of the factory in a densely populated residential area and a decreasing acceptance of the pollution caused by the factory. Without operating profits a relocation of the factory was not feasible, and thus, without any prospects, the fertilizer production was shut down in 1989. Employment fell from 1400 employees in 1985 to 830 in 1990, with the factory only producing sodium carbonate, calcium chloride and phosphate for animal feed. Although losses were reduced to almost zero in 1990, the financial situation deteriorated in 1992 when the prices for sodium carbonate fell. The fall in prices was partly due to the lifting of <b>anti-dumping</b> on sodium carbonate imports from the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (ANSAC) by the European Commission. Another factor in the worsening financial situation was an antitrust fine of US$1.38 million imposed by the European commission for participating in a sodium carbonate cartel together with Solvay and Imperial Chemical Industries. Company revenue fell to 225 million DM and losses increased to 9.6 million DM. On December 23, 1993 all remaining production was shut down and all remaining 700 workers were laid off. Since then Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH is the name of a wholesale distributor of chemicals and subsidiary of K+S AG (named Kali und Salz AG until 1999). Company revenue in 2007 was 7.86 million Euro, down from 10.07 million Euro in 2004.|$|E

The company won $46 million in an <b>anti-dumping</b> case against China, which allowed the factory to keep running). In 2012, Vaughan-Bassett announced an $8 million expansion, including $4.5 million in new equipment and machinery upgrades and $1.5 million to purchase the old Webb Furniture Enterprises plant (which had closed in January 2006, eliminating 309 jobs).|$|E
2500|$|Khor {{argues that}} {{developing}} countries have not {{benefited from the}} WTO Agreements of the Uruguay Round and, therefore, {{the credibility of the}} WTO trade system could be eroded. According to Khor, [...] "one of the major categories of 'problems of implementation of the Uruguay Round' is the way the Northern countries have not lived up to the spirit of their commitments in implementing (or not implementing) their obligations agreed to in the various Agreements." [...] Khor also believes that the Doha Round negotiations [...] "have veered from their proclaimed direction oriented to a development-friendly outcome, towards a 'market access' direction in which developing countries are pressurised to open up their agricultural, industrial [...] and services sectors." [...] Jagdish Bhagwati asserts, however, that there is greater tariff protection on manufacturers in the poor countries, which are also overtaking the rich nations in the number of <b>anti-dumping</b> filings.|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then, the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties {{brought about a}} GATT <b>anti-dumping</b> Agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies {{was the first major}} attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on non-tariff barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called [...] "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two. Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to create some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty regime on a provisional basis.|$|E
50|$|The current set of <b>anti-dumping</b> laws in India {{is defined}} by Section 9A and 9B of Customs and Tariffs Act, 1975 (Amended 1995) and The <b>Anti-dumping</b> rules such as (Identification, Assessment and Collection of <b>Anti-dumping</b> Duty on Dumped Articles and for Determination of Injury) Rules of 1995, Section 9A of customs and tariffs Act 1975 states that “If any article is {{exported}} from any country or territory to India at less than its normal value, then, upon the importation of such article into India, the central government may by notification in the official gazette, impose an <b>anti-dumping</b> duty not exceeding the margin of dumping in relation to such article.” As of November 28, 2016, 353 <b>anti-dumping</b> cases has been initiated by Directorate General of <b>Anti-Dumping</b> and Allied Duties (DGAD) out of which in one hundred and thirty cases, <b>anti-dumping</b> measures are in force.

5000|$|<b>Anti-dumping</b> legislation: [...] "Dumping" [...] is the {{practice}} of firms selling to export markets at lower prices than are charged in domestic markets. Supporters of <b>anti-dumping</b> laws argue that they prevent import of cheaper foreign goods that would cause local firms to close down. However, in practice, <b>anti-dumping</b> laws are usually used to impose trade tariffs on foreign exporters.|$|E
50|$|European Union <b>anti-dumping</b> {{is under}} {{the purview of the}} European Council. It is governed by European Council {{regulation}} 384/96. However, implementation of <b>anti-dumping</b> actions (trade defence actions) is taken after voting by various committees with member state representation.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, South Africa imposed <b>anti-dumping</b> {{duties on}} Brazilian imports of frozen poultry products.

50|$|Another {{outcome of}} the Kennedy Round was the {{adoption}} of an <b>Anti-dumping</b> Code, which gave more precise guidance on the implementation of Article VI of the GATT. In particular, it sought to ensure speedy and fair investigations, and it imposed limits on the retrospective application of <b>anti-dumping</b> measures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anti-dumping</b> regimes involve {{imposing}} duties {{that represent}} the price difference between goods sold on the exporter’s domestic market and goods sold on the import market. Such measures protect against anti-competitive behaviour but are not a means of trade protection. The regimes are not entirely consistent with WTO-GATT aims to liberalise trade barriers and are declining in use in the international trading arena. However the Committee on <b>Anti-Dumping</b> Practices provides a forum for consultation and exchange of information. <b>Anti-dumping</b> measures can only operate where enacted by domestic legislation since they are enforced by the importing country.|$|E
