Old School RuneScape was opened to paying subscribers on 22 February 2013 after the poll received 50,000 votes, and a free-to-play version was later released on 19 February 2015. It was originally created as an exact copy of RuneScape from August 2007 and receives regular content additions. Old School RuneScape is entirely community based; for any proposed update or idea to pass into the game, it needs at least 75% {{of the community to}} vote Yes for it, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not pass it will either be dropped or reconstructed and re-polled so that the players may find the update more acceptable. On 17 July 2017, Jagex announced the development of a mobile version of Old School Runescape.|$|E

500|$|By 1957, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Ford, then age 31, {{might not make}} the Browns' roster. Ford arrived at training camp well above his playing weight, and rookie Bob Mischak was given Ford's spot in August. [...] When Mischak withdrew from the team, the spot was awarded to another rookie, Paul Wiggin. [...] Ford worked to shed pounds during training camp and worked to train the young defensive players, including Wiggin and Bill Quinlan. Rookie running back Jim Brown recalled that Ford pulled him aside during the 1957 training camp and gave him advice on dealing with the Browns' head coach Paul Brown. [...] Ford advised the rookie to {{keep his mouth shut}} and do as the coach set during practice and waiting until game day: [...] "Run it your way in the game and hope it works, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> don't say anything.

500|$|Players {{who become}} Harbingers start {{collecting}} Keystones either by landing on {{them on the}} game board, or by taking them from other players by dueling. Soul Rangers cannot collect Keystones by landing on them; instead, they chase down other players and steal their Keystones. Players must collect the six Keystones of different colours to win. Although players only need one keystone per colour, players can collect more than one which can prevent other players from completing the game. Each Keystone gives players different powers, depending on which Harbinger they are, the list of powers being described {{on the back of}} the character's card. When players have collected the Keystones, they can win the game by returning home to the central hub. Then they must roll a six on the dice; a fear is picked from the well of fears, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not correspond to the player's earlier expressed [...] "greatest fear", that player wins the game. Otherwise, players must return to their headstone and try again. If none of players is able to win the game within sixty minutes, the Gatekeeper is the winner.|$|E
