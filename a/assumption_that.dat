5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are based on the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E
40|$|Controller {{synthesis}} is {{the automatic}} construction a correct system from its specification. This often requires {{assumptions about the}} behaviour of the environment. It is difficult for the designer to identify the <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> ensures {{the existence of a}} correct controller, and doing so manually can lead to <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> are stronger than necessary. As a consequence the generated controllers are suboptimal in terms of robustness. In this work, given a specification, we identify the weakest <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> ensure the existence of a controller. We also consider two important classes of assumptions: the ones that can be ensured by the environment and <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> restricts only inputs of the systems. We show <b>that</b> optimal <b>assumptions</b> correspond to strongly winning strategies, admissible strategies and remorse-free strategies depending on the classes. Using these correspondences, we then propose an algorithm for computing optimal <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> can be ensured by the environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{mobile code}} systems, {{programs}} or processes travel from host to host {{in order to}} accomplish their goals. Such systems violate some of the <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> underlie most existing computer security implementations. In order to make these new systems secure, we {{will have to deal with}} a number of issues that previous systems have been able to ignore or sidestep. This paper surveys the <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> mobile code systems violate (including the identification of programs with persons, and other <b>assumptions</b> <b>that</b> follow from that), the new security issues that arise, and some of the ways that these issues will be addressed. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science.

5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration.

He was a regular selection over the next 12 months, and finished his under-21 career with ten caps. His last appearances came as Spain were eliminated by Sweden in the qualification play-offs for the 2004 European Under-21 Championships.|$|E
