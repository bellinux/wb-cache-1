40|$|Compressed air {{is a major}} {{component}} of energy costs incurred in the weaving of textile fabrics on air-jet looms. The consumption of compressed air in air-jet weaving depends on different process variables. In this study, the effect of weft yarn count, reed count, fabric width and loom speed on the compressed air consumption of air-jet loom was determined using response surface methodology. Fabric width was found to be the most dominant factor affecting the air consumption followed by loom speed, reed count, and weft yarn count respectively. A statistical model for predicting the compressed air consumption on air-jet loom was developed. The prediction ability and accuracy of the developed model was assessed by the fitted line plot between the predicted and <b>actual</b> <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> values. The prediction model may be used for optimizing the production planning, estimating the share of compressed air cost in weaving a particular fabric style, and in identifying any air wastages in the weaving shed by comparing the actual compressed air consumption with that predicted by the model which was developed under controlled conditions without any air leakages...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} three {{methods of}} measuring the air infiltration heat recovery in buildings. The blower door method estimates the air infiltration heat recovery using a test which takes {{less than one}} hour, and gives information to the contractors making retrofit decisions. The co-heating method identifies {{the relationship between the}} infiltration heat recovery and the air flow rate using two or three nights of testing. This method has higher accuracy than the blower door method and is suitable for use by both contractors and researchers. Finally, the STAM (short term average method) investigates the relationship between air infiltration heat recovery and air flow rate, air flow direction, and solar radiation. This is a comprehensive method which is most suitable for use by researchers. This report is presented to the Texas Higher Education Coordination Board as a deliverable under the Energy Research and Applications Program Project # 227, which targeted reducing the design size of HVAC systems in houses since the <b>actual</b> <b>air</b> infiltration energy <b>consumption</b> is less than the design values due to air infiltration heat recovery in house components...|$|R

40|$|Currently used jet {{vacuum ejector}} has a defect of high <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> {{due to its}} {{requirement}} of continuous air supply. Focusing on this problem, {{a new type of}} piston vacuum generator (PVG for short) has been researched. The PVG has two pairs of pistons. One is for driving and another is for vacuum generating. Besides the maximum vacuum value, the vacuum response time and <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> are the most concerning performances. Special structural design is made so as to meet all the requirements, in which the unequal diameters of pistons, using directional control valves instead of the check valves and stepped flow rate control scheme are proposed and realized. Experimental results have shown that for the prototype of piston vacuum generator its maximum vacuum is about 93 kPa, the response time is about 3. 7 s and the <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> is reduced by about 71. 3 % in time interval of 60 s compared to the same level of vacuum ejector...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the mass, substance and energy flow through two-stroke low speed Diesel engines. For this reason, a zero-dimensional model of the combustion in the engine was developed with a calculated amount and composition of exhaust gases. Due to the large amount of oxygen in the exhaust gases, a ratio of real <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> and stoichiometric amount of air required for combustion of injected fuel was set. The calculated ratio showed that the engine consumed four times more air than needed for combustion in AFRstoich. In this work, this was called the <b>Air</b> <b>Consumption</b> Factor or Ratio, and has not previously been mentioned in scientific literature. The <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> ratio is defined as a factor of dry or humid air.

40|$|In Textile industry, {{production}} is mostly key concern for Industry owner. This always has attracted researchers and machines manufacturers {{to make new}} developments in process and machines. Air-jet {{is one of the}} leading and successful highest productive weaving machines. However, it is now well established that due to add of charges of compressed air, manufacturing cost of air-jet weaving machine is higher as compared with rapier and projectile weaving machines. This is why countries having energy issues do not prefer air-jet weaving machines comparing projectile weaving machines. In this regard, several researchers and machine manufacturers have continuously been working to improve the efficiency of air-jet weft insertion. However, industry practice is as important as design made by researchers. The aim of this research is to investigate the <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> of air-jet weaving on industrial scale practice. In this study, five weaving machine of same manufacturer and model were selected. It was observed that despite of manufacturing same quality of fabric, <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> was varying almost in all weaving machines. Conventionally, mill workers adopt hit and trial practice in weaving industry including airpressure setting which leads to variation of nozzle pressure. Main reason of disparity of <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> in air-jet weaving machines may be variation of distance from compressor to weaving machines, number of joints, un-necessary valve opening and pipes leakages cause an increase of compressed <b>air</b> <b>consumption...</b>|$|R
