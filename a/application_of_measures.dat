The technique of measures of noncompactness is frequently applicable in several branches of nonlinear analysis, in particular the technique {{turns out to be}} a very useful tool in the existence theory for several types of integral and integral-differential equations. Furthermore, they are often used in the functional equations, fractional partial differential equations, ordinary and partial differential equations, operator theory and optimal control theory [1, 3, 7, 13, 15, 16, 17, 26, 28, 29].

The bias {{of a common}} indicator of "&sgr;"-convergence is examined {{for a family of}} spatial process models including: [a] spatial lag, [b] spatial error, and [c] spatial moving average. We show that the measure of "&sgr;"-convergence is sensitive to a number of distinct influences including global dispersion, spatial dependence, and a variety of forms of spatial heterogeneity. We suggest a decomposition of the convergence indicator into two components: one reflecting global dispersion, and one reflecting the influence of spatial effects. We then illustrate this approach with a case study of the U. S. states over the 1929 - 2000 period. Copyright (c) 2006 the author(s). Journal compilation (c) 2006 RSAI. ...|$|E
