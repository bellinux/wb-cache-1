5|$|Model {{chose to}} make his initial attacks using {{infantry}} divisions reinforced with assault guns and heavy tanks, and supported by artillery and the Luftwaffe. In doing so he sought to maintain the armoured strength of his panzer divisions {{to be used for}} exploitation once the Red Army defences were breached. Once <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> had been achieved the panzer forces would move through and advance towards Kursk. Jan Möschen, a major in Model's staff, later commented that Model expected <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> on the second day. If <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> did occur the briefest delay in bringing up the panzer divisions would give the Red Army time to react. His corps commanders thought <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> extremely unlikely.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day, 9 July, {{a meeting of}} the commanders of the German forces on the northern side of the Kursk salient concluded that <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> on the northern side of the salient was unlikely. Nevertheless, they decided to continue their offensive to maintain pressure and inflict casualties, thereby tying down the Soviet forces there. Any level of success for Operation Citadel now depended on <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> being achieved by 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf on the southern side of the Kursk salient.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the letter, the {{estimated}} material necessary for a fission chain reaction was several tons.

5|$|Mullum Malarum, <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> for Rajinikanth, {{became a}} {{milestone}} in Tamil cinema; it focused on visual realism, without excessive melodrama.

5|$|Another push against Bosanski Brod was {{launched}} on 27 September. The advance initially had moderate success, until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces, changing the {{sector of the}} bridgehead against which the 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated. The move managed to disrupt the HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough,</b> capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October. In response, the HV and the HVO withdrew their troops and equipment in an orderly fashion, and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams, dominating in possession {{and the number of}} chances created. Tottenham created their best chance to score in the first half, but struggled to find <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in the second half, hardly troubling the Arsenal defence. With neither team able to score after 90 minutes, the match ended in a draw, meaning each team held the trophy for six months each.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> in {{creating}} a strong light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{opponent}} in the fourth round was Leeds United. The match was played at Elland Road on 27 January 2001 {{in front of a}} near-capacity crowd of 37,108. The home team enjoyed much of the possession, but struggled to find <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> as Liverpool's defence stood firm. Two minutes before full-time, Barmby, on as a substitute, scored the winning goal, rebounding a shot that came off the post. Barmby then turned provider for Liverpool's second, setting-up Heskey to score.|$|E

5|$|Once {{again the}} fatal {{weakness}} of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{rising to}} power in Germany, Adolf Hitler {{approved}} the creation of Germany's first panzer divisions. Simplifying his earlier proposal, Guderian suggested {{the design of a}} main combat vehicle, which would be developed into the Panzer III, and <b>a</b> <b>breakthrough</b> tank, the Panzer IV. No existing design appealed to Guderian. As a stopgap, the German Army ordered a preliminary vehicle to train German tank crews. This became the Panzer I.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{north of}} Taegu on September 11 {{in the vicinity}} of Hills 660 and 314 was heavy and confused.

Johnson stated later that any company of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, that had 100 men during this period was his assault company for the day.|$|E
