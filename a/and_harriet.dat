5|$|Blaine’s {{career as}} a Republican newspaperman led {{naturally}} to involvement in Republican party politics. In 1856, he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention. From the party’s early days, Blaine identified with the conservative wing, supporting Supreme Court Justice John McLean for the presidential nomination over the more radical John C. Frémont, the eventual nominee. The following year, Blaine was offered the editorship of the Portland Daily Advertiser, which he accepted, selling {{his interest in the}} Journal soon thereafter. He still maintained his home in Augusta, however, with his growing family. Although Blaine’s first son, Stanwood, died in infancy, he <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> had two more sons soon afterward: Walker, in 1855, and Emmons, in 1857. They would have four more children in years to come: Alice, James, Margaret, <b>and</b> <b>Harriet.</b> It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife's new denomination, becoming a member of the South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta.|$|E

5|$|After working {{together}} on other projects, director Martin Ritt and Paul Newman co-founded Salem Productions and the company made a three-film deal with Paramount Studios. For its first film Salem hired husband-and-wife scriptwriters Irving Ravetch <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> Frank, Jr., who worked with Ritt and Newman on The Long, Hot Summer. Ravetch found Larry McMurtry's novel, Horseman, Pass By, in an airport shop during a Dallas stopover and presented the project to Ritt and Newman after reading a description of Hud Bannon. The partners met Ravetch and Frank at their home, approved the project and the writers adapted the script.|$|E
5|$|Hud is a 1963 film {{directed}} by Martin Ritt and starring Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas and Patricia Neal. It {{was produced by}} Ritt and Newman's recently founded company, Salem Productions, and was their first film for Paramount Pictures. Hud was filmed on location on the Texas Panhandle, including Claude, Texas. Its screenplay was by Irving Ravetch <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> Frank, Jr. and was based on Larry McMurtry's 1961 novel, Horseman, Pass By. The film's title character, Hud Bannon, was a minor character in the original screenplay but was reworked as the lead role. With its main character an antihero, Hud was later described as a revisionist Western.|$|E

5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act. They claimed that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the requirements as amended by the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E

5|$|Reginald Pinney {{was born}} in 1863 in Clifton, Bristol, the eldest son of the Reverend John Pinney, vicar of Coleshill, Warwickshire, and his wife, Harriet.

5|$|The divorce {{meant that}} Skelton {{had lost his}} married man's deferment; he was once again {{classified}} as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the army in early 1944; both MGM and his radio sponsor tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, {{the day before he}} was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to Special Services at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, The Adventures of Ozzie <b>and</b> <b>Harriet.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's {{main project}} was The Balkan Trilogy, a {{sequence}} of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they {{live and work in}} Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, <b>and</b> <b>Harriet,</b> a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person. There was significant fictionalisation, however. While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.|$|E

5|$|Childe {{was born}} on 14 April 1892 in Sydney, New South Wales. He was the only {{surviving}} child of the Reverend Stephen Henry (1844–1923) <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> Eliza Childe (1853–1910), a middle-class couple of English descent. Stephen Childe was a second-generation Anglican priest, ordained into the Church of England in 1867 after gaining a BA from the University of Cambridge. Becoming a teacher, in 1871 he married Mary Ellen Latchford, together having five children. They moved to Australia in 1878. It was here that Mary died, and in 1886 Stephen married Harriet, an Englishwoman from a wealthy background who had moved to Australia as a child. Gordon Childe was raised alongside five half-siblings at his father's palatial country house, the Chalet Fontenelle, in the township of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. Reverend Childe worked as the minister for St. Thomas' Parish, but proved unpopular, arguing with his congregation and taking unscheduled holidays.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and {{encouraged}} his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} people have lived {{on or near the}} St. Johns, {{including}} Paleo-indians, Archaic people, Timucua, Mocama, French and Spanish settlers, Seminoles, slaves and freemen, Florida crackers, land developers, tourists and retirees. It {{has been the subject of}} William Bartram's journals, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' books, <b>and</b> <b>Harriet</b> Beecher Stowe's letters home. Although Florida was the location of the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States, it was the last U.S. territory on the east coast to be developed; it remained an undeveloped frontier into the 20th century. When attention was turned to the state, however, much of the land was rapidly overdeveloped in a national zeal for progress. The St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers. It suffered severe pollution and human interference that has diminished the natural order of life in and around the river. In all, 3.5 million people live within the various watersheds that feed into the St. Johns River. The St. Johns, named one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998, was number 6 on a list of America's Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008. Restoration efforts are under way for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida continues to deal with population increases in the river's vicinity.|$|E
