5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC's Shetland (TV series) {{was filmed}} on {{mainland}} Scotland, {{the cast and}} crew did work in Shetland on occasion, particularly in and near Lerwick.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first film's cast {{returned}} for the sequel, Anne Hathaway {{was replaced by}} Hayden Panettiere {{in the role of}} Red and Jim Belushi was replaced by Martin Short in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{industry}} that dominated Worsley was in decline, in 1937 Sir Montague Maurice Burton opened a clothing factory along the East Lancashire Road. Built in the Art Deco style, in 1938 the factory employed 3,000people.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{upper reaches}} are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, {{there is still}} significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept the navigation profitable for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SSSI is {{in private}} hands, {{considerable}} areas are managed by large conservation organisations. As {{well as the}} two NNRs, there is an RSPB reserve at Titchwell Marsh, and Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserves are at Cley and Salthouse Marshes. The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR. In addition to Blakeney Point, the National Trust owns land at Brancaster Staithe.|$|E
5|$|Some {{have speculated}} that a {{contributor}} to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation. By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lighter presentations and new techniques remained.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> House <b>of</b> Assembly was {{overseen by}} a Governor {{appointed}} by the Company (from 1684, by <b>the</b> Crown), <b>although,</b> for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony's history, the real political power lay with <b>the</b> appointed Council <b>of</b> Bermuda, composed of members of Bermuda's wealthy merchant class.|$|R

5|$|The {{church was}} {{assigned}} as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913, {{only to have}} its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915, falling through the roof. General de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 6 April 1921 at the cathedral. The building experienced extensive damage during World War II, and was partially rebuilt, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old altar and furnishings were not replaced.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{defensible}} barracks made of brick, {{faced in}} Kentish ragstone on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is indented to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel shutters. The {{first floor of}} the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort's interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{location}} <b>of</b> Warps publishing varied {{according to}} <b>the</b> home city <b>of</b> its editor, <b>although</b> during <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> later 1980s {{it was based}} in Christchurch, and during the early and mid 1990s it was based in Dunedin. At times the magazines schedule was erratic, especially during the late 1980s and shortly before its demise in the late 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Germany Valley is {{a scenic}} upland valley high in <b>the</b> Allegheny Mountains <b>of</b> eastern West Virginia {{originally}} settled by German (including Pennsylvania Dutch) {{farmers in the}} mid-18th Century. It is today a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monongahela National Forest, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Valley remains in private hands.|$|R

5|$|Additional optical {{effects were}} {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. Meyer and the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, as had {{been done in the}} original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. At {{least some of the}} rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E
5|$|Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican Congress {{passed a}} series of laws that seemed to {{discriminate}} against Anglo colonists {{in the province of}} Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between the Anglo citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military supported the administration of President Anastasio Bustamante, Antonio López de Santa Anna led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> city <b>of</b> Danzig had {{suffered}} a slow economic decline during <b>the</b> wars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early eighteenth century and had been held by the Russians {{for a short time}} after <b>the</b> Siege <b>of</b> Danzig in 1734. During Corry’s time <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Danzig remained part <b>of</b> Poland <b>although,</b> for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, it was surrounded by Prussian held territory.|$|R
50|$|On 9 August 1798, it lost {{territory}} to establish <b>the</b> Diocese <b>of</b> Minsk (in Belarus); {{the same year}} it was raised to Metropolitan Archdiocese <b>of</b> Mohilev. <b>The</b> archdiocese remained the Latin Metropolitan see for Russia throughout imperial times and the Soviet period, <b>although</b> for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter period it was <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> repression and had no incumbent archbishop.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> is made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{collaboration}} between James Stewart and Anthony Mann, Robert Ryan also teamed with Mann in The Naked Spur, Men in War, and God's Little Acre.|$|R
5|$|Brenton came up {{with the}} idea to show an episode dealing with a Muslim hero set out to stop a group of Islamic terrorists. Brenton and the {{producers}} researched elements of Islam in order to provide a balanced view towards the religion, as well as the nature of the plot and to show Muslims in the episode who oppose the extremists among their religion. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode was set in Birmingham, it was filmed entirely in London. The episode sees the introduction of regular character Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), and the return of Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who first appeared in the first episode and returned so that the character's role can be expanded.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on {{the charge}} of high treason. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had {{secretly}} negotiated with Louis XIV, trying {{to reach an agreement}} under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus {{was seldom}} {{mentioned}} during the Cold War and his pre-war biography was only reprinted in the Lithuanian émigré press, {{particularly in the}} US During the 1950s articles about Marcinkus {{began to appear in}} these newspapers, including Karys, Vienas iš daugelio (1950), Paskutinis žuvusiojo lakūno atvirukas (1955), and Kapitono Marcinkaus mirtis nelaisvėje (1956). The first significant publication discussing Marcinkus in Soviet Lithuania appeared in a 1967 issue of the journal Švytūrys. Thereinafter Marcinkus's life was more frequently mentioned, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information presented was inaccurate and incomplete.|$|E

50|$|New Ashford is {{bordered by}} Williamstown to the north, Adams to the east, Cheshire to the southeast, Lanesborough to the south, and Hancock to the west. New Ashford is 11 mi north of Pittsfield, 57 mi {{northwest}} of Springfield, and 140 mi west-northwest <b>of</b> Boston (<b>although,</b> like <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berkshires, it {{is closer to}} both Hartford and Albany than its own state capital).|$|R
50|$|After {{dropping}} sports, {{the station}} took on its current callsign, {{as well as}} an Oldies format, largely provided by Scott Shannon's The True Oldies Channel from ABC Radio; The Oldies format was discontinued on April 13, 2009. WPRV moved to a Business News and Talk format, including shows from Bloomberg Radio, <b>although</b> today <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business programming has been scaled back and replaced with syndicated talk shows.|$|R
5|$|The Allies {{initially}} {{adopted a}} strategy of blocking land and sea approaches to southern Greece. Thus, in August 480BC, after hearing of Xerxes' approach, a small Allied army led by Spartan King Leonidas I blocked the Pass of Thermopylae, while an Athenian-dominated navy sailed to the Straits of Artemisium. Famously, the massively outnumbered Greek army held Thermopylae for three days before being outflanked by the Persians, who used a little-known mountain path. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek army retreated, the rearguard, formed of the Spartan and Thespian contingents, was surrounded and annihilated. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium, consisting {{of a series of}} naval encounters, was up to that point a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Greeks also retreated, since holding the straits was now a moot point.|$|E
5|$|The British and Germans {{had been}} {{competing}} in radar technology {{for nearly a}} decade at this point, with the German technology often at the same level as the British or surpassing them due to heavy investment in the fledgling technology. By the beginning of World War II, Britain had devised effective radar systems, primarily through the work of Robert Watson-Watt, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technology was still rudimentary in nature and Watson-Watt and other scientists had failed to devise an effective night-defence system in time for the German nighttime bombing of Britain during 1940.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{continues}} {{to pose a}} serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, the one with the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano's glacier mass has retreated, a significant volume of ice still sits atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to 200million cubic meterssimilar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to 100km along river valleys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Although</b> fragmentary, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gigantomachy frieze {{has been}} restored. <b>The</b> general {{sequence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures and <b>the</b> identifications <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approximately sixty gods and goddesses {{have been more}} or less established. The names and positions of most Giants remain uncertain. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Giants have been determined by inscription, while their positions are often conjectured on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> which gods fought which Giants in Apollodorus' account.|$|R
5000|$|Converse is {{a nearly}} extinct American unincorporated {{community}} in Indiana's Blackford County. <b>Although</b> not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community remains, the U.S. Geological Survey considers it a populated place. The community existed as a [...] "flag" [...] station along a railroad, and {{is named after}} railroad executive Joel N. Converse.
