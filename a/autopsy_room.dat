40|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century, hand hygiene (HH) in {{medicine}} and healthcare {{has emerged as a}} significant concept in the prevention of infection. The basic notion has been present for a considerable time; yet it was chiefly the observations of the Hungarian obstetrician, Ignaz Semmelweis (1818 - 65), that highlighted the implications of HH upon patient health. Whilst at the General Hospital of Vienna in 1846, Semmelweis noted that parturient women who were attended to by physicians and medical students had a significantly higher mortality rate of puerperal fever- an endemic of which was present at the time-than those who were attended to solely by midwives. [1] Through his series of meticulous observations, he noticed that the basis of this was the fact that physicians and students attended autopsies and midwives did not; hence, he hypothesised, the causative agent was transmitted from the <b>autopsy</b> <b>rooms</b> to the obstetric wards, mostly likely via the hands.

40|$|Introduction. Formaldehyde is a noxious gas used as {{a tissue}} {{preservative}} of cadavers in <b>autopsy</b> <b>rooms.</b> Therefore, exposure to higher concentrations applies particularly to laboratory staff, anatomists and medical students. Prolonged exposure to formaldehyde is associated with clinical complications. Objective. To assess whether exposure to repeated inhalation of low concentrations of formaldehyde (FA) experienced during a gross anatomy course triggers subjective clinical symptoms in medical students. Material and methods. All 198 first-year medical students of the Medical University of Lublin, Poland (28 % with allergy history and 72 % without allergy history; 69 % male and 31 % female) responded to a questionnaire concerning their subjective FA-related clinical symptoms. Differences in proportions of experienced symptoms between allergic vs. nonallergic, and female vs. males were compared by the Mann-Whitney U test. Results. Even though formaldehyde concentrations in the gross anatomy laboratory were relatively low (0. 47 – 0. 57 mg/m 3), medical students experienced various reactions (lacrimation in 85. 9 %, red eyes, dry and itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing, and headache in > 50 % of students, cough in 44 %, and dry throat or throat irritation in 42 % of students). Among students {{with a history of}} allergy, eye, nose, skin and respiratory system symptoms occurred more frequently in comparison to nonallergic students. Female individuals demonstrated higher sensitivity to FA exposure. Conclusions. Exposure to formaldehyde may result in development of clinical symptoms in medical students. Particularly unpleasant symptoms may be experienced by individuals with allergy history. It is necessary to decrease formaldehyde concentrations in the anatomy dissection laboratory...|$|R

30|$|Although we can {{successfully}} remove leads with mechanical dilator sheath extraction systems, procedure has serious life threatening complications. The Evolution {{is a big}} bulky device {{and has to be}} used by at least two experienced operators one holding the lead and stylet complex and other one cutting fibrotic attachments and advancing the dilator sheath. If their manipulations are not optimally coordinated the lead’s integrity can be easily damaged and heart and great vessels may be injured during the procedure. Major complications with percutaneous lead extraction procedures are cardiac rupture (1 – 4  %), emergency cardiac surgery requirement (1 – 2  %) and death (0.4 – 0.8  %) (Henrikson and Brinker 2008). In our experience we had 4.8  % major and 12.2  % minor complication rates. These rates may be due to our relatively early experience, older age of patients and long implantation duration in our study. Compared to our preliminary results (Kocabas et al. 2015) clinical and procedural success rates are similar but, our minor complication rates declined and less snare use is needed with more experience with the extraction system. Learning curve mostly occurs during first 10 – 20 cases and when compared with our previous report need for snares 20  % and other minor complications 25  % decreased to 12.2  %. Only one additional case of snaring was required in our second half of experience and other minor complications which we reported in preliminary results did not occur. Snaring was needed mostly in patients who have passive fixation electrodes and previously damaged leads. However there was one case of mortality in our series. That patient suffered sudden cardiac arrest with electromechanical dissociation without any pericardial or pleural effusion, arrythmia or profound hypotension in intensive care unit 4  h after successful procedure. He did not respond to iv fluids vasopressors and cardiopulmoner resuscitation and expired before being taken into the cardiovascular surgery <b>room.</b> <b>Autopsy</b> was not performed but tear and late rupture of great vessels is suspected because two mechanical dilator sheaths (11 F and 13 F) were used in this patient to complete the extraction procedure. Experience of the operator is important in preventing complications with these extraction systems; (Smith and Love 2008) and procedure must be performed at high volume cardiovascular centers with emergency cardiovascular surgery backup.|$|R
