5|$|In his 50s Rockefeller {{suffered}} from moderate depression and digestive troubles; during a stressful {{period in the}} 1890s he developed <b>alopecia,</b> the loss of some or all body hair.|$|E
5|$|Cardiomyopathy, {{heart murmur}} and other cardiac issues {{were present in}} 17.2% of {{responses}} while dermatolic conditions such as dermatitis or <b>alopecia</b> were reported by 10.8% of responses. Salukis have an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years, {{which is similar to}} other breeds of their size.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank <b>alopecia,</b> vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
25|$|Male pattern {{hair loss}} {{is also known}} as {{androgenic}} <b>alopecia,</b> androgenetic <b>alopecia</b> (AGA), <b>alopecia</b> androgenetica and male pattern baldness (MPB).|$|E
25|$|Ketoconazole shampoo in {{conjunction}} with an oral 5α-reductase inhibitor has been used off label to treat androgenic <b>alopecia.</b> The antifungal properties of ketoconazole reduce scalp microflora and consequently may reduce follicular inflammation that contributes to <b>alopecia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neutered {{dogs have}} also been known to develop hormone-responsive <b>alopecia</b> (hair loss).|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy induced {{hair loss}} occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can {{manifest}} as <b>alopecia</b> totalis, telogen effluvium, or less often <b>alopecia</b> areata. It is {{usually associated with}} systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss, although permanent cases can occur. Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.|$|E
25|$|Follicular {{dysplasia}} is {{a genetic}} disease of dogs causing <b>alopecia,</b> or hair loss. It {{is caused by}} hair follicles that are misfunctioning due to structural abnormality. There are several types, some affecting only certain breeds. Diagnosis is achieved through a biopsy, and treatment is rarely successful. Certain breeds, such as the Mexican Hairless Dog and Chinese Crested Dog, are bred specifically for <b>alopecia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{cross-sectional}} {{studies have}} found associations between early androgenic <b>alopecia,</b> insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, with low HDL being the component of metabolic syndrome with highest association. Linolenic and linoleic acids, two major dietary sources of HDL, are 5 alpha reductase inhibitors. Premature androgenic <b>alopecia</b> and insulin resistance may be a clinical constellation that represents the male homologue, or phenotype, of polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A {{catalogue}} of illnesses and their symptoms. Some examples are <b>alopecia,</b> asthma, worms, cramps, flesh wounds, fluxes, and gout.|$|E
25|$|GSE {{has been}} found to be {{associated}} with <b>alopecia</b> areata (patchy baldness) whereas regrowth did not necessarily occur on a gluten free diet.|$|E
25|$|Expression of {{the color}} {{dilution}} gene is a disorder called Color Dilution <b>Alopecia.</b> Although not life-threatening, these dogs can develop skin problems.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{premature}} age effect is Werner's syndrome, {{a condition of}} accelerated aging from low-fidelity copying of mRNA. Affected children display premature androgenic <b>alopecia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The only {{published}} {{study to}} test correlation between ejaculation frequency and baldness was probably {{large enough to}} detect an association (1390 subjects) and found no correlation, although persons with only vertex androgenetic <b>alopecia</b> had had fewer female sexual partners than those of other androgenetic <b>alopecia</b> categories (such as frontal or both frontal and vertex). One study may not be enough, especially in baldness, {{where there is a}} complex with age. Marital status has been shown in some studies to influence hair loss in cross-sectional studies (NHANES1).|$|E
25|$|Follicular {{dysplasia}} is {{a genetic}} disease of dogs causing <b>alopecia,</b> or hair loss. It {{is caused by}} hair follicles that are misfunctioning due to structural abnormality.|$|E
25|$|Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, {{stretch marks}} (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth), {{androgenic}} <b>alopecia</b> (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema.|$|E
25|$|In {{support of}} the association, {{finasteride}} improves glucose metabolism and decreases glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c, a surrogate marker for diabetes mellitus. The low SHBG seen with premature androgenic <b>alopecia</b> is also associated with insulin resistance.|$|E
25|$|Having another {{autoimmune}} diseases is a {{risk factor}} to develop Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and the opposite is also true. Autoimmune diseases most commonly associated to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, and <b>alopecia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Female-pattern {{hair loss}} more often causes diffuse {{thinning}} without hairline recession; similar to its male counterpart, female androgenic <b>alopecia</b> rarely leads to total hair loss. The Ludwig scale grades severity of female-pattern hair loss.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alopecia</b> (loss of {{hair from}} the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes) may occur. Skin lesions may be {{secondarily}} infected by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or fungi such as Candida albicans. These skin lesions are accompanied by diarrhoea.|$|E
25|$|The convalescent {{phase is}} {{characterized}} by gradual tissue depigmentation of skin with vitiligo and poliosis, sometimes with nummular depigmented scars, as well as <b>alopecia</b> and diffuse fundus depigmentation resulting in a classic orange-red discoloration ("sunset glow fundus") and retinal pigment epithelium clumping and/or migration.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{models of}} {{androgenic}} <b>alopecia</b> occur naturally {{and have been}} developed in transgenic mice; chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes); bald uakaris (Cacajao rubicundus); and stump-tailed macaques (Macaca speciosa and M. arctoides). Of these, macaques have demonstrated the greatest incidence and most prominent degrees of hair loss.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 Ferrario shaved {{her hair}} off {{to raise money}} and {{awareness}} for cancer, <b>alopecia</b> and trichotillomania. She then grabbed the attention of fashion photographer Peter Coulson who photographed Ferrario for his book In My Pants, a charitable publication to raise money and awareness for cancer and the Cancer Council (Australia).|$|E
25|$|Classic male-pattern {{hair loss}} begins above the temples and vertex (calvaria) of the scalp. As it progresses, a rim of {{hair at the}} sides and rear of the head remains. This has been {{referred}} to as a 'Hippocratic wreath', and rarely progresses to complete baldness. The Hamilton-Norwood scale has been developed to grade androgenic <b>alopecia</b> in males.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to normal biological functions, DHT also {{plays an important}} causative role {{in a number of}} androgen-dependent conditions including skin and hair conditions like acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss (androgenic <b>alopecia</b> or pattern baldness) and prostate diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. 5α-Reductase inhibitors, which prevent DHT synthesis, are effective in the prevention and treatment of these conditions.|$|E
25|$|Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an {{autosomal}} recessive metabolic disorder affecting the uptake of zinc through the inner {{lining of the}} bowel, the Mucous membrane. It is characterized by {{inflammation of the skin}} (dermatitis) around bodily openings (periorificial) and the tips of fingers and toes (acral), hair loss (<b>alopecia),</b> and diarrhea. It can also be related to deficiency of zinc due to other, ie. congenital causes.|$|E
25|$|Inherited {{metabolic}} disorders {{characterized by}} deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include {{deficiencies in the}} enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase or biotinidase. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively, and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. Biochemical and clinical manifestations include: ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, skin rash, feeding problems, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, <b>alopecia,</b> and coma.|$|E
25|$|This {{decrease}} in androgens and androgen receptors, {{and the increase}} in SHBG are opposite the increase in androgenic <b>alopecia</b> with aging. This is not intuitive, as testosterone and its peripheral metabolite, DHT, accelerate hair loss, and SHBG is thought to be protective. The ratio of T/SHBG, DHT/SHBG decreases by as much as 80% by age 80, in numeric parallel to hair loss, and approximates the pharmacology of antiandrogens such as finasteride.|$|E
25|$|Reeve {{suffered}} from asthma and allergies since childhood. At age 16, {{he began to}} suffer from <b>alopecia</b> areata, a condition that causes patches of hair to fall out from an otherwise healthy head of hair. Generally, {{he was able to}} comb over it and often the problem disappeared for long periods. Later in life, the condition became more noticeable after he became paralyzed, and he would have his head shaved.|$|E
25|$|Female {{androgenic}} <b>alopecia</b> {{has become}} a growing problem that, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, affects around 30million women in the United States. Although hair loss in females normally occurs {{after the age of}} 50 or even later when it does not follow events like pregnancy, chronic illness, crash diets, and stress among others, it is now occurring at earlier ages with reported cases in women as young as 15 or 16.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of Black hairstyles involve parting the natural hair into individual sections before styling. Research shows that excessive braiding, tight cornrows, relaxing, and vigorous dry-combing of afro-textured hair can {{be harmful to}} the hair and scalp. They have also been known to cause ailments such as <b>alopecia,</b> balding {{at the edges of}} the scalp, excessive dry scalp, and bruises on the scalp. Keeping hair moisturized, trimming ends, and using very little to no heat will prevent breakage and split ends.|$|E
25|$|Hair and Scalp. The scalp {{is rarely}} {{affected}} by a condition known as lichen planopilaris, acuminatus, follicular lichen planus, and peripilaris, characterised by violaceous, adherent follicular scale with progressive scarring <b>alopecia.</b> While lichen planus and lichen planopilaris may occur together, aside from sharing the term ‘lichen’ and revealing inflammation on skin biopsy, there is neither established data on their co-occurrence nor data to suggest a common etiology. Lichen planopilaris is considered an orphan disease with no definitive prevalence data and no proven effective treatments.|$|E
25|$|Levels of free {{testosterone}} {{are strongly}} linked to libido and DHT levels, but unless free testosterone is virtually nonexistent, levels {{have not been}} shown to affect virility. Men with androgenic <b>alopecia</b> {{are more likely to}} have a higher baseline of free androgens. However, sexual activity is multifactoral, and androgenic profile is not the only determining factor in baldness. Additionally, because hair loss is progressive and free testosterone declines with age, a male's hairline may be more indicative of his past than his present disposition.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{the first}} anti{{androgen}}, or androgen antagonist, was discovered. Antiandrogens antagonise the androgen receptor (AR) and thereby block the biological effects of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Antiandrogens {{are important for}} men with hormonally responsive diseases like prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP), acne, seborrhea, hirsutism and androgen <b>alopecia.</b> Antiandrogens are mainly used {{for the treatment of}} prostate diseases. Research from 2010 suggests that ARs could be linked to the disease progression of triple-negative breast cancer and salivary duct carcinoma and that antiandrogens can potentially be used to treat it.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} to be metabolized by 5α-reductase and the AR activity of the resultant metabolites appears {{to be one of}} the major, if not the most important determinant of the androgenic-myotrophic ratio for a given AAS. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic <b>alopecia</b> (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that the initial programming of pilosebaceous units of hair follicles begins in utero. The physiology is primarily androgenic, with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) the major contributor at the dermal papillae. Men with premature androgenic <b>alopecia</b> tend to have lower than normal values of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and epitestosterone when compared to men without pattern hair loss. Although hair follicles were previously thought to be permanently gone in areas of complete hair loss, {{they are more likely}} dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cell progenitor cells from which the follicles arose.|$|E
