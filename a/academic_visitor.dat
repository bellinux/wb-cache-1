40|$|This paper {{documents}} the five main {{ways in which}} globalization of scientific and engineering has proceeded: (1) expansion of mass higher education worldwide; (2) growth in number of international students; (3) immigration of scientists and engineers; (4) non-immigration trips: <b>academic</b> <b>visitors,</b> conferences; (5) greater international co-authorship and co-patenting. It is argued that by accelerating the rate of technological change and speeding the adoption of best practices around the world, these developments should benefit advanced and developing countries but that they threaten the comparative advantage of advanced countries in high-tech sectors and the edge that their citizens have in access to the highest quality university education and jobs; and risk creating greater divisions between modern and traditional sectors in developing countries. How economies around the world {{take advantage of the}} benefits and minimize the costs of globalization of knowledge will be a major determinant of economic progress. migration, international mobility of knowledge, scientists and engineers,...|$|R

40|$|I ask {{generally}} {{whether a}} country {{can benefit from}} the temporary importation of human capital, and specifically whether a program that attracts large groups of <b>academic</b> <b>visitors</b> to a distant country benefits it by generating additional scholarly research on local issues. Using the list of visitors to the ANU Research School's Economics Program, I estimate this impact from responses to a survey in which visitors described their research before and after their visit and designated as a control person another economist who had a similar career but had not visited. The matching of the control {{may be viewed as}} being along both observable and (to the researcher) unobservable characteristics of the treated and control individuals. The results show a highly significant ceteris paribus impact of such visits on the visitor's subsequent research. Valuing this extra research based on the scholarly citations it received and the effects of citations on salaries shows a substantial monetary impact of visiting economists. Less tangible additional impacts in terms of research style also clearly result...|$|R

40|$|Newsletter. It is hard {{to believe}} that a decade has passed since the Newsletter, and the regular {{activities}} of the Centre, began. The first CSJR Newsletter in 2000 comprised some photocop-ies of typed pages that were stapled together. In 2003 we expanded the Newsletter to include more information about activities at the Centre and at partner institutions, and also research notes by young scholars and <b>academic</b> <b>visitors</b> of the Centre. That is when the first colour is-sue was produced. It was initially produced off-site, but by 2006 it was being created entirely in-house, designed by SOAS MA Japanese Religions alumna Janet Foster and printed by the SOAS Print Room. Today the Newsletter is distributed to more than 400 institutions and in-dividuals in Europe, Japan and North America with a scholarly interest in Japanese religions. I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised when a colleague told me that he actually uses it in his classes as a quick update on scholarly trends and findings. Through the years it has been a great experience to bring together people interested in Japanese religions, who have used the Newsletter as a means of communication to an audience larger than the CSJR itself. Undoubtedly the Newsletter would not have existed without the dedication of many contribu-tors who have put an extraordinary amount of time and energy into what its production in...|$|R

50|$|The mammal {{specimens}} (skulls, skeletons, skin, horns, etc.) in the Powell-Cotton Museum are exhibits as well {{as objects}} of study. Some academics from universities and research institutes such as University of Cambridge, University College London, University of Sheffield, University of Kent, University of Exeter, The University of Bradford, University of the Witwatersrand, University of California, Université Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris III, University of Melbourne, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Canterbury Christchurch University, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna used to visit this museum {{in order to obtain}} skeletal data, collect samples for DNA or dietary analysis and so on. One of the famous <b>academic</b> <b>visitors</b> is Professor Colin Groves of the Australian National University, whose research interests include {{but are not limited to}} mammalian taxonomy (especially primate taxonomy), human evolution and taxonomic history of mammals. In addition to the specimens preserved in the museums such as Natural History Museum (London), Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (Paris), Museum voor Middenafrika (Tervuren), Naturalis (Leiden), Musée Royale d’Histoire Naturelle (Brussels), Kenya National Museums (Nairobi), Zoologisches Museum A. Humboldt (Berlin) and Museum A. Koenig (Bonn), he also utilized the mammal specimens provided by the Powell-Cotton Museum and hence conducted many comparative studies, for example, he used to measure the skulls of Northern White Rhinoceros, and examine the colobus material and the specimens of musk-deer at the Museum. Some of these studies can be found in his noted book “Primate Taxonomy” which is considered to relabel museum cabinets. And, he thought highly of the Powell-Cotton Museum.|$|R
