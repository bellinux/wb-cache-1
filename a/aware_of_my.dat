[...] "I just found this out today - my album went gold there. It was a great feeling because it was very unexpected", the singer revealed. [...] "I would love to (tour Taiwan). I haven't toured at all at this point, but I would really love to do that. It's a great feeling to know that people in other places and other countries are <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> music and what I do". The tour, however, didn't happen for unknown reasons. Lohan promoted the album in a few television appearances, including at MTV's Total Request Live {{on the day of the}} album's release, and at The Ellen DeGeneres Show on December 14, 2005. The singer performed [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart" [...] and her cover of [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] in the 2005 American Music Awards.|$|E

I'm more patient ... more forgiving and more <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own flaws ... Something that comes with age I think. So fittingly this record is called 21 ... Like a photo album you see [...] progression and change ... throughout the years. I {{tried to think of}} other album titles but couldn't come up with anything that represented the album properly."-- Adele, on her meaning behind the title.|$|E

"I think," [...] he said coldly, [...] "that you are <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what <b>my</b> {{feelings}} and desired {{course of action}} have been with regard to those <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fellow creatures with whom I have happened to come into contact. It {{seems to me that}} I have been a trifle unfortunate in several instances." ...|$|R

According to Rove, he didn't believe he was a confirming source for Robert Novak and Matt Cooper with regard to Plame. Rove also reiterated that he first learned of Plame from another reporter, though would not disclose which reporter. Rove told Gregory [...] "I acted in an appropriate manner, made all the appropriate individuals <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> contact.

2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E
60|$|Now I saw the {{mackerel}} fleet on its fishing-ground, though I was not {{at first}} <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it. So <b>my</b> experience was complete.|$|R

2500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a spell {{in a drug}} rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into EastEnders by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, [...] "the call from the producers couldn't {{have come at a}} more opportune moment for me. The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once I assured them that I was well [...] they invited me back for another year." [...] The character's [...] "dramatic" [...] return to EastEnders aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with [...] "bad boy" [...] David Wicks (Michael French). Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by Barbara Windsor. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says [...] "instantly took me under her wing", and Martine McCutcheon, who played Tiffany Raymond.|$|E
2500|$|Xu Yin (徐胤), the Army Inspector (監軍) of the Jin {{garrison}} at Badong (巴東), led marine forces towards Jianping (建平), while Yang Zhao (楊肇), the Inspector (刺史) of Jing Province (also under Jin control), led troops towards Xiling. Lu Kang gave orders as such: Zhang Xian {{to reinforce}} Jiangling's defences; Sun Zun (孫遵), the Commandant of Gong'an (公安), {{to patrol the}} south river bank and resist Yang Hu; naval commander Liu Lü (留慮) and General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) Zhu Wan (朱琬) to defend against Xu Yin. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao {{with the aid of}} the defensive structures they constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang's subordinates Zhu Qiao (朱喬) and Yu Zan (俞贊) defected to Yang Zhao's side instead. Lu Kang said, [...] "Yu Zan has been serving under {{me for a long time}} and he is very <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> situation. He knows that the tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling to follow my orders, so he'll definitely suggest to the enemy to take advantage of this weakness." [...] Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang's army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} hear what Mary Phillips said. Perhaps my senses were benumbed. Perhaps the wind was {{carrying}} away her words. That it was blowing from me toward her soon became too evident.

6000|$|... "I {{said most}} decidedly I wouldn't," [...] I returned, and I {{recalled}} my severity to Tedham in refusing his prayer with more satisfaction {{than it had}} given me at the time.

50|$|Philosophy traces back to, {{and brings}} to awareness, {{what has been}} present before without being {{conscious}} of itself (“an ihm selber in seiner Vorgängigkeit unbewußt”). Thus I seek to become <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> myself in <b>my</b> origins, and consequently attain an original relationship to reality, not by disposing of prior decisions - which would be impossible - but by accepting myself in these prior decisions. Such a philosophy is not geared toward enlightenment but toward a responsible appropriation <b>of</b> myself in <b>my</b> origins, toward a responsible performance <b>of</b> <b>my</b> existence, toward existing properly. In this regard philosophy specifically is existential philosophy.|$|R
