On 1 February 1932 she departed again, this time for Italy. After a two-month tour Imogen came home with mixed views on Italian music-making. She concluded that [...] "the Italians <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> of singers... But music is a different language {{in that part of}} the world". Back in London, she decided that despite her experiences, [...] "if it is music one is wanting, there is no place like London." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{being denied}} a license four times, one couple asked the Rowan County Attorney's Office to {{investigate}} Davis for official misconduct, a misdemeanor under Kentucky law. Official misconduct {{in the first}} degree is a Class A misdemeanor and is punishable with imprisonment not to exceed 12 months and fines of $500. Official misconduct in the second degree is a Class B misdemeanor and carries a potential punishment of up to 90 days' imprisonment and fines of $250. The Rowan County Attorney's Office is prohibited from prosecuting Davis; Attorney General Cecil Watkins referred the official misconduct complaint to the Kentucky Attorney General's office, led by Attorney General Jack Conway. The Kentucky Attorney General's office conducted a review, and Conway issued a statement saying, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> of laws, and no one can defy an order from a federal judge." [...] Conway then issued a one-sentence statement saying that he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Davis.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} {{the origin of}} the title [...] "Rhythm Nation", Jackson stated she first uttered the phrase during a conversation with her producers. [...] "I thought {{it would be great if}} we could create our own nation" [...] adding that it would be [...] "one that would have a positive message and that everyone would be free to join." [...] She based the idea on the prevalence of various youth groups and organizations that are formed as a means of creating a common identity. The usage of the number [...] "1814" [...] represents the year the national anthem [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] was written. Rolling Stone emphasized the core concept is further explored in the album's opening pledge (the first track of the recording), which states: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> with no geographic boundaries, bound together through our beliefs. We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rid of color-lines."

500|$|Gjems-Onstad came {{to believe}} that the recent mass {{immigration}} to Norway was a greater threat than the Nazi invasion of Norway, although he made clear he had nothing against [...] "normal immigration" [...] and individuals, nor about Norwegians finding spouses in other countries. What he stated he was concerned about was increasing ethnic tensions and Norwegians being outnumbered in Norway {{in the course of the}} 21st century, and he stated that what worried him the very most was the growth of Islam. Gjems-Onstad praised Progress Party MPs Vidar Kleppe and Øystein Hedstrøm at their election campaign rally in 1999, and participated in the non-partisan demonstration against Muslim prayer calling in 2000. He was involved in the Conservative Party in Asker from 2005 to 2007, but joined the Pensioners' Party in 2007 as their top ballot candidate for the municipal election. As Gjems-Onstad called for a halt of immigration to Asker, he was instantly denounced by his own party. He also maintained that [...] "Norway is the fatherland of the Norwegians, and Norwegians <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> within the white race," [...] and during a television debate with fellow lawyer and politician Abid Raja said that he could not call himself a Norwegian, only a Pakistani-Norwegian—they both nevertheless affirmed that they had great respect for each other. Gjems-Onstad was expelled from the Pensioners' Party before the election, but removal from the ballot is legally impossible. As the election was held the Pensioners' Party did not win any seats, and the local party leadership expressed their delight. Gjems-Onstad was also a member of Stop Islamisation of Norway, and participated in a demonstration alongside the organisation's leader Arne Tumyr in 2009.|$|E
