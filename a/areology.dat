2500|$|Although the Greek-language-origin prefix [...] {{refers to}} Earth, [...] "geology" [...] {{is often used}} in {{conjunction}} with the names of other planetary bodies when describing their composition and internal processes: examples are [...] "the geology of Mars" [...] and [...] "Lunar geology". Specialised terms such as selenology (studies of the Moon), <b>areology</b> (of Mars), etc., are also in use.|$|E
5000|$|Interplanetary Sciences: While the {{discipline}} of geography is normally concerned with the Earth, the term can also be informally {{used to describe the}} study of other worlds, such as the planets of the Solar System and even beyond. The study of systems larger than the Earth itself usually forms part of Astronomy or Cosmology. The study of other planets is usually called planetary science. Alternative terms such as <b>areology</b> (the study of Mars) have been proposed but are not widely used.|$|E
50|$|The geology of Mars is the {{scientific}} study of the surface, crust, and interior of the planet Mars. It emphasizes the composition, structure, history, and physical processes that shape the planet. It is analogous to the field of terrestrial geology. In planetary science, the term geology is used in its broadest sense to mean the study of the solid parts of planets and moons. The term incorporates aspects of geophysics, geochemistry, mineralogy, geodesy, and cartography. A neologism, <b>areology,</b> from the Greek word Arēs (Mars), sometimes appears as a synonym for Mars's geology in the popular media and works of science fiction (e.g. Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy), but the term is rarely, if ever, used by professional geologists and planetary scientists.|$|E
