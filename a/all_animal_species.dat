25|$|G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are {{a family}} of {{integral}} transmembrane proteins that possess seven transmembrane domains and are linked to a heterotrimeric G protein. With nearly 800 members, {{this is the largest}} family of membrane proteins and receptors in mammals. Counting <b>all</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> they add up to over 5000. Mammalian GPCRs are classified into 5 major families: rhodopsin-like, secretin-like, metabotropic glutamate, adhesion and frizzled/smoothened, with a few GPCR groups being difficult to classify due to low sequence similarity, e.g. vomeronasal receptors. Other classes exist in eukaryotes, such as the Dictyostelium cyclic AMP receptors and fungal mating pheromone receptors.|$|E

25|$|The {{cerebellum}} of cartilaginous and {{bony fishes}} {{is large and}} complex. In at least one important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish cerebellum does not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei. Instead, the primary targets of Purkinje cells are a distinct type of cell distributed across the cerebellar cortex, a type not seen in mammals. The circuits in the cerebellum are similar across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. There is also an analogous brain structure in cephalopods with well-developed brains, such as octopuses. This has been taken {{as evidence that the}} cerebellum performs functions important to <b>all</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> with a brain.|$|E
25|$|Between 1603 and 1613 Sir Walter Raleigh was a {{prisoner}} in the Tower of London awaiting execution; in this period he wrote {{a history of the}} world in five volumes where he described his American experiences and adventures, in it he wondered whether all the new species discovered in the new continent could have found their place on Noah's Ark. A very serious question at the time, he postulates that only animals from the old continent found place on the Ark; eventually, after the Flood, some of these animals would migrate to the new continent and, under environmental pressure, change their appearances to create new species. Fifty years later, Matthew Hale went even further, and said that only the prototypes of <b>all</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> were welcomed on the Ark; these would eventually differentiate after their release. Many clergymen were happy with Raleigh and Hale ideas since they appeared {{to solve the problem of}} the Ark's tonnage.|$|E
2500|$|Kangaroos and {{wallabies}} have large, elastic tendons {{in their}} hind legs. They store elastic strain {{energy in the}} tendons of their large hind legs, providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort. [...] This is true in <b>all</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> which have muscles connected to their skeletons through elastic elements such as tendons, but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos.|$|E

2500|$|These Buddhist nationalists {{have been}} {{opposed by the}} Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, a {{self-governance}} movement led by the Buddhist Dr. A. T. Ariyaratne and based in Buddhist ideals, who condemn {{the use of violence}} and the denial of Human rights to Tamils and other non-Buddhists. Ariyaratne calls for non-violent action and he has been actively working for peace in Sri Lanka for many decades, and has stated {{that the only way to}} peace is through [...] "the dispelling of the view of 'I and mine' or the shedding of 'self' and the realization of the true doctrines of the interconnection between <b>all</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> and the unity of all humanity," [...] thus advocating social action in Buddhist terms. He stated in one of his lectures, [...] "When we work towards the welfare of all the means we use have to be based on Truth, Non-violence and Selflessness in conformity with Awakening of All". What Ariyaratne advocates is losing the self in the service of others and attempting to bring others to awakening. Ariyaratne has stated, [...] "I cannot awaken myself unless I help awaken others".|$|E

50|$|Limitation {{of using}} {{excavation}} techniques is revealed through studying {{different kinds of}} faunal remains. First, people have problem of screening or sieving large animals remains.

50|$|The {{extinction}} of nearly <b>all</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> {{at the end}} of the Permian Period allowed for the radiation of many new lifeforms.

50|$|The mussel Mytilus edulis is {{an anomaly}} {{in terms of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA inheritance.

50|$|Waddington's {{emphasis}} on epigenetics over genes prefigured the current interest in evolutionary developmental biology. As Sean B.

50|$|The {{total number}} of living {{arthropod}} species is probably {{in the tens of}} millions. One conservative estimate puts the number of arthropod species in tropical forests alone at six to nine million species.

By the middle of the 18th century only a few natural historians accepted a literal interpretation of the narrative.|$|R
