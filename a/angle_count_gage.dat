5000|$|The {{support of}} Genoa allowed a road into central Italy. While the Prince of Conti {{stayed in the}} north, <b>Count</b> <b>Gages</b> {{followed}} this road to the south. But then the Austrian commander, Prince Lobkowitz took the offensive and drove the Spanish army of the <b>Count</b> de <b>Gages</b> further southward towards the Neapolitan frontier near {{the small town of}} Velletri. Velletri just happened to be the birthplace of Caesar Augustus, but now from June through August 1744, Velletri became the scene of extensive military maneuvering between the French-Spanish army under the command of the <b>Count</b> <b>Gages</b> and the Austrian forces under the command of Prince Lobkowitz The King of Naples (the future Charles III of Spain) was increasingly worried about the Austrian army operating so close to his borders and decided to assist the Spaniards. Together a combined army of French, Spanish and Neapolitans surprised the Austrian army on the night of 16-17 June 1744. The Austrians were routed from three important hills around the town of Velletri during the attack. This battle is sometimes called the [...] "Battle of Nemi" [...] after the small town of Nemi located nearby. Because of this surprise attack, the combined army was able to take possession of the town of Velletri. Thus, the surprise attack has also been called the [...] "first Battle of Velletri." ...|$|R

In such a situation, the sign indicates whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Though different conventions can be used, {{it is common}} in mathematics to have counterclockwise <b>angles</b> <b>count</b> as positive, and clockwise <b>angles</b> <b>count</b> as negative.|$|R
40|$|Several {{large-scale}} forest inventories are {{now being}} conducted using <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling, and the method is commonly used for timber cruising and corporate forest assessment. The calculation of basal area or volume increment from <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sample data is not trivial, and three alternative methods are currently in common use: the difference method, the starting value method, and the end value method. This article develops the hypothesis that in various circumstances these methods are susceptible to bias {{as a result of}} measurement error and mis-sampling of trees. After reviewing prior work in <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> mathematics and developing the theoretical basis of our hypothesis, we present a supporting example based on a large permanent sampling plot at Hirschlacke in northern Austria. Our results suggest that the errors resulting from using calculation methodologies susceptible to bias from measurement error may in practical circumstances be more than 10 % of volume increment, which could have ramifications for sustainable forest management or carbon sequestration budgetin...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we apply}} {{vertical}} <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling {{to estimate the}} crown ratio of trees in unthinned forest stands. The rationale {{is to be able}} to quickly assess the relative crown size of forest stands to support thinning decisions by simply counting trees. We provide estimators and discuss their precision based on pilot studies in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations in northern Sweden. A separate study was conducted to investigate the amount of measurement errors, i. e., how many trees are wrongly selected or overlooked when using the method. Sampling errors for estimating crown ratio were found to be remarkably low, partly due to high correlation between crown length and tree height and partly due to low variability in the study sites. Measurement errors were in the range of what is commonly obtained with horizontal <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling for basal area estimation...|$|R
30|$|When using {{inventory}} {{data for}} a structural diversity index like the NFI of Germany, which is partly based on sampling via the <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> method, {{it is important}} to aggregate index-scores at a stratum level (e.g. forest-type) (Bitterlich 1952; Lappi and Bailey 1987; Sterba 2008). Observations or changes of structural diversity for single inventory plots should not be considered because dramatic changes recorded at individual plots may be caused by the sampling design rather than by actual changes in forest structure. Observed differences in variables between two inventories at a single plot may be attributable to the method of PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling, that <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling is based on. Whether a tree is included in the sample or not depends on its diameter at breast height and its distance to the centre of the inventory plot. The associated low number of trees leads, in most cases, to a loss of information at the plot-level (justified by the need to optimize the sampling effort). For larger study areas and inventory strata, the accuracy of observations from <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling is as high as that from inventories employing fixed radius circles (Lappi and Bailey 1987; Sterba 2008). On this basis, accurate calculations of harvested timber volume or biomass, growing stock, availability of certain products, etc. have been successfully performed in the past (Polley 2005; Kändler and Cullmann 2014; Polley and Kroiher 2017).|$|R

30|$|The German {{inventory}} {{is based}} on a 4  km[*]×[*] 4  km grid (base grid), but a smaller grid size (2.83  km[*]×[*] 2.83  km or 2  km[*]×[*] 2  km) was used in some regions. Each inventory plot is a square of 150  m[*]×[*] 150  m, of which each corner represents a subplot when an <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling with a counting factor of 4 is applied. We treated the independent subplots as individual plots, as the subplots could be part of different forest types, and so, cannot be correlated.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} field plot {{configurations}} on {{the uncertainties of}} plot-level forest resource estimates were analyzed using airborne laser scanner data, aerial photographs and field measurements. The aim was to select a field sample plot configuration {{that can be used}} for both large area and management inventories. Error estimates were evaluated at the plot level using six different training plot configurations. Additionally, separate plots with two different sizes were used for evaluation. Stem volume and five other forest resource characteristics were considered. The field measurement costs of the different plot configurations were also studied. RMSEs and mean deviations for airborne laser scanning ALS-assisted estimates were practically the same for the fixed radius plot, the two concentric plots and the <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> plot with a basal area factor of q = 1 for all three evaluation plot sizes. <b>Angle</b> <b>count</b> plots with basal area factors of q = 1. 5 and 2 increased the RMSEs. For the former plot configurations, the RMSEs for the ALS-assisted estimates could be attributed to inaccuracy in the predicted relationships between the field data and ALS data, not to the training plot configuration. Tree measurements and costs can, therefore, be reduced from those of the Finnish management inventories without increasing RMSEs...|$|R
30|$|The shape, {{size and}} number of sample plots vary greatly among provinces. Square plots are used in more than 90  % of the provinces. Circular plots are used only in Tibet, while {{rectangular}} plots are used in Inner Mongolia and in one sub-population of Heilongjiang. Point sampling or <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling was used in Guangxi before the 6 th NFI, but square plots have been used since 2005 (Cen et al. 2007). In the past, several provinces such as Henan and Hubei used to apply cluster sampling in plateau areas, where a cluster was composed of 4 or 5 plots (Xiao 2005).|$|R

5000|$|Empress Maria Theresa, was {{frustrated}} with the failure of Lobkowitz to stop the advance of Gage. Accordingly, Lobkowitz was replaced with Count Schulenburg. A change in the command of the Austrians, encouraged the Bourbon allies to strike first {{in the spring of}} 1745. Accordingly, <b>Count</b> de <b>Gages</b> moved from Modena towards Lucca, the Gallispan army in the Alps under the new command of Marshal Maillebois (Prince Conti and Marshal Maillebois had exchanged commands over the winter of 1744-1745) advanced through the Italian Riviera to the Tanaro. In the middle of July 1745, the two armies were at last concentrated between the Scrivia and the Tanaro. Together <b>Count</b> de <b>Gage's</b> army and the Gallispan army composed an unusually large number of 80,000 men. A swift march on Piacenza drew the Austrian commander thither and in his absence the allies fell upon and completely defeated the Sardinians at Bassignano on 27 September 1745, a victory which was quickly followed by the capture of Alessandria, Valenza and Casale Monferrato. Jomini calls the concentration of forces which effected the victory [...] "Le plus remarquable de toute la Guerre".|$|R

50|$|The {{aggressiveness}} of the Spanish in Italy forced Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and King Charles Emmanuel of Sardinia into {{negotiations in}} early 1742. These negotiations {{were held at}} Turin. Maria Theresa sent her envoy Count Schulenburg and King Charles Emmanuel sent the Marquis d'Ormea. On 1 February 1742, Schulenburg and Ormea signed the Convention of Turin which resolved (or postponed resolution) many differences and formed an alliance between the two countries. In 1742, field marshal Count Traun held his own with ease against the Spanish and Neapolitans. On 19 August 1742, Naples was forced {{by the arrival of}} a British naval squadron in Naple's own harbour, to withdraw her 10,000 troops from the Montemar force to provide for home defence. The Spanish force under Montemar was now too weak to advance in the Po Valley and a second Spanish army was sent to Italy via France. Sardinia had allied herself with Austria in the Convention of Turin {{and at the same time}} neither state was at war with France and this led to curious complications, combats being fought in the Isère valley between the troops of Sardinia and of Spain, in which the French took no part. At the end of 1742, the Duke of Montemar was replaced as head of the Spanish forces in Italy by <b>Count</b> <b>Gages.</b>|$|R

30|$|National forest {{inventories}} {{are charged}} with monitoring large areas with limited budgets. Our survey of international inventories suggests that improvements to plot and sample designs {{are made in the}} interests of obtaining better estimate precision without requiring additional field costs. Plot designs evolve as more efficient measurement configurations are shown to adequately capture local conditions, while new sample designs are developed to improve variance estimates by controlling how plots are distributed or analyzed. A “statistical” design based framework has been used in most inventories. Systematic or stratified systematic sampling designs are often used and three-stage design in US. Arranging plots into clusters is also common particularly in Europe, a cluster aiming to be a one-day workload on average. The FIA in USA uses detached plots. A circular plot is the most common plot design, with either one radius or a few radii. <b>Angle</b> <b>count</b> plot is used by some countries.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} has been to reduce the {{hardware}} cost of SDF FFTs. Inorder to achieve this, two methods for simplifying rotations in FFTs are presented:Decimation and Reduction. When applied, these methods reduce the total amountof angles that the rotators need to rotate, {{as well as the}} total <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> of theFFT. This is useful for constant shift and add based rotators, as their hardwarecost are typically dependent on the amount of angles it needs to calculate. Decimation works by splitting a large twiddle factor into a smaller one plusan additional small rotator in series. This allows for the possibility to implementlarge FFTs without needing any large twiddle factors. Reduction is a method thattakes a twiddle factor and simplifies it by removing one angle from the rotator. This can be done without adding any hardware cost if applied correctly. In addition to the methods, the thesis also includes proposed designs for 64 - upto 1024 -point FFTs, as well as post-implementation results for a 32 - and 64 -pointFFT...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{inventories}} {{were originally}} {{designed for the}} assessment of timber stocks over large areas. The large datasets gathered by these programs are becoming of increasing interest in other applications, particularly in ecosystem modeling. With inventory designs based on sampling proportional to size (angle-count plots) users should be cautious of using data pertaining to individual plots, as the plot-wise data is a statistical estimate rather than a true measurement. Estimates of per-plot basal area are mathematically unbiased, but the individual precision is extremely poor. Resampling of inventory datasets using multiple basal area factors can improve the precision of the estimates on single plots, thus providing better data for potential end users. Following two simulation studies to demonstrate our method we apply it to the sampling points of the Austrian National Forest Inventory, and show how the improved estimates of basal area give rise to more realistic estimates of basal area increment on indi - vidual points, reducing variance through the smoothing of extreme estimates. Our method will be useful in studies where <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> inventory data pertaining to individual plots is used to assess the precision of models or remote sensing methods...|$|R

All inventories used lines or strips passing through countries or country regions (Ilvessalo 1927; Tomppo et al. 2011). The intervals between the lines varied by regions depending on the variability of forests and land use. Norway and Sweden employed strip surveys: all trees over a certain diameter threshold were callipered on the strips with a width of 10  m (Tomter et al. 2010; Axelsson et al. 2010). The first NFI in Finland employed lines and visual assessment on the lines as well sample plots with exact mesurements and also with visual assessments on the plots, the latter one to calibrate the visual assessments (Ilvessalo 1927; Tomppo et al. 2011).
