25|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>canal</b> {{decompression}} {{is another}} surgical technique that can prolong usable hearing when a vestibular schwannoma has grown {{too large to}} remove without damage to the cochlear nerve. In the IAC (internal <b>auditory</b> <b>canal)</b> decompression, a middle fossa approach is employed to expose the bony roof of the IAC without any attempt to remove the tumor. The bone overlying the acoustic nerve is removed, allowing the tumour to expand upward into the middle cranial fossa. In this way, pressure on the cochlear nerve is relieved, {{reducing the risk of}} further hearing loss from direct compression or obstruction of vascular supply to the nerve.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Dr. V. S. Ramachandran and his lab {{proposed}} that caloric stimulation might {{be effective in}} treating Dejerine–Roussy syndrome. They hypothesized that if cold water was streamed into the ear down the <b>auditory</b> <b>canal,</b> the symptoms associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome would be alleviated. Ramachandran stated that he had carried out provisional experiments on two patients and believed that their reactions supported his theory.|$|E
25|$|People with {{peripheral}} vertigo typically present with {{mild to moderate}} imbalance, nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus, fullness, and pain in the ear. In addition, lesions of the internal <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> {{may be associated with}} facial weakness on the same side. Due to a rapid compensation process, acute vertigo {{as a result of a}} peripheral lesion tends to improve in a short period of time (days to weeks).|$|E

40|$|A cryptic {{translocation}} t(5; 18) (qter;qter) {{was detected}} {{in a large}} family, using a FISH-based approach combining subtelomeric probes to allow the subtelomeric regions of most chromosome ends to be analysed for deletions and balanced or unbalanced translocations.

Some of the features observed in affected individuals are characteristic of known syndromes involving either 18 q (growth deficiency, nystagmus, narrow <b>auditory</b> <b>canals,</b> genital hypoplasia, behaviour problems in 18 q deletion syndrome) or 5 q (umbilical and inguinal hernias, congenital heart defects in distal 5 q trisomy). status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|The {{facial nerve}} (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII) both enter the {{internal}} <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> in the temporal bone. [...] The facial nerve then reaches {{the side of}} the face by using the stylomastoid foramen, also in the temporal bone. [...] Its fibers then spread out to reach and control all of the muscles of facial expression. [...] The vestibulocochlear nerve reaches the organs that control balance and hearing in the temporal bone, and therefore does not reach the external surface of the skull.|$|E
2500|$|A bone {{anchored}} {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) is an auditory prosthetic based on bone conduction {{which can be}} surgically implanted. It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mould in the ear cannot be used. The BAHA uses the skull as a pathway for sound {{to travel to the}} inner ear. [...] For people with conductive hearing loss, the BAHA bypasses the external <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea. [...] For people with unilateral hearing loss, the BAHA uses the skull to conduct the sound from the deaf side to the side with the functioning cochlea.|$|E
2500|$|Barotrauma {{can affect}} the external, middle, or inner ear. [...] Middle ear {{barotrauma}} (MEBT) {{is the most common}} being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient equilibration of the middle ear. [...] External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in the external <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> either by tight fitting diving equipment or ear wax. [...] Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT), though much less common than MEBT, shares a similar mechanism. [...] Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss as well as vertigo. It is also common for conditions affecting the inner ear to result in auditory hypersensitivity.|$|E

30|$|FD in the craniofacial {{area can}} cause {{significant}} {{expansion of the}} bones with facial asymmetry and disfigurement. In some cases, FD can cause displacement of structures, such as the orbit {{that can lead to}} visual disturbances and the <b>auditory</b> <b>canals</b> that can lead to hearing impairment [20]. The progression of the lesion into the oral cavity can compromise masticating and speaking. Periodontal and occlusal changes may also present, and this condition may require orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery to correct the malposition of the involved teeth and jaw [21].|$|R

2500|$|In {{the human}} body there are twelve pairs of cranial nerves. [...] Audiologists {{generally}} focus their expertise on the seventh and eighth nerves, which are known as the facial nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve, respectively. [...] Electroneuronography is typically concerned {{with the amount of}} degradation in the facial nerves, each of which consists of thousands of fibers. [...] Motor and sensory fibers are typically found in a 2:1 ratio, and it has been proposed that only half of the motor units need to be functional for normal nerve conduction to take place. [...] The facial nerves originate in the brainstem, cross through the <b>auditory</b> <b>canal,</b> exit the skull at the stylomastoid foramen, and terminate face in 2 main branches {{on each side of the}} face. [...] These control muscle contractions and facial expressions.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the limits}} of {{audibility}} are approached, the sound becomes much fainter, and when that limit is reached, the sound usually gives place to a peculiar sensation, which is not sound but more like dizziness, and which some persons experience to a high degree. Young people hear shriller sounds than older people, and I am told there is a proverb in Dorsetshire, that no agricultural labourer who is {{more than forty years}} old, can hear a bat squeak. The power of hearing shrill notes {{has nothing to do with}} sharpness of hearing, any more than a wide range of the key-board of a piano has to do with the sound of the individual strings. We all have our limits, and that limit may be quickly found by these whistles in every case. The facility of hearing shrill sounds depends in some degree on the position of the whistle, for it is highest when it is held exactly opposite the opening of the ear. Any roughness of the lining of the <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> appears to have a marked effect in checking the transmission of rapid vibrations when they strike the ear obliquely. I myself feel this in a marked degree, and I have long noted the fact in respect to the buzz of a mosquito. I do not hear the mosquito much as it flies about, but when it passes close by my ear I hear a [...] "ping," [...] the suddenness of which is very striking. Mr. Dalby, the aurist, to whom I gave one of these instruments, tells me he uses it for diagnoses. When the power of hearing high notes is wholly lost, the loss is commonly owing to failure in the nerves, but when very deaf people are still able to hear high notes if they are sounded with force, the nerves are usually all right, and the fault lies in the lining of the <b>auditory</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: Determinar a eficácia dos fones de inserção em casos de suspeita de colabamento de meato acústico externo. MÉTODOS: Vinte e um idosos com intervalo aéreo-ósseo {{superior}} a 10 dBNA nas frequências de 3 kHz e/ou 4 kHz foram submetidos à anamne se, audiometria tonal liminar, logoaudiometria e imitanciometria. A audiometria tonal e a logoaudiometria foram realizadas com os fones supra-aurais e com fones de inserção. RESULTADOS: Verificou-se que os limiares auditivos por via aérea obtidos com os fones de inserção foram menores em todas as frequências com exceção de 1 kHz. O intervalo aéreo-ósseo também foi menor com o fone de inserção, havendo um acoplamento aéreo-ósseo com este transdutor. CONCLUSÃO: Os fones de inserção ER- 3 A possibilitam melhora significativa nos limiares de audibilidade por via aérea em idosos, diminuindo ou até eliminando o intervalo aéreo-ósseo, sobretudo nas frequências altas, nos casos de colabamento do meato acústico externo.
