The tree faces several threats, including soil compaction from foot and vehicle traffic due to tourism and special events in the park, drought, and the interruption of irrigation due to courthouse renovation. New restrictions were imposed in 2000 after the health of the tree began to decline. common myna birds (Acridotheres tristis) roost in the branches of the tree at sunset, causing <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> bird cries as the evening approaches.|$|E
5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E

New mechanistic insights were presented for known players orchestrating the symphony on cytosine - 'the symphony on C' (TET 1, 2, 3; GADD 45; AID; and TDG), while new instruments and classical themes were pulled into the amalgamation.

500|$|Across the Atlantic, similar {{experiments}} were taking place. In San Francisco, performance artist Monte Cazazza began recording noise music. Boyd Rice released several albums of noise, with guitar drones and tape loops creating <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> repetitive sounds. In Boston Sleep Chamber and other artists from [...] Inner-X-Musick began {{experimenting with a}} mixture of powerful noise and early forms of EBM. In Italy, work by Maurizio Bianchi {{at the beginning of the}} 1980s also shared this aesthetic. In Germany, Einstürzende Neubauten mixed metal percussion, guitars, and unconventional instruments (such as jackhammers and bones) in stage performances that often damaged the venues in which they played. Blixa Bargeld, inspired by Antonin Artaud and an enthusiasm for amphetamines, also originated an art movement called Die Genialen Dilettanten. Bargeld is particularly well known for his hissing scream.|$|E

John Simon, who was credited with production assistance on the song, created the bassline by playing a Moog synthesizer with help from Robert Moog himself. James Bennighof, author of The Words and Music of Paul Simon, finds that [...] "textural elements are variously supported by a churning groove, percussive, and distorted electronic sounds" [...] that complement the song's subject matter, suicide suburban youth.

50|$|Kyrie, I eulogize the archons of the Panethnic Numismatic Thesaurus and the Ecumenical Trapeza for the orthodoxy {{of their}} axioms, methods and policies, {{although}} there is <b>an</b> episode <b>of</b> <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> the Trapeza with Hellas. With enthusiasm we dialogue and synagonize at the synods of our didymous organizations in which polymorphous economic ideas and dogmas are analyzed and synthesized. Our critical problems such as the numismatic plethora generate some agony and melancholy. This phenomenon is characteristic of our epoch. But, to my thesis, we have the dynamism to program therapeutic practices as a prophylaxis from chaos and catastrophe. In parallel, a Panethnic unhypocritical economic synergy and harmonization in a democratic climate is basic. I apologize for my eccentric monologue. I emphasize my euharistia to you, Kyrie to the eugenic and generous American Ethnos and to the organizers and protagonists of his Amphictyony and the gastronomic symposia.|$|R
500|$|Third Way {{contributor}} Graham Cray {{wrote that}} the song [...] " [...] more directly a culture which consists of <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> voices and images but which has neither soul nor direction." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes noted that the lyrics were ambiguous in whether they took place in reality or fantasy, which he likened to the overarching theme of the album. Author David Kootnikoff believed that [...] "the pop melody conceals the lyric's dark theme about a victim of physical abuse who reasons her pain away with the line 'When he hurts you, you feel alive.'" [...] Mark Brown of The Orange County Register described it as [...] "the desperate tale of an abused woman with {{nowhere to go but}} back to her home." [...] He compared it to U2's 1987 song [...] "Running to Stand Still", saying [...] "That same sort of descriptive but distanced narrative is what made [...] so powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|The SIS {{building}} was positively critiqued by Deyan Sudjic in The Guardian in 1992 who {{described it as}} an [...] "epitaph for the [...] architecture of the eighties". Sudjic wrote that [...] "It's a design which combines high seriousness in its classical composition with a possible unwitting sense of humour. The building could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple {{or a piece of}} clanking art deco machinery", and added that the most impressive thing about Farrell's design was the way he had not [...] "confined himself to a single idea" [...] as the building [...] "grows and develops as you move around it". In their 2014 Guide to London's Contemporary Architecture, Kenneth Allinson and Victoria Thornton wrote that [...] "Some see this building as Farrell's most controlled and mature building – a rich diet, certainly, but not <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> rhetorical features, nor without the unselfconscious virtuosity which can uplift and excite. But it is undoubtedly too Gotham City for the taste of many. Farrell's many critics and opponents...would call it a nightmare: a secret service fortress, provided by a private speculator, designed by an avowed populist, and sited on a most prominent river location. Indubitably, it is a bizarre phenomenon".|$|E
500|$|The album opens {{out with}} 'Howl', a grinding, but graceful opener. The song starts with an opening {{two minutes of}} intense and spacious drone synthesisers. The {{following}} two minutes of the song break into [...] "unrelenting and brutal" [...] mathcore with Eva Spence making her vocal debut with her [...] "gleefully guttural vocal register". The song is used {{as an example of}} how the band is using more complex, but 'more rewarding' song structures in their music. ‘Ex Luna Scientia’, the opening single for the album is seen as a more expansive and more melodic song in comparison to their previous work, placing emphasis on Eva Spence’s singing rather than her trademark 'guttural' style. Rock Sound reviewer Oliver Robertson used the song as an example for the sonic development of the album as it is [...] "more focused on making each element stand out now, rather than creating simply <b>a</b> <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> noise." [...] The introduction to 'Empiresk' is seen as being [...] "completely caked in reverb" [...] and ends with a stoner riff. The [...] "sparse piano chords" [...] that open both 'Empiresk' and 'Prelude II', among the atmospheric breaks that are featured on other tracks on the album defy the aggression featured on the rest of Astraea. Songs like 'The Scales of Balance', 'Remancer' and 'Gloam' are seen as having a fimiliar style to the Rolo Tomassi's previous work. 'Gloam', specifically the last half of the song, showcases a [...] "battle between melodic keyboard and screamed vocals with a real sense of urgency and threat." [...] 'Remancer' specifically has been considered as almost like Mastodon. The album closes with 'Illuminare', a song which Metal Hammer reviewer Merlin Alderslade cites as showing Radiohead and Sigur Rós influences.|$|E

[...] Miller paints what she calls, “piles of guilty pleasure” and her work has been described as <b>a</b> “vibrating <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> heady color.” <b>A</b> May 2004 review in Art in America stated, “Miller’s paintings teem with as much activity and information as it seems they can bear, deliberately flirting with surfeit. Painterly abstraction is at least as integral to these works as their still-life components are, and their dizzying visual generosity underlines the symbiotic relationship between food and paint, and the inherently sustaining nature of both.” Her influences include Goya, Florine Stettheimer, Cézanne, van Gogh and Fairfield Porter.|$|R

The music is similar to Coldcut and has an electro infused sound that reviewer Bob Bannister terms a combination of [...] "South Bronx hip hop and the avant-Eurodisco sound of Kraftwerk." [...] The album was created over a two-year period on two 100 MHz Macs that were barely switched off during the production; one 30-second siren sound {{at the beginning of the}} track Machine Toy took three days to render. For the video track Deadly Media, Stuart Warren Hill recorded news broadcasts from around the world off of a satellite feed and cropped everything but the newscasters’ mouths to build <b>a</b> random <b>cacophony</b> <b>of</b> voices out of which the spliced-together phase [...] "deadly media" [...] emerges.|$|R

Billy Lucas and David Stubbs of Melody Maker Magazine praised the artwork, lyrics, [...] "slammer guitars", and [...] "scrawling vocals" [...] on the album.
