50|$|Arc A is {{regulated}} by FNR in anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic activation of arcA transcription is increased three- to fourfold {{in the presence}} of Fnr. The arcA upstream regulatory region contains five putative promoter sequences and a putative Fnr-binding site. Identification of the transcription start sites indicates that transcription occurs in <b>aerobiosis</b> from three constitutive upstream promoters (Pe, Pd, Pc). In anaerobiosis an additional completely Fnr-dependent transcript starting at Pa, is present. Both of these genes then negatively regulate the sodA gene, coding for manganese superoxide dismutase.|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni, {{the most}} {{frequent}} cause of food-borne bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, is a microaerophile that has to survive high environmental oxygen tensions, adapt to oxygen limitation in the intestine and resist host oxidative attack. Here, oxygen-dependent changes in C. jejuni physiology were studied at constant growth rate using carbon (serine) -limited continuous chemostat cultures. We show that a perceived <b>aerobiosis</b> scale can be calibrated by the acetate excretion flux, which becomes zero when metabolism is fully aerobic (100 % <b>aerobiosis).</b> Transcriptome changes in a downshift experiment from 150 % to 40 % <b>aerobiosis</b> revealed many novel oxygen-regulated genes and highlighted re-modelling of the electron transport chains. A label-free proteomic analysis showed that at 40 % <b>aerobiosis,</b> many proteins involved in host colonisation (e. g. PorA, CadF, FlpA, CjkT) became more abundant. PorA abundance increased steeply below 100 % <b>aerobiosis.</b> In contrast, several citric-acid cycle enzymes, the peptide transporter CstA, PEB 1 aspartate/glutamate transporter, LutABC lactate dehydrogenase and PutA proline dehydrogenase became more abundant with increasing <b>aerobiosis.</b> We also observed a co-ordinated response of oxidative stress protection enzymes and Fe-S cluster biogenesis proteins above 100 % <b>aerobiosis.</b> Our approaches reveal key virulence factors that respond to restricted oxygen availability and specific transporters and catabolic pathways activated with increasing <b>aerobiosis.</b> This article is protected by copyright.

40|$|Oxygen {{availability}} is {{the major}} determinant of the metabolic modes adopted by Escherichia coli. Although much is known about E. coli gene expression and metabolism under fully aerobic and anaerobic conditions, the intermediate oxygen tensions that are encountered in natural niches are understudied. Here, for the first time, the transcript profiles of E. coli K- 12 across the physiologically significant range of oxygen availabilities are described. These suggested a progressive switch to aerobic respiratory metabolism and a remodeling of the cell envelope as oxygen availability increased. The transcriptional responses were consistent with changes in the abundance of cytochrome bd and bo′ and the outer membrane protein OmpW. The observed transcript and protein profiles result from changes {{in the activities of}} regulators that respond to oxygen itself or to metabolic and environmental signals that are sensitive to oxygen availability (<b>aerobiosis).</b> A probabilistic model (TFInfer) was used to predict the activity of the indirect oxygen-sensing two-component system ArcBA across the <b>aerobiosis</b> range. The model implied that the activity of the regulator ArcA correlated with <b>aerobiosis</b> but not with the redox state of the ubiquinone pool, challenging the idea that ArcA activity is inhibited by oxidized ubiquinone. The amount of phosphorylated ArcA correlated with the predicted ArcA activities and with <b>aerobiosis,</b> suggesting that fermentation product-mediated inhibition of ArcB phosphatase activity is the dominant mechanism for regulating ArcA activity under the conditions used here...|$|E
40|$|The {{virulence}} plasmid of Salmonella enterica (pSLT) is an F-like conjugative plasmid. High {{rates of}} pSLT transfer {{occur in the}} mammalian gut, a microaerobic environment. In this study, we describe genetic screens for host-encoded activators and repressors of the transfer operon (tra) of pSLT. We show that the transcription factor ArcA is an activator of conjugation, especially under microaerobiosis. In turn, succinate dehydrogenase (SdhABCD) is a repressor of mating in <b>aerobiosis.</b> ArcA binds upstream of the main tra promoter (ptraY) and activates tra transcription, as previously described in F, R 1, and R 100. In the absence of ArcA, transfer of pSLT decreased 7 -fold in <b>aerobiosis</b> and > 100 -fold in microaerobiosis. In <b>aerobiosis,</b> ArcA activates the traY promoter in an ArcB-independent manner, as described in other F-like plasmids. In microaerobiosis, however, the ArcB sensor is necessary for activation of ptraY. Lack of Sdh causes a > 20 -fold increase in pSLT transfer in <b>aerobiosis,</b> but has little effect under microaerobiosis. Sdh inhibits conjugal transfer by reducing traJ transcription, probably in an indirect manner. In turn, the sdhCDAB operon is repressed by the ArcAB system under microaerobiosis. Hence, the ArcAB two-component system of S. enterica stimulates pSLT transfer under microaerobiosis by two concerted actions: activation of the tra operon and repression of the sdhCDAB operon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} of cytochrome (cyt) b 559 during acceptor- and donor-side photoinhibition {{has been}} investigated in oxygen-evolving and non-evolving photosystem II (PSII) membranes. Strong illumination at 20 °C under <b>aerobiosis</b> induced a strong decrease in the absorbance of the cyt b 559 α-band in the two preparations. This absorbance decline was observed only in non-oxygen-evolving PSII samples when illumination was performed under <b>aerobiosis</b> but at 4 °C, or under anaerobiosis at 20 °C. These results suggest that acceptor-side photoinhibition induces the degradation of cyt b 559 by a mechanism related to an enzymatic reaction mediated by singlet oxygen. Donor-side photoinhibition may induce, however, a non-enzymatic photocleavage of the protein...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effect of anaerobiosis on the formation of Bacillus cereus spores and their resulting properties. For this purpose, an appropriate sporulation medium was developed (MODs). Sporulation of 18 strains from different phylogenetic groups of B. cereus was studied in MODs medium in <b>aerobiosis</b> and anaerobiosis. In anaerobiosis, sporulation ability was weaker and more heterogeneous than in <b>aerobiosis.</b> Among tested strains, B. cereus AH 187 produced {{the highest level of}} spores in anaerobiosis. This strain was therefore chosen to study spore properties. Spores produced in anaerobiosis were more resistant to wet heat at 90 °C, 92. 5 °C, 95 °C, 97. 5 °C and 100 °C. For example, D 90 were 21, 09 1. 70 and 81. 87 2. 00 for <b>aerobiosis</b> and anaerobiosis conditions, respectively. Spores produced in anaerobiosis have a z-value of 7. 70 °C compared with 10. 52 °C for spores produced in <b>aerobiosis.</b> Spores produced in anaerobiosis were also more resistant to 1 M NaOH, 1 M nitrous acid and pulsed light at fluences of 0. 34 J cm- 2 and 0. 49 J cm- 2. No difference in resistance to UV-C, 5 % hydrogen peroxide or 0. 25 mM formaldehyde was observed between these two conditions. In the presence of L-alanine, spores produced in anaerobiosis germinated more efficiently than spore produced in <b>aerobiosis.</b> No difference in germination was observed with inosine as inducer. No difference in the size of spores produced in the different conditions was observed by transmission electron microscopy. However, spores obtained under anaerobic conditions had a damaged exosporium, or in some cases a completely detached exosporium, unlike spores produced under aerobic conditions. This study shows that few spores are formed under anaerobic condition; nevertheless, this condition has an impact on the spore properties of B. cereus AH 187 strain. Spores obtained under anaerobic condition were more resistant to heat and to some chemical compounds. This is an important feature, considering the risk associated with the presence of this pathogen in thermally processed and packaged food in absence of oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Aerobic and {{respiratory}} cultivations provide benefits for some {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB). Growth, metabolites, enzymatic activities (lactate dehydrogenase; pyruvate and NADH oxidases, NADH peroxidase; catalase), antioxidant capability and stress tolerance of Lactobacillus casei N 87 were evaluated in anaerobic, aerobic {{and respiratory}} (<b>aerobiosis</b> with heme and menaquinone supplementation) batch cultivations with different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. The expression of pox (pyruvate oxidase) and cydABCD operon (cytochrome bd oxidase complex) was quantified by quantitative Real Time polymerase chain reaction. Respiration increased biomass production compared to anaerobiosis and unsupplemented <b>aerobiosis,</b> and altered the central metabolism rerouting pyruvate away from lactate accumulation. All enzymatic activities, except lactate dehydrogenase, were higher in respiratory cultures, while unsupplemented <b>aerobiosis</b> with 60 % of DO promoted H 2 O 2 and free radical accumulation. Respiration improved the survival to oxidative and freeze-drying stresses, while significant numbers of dead, damaged and viable but not cultivable cells were found in unsupplemented aerobic cultures (60 % DO). Analysis of gene expression suggested that the activation of aerobic and respiratory pathways occurred during the exponential growth phase, and that O 2 and hemin induced, respectively, the transcription of pox and cydABCD genes.

40|$|The manganese-containing isozyme of {{superoxide}} dismutase (MnSOD) is synthesized by Escherichia coli only during <b>aerobiosis,</b> {{in accordance with}} the fact that superoxide can be formed only in aerobic environments. In contrast, E. coli continues to synthesize the iron-containing isozyme (FeSOD) {{even in the absence of}} oxygen. A strain devoid of FeSOD exhibited no deficits during either anaerobic or continuously aerobic growth, but its growth lagged for 2 h during the transition from anaerobiosis to <b>aerobiosis.</b> Complementation of this defect with heterologous SODs established that anaerobic SOD synthesis per se is necessary to permit a smooth transition to <b>aerobiosis.</b> The growth deficit was eliminated by supplementation of the medium with branched-chain amino acids, indicating that the growth interruption was due to the established sensitivity of dihydroxyacid dehydratase to endogenous superoxide. Components of the anaerobic respiratory chain rapidly generated superoxide when exposed to oxygen in vitro, suggesting that this transition may be a period of acute oxidative stress. These results show that facultative bacteria must preemptively synthesize SOD during anaerobiosis in preparation for reaeration. The data suggest that evolution has chosen FeSOD for this function because of the relative availability of iron, in comparison to manganese, during anaerobiosis.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of recent {{evidence}} clearly indicates that the regulation of phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity is fundamental in the control of glycolysis (Lowry and Passonneau, 1964) {{through a series of}} feedback mechanisms (Sols et., 1963). Endproduct inhibition of PFK by ATP (ViRuela et., 1963) may account for the Pasteur effect in certain tissues (Wu, 1964).

Lowering of the pH to that of gastric secretions induced expression of several proteins in the coccoids. However, the coccoids produced under prolonged microaerobic conditions exhibited a profile of acid stress-induced protein expression different from that induced by <b>aerobiosis</b> or starvation.

Principal component analysis (PCA) of the exoproteome dynamics indicated that toxin-related proteins were the most representative of the exoproteome changes, both in terms of protein abundance and their methionine sulfoxide (Met(O)) content. PCA also revealed an interesting interconnection between toxin-, metabolism-, and oxidative stress–related proteins, suggesting that the abundance level of toxin-related proteins, and their Met(O) content in the B. cereus exoproteome, reflected the cellular oxidation under both <b>aerobiosis</b> and anaerobiosis...|$|E
40|$|Metagenomic {{analyses}} {{have advanced}} {{our understanding of}} ecological microbial diversity, but {{to what extent can}} metagenomic data be used to predict the metabolic capacity of difficult-to-study organisms and their abiotic environmental interactions? We tackle this question, using a comparative genomic approach, by considering the molecular basis of <b>aerobiosis</b> within archaea. Lipoylation, the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to 2 -oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes (OADHCs), is essential for metabolism in aerobic bacteria and eukarya. Lipoylation is catalysed either by lipoate protein ligase (LplA), which in archaea is typically encoded by two genes (LplA-N and LplA-C), or by a lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase (LipB or LipM) plus a lipoic acid synthetase (LipA). Does the genomic presence of lipoylation and OADHC genes across archaea from diverse habitats correlate with <b>aerobiosis?</b> First, analyses of 11, 826 biotin protein ligase (BPL) -LplA-LipB transferase family members and 147 archaeal genomes identified 85 species with lipoylation capabilities and provided support for multiple ancestral acquisitions of lipoylation pathways during archaeal evolution. Second, {{with the exception of the}} Sulfolobales order, the majority of species possessing lipoylation systems exclusively retain LplA, or either LipB or LipM, consistent with archaeal genome streamlining. Third, obligate anaerobic archaea display widespread loss of lipoylation and OADHC genes. Conversely, a high level of correspondence is observed between <b>aerobiosis</b> and the presence of LplA/LipB/ LipM, LipA and OADHC E 2, consistent with the role of lipoylation in aerobic metabolism.

Four of these media were selected for quantitative enumeration of L acidophilus La 05, L casei Lc 01, and B. animalis Bb 12.

This quantitative method is used to show how steady-state electron fluxes through the alternative cytochrome oxidases of Escherichia coli are distributed {{as a function of the}} extent of <b>aerobiosis</b> of glucose-limited chemostat cultures. At low oxygen availability the electron flux is mainly via the high-affinity cytochrome bd oxidase, and, at higher oxygen availability, a similar phenomenon occurs but now via the low-affinity cytochrome bo oxidase.

At 10 °C, growth occurred at pH values equal to or higher than 5. 7 during anaerobiosis, whereas aerobic growth was observed from pH 5. 4. Growth rates during <b>aerobiosis</b> were similar at pH 5. 4 and pH 7.

To explore the possible role of this region in the regulation of sodA, we used oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to change the sequence of nucleotides - 48 through - 44 from 5 '-GGCAT- 3 ' to 5 '-TTACG- 3 '. We studied the effect of this altered sequence on the expression of sodA. The data showed that the altered sequence resulted in the constitutive expression of the gene. Thus, E. coli harboring a plasmid containing the mutated sodA gene (pSNM 6) were uninducible by paraquat in <b>aerobiosis</b> or by 2, 2 '-dipyridyl in <b>aerobiosis</b> or anaerobiosis. Furthermore, a multicopy plasmid containing the mutated sodA failed to titrate the repressor molecules present in an E. coli strain carrying the sodA-lacZ fusion.

A decrease in the oxygen partial pressure below 28. 0 mm of Hg resulted firstly in an increase of the respiratory enzymes (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NADH] oxidase, 2. 53 -fold; succinic dehydrogenase, 1. 4 -fold; cytochrome b 1 3. 91 -fold; and cytochrome a 2, 2. 45 -fold) before the electron transport system gradually collapsed as cytochrome a 2, followed by cytochrome b 1 succinic dehydrogenase, and finally NADH oxidase decreased in activity. The change from respiration to fermentation was initiated well before the oxygen tension reached zero by the increase in levels of fructose diphosphate-aldolase, glucose 6 -phosphate, and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydro-genases and a decrease in 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. When the dissolved oxygen tension reached zero, dry weight and CO 2 formation together with isocitrate dehydrogenase decreased, whereas acid production and phosphofruc-tokinase synthesis started to increase. Enzymatic investigations revealed that the kinetics of the enzyme phosphofructokinase from strict aerobic cultures (6. 9 ppm oxygen in solution) was adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -insensitive, whereas the same enzyme from anaerobic cultures was ATP-sensitive.

The PD of vancomycin (VAN), ampicillin-sulbactam (SAM), and piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) against enterococci were determined in vivo, comparing the following different conditions of inoculum preparation: <b>aerobiosis,</b> <b>aerobiosis</b> plus mu-cin, and anaerobiosis plus mucin. Drug exposure was expressed as {{the ratio of the}} area under the concentration-time curve for the free, unbound fraction of the drug to theMIC (fAUC/MIC) (VAN) or the time in a 24 -h period that the drug concentration for the free, unbound fraction exceeded theMIC under steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions (fT>MIC) (SAM and TZP) and linked to the change in log 10 CFU/thigh. Only anaerobiosis plus mucin enhanced the in vivo growth, yielding significant PD pa-rameters with all antibiotics. In conclusion, robust in vivo growth of enterococci was crucial for better determining the PD of tested antibacterial agents, and this was achieved by optimizing the procedure for preparing the inoculum. Enterococci are commensal organisms in the gastrointestinaltracts ofmany species, from insects to humans (1), but are also the third leading cause of hospital infections (2, 3). They display intrinsic and acquired resistance to almost all antibiotics in clini-cal use, and no single agent is able to kill more than 3 log 10 CFU/g in vivo (4). Animal models of infection are invaluable tools fo...|$|E
40|$|Soluble and membrane-bound {{inorganic}} pyrophosphatases (sPPase and H -PPase, respectively) of {{the purple}} nonsulfur bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum are differentially regulated by environmental growth conditions. Both proteins and their transcripts {{were found in}} cells of anaerobic phototrophic batch cultures along all growth phases, although they displayed different time patterns. However, in aerobic cells that grow in the dark, which exhibited the highest growth rates, Northern and Western blot analyses as well as activity assays demonstrated high sPPase levels but no H -PPase. It is noteworthy that H -PPase is highly expressed in aerobic cells under acute salt stress (1 M NaCl). H -PPase was also present in anaerobic cells growing at reduced rates in the dark under either fermentative or anaerobic respiratory conditions. Since H -PPase was detected not only under all anaerobic growth conditions but also under salt stress in <b>aerobiosis,</b> the corresponding gene is not invariably repressed by oxygen. Primer extension analyses showed that, under all anaerobic conditions tested, the R. rubrum H -PPase gene utilizes two activator-dependent tandem promoters, one with an FNR-like sequence motif {{and the other with}} a RegA motif, whereas in <b>aerobiosis</b> under salt stress, the H -PPase gene is transcribed from two further tandem promoters involving other transcription factors. These results demonstrate a tight transcriptional regulation of the H -PPase gene, which appears to be induced in response to a variety of environmental conditions, all of which constrain cell energetics...|$|E

Therefore SUT 1 was {{shown to be a}} novel potent sec 14 - 1 suppressor. Further, the hypoxic gene CSR 1 (YLR 380 W), a Sec 14 homolog, was upregulated upon SUT 1 constitutive expression. In addition, SUT 1 effects on both sec 14 - 1 suppression and on free sterol composition were abolished in a csr 1 -null background, showing that this gene acts downstream of SUT 1...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis {{of total}} {{cellular}} proteins of Ewhe-richia cob was studied after transfer of cultures from pH 6. 9 to pH 4. 3. Proteins indOced by such an external pH shift down {{were identified by}} mend- and bi-dimensional electrophoresis. 30 to 45 rain after an acid shift, a group of at least sixteen polypeptides was markedly induced. Four of these polypeptides corresponded to the well known heat shock proteins GroEL, DunK, HtpG and HtpM. Their pH induction was RpoH-depen-dent. Three other pH-induced proteins were previ-ously identified as stress proteins induced either by osmolarity or <b>aerobiosis</b> or low temperature (proteins 32 (defined in this paper), C 70. 0 an...|$|E
40|$|ArcBA is a two-component {{regulatory}} system of Escherichia coli involved in sensing oxygen availability and the concomitant transcriptional regulation of oxidative and fermentative catabolism. Based on in vitro data, {{it has been}} postulated that the redox state of the ubiquinone pool is the determinant for ArcB kinase activity. Here {{we report on the}} in vivo regulation of ArcB activation, as determined using a lacZ reporter specifically responsive to phosphorylated ArcA. Our results indicate that upon deletion of a ubiquinone biosynthetic enzyme, regulation of ArcB in the anaerobic-aerobic transition is not affected. In contrast, interference with menaquinone biosynthesis leads to inactivation of ArcB during anaerobic growth; this phenotype is fully rescued by addition of a menaquinone precursor. This clearly demonstrates that the menaquinones {{play a major role in}} ArcB activation. ArcB shows a complex pattern of regulation when E. coli is titrated through the entire <b>aerobiosis</b> range; ArcB is activated under anaerobic and subaerobic conditions and is much less active under fully aerobic and microaerobic conditions. Furthermore, there is no correlation between ArcB activation and the redox state of the ubiquinone pool, but there is a restricted correlation between the total cellular ubiquinone content and ArcB activity due to the considerable increase in the size of the ubiquinone pool with increasing degrees of <b>aerobiosis.</b> These results lead to the working hypothesis that the in vivo activity of ArcB in E. coli is modulated by the redox state of the menaquinone pool and that the ubiquinone/ubiquinol ratio in vivo surely is not the only determinant of ArcB activity...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori can {{transform}} from its normal helical bacillary morphology to a coccoid morphology. Since this coccoid form cannot be cultured in vitro, {{it has been}} speculated {{that it is a}} dormant form potentially involved in the transmission of H. pylori and in a patient's relapse after antibiotic therapy. In this study we determined the effects of aging, temperature, <b>aerobiosis,</b> starvation, and antibiotics on the morphologic conversion rate and culturability of H. pylori. <b>Aerobiosis</b> and the addition of a bactericidal antibiotic to the culture medium resulted in the highest conversion rate. During the conversion to coccoid forms, the cultures always lost culturability at the stage where 50 % of the organisms were still in bacillary form; this result indicated that culturability and coccoid morphology are two separate but related entities. Independent of the conditions used to induce the conversion into coccoids, the morphological conversion was accompanied by several marked antigenic and ultrastructural changes. Also, both the total amounts and the integrity of RNA and DNA were significantly reduced in coccoid forms. With the potential-sensitive probe diOC(5) - 3, a clear loss of membrane potential in coccoid forms was observed. Inhibition of protein or RNA synthesis by the addition of bacteriostatic antibiotics did not prevent the conversion to coccoid forms but resulted in an increased conversion rate. Hence, we conclude that conversion of H. pylori from the bacillary to the coccoid form is a passive process that does not require protein synthesis. Our data suggest that the coccoid form of H. pylori is the morphologic manifestation of bacterial cell death...|$|E
30|$|Two further {{well-documented}} {{features of}} D. bruxellensis are {{its ability to}} produce acetic acid from glucose, although only under <b>aerobiosis</b> conditions (Leite et al. 2013), and the Custer effect, the temporary inhibition of fermentation under anaerobic conditions (Wijsman et al. 1984; Scheffers 1979). In previous studies {{it has been suggested}} that D. bruxellensis is not able to produce glycerol (Gerós et al. 2000; Wijsman et al. 1984). However, we and others demonstrated that small amounts of glycerol are produced by this yeast (Pereira et al. 2012; Leite et al. 2013). In general, yeasts produce glycerol to redress the imbalance in redox potential, in anaerobic or oxygen-limiting growth conditions (van Dijken and Scheffers 1986).|$|E
