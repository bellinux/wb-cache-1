Wire Electrical Discharge Machine (WEDM) is an <b>advanced</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool,</b> extensively used to machine hard to cut materials like nickel, titanium and other super alloys. Selection of WEDM process parameters to yield the desired level of performance measures like Material removal Rate (MRR) and Surface Roughness (SR) is crucial from quality and economic view points. In the present work an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of WEDM process parameters such as pulse on time, pulse off time, peak current and servo voltage in machining of Nimonic- 263 alloy. A central composite face centered design of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been used for experimental plan. The significance of process parameters are estimated by ANOVA analysis. Mathematical prediction models are developed for MRR and SR by RSM. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used to optimize the performances of the process. Results of RSM and PSO technique are compared. It has been observed that, performance of the PSO is better than that of RSM.

This development effort is for motor technologies of high power density and high efficiency. Such motors that are also small and light-weight are not available on the commercial market because high-power motors have typically been used in large industrial applications where small size and light weight are not requirements. AC Delco has been developing motors since 1918 and is interested in leveraging its research and development dollars to produce an array of motor systems for vehicles {{and to develop a}} future line of propulsion products. The DOE focus of the study was applied to machining applications. The most attractive feature of this motor is the axial air gap, which may make possible the removal of the motor`s stationary component from a total enclosure of the remainder of the machine if the power characteristics are adequate. The objectives of this project were to evaluate alternative electric drive systems for machine tools and automotive electric drive systems and to select a best machine type for each of those applications. A major challenge of this project was to produce a small, light-weight, highly efficient motor at a cost-effective price. The project developed machine and machine drive systems and design criteria for the range of applications. The final results included the creation of a baseline for developing electric vehicle powertrain system designs, conventional vehicle engine support system designs, and <b>advanced</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> configurations. In addition, an axial gap permanent magnet motor was built and tested, and gave, said one engineer involved, a sterling performance.

Laser cutting machine is widely known for having the most number of controllable parameters among the <b>advanced</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools,</b> hence become more difficult to engineer the process into desired responses; surface roughness and kerf width. Mastering both laser processing and ANFIS programming are difficult task for most researchers, especially for the difficult to model processes.

It has been already proved that hard turning is capable technology in cutting of hardened steels however, there are few results regarding to bore manufacturing. Therefore, the replace ability of hard turning against grinding must be defined in high precision bores when the workpiece has different geometry (bore diameter, length to diameter ratio, wall thickness ratio). Moreover, as tolerances given for a workpiece are getting stricter, the transition range between hard turning and grinding must be determined. In some cases, it can be also worthy to utilize the advantages of these two processes to create a powerful combined technology. Therefore, a set of rules was developed to assist the selection of proper process at process planning.

Nc <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> {{with the aid of}} microelectronics and computer technology rapid progress, is toward high precision, multi-function, high speed, high efficiency, composite processing functions, such as intelligent direction, our country numerical control system in the technology has already become more and more mature, in the major key technologies, has reached the foreign <b>advanced</b> level. CNC <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> production and application The generation of nc <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> and its importance With the rapid development of science and technology, the society product variety requirements increasingly intense, product update more and more quickly, many varieties, the proportion of medium and small batch production increased significantly. At the same time, along with the aviation industry, automobile industry and light industry consumer goods production growth, complex shape parts is more and more, more and more is also high accuracy requirement. In addition, the fierce market competition requirements product development production cycle is mor...|$|R
