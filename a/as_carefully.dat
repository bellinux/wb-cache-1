5|$|The {{surviving}} Pipe roll from 1130 records {{an income}} of £24,500. This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850. The income that they record {{in the early years}} of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225. Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.|$|E

25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> as possible. If there is no free flow valve, as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{believed}} {{that one of}} the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that [...] "If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way." [...] He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as [...] "making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher.|$|E
500|$|Like his {{predecessor}} Rafael Kubelík, {{and his successor}} Colin Davis, Solti found his early days as musical director marred by vituperative hostility from a small clique in the Covent Garden audience. Rotten vegetables were thrown at him, and his car was vandalised outside the theatre, with the words [...] "Solti must go!" [...] scratched on its paintwork. Some press reviews were strongly critical; Solti was so wounded by a review in The Times of his conducting of The Marriage of Figaro that he almost left Covent Garden in despair. The {{chief executive of the}} Opera House, Sir David Webster, persuaded him to stay with the company, and matters improved, helped by changes on which Solti insisted. The chorus and orchestra were strengthened, and in the interests of musical and dramatic excellence, Solti secured the introduction of the stagione system of scheduling performances, rather than the traditional repertory system. By 1967 The Times commented that [...] "Patrons of Covent Garden today automatically expect any new production, and indeed any revival, to be as strongly cast as anything at the Met in New York, and <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> presented as anything in Milan or Vienna".|$|E

500|$|Solti, however, was an {{advocate}} of opera in the vernacular, and promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. Among those who came to prominence during the decade were Gwyneth Jones and Peter Glossop. Solti demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi. Nevertheless, Solti and Webster had {{to take into account}} the complete opposition on the part of such stars as Callas to opera in translation. Moreover, as Webster recognised, the English-speaking singers wanted to learn their roles in the original so that they could sing them in other countries and on record. Increasingly, productions were in the original language. In the interests of musical and dramatic excellence, Solti was a strong proponent of the stagione system of scheduling performances, rather than the traditional repertory system. By 1967, The Times said, [...] "Patrons of Covent Garden today automatically expect any new production, and indeed any revival, to be as strongly cast as anything at the Met in New York, and <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> presented as anything in Milan or Vienna".|$|E
500|$|Washington would {{normally}} have assigned {{the duties of}} advance guard to Daniel Morgan and his riflemen, but he had detached these to assist Horatio Gates {{in the defense of}} the Hudson River Valley against the advance of General John Burgoyne. [...] Since they were unavailable, he organized a light infantry corps consisting of 700 picked men from Continental Army regiments (including future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, who would go on to fight in the coming battle) and about 1,000 Pennsylvania and Delaware militia, and placed them under the command of Brigadier General William Maxwell. [...] These troops occupied Iron Hill and Cooch's Bridge. General Nathanael Greene advocated moving the entire Continental Army to this position, believing the Christina River to be a more defensible point, but Washington declined, instead ordering [...] Maxwell to monitor British movements and slow its advance {{while the rest of the}} army fortified the Red Clay Creek and Wilmington. [...] Maxwell's men were encamped on either side of the road leading south from Cooch's Bridge toward Aiken's Tavern (present-day Glasgow, Delaware) in a series of small camps designed to facilitate ambushes. [...] On August 28, Washington, atop Iron Hill, and Howe, on Gray's Hill, observed each other as they took stock of the enemy's position; one of the Hessian generals wrote, [...] "These gentlemen observed us with their glasses <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> as we observed them. [...] Those of our officers who know Washington well, maintained that the man in the plain coat was Washington." ...|$|E

2500|$|B. Barry Levy {{notes that}} the 16th century Rabbi Ibn Zimra recounted [...] "how he {{restored}} the scrolls to their original state" [...] and noted [...] "the importance of having textual consistency in the scrolls, because criticisms of how Jews preserved and transmitted the Torah text contained accusations that they willfully changed it." [...] Levy also suggests that [...] "Torah scrolls remain prized and frequently used ritual objects, and scribes have continually worked <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> as possible to copy them, always holding dear the belief that they were producing as accurate and correct a text as they could. Unfortunately even this commitment and care could not guarantee a letter-perfect text".|$|E

When salvage crews finally recovered {{the remains of the}} torpedo and the launch tube, analysis determined that both bore signs of distortion and heat damage that were consistent with an explosion near the middle of the torpedo, very close to an essential welded joint. The official conclusion of the commission was that a faulty weld had led to the explosion.|$|E

2500|$|The modern {{presidency}} {{holds the}} president {{as one of the}} nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as [...] "propagandized leadership" [...] which has a [...] "mesmerizing power surrounding the office". Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras. One critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> framed [...] "in rich detail" [...] which [...] "drew on the power of myth" [...] regarding the incident of PT 109 and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions. As a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to [...] "drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees".|$|E
2500|$|Touring and {{recording}} {{as a solo}} artist from the late 1980s through the 1990s with bassists Mike Maffei, [...] John S. McClure (later to become a professor of Divinity at Vanderbilt University), and Ron Easley, and with drummers Doug Garrison and, from 1993 on, Richard Dworkin (who also played for many years with the jazz group The Microscopic Septet), Chilton gained a reputation for his eclectic taste in song covers, guitar work, and laconic stage presence. Writing about a live performance in the New York Times, critic Peter Watrous said of Chilton that [...] "He's a soul and blues guitar connoisseur; he chooses his guitar licks <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> as he does the blues songs he covers, and during his solos, a listener heard a history of soul and blues guitar." [...] Watrous {{went on to say}} of the show that [...] "Irony flowed over everything, {{and it was hard to}} tell exactly what Mr. Chilton was after, except perhaps a little fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Managing {{editor of}} The Sun, Richard Caseby, said the {{newspaper}} had faced [...] "a very difficult decision". Both media outlets argued they had released the video [...] "in the public interest". BBC News showed {{some parts of}} the video. Sky News decided not to follow suit, as senior editors were of the opinion that the graphic images were [...] "unnecessarily distressing". Both ITV and the BBC ran warnings before showing the footage. Most of Britain's national daily newspapers grabbed still images from the video footage for their front pages the next morning. A BBC executive said that the news organisation edited the footage before broadcasting, and [...] "dealt with the material <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> as we could." [...] The spokesman said they [...] "thought very carefully about the pictures...and gave great consideration to how we used the footage". They argued that the footage was an important element of the story and shed light on the perpetrators and the possible motives for the attack." ...|$|E

2500|$|An article {{reportedly}} {{written by}} the composer appeared in the Moscow newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva {{a few days before}} the premiere of the Fifth Symphony. There, he reportedly states that the work [...] "is a Soviet artist’s creative response to justified criticism." [...] Whether Shostakovich or someone more closely connected with the Party actually wrote the article is open to question, but the phrase [...] "justified criticism"—a reference to the denunciation of the composer in 1936—is especially telling. Official critics treated the work as a turnaround in its composer's career, a personal perestroyka or [...] "restructuring" [...] by the composer, with the Party engineering Shostakovich's rehabilitation <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> as it had his fall a couple of years earlier. Like the Pravda attack at that time on the opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, the political basis for extolling the Fifth Symphony was to show how the Party could make artists bow to its demands. It had to show that it could reward as easily and fully as it could punish.|$|E
2500|$|The Hugo- and Nebula-nominated novella [...] "Death and Designation Among the Asadi" [...] {{forms the}} first part of Transfigurations, a novel {{published}} in 1979 by Berkley Putnam. The story continues when the daughter of the anthropologist who studied the Asadi, a hominid-like race on the planet Bosk'veld, investigates his disappearance. [...] In the journal Foundation, John Clute writes that the novel is [...] "a fever of explanation. Hypothesis builds on hypothesis , and much of the resulting construction is beautifully crafted, almost hallucinatory it is so plausible. But of course these explanations are never enough – and the intellectual tact by which Bishop makes them almost but not quite fit the data they are meant to make transparent is perhaps the strongest part of this extremely dense and carefully thought-through novel." [...] Theodore Sturgeon writes [...] "Michael Bishop's Transfigurations is as complex, <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> thought-out, and as compelling an sf novel as you'll find anywhere, ever." [...] Transfigurations was nominated for the British Science Fiction Association Award in 1980.|$|E

As we have lived, so will we die– together." [...] The 67-year-old Isidor likewise refused an offer to board on account of his age, saying: [...] "I do not wish any distinction in my favor which is not granted to others." [...] They were last seen alive on deck arm in arm. Major Archibald Butt, military aide to US President William Howard Taft, escorted to the boat Marie Young, a former music teacher to the children of President Theodore Roosevelt. She later recalled he [...] "wrapped blankets about me and tucked me in <b>as</b> <b>carefully</b> as if we were going on a motor ride."
