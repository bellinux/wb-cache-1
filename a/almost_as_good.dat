5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat {{was in the best}} shape, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E

Foreshadowing what would eventually become a storied rivalry, the 1904 race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub.|$|E

A symmetric operator is said to be essentially self-adjoint if the closure of A is self-adjoint. Equivalently, A is essentially self-adjoint if it has a unique self-adjoint extension. In practical terms, having an essentially self-adjoint operator is <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as having a self-adjoint operator, since we merely need to take the closure to obtain self-adjoint operator.|$|E
25|$|This was an {{incredible}} feat, considering that Australia's bowling attack was <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as its batting. Their bowling-lineup boasted of some stellar names: Keith Miller, who was a genuine allrounder capable of giving very good performances with both bat and the ball, Ray Lindwall, who was said to possess absolute mastery of bowling in any condition, an who was bowling accurately, with penetrative and attacking bowling, and Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston, who were both equally vital cogs in the team. This particular innings of Hazare's {{was said to have}} enhanced India's reputation as well as his. In the process, Hazare emulated Bradman, who did the same in the previous test.|$|E

40|$|Stand-up comedy {{does not}} play a {{significant}} role in how the mainstream social sciences are communicated. The structures and techniques used to deliver academic knowledge are usually infused with seriousness. Humour, as a vehicle for expressing an argument, is often seen as antithetical to the ‘proper’ delivery of ideas (Watson, 2015). In this paper, I will argue that the social sciences have a great deal to learn from the structure of stand-up comedy when it comes to sharing research, both in written and oral formats. As anthropologist Kate Fox said, “at its best … social science can sometimes be <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> insightful <b>as</b> <b>good</b> stand-up comedy” (2004, p. 71) ...|$|R
500|$|LeMond did not apologize. The U.S. {{team was}} {{not set up}} as the European teams, {{and did not have}} an {{independent}} race to determine the national champion. Instead the highest finisher at the World's was considered the national champion. LeMond had argued for the team to compete as the European teams did, but team management and Boyer voted against him. Thus unlike the other teams at the world championship, the US riders were competing against each other. Aged 21, LeMond was the first American pro to win a medal at the World's since Frank Kramer took silver in 1912. Said LeMond: [...] "I'm racing for Renault and I'm racing for myself.

It was directed by Hiroji Kiyotake and Hiroyuki Kimura, and designed by Makoto Kano, while Takahiro Harada serving as the main programmer. Metroid II marked a [...] "new high point" [...] for handheld game consoles, with graphics that were <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as the 8-bit graphics in games for the NES. The game features enhancements from its predecessor that include easier controls which allow Samus to crouch while firing at the same time, and jump while shooting straight down to attack anything below her. The game also utilizes the cartridge's battery-backed memory for saving the player's progress. In the 2004 interview for the Nintendo Dream magazine, Kiyotake revealed that the planet SR388 was named after the Yamaha SR400 motorcycle.|$|E

Feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the Village Voice: [...] "Lazenby... seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates".|$|E
