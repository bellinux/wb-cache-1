Not knowing whether this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so surprised and overwhelmed that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately.|$|E

5|$|A mile east of Highway 133, {{the valley}} floor widens, filled with farms and subdivisions as the road gently trends to the south. Five miles (8km) east of Carbondale, Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County. Subdivisions begin to {{increase}} in the surrounding valley and the road soon turns to the south again as it passes a built-up area and then crosses the Roaring Fork. <b>A</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> a half after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork and then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma.|$|E
5|$|After Oxbow's maiden win, he {{was flown}} to Hollywood Park in California {{to run in}} the Grade I CashCall Futurity at <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> one-sixteenth (1,700m) on a {{synthetic}} surface. He was the longest shot in the field at 61–1, and drew the far outside post at number eleven. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, his fifth jockey in five races, Oxbow broke well coming out the gate. He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite losing ground by being four horses wide around the first turn and three wide around the final turn. Oxbow finished fourth, nine lengths back, but earned his first Road to the Kentucky Derby point, and a speed figure of 87.|$|E

5|$|As sweet {{a little}} nook as ever Ulysses mooned away a day in, during his memorable voyage homeward. Though merely a small bay, {{about a mile}} in breadth, and curving inland for <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> a half, it is quite {{sheltered}} from all winds save the east, being flanked {{to the south and}} west by Haskeval and Hondeval, and guarded on the northern side by a low range of heathery slopes.

5|$|Both {{stations}} {{closed in}} the 1960s {{as part of the}} Beeching Axe. Shepton Mallet (High Street) closed with the withdrawal of passenger services on the Yatton to Witham line in 1963, though part of the former East Somerset line remains open for freight and as a heritage railway. Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) closed in 1966 with the closure of the Somerset and Dorset line. Nowadays, the nearest Network Rail station is Castle Cary, some eight miles south of Shepton Mallet. However, the nearest station on the East Somerset Railway is Mendip Vale, which is <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> a half away.|$|E

5|$|Shannon (1941–1955), named Shannon II in America, was an {{outstanding}} Australian Thoroughbred racehorse who {{was inducted into}} the Hall of Fame. He created new racecourse records in Australia before he was sold to an American buyer who exported him to California in 1948. There Shannon equalled the world record of 1:47 for the nine furlongs (1,800 metres) in winning the Forty Niner Handicap Stakes, then one week later equalled the world record of 1:59 for <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> a quarter (2,000 metres). Shannon was named the 1948 American Champion Older Male Horse. At stud in America he proved to be a good sire.|$|E
5|$|Stanton and Pike {{stopped to}} rest, and Reed {{returned}} alone to the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> a half (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks {{to make room for the}} wagons.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 Belmont Stakes was the 105th {{running of}} the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York held on June 9, 1973.

5|$|The western {{terminus}} is at exit24 on I-96, {{one mile}} (1.6km) east of Marne. In Ottawa County, {{the road is}} called Ironwood Drive. Beginning at the Kent County border, the street is called Remembrance Road (in honor {{of those who died}} in battle). From its western terminus, the road angles southeast–northwest for about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> a half (2.4km). Then M-11 turns south on Wilson Avenue to run north–south through Walker. Wilson Avenue intersects M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) in the Standale Business District. South of Lake Michigan Drive, the trunkline continues on Wilson Avenue through the edge of a rural area. The highway runs through forest land near Millennium Park until it crosses the Grand River at I-196.|$|E
5|$|From the Rutgers Street intersection, Route 7 {{continues}} along Washington Avenue {{for about}} <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> {{a half before}} reaching Nutley, still continuing on Washington Avenue into Nutley. At the intersection with County Route 646 (Park Avenue), Route 7 turns into a municipally maintained road and enters a more residential area. Upon intersecting County Route 606 (Kingsland Road), Route 7 crosses into Clifton, Passaic County and heads to the west on county-maintained Kingsland Street signed eastwest. Kingsland, carrying Route 7, crosses back into Nutley, regaining state maintenance. When Kingsand becomes County Route 644 at the intersection with Cathedral Avenue, Route 7 turns north from Kingsland onto Cathedral Avenue and comes to its terminus at Orange St in Nutley. However, signage continues to indicate Route 7 up to the terminus of Cathedral Avenue at interchange with Route 3 {{at the intersection of}} Cathedral Avenue, Passaic Avenue, and Ward Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Saint Paul Public Schools {{purchased}} a {{parcel of land}} about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> half west of the Unidale Mall on University Avenue from 3M. Construction of the new facility was planned to start in 2005, costing $7 million. When construction bids were higher than expected, the price tag went up to $8 million and the project was postponed to allow for planning to reduce costs. Construction started in late November 2006 after price concerns had been resolved. The building opened in early December 2007, with a total cost of $7.5 million. It was dedicated one day before the two-year anniversary of Gordon Parks's death. He died on March 7, 2006; the building was dedicated on March 6, 2008.|$|E

5|$|In {{the town}} of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 meet the {{southern}} terminus of NY65. Exiting the hamlet, US20 and NY5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. <b>A</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> a half from the town line, US20 and NY5 intersect NY64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US20 and NY5. NY64, whose right-of-way ends at US20 and NY5 {{at the foot of}} a small hill, joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb. Near the junction with NY444, US20, NY5 and NY64 take on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.|$|E
5|$|North of Romeo, the {{trunkline}} {{passes through}} agricultural areas of The Thumb {{region of the}} state. M-53 crosses into Lapeer County south of Almont. Further north, Van Dyke Road meets I-69 in Imlay City, running through the downtown area north of the Interstate; Imlay City is also {{the location of a}} crossing of the Canadian National Railway line that carries Amtrak's Blue Water service between Flint and Port Huron. In the unincorporated community of Burnside, M-53 intersects M-90. The two highways run concurrently for about <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> a half (2.4km) before separating. M-53 continues northward and crosses into Sanilac County near Marlette. In that city, the highway crosses a branch line of the Huron and Eastern Railway (HESR) before continuing through downtown. From Marlette northward, M-53 runs parallel to, and about a mile east of, the Sanilac–Tuscola county line. The highway follows Van Dyke Road through rural farming country past intersections with M-46 and M-81 and across the Cass River before crossing into Huron County.|$|E
5|$|Old Business Spur I-96 (Old BS I-96) is {{the section}} of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the {{intersection}} with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in downtown Detroit and an unsigned state trunkline highway. It was previously a business spur of I-96. Picking up where M-5 ends at the interchange with I-96, Old BS I-96 follows Grand River Avenue southeasterly. The road itself is bounded by businesses as it passes through residential neighborhoods on Detroit's West Side. About <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> three-quarters (2.8km) along, the highway crosses I-96 again, and I-96 from here into the downtown area parallels Grand River Avenue. Old BS I-96 here is mostly residential. It passes Bishop Park near Grand Boulevard and then crosses I-94. In the North Corktown neighborhood, Grand River Avenue crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MotorCity Casino. About a half mile (0.7km) past M-10, Old BS I-96 crosses I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and enters Downtown Detroit's Foxtown neighborhood. State maintenance ends at the five-way intersection between Grand River Avenue, Cass Avenue, and Middle Street. Grand River Avenue continues another five blocks to Woodward Avenue and another four blocks as it curves in an arc around Grand Circus Park.|$|E
