40|$|The <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> of {{immunization}} with heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tbc) and Tuberculin (PPD) -coupled syngeneic {{tumor cells}} was examined in vivo. Three tumor cell lines were employed. Immunization of Tbc-primed BALB/c mice with PPD-coupled syngeneic Meth-A tumor cells displayed a potent <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> on viable Meth-A cells inoculated subcutaneously. Neither PPD-coupled LLC (Lewis Lung Carcinoma) cells nor sonicated PPD-coupled Meth-A cells {{were capable of}} immunizing these mice. PPD-coupled syngeneic whole tumor cells were indispensable for induction of this tumor-specific resistance. Immunization of Tbc-primed C 3 H/He mice with PPD-coupled syngeneic MH 134 tumor cells did not elicit anti-tumor activity against MH 134, but additional pretreatment of mice with cyclophosphamide brought on an <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect.</b> Antimetastatic reactivity was investigated in C 57 BL/ 6 mice bearing LLC, with a reduction in metastases noted. This antimetastatic effect was observed even when the mice were immunized with PPD-coupled LLC cells three days after removal of the initial tumor. Immunization with Tbc and PPD-coupled Meth-A cells together with intraperitoneal administration of murine or rat interleukin 2 (IL 2) further augmented anti-Meth-A resistance.

Furthermore, {{it has been shown}} that it has significant anti-tumor effects, which are mediated by T cells and natural killer cells, in a manner similar to interleukin- 12. Here, we report the evaluation of the effects of the systemic administration of interleukin- 18 in combination with B 7 - 1 (CD 80) expressed on tumor cells [interleukin- 18 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1] on the growth of murine B 16 melanoma in vivo. After the subcutaneous inoculation of B 16 melanoma, B 16 tumors grew progressively in immunocompetent syngeneic C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Mice treated with either interleukin- 18 or immunized with B 7 - 1 -transduced B 16 did not demonstrate significant <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect.</b> The combination of the two treatments, however, resulted in dramatic suppression of melanoma formation, tumor growth, and a significant improvement in survival. Inhibitory effects of [interleukin- 18 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1] on lung metastasis in mice were also detected. Additionally, mice treated with [interleukin- 18 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1] showed an increase of natural killer cytotoxicity and interferon-γ production in vivo. Unlike [interleukin- 18 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1], [interleukin- 12 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1] did not have a strong <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> against B 16 melanoma. Histologic characterization after the [interleukin- 18 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1] treatment confirmed the infiltration of natural killer cells into the tumor, suggesting that natural killer cells may be involved in the [interleukin- 18 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1]-induced <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect.</b> This finding was confirmed by showing that depletion of NK 1. 1 + cells before immunization inhibits the [interleukin- 18 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1]-induced <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect.</b> Depletion of CD 3 + cells in vivo also decreased the <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> of [interleukin- 18 [*]+[*]B 7 - 1], suggesting the importance of CD 3 + T cells.

Nonetheless, the low immunogenicity of parenterally administered vaccines, particularly regarding the activation of cytotoxic CD 8 + T cell responses, suggests that further improvements in both vaccine composition and administration routes are still required. In the present study, we report the immune responses and <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effects</b> of a DNA vaccine (pgD-E 7 E 6 E 5) expressing three proteins (E 7, E 6, and E 5) of the human papillomavirus type 16 genetically fused to the glycoprotein D of the human herpes simplex virus type 1, which was administered to mice by the intradermal (id) route using a gene gun.

Plus, results {{of research on the}} <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effects</b> of selenium compounds remain controversial. Methods We investigated levels of Ang- 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the estrogen-independent bone metastatic mammary cancer (MDA-MB- 231) cells in response to treatment by methylseleninic acid (MSeA), and further examined the effects of MSeA oral administration on xenograft mammary tumors of athymic nude mice by RT-PCR, Western, radioimmuno assay, and Immunohistochemistry. Results Treatment of MDA-MB- 231 cells with MSeA caused significant reduction of Ang- 2 mRNA transcripts and secretion of Ang- 2 proteins by the cells. Level of VEGF protein was accordingly decreased following the treatment. Compared with the controls, oral administration of MSeA (3 [*]mg/kg/day for 18 [*]days) to the nude mice carrying MDA-MB- 231 induced tumors resulted in significant reduction in xenograft tumor volume and weights, significant decrease in microvascular density, and promotion of vascular normalization by increasing pericytes coverage. As expected, level of VEGF was also decreased in MSeA treated tumors. Conclusions Our results point out that MSeA exerts its <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effects,</b> at least in part, by inhibiting the Ang- 2 /Tie 2 pathway, probably via inhibiting VEGF. </p...|$|R

In this study, we investigate the <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> of YM 529 on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods Direct <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> of YM 529 against 8 NSCLC cell lines (adenocarcinoma: H 23, H 1299, NCI-H 1819, NCI-H 2009, H 44, A 549, adenosquamous cell carcinoma: NCI-H 125, squamous cell carcinoma: NCI-H 157) were measured by MTS assay and calculated inhibition concentration 50 % (IC 50) values. YM 529 induced apoptosis of NCI-H 1819 was examined by DNA fragmentation of 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis and flowcytometric analysis (sub-G 1 method). We examined where YM 529 given effect to apoptosis of NSCLC cells in signaling pathway of the mevalonate pathway by western blotting analysis. Results We found that there was direct <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> of YM 529 on 8 NSCLC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and their IC 50 values were 2. 1 to 7. 9 μM and YM 529 induced apoptosis and G 1 arrest cell cycle with dose-dependent manner and YM 529 caused down regulation of phospholyration of ERK 1 / 2 in signaling pathways of NSCLC cell line (NCI-H 1819).

Previous studies have revealed CD 26 expression in T cell leukemia/lymphoma and malignant mesothelioma, and an inhibitory effect of anti-CD 26 monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the growth of CD 26 + cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The function of CD 26 in tumor development is unknown and the machinery with which the CD 26 mAb induces its <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> remains uncharacterized. Results The localization of CD 26 in the nucleus of T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells and mesothelioma cells was shown by biochemical and immuno-electron microscopic analysis. The DPPIV enzyme activity was revealed in the nuclear fraction of T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells. These expressions of intra-nuclear CD 26 were augmented by treatment with the CD 26 mAb, 1 F 7, with <b>anti-tumor</b> <b>effect</b> against the CD 26 + T cell leukemia/lymphoma cells.
