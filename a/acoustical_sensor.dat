40|$|The faint fluxes {{of cosmic}} neutrinos {{expected}} {{at very high}} energies require large instrumented detector volumes. The necessary volumes in combination with a sufficient shielding against background constitute forbidding and complex environments (e. g. the deep sea) as sites for neutrino telescopes. To withstand these environments and to assure the data quality, the sensors have to be reliable and their operation has to {{be as simple as}} possible. A compact sensor module design including all necessary components for data acquisition and module calibration would simplify the detector mechanics and ensures the long term operability of the detector. The compact design discussed here combines optical and acoustical sensors inside one module, therefore reducing electronics and additional external instruments for calibration purposes. In this design the <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> is primary used for acoustic positioning of the module. The module may also be used for acoustic particle detection and marine science if an appropriate <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> is chosen. First tests of this design are promising concerning the task of calibration. To expand the field of application also towards acoustic particle detection further improvements concerning electromagnetic shielding and adaptation of the single components are necessary.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} a directional speech acquisition system using a MEMS cubic <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> microarray cluster to improve speech intelligibility in a noisy reverberant acoustical environment. In the proposed system, five identical <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays constitute the five sides of a cubic geometry whereas {{the other side of the}} cube is to be used for interconnection and packaging purposes. Each of the sensor microarrays is associated with two beam shapes: a main beam to acquire speech signal from a particular direction and a scanning beam to locate and track a potential speech source. A microelectronics based beam synthesis engine controls the selection of a main beam to acquire speech signals from a particular direction based on the output level of the five scanning beams. In this way the developed system provides an improved reduced noise dynamic directional speech acquisition system covering a 3 -D space. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical And Electronic Engineering) A {{need was}} {{established}} {{for the development of}} a <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> in silicon. The <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> is based on the silicon pressure sensor. This sensor consists of a silicon membrane which is formed from silicon bulk material by means of etching. By transforming the movement of the membrane into a variation of capacitance, it is possible to detect a change in pressure. Signal processing is needed to insure that the : information, received from the sensor, is useable and accurate. The physical aspects of sound was investigated. An important relationship was derived between the intensity of a sound and the pressure associated with it. Because silicon was used in a mechanical environment, the mechanical properties of the material were investigated. A model was developed to simplify the design of the senor. A expression was derived for the movement of the membrane for any uniform load applied to it. The variation in capacitance was given by integrating over the area of the membrane. The condense microphone was used as a example of a design of a <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor.</b> Arising from the example, the natural frequency of the silicon membrane was looked into. A variety of diaphragms were made to provide for a wide working area. Some of the manufacturingprocesses were individually examincd and changed to comply with the manufacturing of the diaphragms. The important process of etching was thoroughly investigated. An excellent etching agent was found with which accurate micro machining could be done. Using this etching agent, a variety of silicon and poll silicon diaphragms were made. Most of the silicon diaphragms were suceossfully formed. The. poli silicon diaphragms were however deformed because of internal stress which developed during the forming process. A signal processing circuit was developed to perform the task of transforming the variation in capacitance to a variation in voltage. The circuit utilised the current through the capacitor to establish the variation in capacitance. The current was transferred to a voltage by a differencing current amplifier.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a {{digital signal processing}} sensor array system, based on randomly distributed sensor nodes, for surveillance and source localization applications. In most array processing the sensor array geometry is fixed and known and the steering array vector/manifold information is used in beamformation. In this system, array calibration may be impractical due to unknown placement and orientation of the sensors with unknown frequency/spatial responses. This paper proposes a blind beamforming technique, using only the measured sensor data, to form either a sample data or a sample correlation matrix. The maximum power collection criterion is used to obtain array weights from the dominant eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of a matrix eigenvalue problem. Theoretical justification of this approach uses a generalization of Szegö’s theory of the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of the Toeplitz form. An efficient blind beamforming time delay estimate of the dominant source is proposed. Source localization based on a least squares (LS) method for time delay estimation is also given.

A detailed study of this mechanism which encompasses the motion analysis of the whip-tip as well as the determination of the local origin of the shock emission requires a sophisticated recording technique. A pre-trigger framing high-speed video camera system was used which was triggered by an <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> and synchronized with a pulsed copper-vapour laser. The phenomena were visualized by the direct shadowgraph method and recorded cinemtographically as digital images at a frame rate of 9 kHz using a CCD-matrix with 256 (H) x 128 (V) pixels. The resulting series of frames allowed, for the first time, (i) a reconstruction of the whip-tip trajectory, (ii) a determination of the tuft velocity and acceleration, (iii) a correlation of whip-tip kinematics with shock wave emission, and (iv) a motion analysis of the turning and unfolding mechanism of the tuft.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Geology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Suspended {{particulate}} matter (SPM) {{plays an important}} role in the biogeochemistry of estuaries and wetlands. Recent wetland restoration efforts have targeted tidal wetlands; yet, many questions pertaining to SPM dynamics s remain. A paired in situ optical and <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> package was deployed for several weeks during the winter in the main channel at Browns Island, CA, in order to identify processes controlling estuarine and marsh sediment dynamics. Turbidity, particle volume concentration and particulate attenuation were employed as surrogates of SPM concentration. The slope of the particulate attenuation spectra, ???, and laser diffraction were used to study particle size dynamics and flocculation processes. Water samples were collected hourly over one tidal cycle at the end of the study period for SPM concentration and organic content in support of optical measurements. Together these observations helped elucidate the role of tidal wetlands in the cycling of estuarine particles. Tidal action was a driving force of particle dynamics at Browns Island, as fluctuations in tidal water levels controlled wetland inundation and current velocity. SPM surrogates were maximum at the height of the higher high (HH) flood tide and minimum at lower low (LL) tide water level, consistent with the loss of SPM through deposition and/or flocculation due to the interaction of estuarine water with the island. Following HH slack tide, particles smaller than 133 ???m flocculated into larger particle aggregates. The largest aggregates reached a maximum size of 150 ???m during the ebb tide. The controlling mechanism for flocculation was likely particle to particle collisions and differential settling in the presence of organic rich pore waters draining from the marsh. The transport of organic rich flocs could be an important mechanism for the export of contaminants and organic matter off of the island and into the estuary. Geolog...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} the design methodology and fabrication procedures for a MEMS-based square planar <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> microarray {{for use in}} a hearing instrument to improve speech intelligibility in noisy and reverberant environments. The proposed microarray offers the potential of controlled directional sensitivity with a reasonably constant beamwidth over the audio frequency range when used in conjunction with an appropriate digital signal processor. The microarray consists of nine identical square-shaped capacitive-type acoustical sensors in a 3 x 3 planar layout and has a footprint area of 4. 6 x 4. 6 mm 2. Each sensor has a sensitivity of 10. 3 mV/Pa when biased at 12 volts. A beamforming algorithm pertaining to MEMS realization of a square planar array of uniformly spaced identical acoustical sensors has been developed. A new analytical model has been developed that provides a better approximation to the pull-in voltage of capacitive type square diaphragm acoustical sensors as compared to existing models. A MEMS-based three-dimensional modular package has been developed for the microarray where silicon has been used as the package material. The package realizes a complete microsystem by holding the microarray, necessary microelectronics dies and a power source in stacked submodules. Two different schemes have been developed to establish intermodular electrical connectivity. The first scheme uses pressure-dependent cantilevered bridge-type microspring contacts that are fabricated {{as an integral part of}} a package submodule. The second scheme uses a MEMS-based microbus card to establish intermodular connectivity by using interconnection channels that are present in each package submodule. The design methodology and fabrication process was developed through the extensive use of simulation tools.

The FEA results closely match theoretical values predicted by the design methodology. The design has been sent for analysis and prototype fabrication costing to the Corning-IntelliSense Corporation.

40|$|Undesired, human {{behavior}} in public environments {{is an increasing}} issue in today’s society. The overload of security operators and law enforcement addresses the need for automatic detection of anomalous behavior. The EU-project ADABTS aims to facilitate the protection of EU citizens, property and infrastructure against threats of terrorism, crime and riots, by the automatic detection of abnormal human behaviour. At the Acoustics & Sonar department of TNO Defence and Safety, part of this problem is addressed by means of acoustical detection of anomalous events. The approach is based on ‘scanning’ public environments by applying beamforming on the outputs of an <b>acoustical</b> <b>sensor</b> array and applying classification algorithms for detecting specific sources. In this Master’s thesis, an initial step is taken {{with the development of}} a real-time beamforming system that delivers required sound parameters used in sound classification. A number of different beamforming methods have been considered, differing in performance and computational complexity. Conventional methods like Delay and Sum (DAS), possibly combined with the use of static, frequency-invariant windows, lack spatial resolution at especially lower frequencies and are unable of coping with multiple interfering sources. Other methods provide an improved performance on the cost of increased complexity. The method known as Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming maintains a high spatial resolution at lower frequencies. Two main versions of this method are frequently used: a static (non-input-based) one and a dynamic (input-based) one. Static MVDR (SMVDR) is able to maintain performance at lower frequencies, but due to its static nature it does not add any extra value in multi-source environments. Dynamic MVDR (DMVDR), on the other hand, is partly capable of filtering away undesired coherent interferers and also has an improved spatial response in single-source environments. Its computational complexity, still, is an important bottleneck. The search for less intensive beamforming methods leads to a way of adaptive beamforming. Beamformers in which static beamforming and dynamic filtering are split in two different parts, are able to alleviate complexity. However, the need for adding extra elements to account for target-signal cancellation in multi-source environments destroys the computational advantages, making it unsuitable. The developed real-time application takes into account the intensive routines of DMVDR. Since the properties of the deployment platform are not known in advance, it is supplied with a mechanism for adapting to different and changing, available hardware resources such as available CPU-time, arithmetic units and memory. In this way it will always deliver the best possible solution, based on what the user is offering. Still, an extensive implementation process has led to a relatively fast execution of the algorithm. The system is supplied with a user interface for controlling a number of parameters and for obtaining the first visual effects. Furthermore, it is provided with a user-friendly mechanism for calibrating the system for each possible deployment environment. MSPElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

The signals were used to distinguish between live coral and uncolonized sediment within the depth range of the measurements (2. 5 – 5 m). In situRrs, λ were found to compare well with remotely sensed measurements from an imaging spectrometer, the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), deployed on an aircraft at high altitude. Cloud cover and in situ sensor orientation were found to have minimal impact on in situRrs, λ, suggesting that valid reflectance data may be collected using autonomous surveys even when atmospheric conditions are not favorable for remote sensing operations. The use of reflectance in the red and near infrared portions of the spectrum, expressed as the red edge height, REHλ, was investigated for detecting live aquatic vegetative biomass, including coral symbionts and turf algae. The REHλ signal from live coral was detected in Kane'ohe Bay to a depth of approximately 4 m with in situ measurements. A remote sensing algorithm based on the REHλ signal was defined and applied to AVIRIS imagery of the entire bay and was found to reveal areas of shallow, dense coral and algal cover. The peak wavelength of REHλ decreased with increasing water depth, indicating that a more complete examination of the red edge signal may potentially yield a remote sensing approach to simultaneously estimate vegetative biomass and bathymetry in shallow water...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} event {{alignment}} framework which enables change detection in non-stationary signals. change detection. Classical condition monitoring frameworks have been restrained to laboratory settings with stationary operating conditions, {{which are not}} resembling real world operation. In this paper we apply the technique for non-stationary condition monitoring of large diesel engines based on <b>acoustical</b> emission <b>sensor</b> signals. The performance of the event alignment is analyzed in an unsupervised probabilistic detection framework based on outlier detection with either Principal Component Analysis or Gaussian Processes modeling. We are especially interested in the true performance of the condition monitoring performance with mixed aligned and unaligned data, e. g. detection of fault condition of unaligned examples versus false alarms of aligned normal condition data. Further, we expect that the non-stationary model {{can be used for}} wear trending due to longer and continuous monitoring across operating condition changes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{corrections}} for fluid loading must be undertaken to Earth-based calibrations for planetary probe sensors, which rely on accurate and precise predictions of mechanical vibrations. These <b>sensors</b> include <b>acoustical</b> instrumentation, and <b>sensors</b> {{for the mass}} change resulting from species accumulation upon oscillating plates. Some published designs are particularly susceptible (an example leading to around an octave error in the frequency calibration for Venus is shown). Because such corrections have not previously been raised, and would be almost impossible to incorporate into drop tests of probes, this paper demonstrates the surprising results of applying well-established formulations...|$|R
