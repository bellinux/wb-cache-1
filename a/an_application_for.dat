5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court.

Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> a declaration to be made together with <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E

5|$|Canterbury Castle was {{designed}} by Jeter O. Frye and constructed between 1929 and 1931. Immediately following construction, Frye was unable {{to sell the house}} and left Portland in bankruptcy to resume his career in California. Visitors immediately showed interest in touring the house. The castle attracted paying tourists and school groups, became a stop on the Washington Park bus tour and hosted Halloween parties for a local radio station. The house became known as Canterbury Castle over time due to the plat and name of the street on which it was situated. The terraced garden was eliminated in the 1950s when a portion of the land was sold. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under the ownership of Dale and Karen Bernards, who had submitted <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> listing one year prior.|$|E
5|$|Hinkley Point C {{nuclear power}} station is a project to {{construct}} a 3,200 MW two reactor {{nuclear power station}}. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Hinkley Point– already {{the site of the}} disused Hinkley Point A and the still operational Hinkley Point B power stations– was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. NNB Generation Company, a subsidiary of EDF, submitted <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> development consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011. A protest group, Stop Hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and oppose any expansion at the Hinkley Point site. In December 2013, the European Commission opened an investigation to assess whether the project breaks state-aid rules. On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project, with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners voting against the decision.|$|E

5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. <b>An</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
5|$|In August 1962, Chaffee {{confided in}} his family that he had {{submitted}} <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> the NASA astronaut training program, and informed his superiors he wanted to train as a test pilot for astronaut status.

In January 1963, he entered the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, to work on his Master of Science degree in Reliability Engineering.|$|E
5|$|In {{the appeal}} against Prakash J.'s {{judgment}} to the Court of Appeal, also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996), {{counsel for the}} appellants argued that the restriction placed by the Minister on the importation, sale and distribution of the Jehovah's Witnesses publications was too wide and disproportionate. Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to carry out National Service {{was a threat to}} national security. The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to bring <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>for</b> judicial review of Order No. 405/1995.|$|E
