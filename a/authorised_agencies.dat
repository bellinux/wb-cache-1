40|$|Network {{shutdowns}} impacting {{an entire}} country are now almost non-existent, but {{the practice of}} shutting down communications in certain cities or areas of a country, or suspending certain services continues globally. This has happened {{over the past decade}} or so for a variety of reasons, sometimes due to national security concerns but also to prevent the organisation of protests or the spread of civil unrest. Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the subject, most telecommunications operators rarely address publicly the issue of network shutdowns and associated policies. Therefore, relatively little is known about the reasons for shutdowns, the mechanism through which governments affect such shutdowns, or the economic and social impacts of shutdowns on telecommunications companies, users, and society at large. Without such information, there is little opportunity to understand the avenues for prevention, mitigation and redress for business, users, or civil society. To combat its own serious public security challenges, the Government of Pakistan has often instructed telecommunication operators to suspend mobile and/or Internet networks where intelligence indicates a threat to national security. The Government of Pakistan’s stated intention in blocking access to communication at such a time is primarily in order to protect the right to life as violent extremists use mobile phones to inform each other of their movements and in some cases, mobile phones have been used to detonate bombs. Due to the relatively frequent nature of network shutdowns and associated security considerations, Pakistan was selected as the focus for this study. This paper seeks to: Analyse the Pakistan context as an introduction to further research on the economic and social impacts of network shutdowns. Explore how requests for disconnection are made by <b>authorised</b> <b>agencies</b> to telecommunication operators. Conduct a preliminary study on the day-to-day impacts and the perception of Pakistani citizens of network shutdowns, with a view to developing more in-depth research in the future. Analyse instances of mobile and Internet shutdowns outside of Pakistan, which were followed by corporate and government campaigns to achieve positive change, such as an amendment in the law. Provide best practices and guidelines for telecommunication operators with regard to handling network shutdown requests. Explore short-term and long-term opportunities for government strategies that both safeguard human rights online and offline by working with companies and governments so that human rights (of expression, assembly, privacy, security, and others) are not undermined while governments pursue legitimate objectives such as protecting society from terrorism or violence...|$|E

This Paper is to limit such thefts, by letting the Monitoring and Control Room to know the theft and also the location of theft. Monitoring and Control Room is kept known about {{the situation of the}} system at every instant. This wireless system is used to overcome the theft of electricity via bypassing the energy meter and hence it also controls the revenue losses and utility of the electricity <b>authorised</b> <b>agency.</b> There is always a contract between the consumer and the supplier that the consumer will pay for the electricity consumed by him. But in India near about 32 % of the electricity is consumed but not paid for it i. e. it is being stolen by the consumer hence the need of a system arises that would overcome this theft of electricity but mostly the electricity is being stolen via bypassing the energy meter hence this system recognizes such type of theft of electricity. Power consumption and losses have to be closely monitored so that the generated power is utilized in a most efficient manner. The system prevents the illegal usage of electricity. At this point of technological development the problem of illegal usage of electricity can be solved electronically without any human control. The implementation of this system will save large amount of electricity, and there by electricity will be available for more number of consumers then earlier, in highly populated country such as INDIA...|$|R

40|$|A new {{regional}} {{level of government}} was formed in late 1989 {{as part of a}} comprehensive reform of New Zealand’s local government. Regional government was not new, but the comprehensiveness of reforms established a comprehensive regional layer of government across all of New Zealand and was part of a wider decentralisation of government functions. The {{new regional}} councils were intended to be the primary environmental policy and implementation agencies underpinning the parallel environmental resource management law reforms, promising a new era of regional government. This thesis examines the public value of this regional government structure two decades later using environmental management as a case study. Public value was assessed using substantive value, <b>authorising</b> <b>agency</b> and operational feasibility drawing on published data and a survey of perceptions held by environmental resource practitioners and stakeholders. The results indicate a low level of public value. Despite some improvements, and some regional variation, overall environmental conditions have deteriorated nationally since 1989. The councils also show low public support and apparent sector capture and vary in capability to undertake their functions. While sub-national environmental conditions and problems were identified, they do not match existing regional council jurisdictions, nor match each other. Most councils share many characteristics, suggesting uniform rather than separate management regimes are appropriate. Consequently, the efficacy of the regional council-based model for managing the environment is questioned. The role of the councils is also queried. Although classified as part of local government, these democratically elected regional councils are really multi-special purpose authorities that parallel a national government decentralised regional administration. Despite being endowed with a broad mandate to promote their communities’ well-being, most regional councils continue to exercise a narrow set of functions. These are based on their historical role as environmental management agencies. This discourages allocative efficiency, limiting their sustainable development capability. Importantly, the hierarchical policy-making system developed has been compromised by an ongoing lack of national level government policy. Recommendations for alternative environmental management institutional arrangements in New Zealand are made, while more broadly the implications of the research for regional studies identified...|$|R

A computer-based model is produced with the capability of manipulating the generalisable costbenefit factors to accommodate local conditions and could therefore be used as a decision support aid by the three key stakeholder groups. The application of the model beyond the case studies is also discussed. The problematic nature of applying cost-benefit analysis to the quality assurance mechanisms of Access Courses is also considered. Areas where further research is required are outlined...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a rubber farming community in Southern Thailand with rubber farmers and their first-line public healthcare providers as the study informants. The study aims were to first, explore perceived effects of work exposures in rubber farming on rubber farmers’ health, second, identify decisions made in response to the effects of work exposures on health, and third, determine influencing factors on the construction of the perception and the process of decision making. Data were obtained using ethnographic research methods, underpinned by an interpretative paradigm. Unstructured interviews and participant observation were employed as the principal means of data collection. Together with the primary methods of data collection, note taking (fieldnotes, fieldwork personal journal, and photographs) and reviewing/analysing existing documents were employed. While data were being collected, initial data analysis was carried out to make sense of information gained and direct further steps of the data collection. After terminating the data collection, ethnographic data analysis suggested by Spradley (1979, 1980) was used to determine themes to meet the aims of the study. The study findings reveal that individual rubber farmers and healthcare providers construct perceptions of effects of rubber farming on rubber farmers’ health and decisions on the actions taken to manage the rubber farmers’ work-related health problems based on their own accounts of compounding factors. Among factors identified, discrepancies between health policy and its practice, coupled with the existence of a hierarchy of power-superior-inferior relationships among individual levels of health authority-emerge as the most powerful factors, inducing the emergence of other factors. Recommendations made {{as a result of this}} study draw attention mainly to the minimisation of the discrepancies between health policies and their implications, and the establishment of partnership status among <b>authorised</b> health <b>agencies</b> and between health agencies and rubber farmers in order to improve the quality of occupational safety and health services provided to the rubber farmers...|$|R
