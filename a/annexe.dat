5|$|Below {{the tower}} is an Italianate building. On {{the ground floor}} was the Scarlet Drawing Room and a {{vestibule}} with an <b>annexe</b> which housed a kitchen and offices. The first floor held the Crimson Drawing Room, sanctuary and library.|$|E
5|$|Cowes Castle {{was bought}} {{outright}} from the Crown by the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1917. Further development work {{was carried out}} on the property in the 1920s, and a ballroom in an adjacent hotel was purchased for use as an <b>annexe</b> for female members.|$|E
5|$|Also {{located in}} {{the eastern end of}} the suburb are Lennox Gardens, the Yarralumla Yacht Club, the Albert Hall and the Hotel Canberra. The Hotel Canberra opened in 1924 to {{accommodate}} politicians when Parliament was in session. The hotel was closed in 1974 and the buildings served as an <b>annexe</b> for Parliament House between 1976 and 1984. The Hyatt Hotel Group re-opened the hotel in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 {{the museum}} {{acquired}} the All Saints <b>Annexe,</b> a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square. The 1867 building, which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman, then later {{used as a}} hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices.|$|E
5|$|A further block (also {{known as}} <b>Annexe</b> Market or Triangular Block) {{consisting}} of two separate structures (the Fish Market and the Red House) was built between 1886 and 1899. The Fish Market, built by John Mowlem & Co., was completed in 1888, one year after Sir Horace Jones' death. The Red House, with its imposing red brick and Portland stone façade, was built between 1898 and 1899 for the London Central Markets Cold Storage Co. Ltd.. It {{was one of the}} first cold stores to be built outside the London docks and continued to serve Smithfield Market until the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House <b>annexe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later {{extensions}} {{were installed}} to both 10 Downing Street and the specially constructed Transatlantic Telephone Room within the Cabinet War Rooms. Churchill's office-bedroom included BBC broadcasting equipment; Churchill made four wartime broadcasts from the Cabinet War Rooms. Although the office room was also fitted {{out as a}} bedroom, Churchill rarely slept underground, preferring to sleep at 10 Downing Street or the No.10 <b>Annexe,</b> a flat in the New Public Offices directly above the Cabinet War Rooms. His daughter Mary Soames often slept in the bedroom allocated to Mrs Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Savaric fitzGeldewin (died 8 August 1205) was an Englishman {{who became}} Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury in England. Related to his {{predecessor}} {{as well as}} to the German Emperor Henry VI, he was elected bishop on the urging of his predecessor, who urged his election on the cathedral chapter of Bath. While bishop, Savaric spent many years attempting to <b>annexe</b> Glastonbury Abbey as part of his bishopric. Savaric also worked to secure the release of King Richard I of England from captivity, when the king was held by Emperor Henry VI.|$|E
5|$|The Charing Cross Hotel, {{designed}} by Edward Middleton Barry, opened on 15 May 1865 {{and gave the}} station an ornate frontage in the French Renaissance style. It had 250 bedrooms spread over seven floors and extended along Villiers Street {{as well as the}} front of the Strand. The public rooms had balconies overlooking the main station concourse. It quickly became popular and was profitable, leading to a 90-bedroom <b>annexe</b> {{on the other side of}} Villiers Street opening in 1878. A bridge over the street connected the two parts of the hotel together.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry with very large boulder quoins; {{the roof is}} made from slate with stone copings. The {{main part of the}} church is 45feet 6inches long by 15feet 3inches wide (13.87 by 4.65m); the <b>annexe</b> at the west end {{measures}} 20feet 6inches by 15feet 6inches (6.25 by 4.72m). At the west end of the roof of the nave, there is a bellcote with a single bell decorated with three bull heads, dated 1661; at the east end, there is a cross. There is no structural division between the nave and the chancel. The <b>annexe</b> at the west end is smaller and lower in height than the main building, and was built in line with it. It may have been built for use as a schoolroom. It has a 16th-century doorway at the west end, converted into a window in the 19th century, and a modern door at the east end, as well as an 18th-century fireplace. The main entrance into the church is {{on the north side of}} the nave, dating from the late 15th century. The doorway is pointed, in a square frame.|$|E
5|$|The newest of Manor Hall's annexes was {{originally}} {{a row of}} spacious townhouses constructed in the 1780s {{as part of the}} building boom of Clifton in between wars with France. 30-35 Richmond Terrace was a hotel prior before being acquired by the University in 2006. The building underwent a major refurbishment and it now provides self-catered en suite accommodation for 92 students. It was previously managed by University Student Houses and became a Manor Hall <b>annexe</b> in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} hold the games at the Shenton Park <b>Annexe</b> of the Royal Perth Hospital but this was abandoned due the need for temporary buildings. The Royal Agricultural Showgrounds in the suburb of Claremont was used as it had an oval and buildings for accommodation and events. A major advantage of the venue was that all facilities were on one level. There was no suitable facility for basketball and after much debate a wooden court was laid on a sand foundation {{in front of the}} main grandstand. Beatty Park was used for swimming events.|$|E
5|$|Veerapandiya Kattabomman, {{the king}} of Panchalankurichi, is a brave fighter and a devotee of his family deity, Murugan of Thiruchendur. On {{receiving}} news of a robbery in his territory, Kattabomman and his retinue set out incognito to capture the robbers. When they are captured, they confess {{that they had been}} hired by the British to create unrest in Kattabomman's domain. They also tell him that the British had enticed the neighbouring chieftain, Ettappan, to help them in their endeavour to <b>annexe</b> Panchalankurichi.|$|E
5|$|In 1218 and 1219, Jocelin also {{ended the}} dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey. Jocelin gave up any claim to {{control of the}} abbey, and the abbey gave the bishopric a number of estates. Previously, the bishops, {{as part of their}} attempt to <b>annexe</b> Glastonbury to their bishopric, had been known as the Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury. They also had held the office of abbot. In 1218, as part of the settlement, a new abbot was elected at Glastonbury. The papacy had never {{acknowledged}} Jocelin's claiming of the title of abbot. The historian J. A. Robinson felt that as part of the settlement, Jocelin began to use the title Bishop of Bath and Wells, but another historian, David Knowles, disagreed.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{the later}} medieval era that the borders of Scotland reached {{approximately}} their modern extent. The Isle of Man fell under English control in the 14th century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority. The English were able to <b>annexe</b> a large slice of the lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). In 1468 the last great acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when James III married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. However, in 1482 Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for {{what was to be}} the final change of hands.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Victoria {{opened in}} 1887, its name commemorating the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria held that year. It held 500 {{bedrooms}} {{and was the}} second largest hotel in London of its type on opening, overrunning its budget by around £520,000 (now £). The hotel was self-powered, generating its own electricity from dynamos. It was bought by Frederick Gordon in 1893, giving him a monopoly on all hotels on Northumberland Avenue. A refurbishment was started in 1911, though delayed due to the First World War, {{which resulted in a}} new <b>annexe,</b> the Edward VII Rooms. It closed in 1940 and was used by the War Office in need of extra accommodation. The War Office bought the building outright in 1951, renaming it the Victoria Buildings. It was subsequently renamed Northumberland House.|$|E
5|$|The LC station {{began to}} be reconstructed in the late 19th century after several {{properties}} on Buckingham Palace Road, and the hotel, were bought by the company. Work began in 1899 with {{the removal of the}} old roof. The rebuilt station was partially opened on 10 June 1906, with additional platforms and cab exit on 10 February the following year, along with a new <b>annexe</b> to the hotel. It was formally re-opened on 1 July 1908. As a consequence of the rebuilding, boat trains become more popular from Victoria compared to Charing Cross and Cannon Street. Services increased to serve Ostend and Calais via Dover and Rotterdam via Gravesend. The LB part of the station also served Dieppe via Newhaven.|$|E
5|$|These {{reforms were}} pursued under his successors and grandchildren Malcolm IV of Scotland and William I, with the crown now passing {{down the main}} line of descent through primogeniture, leading to {{the first of a}} series of minorities. The {{benefits}} of greater authority were reaped by William's son Alexander II and his son Alexander III, who pursued a policy of peace with England to expand their authority in the Highlands and Islands. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a position to <b>annexe</b> the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following Haakon Haakonarson's ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the Battle of Largs with the Treaty of Perth in 1266.|$|E
5|$|Milford Haven was {{appointed}} Military Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), {{to add to}} the Civil one he already held, in recognition of his service to the Royal Navy in the 1921 New Year Honours, and was specially promoted by Order in Council to the rank of Admiral of the Fleet on the Retired List, dated 19 August. A few days later he joined HMS Repulse, the ship on which his son Louis was serving, for a week at the invitation of the captain Dudley Pound. It was his last voyage; he died at 42 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, London in the <b>annexe</b> of the Naval and Military Club on 11 September 1921 of heart failure following influenza. After a funeral service at Westminster Abbey, his remains were buried at St. Mildred's Church, Whippingham, on the Isle of Wight.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the thirteenth}} century the borders with England were very fluid, with Northumbria being annexed to Scotland by David I, but lost under his {{grandson}} and successor Malcolm IV in 1157. By the late thirteenth century when the Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries. The Isle of Man fell under English control in the fourteenth century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority. The English were able to <b>annexe</b> a large slice of the Lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). The dowry of the Orkney and Shetland Islands in 1468 was the last great land acquisition for the kingdom. However, in 1482 Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in Medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for {{what was to be}} the final change of hands.|$|E
5|$|With his {{predecessors}} {{unable to make}} significant gains in Rajputana, after ascending the throne, Shah made plans to <b>annexe</b> cities of the region to the Mughal empire. On 10 November Shah began his march to Amber (in Rajputana, present day Rajasthan state of India), visiting the tomb of Salim Chishti in Fatehpur Sikri on 21 November. In the meantime, Shah's aid Mihrab Khan was ordered to take possession of Jodhpur. Shah reached Amber on 20 January 1708. Though the monarch of the kingdom was Jai Singh, his brother Bijai Singh resented his rule. Shah ruled {{that because of the}} dispute, the region would become part of the Mughal empire and the city was renamed as Islamabad. Jai Singh's goods and properties were confiscated on the pretext that he supported Shah's brother Azam Shah during the war of Shah's succession and Bijai Singh was made the governor of Amber on 30 April 1708. Shah gave him the title of Mirza Rajah, and he received gifts valued at 100,000 rupees. Amber passed into Mughal hands without a war.|$|E
5|$|In 221BC, {{the state}} of Qin {{completed}} its conquest over the other Warring States and united China under Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. These conquests, combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC, transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire. With the transformation, Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers {{to be used in}} public works than the prior feudal kingdoms. Also, once unification was achieved, Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them. Soon after the conquests, in the year 215 BC, the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there, who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier. Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature, since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time; its aim was to <b>annexe</b> the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin's northern borders. Once the Xiongnu were chased away, Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to <b>annexe</b> territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the thirteenth}} century the borders with England were very fluid.

In 1482, Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in Medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for what was to be the final change of hands. The only uncertain area was the small region of the Debatable Lands at the south-west end of the border, which would be divided by a French-mediated commission in 1552.|$|E

25|$|The John Reid <b>Annexe</b> is {{situated}} {{directly behind the}} John Reid Pavilion with the ridge of the <b>Annexe</b> roof at 90 degrees to the main ridge of the John Reid Pavilion. The <b>Annexe</b> is of single-skin timber construction, clad externally with chamferboards, with horizontal boarding on some interior walls. It has a corrugated iron gable roof supported by hardwood timber trusses. The <b>Annexe</b> can be accessed at both ends via steel roller doors and the doors lead through to the John Reid Pavilion to the northwest and Building No.7 to the southeast.|$|E
25|$|The Sugar Hall {{is located}} between the Dairy Industry Hall and the John Reid Pavilion <b>Annexe.</b> It {{is a small}} timber-framed {{building}} with a rendered masonry facade. A roller door joins this building to the John Reid <b>Annexe.</b>|$|E
25|$|The college {{also has}} a large {{undergraduate}} <b>annexe</b> situated on St Michael's Street, developed from Frewin Hall in the 1940s, and a graduate <b>annexe</b> shared with St Cross College was completed in 1995. The St Cross annex is laid out in clusters of five bed-sitting rooms, sharing two shower rooms and a well equipped kitchen. A second graduate <b>annexe,</b> Hollybush Row, was opened in September 2008 and is located close to the railway station and Said Business School. It consists of single rooms with en-suite bathrooms and shared kitchens. There are also {{a small number of}} other graduate houses offered by the college.|$|E

25|$|Victoria Island {{with its}} <b>annexe</b> is {{situated}} {{to the south}} of Lagos Island. It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.|$|E
25|$|A twelve storey {{office block}} is planned {{next to the}} tower, with 6,506 square metres of floor space. The hotel has a four-storey <b>annexe,</b> {{containing}} a swimming pool, ballroom, conference rooms and coffee shop.|$|E
25|$|A modular <b>annexe</b> {{building}} was opened in October 1998, providing seven additional classrooms for Mathematics and allowing adaptations {{to be made}} to rooms in the Main Building in order to enhance ICT and Science lab facilities.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attack against}} this {{building}} came at 6.30 a.m., barely {{an hour before}} the Yorke Bay amphibious landing, when one of Giachino's squads, led by Lieutenant Gustavo Lugo, started to exchange fire with the British troops inside the house. At the same time, Giachino himself, with four of his subordinates, entered the servants' <b>annexe,</b> believing it to be the rear entrance to the residence. Three Royal Marines, Corporals Mick Sellen and Fleet and Marine Harry Dorey, who were placed to cover the <b>annexe,</b> beat off the first attack. Giachino was hit instantly as he burst through the door, while Lieutenant Diego Garcia Quiroga was shot in the arm. The remaining three retreated to the maid's quarters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} 1876–1888, the National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland {{expended}} an estimated £7000 on the grounds. The main exhibition building was {{doubled in size}} for the 1877 exhibition and another <b>annexe</b> was provided for horticultural exhibits.|$|E
25|$|At the {{northeast}} {{end of the}} building is a two-storey cream brick <b>annexe</b> (erected 1971), which {{is used by the}} Police during the period of the Ekka. The building has a flat roof, with a large fascia and aluminium window frames.|$|E
