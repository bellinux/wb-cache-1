5000|$|... “Understanding of the {{organization}} of <b>plant</b> <b>antennae,</b> or <b>plant</b> light collection structures, and reaction centers, where the photosynthetic light reaction actually takes place, has changed over the years. It is now understood that a single antennae does not link only to a single reaction center, as was previously described in the puddle model. Current evidence indicates that reaction centers are connected with shared antennae in terrestrial plants.” As a result, the parameters used to provide reliable measurements have changed to represent the newer understanding of this relationship. The model that represents the newer understanding of the antennae - reaction center relationship is called the lake model.|$|R
50|$|Organisms that undergo {{photosynthesis}} initially absorb {{light energy}} {{through the process}} of electron excitation in an antenna. This antenna varies between organisms. Bacteria can use ring like structures as <b>antennas,</b> whereas <b>plants</b> and other organisms use chlorophyll pigments to absorb photons. This electron excitation creates a separation of charge in a reaction site that is later converted into chemical energy for the cell to use. However, this electron excitation must be transferred in an efficient and timely manner, before that energy is lost in fluorescence.|$|R
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} discovered in unicellular green algae, {{and may also}} occur in plants. However, in these organisms it occurs by a different mechanism, which is not as well understood. The plant/algal mechanism is considered functionally analogous to the cyanobacterial mechanism but involves completely different components. The foremost difference {{is the presence of}} fundamentally different types of light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> complexes: <b>plants</b> and green algae use an intrinsically-bound membrane complex of chlorophyll a/b binding proteins for their antenna, instead of the soluble phycobilisome complexes used by cyanobacteria (and certain algae).|$|R
50|$|Anoplophora horsfieldi {{can reach}} {{a length of}} about 35 mm. These beetles are black or dark brown, with large {{irregular}} pale yellow transversal bands on the elytra, pale yellow markings {{on the head and}} the pronotum and very long <b>antennae.</b> Main host <b>plants</b> are Camellia sinensis, Celtis sinensis, Quercus glauca and Ulmus pumila.|$|R
50|$|These {{types of}} hybrid cables {{may also be}} useful in other environments such as Distributed <b>Antenna</b> System (DAS) <b>plants</b> where they will serve antennas in indoor, outdoor, and roof-top locations. Considerations such as fire resistance, Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) Listings, {{placement}} in vertical shafts, and other performance-related issues need to be fully addressed for these environments.|$|R
50|$|Photosystem {{modulation}} is {{an example}} of a long term light adaptation or acclimation that usually occurs on the genetic level; transcriptional, translational and post-translational. Plants grown under high light intensity usually have smaller <b>antenna</b> compared to <b>plants</b> grown under low light. A study found that the acclimative modulation of PSII antenna size only involves the outer light harvesting complexes of PSII (LHC-PSII) caused by the proteolysis of its apoprotein.|$|R
40|$|We have {{suggested}} {{a model for}} the electronic excited states of the minor <b>plant</b> <b>antenna,</b> CP 29, by incorporating a considerable part of the current information offered by structure determination, site-directed mutagenesis, and spectroscopy in the modeling. We have assumed that the electronic excited states of the complex have been decided by the chlorophyll-chlorophyll (Chl) and Chl-protein interactions and have modeled the Coulombic interaction between a pair of Chls in the point-dipole approximation and the Chl-protein interactions are treated as empirical fit parameters. We {{have suggested}} the Qy dipole moment orientations and the site energies for all the chlorophylls in the complex through a simultaneous simulation of the absorption and linear dichroism spectra. The assignments proposed have been discussed to yield a satisfactory reproduction of all prominent features of the absorption, linear and circular dichroism spectra as well as the key spectral and temporal characteristics of the energy transfer processes among the chlorophylls. The orientations and the spectral assignments obtained by relatively simple exciton calculations have been necessary to provide a good point of departure for more detailed treatments of structure-function relationship in CP 29. Moreover, it has been discussed that the CP 29 model suggested can guide the studies for {{a better understanding of the}} structure-function relationship in the major <b>plant</b> <b>antenna,</b> LHCII...|$|R
40|$|The {{direction}} of future antenna {{technology will be}} toward antennas which are large, both physically and electrically, will operate at frequencies up to 60 GHz, and are non-reciprocal and complex, implementing multiple-beam and scanning beam concepts and monolithic semiconductor devices and techniques. The acquisition of accurate antenna performance measurements is {{a critical part of}} the advanced antenna research program and represents a substantial antenna measurement technology challenge, considering the special characteristics of future spacecraft communications antennas. Comparison of various antenna testing techniques and their relative advantages and disadvantages shows that the near-field approach is necessary to meet immediate and long-term testing requirements. The LeRC facilities, the 22 ft x 22 ft horizontal antenna boresight planar scanner and the 60 ft x 60 ft vertical <b>antenna</b> boresight <b>plant</b> scanner (with a 60 GHz frequency and D/lamdba = 3000 electrical size capabilities), will meet future program testing requirements...|$|R
40|$|During photosynthesis, two multi-protein complexes, photosystems (PS) I and II work {{in tandem}} {{to convert the}} light-energy absorbed by the light-harvesting {{antennae}} into chemical energy, which is subsequently used to assimilate atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon compounds. This is the main nutritional basis for life on Earth. The photosynthetic <b>antenna</b> of higher <b>plants</b> comprises at least ten different pigment-binding proteins (LHC), which play important roles in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules associated with the LHC proteins are organised into an array, which can be modulated, thereby optimising light-harvesting processes and protection against oxidative damage under conditions of excessive light absorption. All ten LHC proteins have been conserved through eons of evolution, suggesting that there are strong evolutionary pressures to retain all ten proteins, and hence that each protein has a unique function. The light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> of higher <b>plant</b> PSI consists of at least four proteins, Lhca 1 - 4, collectively called LHCI. By constructing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants in which each Lhca gene has been individually repressed or knocked-out, a collection of plants with different Lhca protein contents was obtained. The objective was to use these plants to study the structure, function and regulation of the Lhca proteins in vivo. The major findings of this work are as follows. Removing single Lhca proteins influenced {{the stability of the}} other Lhca proteins, showing that there is a high degree of inter-dependency between the polypeptides in LHCI, and hence that a full set of Lhca proteins is important for maintaining the structural integrity of LHCI. This has provided insight into the organisation of LHCI by revealing clues about the relative positions of each Lhca protein in the antenna complex. The physiological consequences of removing individual Lhca proteins were dependent on the degree of <b>antenna</b> depletion. <b>Plants</b> with relatively small antenna changes could compensate, to some extent, for the loss of LHCI, while larger depletions had profound effects on whole plant resulting in growth reductions. The fitness of each Lhca plant was assessed by measuring their seed production in the harsh conditions in the field. We found that all Lhca-deficient plants produced fewer seeds under some conditions, with seed-production compared to wild type varying between 10 - 80 % depending on the extent of LHCI reduction. Therefore, we conclude that each Lhca protein is important for plant fitness, and hence for the survival of the species. PSI is characterised by a pool of pigments absorbing light in the red end of the solar visible spectrum, thought to be especially important for plants in dense vegetation systems where the incident light is enriched in wavelengths higher than 690 nm. A majority of these pigments are situated on LHCI and, based on in-vitro studies, were thought to be mainly associated with Lhca 4. Using our plants, we have established that red pigments are indeed present on all Lhca proteins and that these pigments become even more red upon association with PSI...|$|R
50|$|Accessory {{pigments}} are light-absorbing compounds, {{found in}} photosynthetic organisms, {{that work in}} conjunction with chlorophyll a. They include other forms of this pigment, such as chlorophyll b in green algal and higher <b>plant</b> <b>antennae,</b> while other algae may contain chlorophyll c or d. In addition, there are many non-chlorophyll accessory pigments, such as carotenoids or phycobiliproteins, which also absorb light and transfer that light energy to photosystem chlorophyll. Some of these accessory pigments, in particular the carotenoids, also serve to absorb and dissipate excess light energy, or work as antioxidants. The large, physically associated group of chlorophylls and other accessory pigments is {{sometimes referred to as}} a pigment bed, though this term is no longer supported by what we know of photosystem and antenna complex structures.|$|R
40|$|LHCII is {{the major}} <b>antenna</b> complex of <b>plants</b> and algae, where it is {{involved}} in light harvesting and photoprotection. Its properties have been extensively studied in vitro, after isolation of the pigment-protein complex from the membranes, but are these properties representative for LHCII in the thylakoid membrane? In this work, we have studied LHCII in {{the cells of the}} green alga C. reinhardtii acclimated to different light conditions {{in the absence of the}} other components of the photosynthetic apparatus. We show that LHCII exists in the membranes in different fluorescence quenching states, all having a shorter excited-state lifetime than isolated LHCII in detergent. The ratio between these populations depends on the light conditions, indicating that the light is able to regulate the properties of the complexes in the membrane...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthetic antenna {{proteins}} can {{be thought}} of as "programmed solvents", which bind pigments at specific mutual orientations, thus tuning the overall energetic landscape and ensuring highly efficient light-harvesting. While positioning of chlorophyll cofactors is well understood and rationalized by the principle of an "energy funnel", the carotenoids still pose many open questions. Particularly, their short excited state lifetime (< 25 ps) renders them potential energy sinks able to compete with the reaction centers and drastically undermine light-harvesting efficiency. Exploration of the orientational phase-space revealed that the placement of central carotenoids minimizes their interaction with the nearest chlorophylls in the <b>plant</b> <b>antenna</b> complexes LHCII, CP 26, CP 29 and LHCI. At the same time we show that this interaction is highly sensitive to structural perturbations, which has a profound effect on the overall lifetime of the complex. This links the protein dynamics to the light-harvesting regulation in plants by the carotenoids...|$|R
40|$|Following {{experiments}} which {{studied the}} substitution of the central ion of isolated chlorophylls by heavy metal ions in vitro, in vivo experiments with submersed water plants were carried out. It was discovered that {{the substitution of}} the central atom of chlorophyll, magnesium, by heavy metals (mercury, copper, cadmium, nickel, zinc, lead) in vivo is an important damage mechanism in stressed plants. This substitution prevents photosynthetic light-harvesting in the affected chlorophyll molecules, resulting in a breakdown of photosynthesis. The reaction varies with light intensity. In low light irradiance all the central atoms of the chlorophylls are accessible to heavy metals, with heavy metal chlorophylls being formed, {{some of which are}} much more stable towards irradiance than Mg-chlorophyll. Consequently, plants remain green even when they are dead. In high light, however, almost all chlorophyll decays, showing that under such conditions most of the chlorophylls are inaccessible to heavy metal ions. Key words: Heavy metal chlorophylls, submersed water <b>plants,</b> <b>antenna</b> pigments, copper, zinc...|$|R
40|$|It {{emerges from}} {{numerous}} experiments that LHCII, the major photosynthetic <b>antenna</b> complex of <b>plants,</b> can appear {{not only in}} the trimeric or monomeric states but also as a dimer. We address the problem whether the dimeric form of the complex is just a simple intermediate element of the trimer–monomer transformation or if it can also be a physiologically relevant molecular organization form? Dimers of LHCII were analyzed with application of native electrophoresis, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The results reveal the appearance of two types of LHCII dimers: one formed by the dissociation of one monomer from the trimeric structure and the other formed by association of monomers into a distinctively different molecular organizational form, characterized by a high rate of chlorophyll excitation quenching. The hypothetical structure of such an energy quencher is proposed. The high light-induced LHCII dimerization is discussed as a potential element of the photoprotective response in plants...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCyanobacteria {{possess a}} family of one-helix high light-inducible {{proteins}} (Hlips) that are homologous to light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> of <b>plants</b> and algae. An Hlip protein, high light-inducible protein D (HliD) purified as a small complex with the Ycf 39 protein is evaluated using resonance Raman spectroscopy. We show that the HliD binds two different β-carotenes, each present in two non-equivalent binding pockets with different conformations, having their (0, 0) absorption maxima at 489 and 522 nm, respectively. Both populations of β-carotene molecules were in all-trans configuration and the absorption position of the farthest blue-shifted β-carotene was attributed entirely to the polarizability of the environment in its binding pocket. In contrast, the absorption maximum of the red-shifted β-carotene was attributed to two different factors: the polarizability of the environment in its binding pocket and, more importantly, to the conformation of its β-rings. This second β-carotene has highly twisted β-rings adopting a flat conformation, which implies that the effective conjugation length N is extended up to 10. 5 modifying the energetic levels. This increase in N will also result in a lower S 1 energy state, which may provide a permanent energy dissipation channel. Analysis of the carbonyl stretching region for chlorophyll a excitations indicates that the HliD binds six chlorophyll a molecules in five non-equivalent binding sites, {{with at least one}} chlorophyll a presenting a slight distortion to its macrocycle. The binding modes and conformations of HliD-bound pigments are discussed with respect to the known structures of LHCII and CP 29...|$|R
40|$|Biology {{offers a}} {{boundless}} source of adaptation, innovation, and inspiration. A {{wide range of}} photosynthetic organisms exist {{that are capable of}} harvesting solar light in an exceptionally efficient way, using abundant and low-cost materials. These natural light-harvesting complexes consist of proteins that strongly bind a high density of chromophores to capture solar photons and rapidly transfer the excitation energy to the photochemical reaction centre. The amount of harvested light is also delicately tuned to the level of solar radiation to maintain a constant energy throughput at the reaction centre and avoid the accumulation of the products of charge separation. In this Review, recent developments in the understanding of light harvesting by plants will be discussed, based on results obtained from single molecule spectroscopy studies. Three design principles of the main light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> of <b>plants</b> will be highlighted: (a) fine, photoactive control over the intrinsic protein disorder to efficiently use intrinsically available thermal energy dissipation mechanisms; (b) the design of the protein microenvironment of a low-energy chromophore dimer to control the amount of shade absorption; (c) the design of the exciton manifold to ensure efficient funneling of the harvested light to the terminal emitter cluster.

40|$|Lhca 4 {{is one of}} the {{peripheral}} <b>antennae</b> of higher <b>plant</b> photosystem I and it is characterized by the presence of chlorophyll a with absorption and emission bands around 30 nm red-shifted compared to those of the other chlorophylls associated with plant complexes. In this work we have investigated the origin of this red shift by using the recent structure of Lhca 4 (Qin et al., Science, 2015, 348, 989) to build an exciton model that includes a charge-transfer (CT) state mixed with the excited-state manifold. A simultaneous quantitative fit of absorption, linear dichroism, fluorescence, and Stark absorption spectra of the wild-type Lhca 4 and NH mutant (where the sites involved in CT are affected) enables us to determine the origin of the CT state and explore its spectral signatures. A huge borrowing of dipole strength by the CT, accompanied by anomalous broadening and red-shifting of the fluorescence as well as dramatic changes in the Stark spectrum, can be accounted for by a model implying an exciton-type mixing between excited states and CT states...|$|R
40|$|The herein {{reported}} work {{describes the}} development of hierarchically-organized fluorescent nanomaterials inspired by <b>plant</b> <b>antenna</b> systems. These hybrid materials are based on nanostructured zeolitic materials (LTL zeolite) doped with laser dyes, which implies a synergism between organic and inorganic moieties. The non-interconnected channeled structure and pore dimensions (7. 1 Å) of the inorganic host are ideal to order and align the allocated fluorophores inside, inferring also high thermal and chemical stability. These artificial antennae harvest {{a broad range of}} chromatic radiation and convert it into predominant red-edge or alternatively white-light emission, just choosing the right dye combination and concentration ratio to modulate the efficiency of the ongoing energy transfer hops. A further degree of organization can be achieved by functionalizing the channel entrances of LTL zeolite with specific tailor-made (stopcock) molecules via a covalent linkage. These molecules plug the channels to avoid the leakage of the guest molecules absorbed inside, as well as connect the inner space of the zeolite with the outside thanks to energy transfer processes, making the coupling of the material with external devices easier...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) is {{the main}} {{component}} of the <b>antenna</b> system of <b>plants</b> and green algae and {{plays a major role in}} the capture of sun light for photosynthesis. The LHCII complexes have also been proposed to play a key role in the optimization of photosynthetic efficiency through the process of state 1 –state 2 transitions and are involved in down-regulation of photosynthesis under excess light by energy dissipation through non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). We present here the first solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR data of the major light-harvesting complex (LHCII) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a eukaryotic green alga. We are able to identify nuclear spin clusters of the protein and of its associated chlorophyll pigments in 13 C– 13 C dipolar homonuclear correlation spectra on a uniformly 13 C-labeled sample. In particular, we were able to resolve several chlorophyll 131 carbon resonances that are sensitive to hydrogen bonding to the 131 -keto carbonyl group.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{roles of}} the chlorophyll a/b binding proteins CP 29 and CP 26 in light harvesting and energy dissipation within the photosynthetic apparatus have been investigated. Arabidopsis was transformed with antisense constructs against the genes encoding the CP 29 or CP 26 apoprotein, which gave rise to several transgenic lines with remarkably low amounts of the antisense target proteins. The decrease {{in the level of}} CP 24 protein in the CP 29 antisense lines indicates a physical interaction between these complexes. Analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence showed that removal of the proteins affected photosystem II function, probably as a result of changes in the organization of the light-harvesting <b>antenna.</b> However, whole <b>plant</b> measurements showed that overall photosynthetic rates were similar to those in the wild type. Both antisense lines were capable of the qE type of nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching, although there were minor changes in the capacity for quenching and in its induction kinetics. High-light-induced violaxanthin deepoxidation to zeaxanthin was not affected, although the pool size of these pigments was decreased slightly. We conclude that CP 29 and CP 26 are unlikely to be sites for nonphotochemical quenching...|$|R
40|$|The chromophore-binding {{properties}} of the higher plant light-harvesting protein CP 29 have been studied by using site-directed mutagenesis of pigment- binding residues. Overexpression of the apoproteins in bacteria was followed by reconstitution in vitro with purified pigments, thus obtaining a family of mutant CP 29 proteins lacking individual chromophore-binding sites. Biochemical characterization allowed identification of the eight porphyrins and two xanthophyll-binding sites. It is shown that the four porphyrin- binding sites (A 1, A 2, A 4, and AS) situated in the central, twofold- symmetrical domain of the protein are selective for Chl-a, whereas the four peripheral sites (A 3, B 3, B 5, and B 6) have mixed Chl-a-Chl-b specificity. Within a site, porphyrin coordination by glutamine increases affinity for Chl-b as compared with glutamate. Xanthophyll site L 1 is occupied by lutein, whereas site L 2 can bind violaxanthin or neoxanthin. The protein is relatively stable when site L 2 site is empty, suggesting that xanthophylls can be exchanged during operation of xanthophyll cycle-dependent photoprotection mechanism. Differential absorption spectroscopy allowed determination of transition energy levels for individual chromophores, thus opening the way to calculation of energy-transfer rates between Chl in higher <b>plant</b> <b>antenna</b> proteins...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe outer <b>antenna</b> {{of higher}} <b>plants</b> Photosystem I is {{composed}} of four complexes (Lhca 1 - 4) belonging to the light-harvesting protein family. Difficulties in their purification have so far prevented the determination of their properties {{and most of the}} knowledge about Lhcas has been obtained from the study of the in vitro reconstituted antennas. In this work we were able to purify the native complexes, showing that Lhca 2 / 3 and Lhca 1 / 4 form two functional heterodimers. Both dimers show red-fluorescence emission with maxima around 730 nm, as in the intact PSI complex. This indicates that the dimers are in their native state and that LHCI- 680, which was previously assumed {{to be part of the}} PSI antenna, does not represent the native state of the system. The data show that the light-harvesting properties of the two dimers are functionally identical, concerning absorption, long-wavelength emission and fluorescence quantum yield, while they differ in their high-light response. Implications of the present results for the understanding of the energy transfer process in PSI are discussed. Finally, the comparison of the properties of the native dimers with those of the reconstituted complexes demonstrates that all the major properties of the Lhcas are reproduced in the in vitro systems...|$|R
40|$|Photosystem I (PSI) is a pigment protein complex catalyzing the light-driven {{electron}} transport from plastocyanin to ferredoxin in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Several PSI subunits {{are highly}} conserved in cyanobacteria, algae and plants, whereas others are distributed differentially {{in the various}} organisms. Here we characterized the structural and functional properties of PSI purified from the heterokont alga Nannochloropsis gaditana, showing that it is organized as a supercomplex including a core complex and an outer <b>antenna,</b> as in <b>plants</b> and other eukaryotic algae. Differently from all known organisms, the N.  gaditana PSI supercomplex contains five peripheral antenna proteins, identified by proteome analysis as type-R light-harvesting complexes (LHCr 4 - 8). Two antenna subunits are bound in a conserved position, as in PSI in plants, whereas three additional antennae {{are associated with the}} core on the other side. This peculiar antenna association correlates with the presence of PsaF/J and the absence of PsaH, G and K in the N.  gaditana genome and proteome. Excitation energy transfer in the supercomplex is highly efficient, leading to a very high trapping efficiency as observed in all other PSI eukaryotes, showing that although the supramolecular organization of PSI changed during evolution, fundamental functional properties such as trapping efficiency were maintained...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{electronic}} transitions of lutein and neoxanthin in {{the major}} light-harvesting complex, LHCIIb, have been identified for the first time. It was found that 0 – 0, 0 – 1 and 0 – 2 transitions of neoxanthin were located around 486, 457 and 430 nm, whilst those for lutein were dependent on the oligomerisation state. For the monomer, the absorption bands of lutein were found at 495, 466 and 437 nm. Trimerisation caused a decrease in lutein absorption and the parallel appearance of an additional absorption band around 510 nm, which was identified by resonance Raman excitation spectra to originate from lutein. Circular dichroism measurements together with analysis of the ν 4 resonance Raman region of xanthophylls suggested that this lutein molecule is distorted in the trimer. This feature is not predicted by the LHCIIb atomic model of Kühlbrandt and co-workers [Kühlbrandt, W., Wang, D. N. and Fugiyoshi, Y. (1994) Nature 367, 614 – 621] and {{is an important step}} in understanding pigment dynamics of the complex. Oligomerisation of trimers led to a specific distortion of the neoxanthin molecule. These observations suggest that the xanthophylls of LHCIIb sense the protein conformation and which may reflect their special role in the assembly and function of the light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> of higher <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} {{framework}} to segment cultural and natural features, given 3 D aerial scans {{of a large}} urban area, and (optionally) registered ground level scans of the same area. This system provides a primary step to achieve {{the ultimate goal of}} detecting every object from a large number of varied categories, from <b>antenna</b> to power <b>plants.</b> Our framework first identifies local patches of the ground surface and roofs of buildings. This is accomplished by tensor voting that infers surface orientation from neighboring regions as well as local 3 D points. We then group adjacent planar surfaces with consistent pose to find surface segments and classify them as either the terrain or roofs of buildings. The same approach is also applied to delineate vertical faces of buildings, as well as free-standing vertical structures such as fences. The inferred large structures are then used as geometric context to segment linear structures, such as power lines, and structures attached to walls and roofs from remaining unclassified 3 D points in the scene. We demonstrate our system on real LIDAR datasets acquired from typical urban regions with areas of a few square kilometers each, and provide a quantitative analysis of performance using externally provided ground truth...|$|R
50|$|Surveys of {{the insect}} fauna on typical compass plants have noted many {{different}} taxa, often present in large numbers. One plant can produce up to 12 stems. Surveys counted {{an average of}} nearly 80 insects on each stem or within its tissues. The vast majority of insects on the stems are the gall wasps Antistrophus rufus and A. minor, and the many types of parasitoids that attack them. The gall wasps, especially A. rufus, inject eggs into the stem, an action that induces {{the formation of a}} gall in the plant tissue. The larva of the wasp lives and feeds inside the gall, overwinters there, and emerges as an adult the following spring. Over 600 galls can be in a single stem. The galls are internal in this species, and generally not visible. The adult female A. rufus locates an appropriate site to oviposit by detecting plant volatiles emitted by the fresh growing stem of its host plant, a mix of monoterpenes. The male A. rufus also uses the volatiles in his search for mates. Females mate immediately upon emergence from the gall, and the male uses volatiles to find a gall containing a female, as evidenced by the movements of his <b>antennae</b> upon the <b>plant's</b> surface. He then waits there for her to emerge.|$|R
30|$|The {{parameter}} qL {{reflects the}} proportion of light absorbed by the antenna pigment in PSII for the photochemical reaction (Kramer et al. 2004), and NPQ {{is proportional to the}} rate constant of thermal energy dissipation, which is related to the plant self-protection mechanism of the photosynthetic apparatus in a stressful environment (Zribi et al. 2009). Plants grown under the LED-A 1 strategy had the highest qL, which was significantly higher (p <  0.05) than that of other treatments with a 211.65  % increase compared to the control. In addition, there was a significantly correlated relation among qL, Y(II) and ETR (p <  0.01), indicating that these parameters were to reflect the actual redox degree of photoelectrons in PSII. The NPQ of plants under the LED-B treatment was significantly higher than that of other groups; especially LED-B 2 was the highest one with a 14.94  % increase compared to the control, indicating that the light absorbed by the <b>plant’s</b> <b>antenna</b> pigments was dissipated as heat to a greater extent in the LED-B light quality, and that the plants’ self-protection mechanisms of the photosynthetic apparatus in PSII was strengthened. The NPQ of plants under the LED-A 1 strategy was the lowest, significant lower than the groups and with a 4.06  % increase compared to the control, indicating that more light could be used for the photochemical reaction under this condition (Table  5).|$|R
40|$|The photosystem II (PSII) light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> {{in higher}} <b>plants</b> {{contains}} {{a number of}} highly conserved gene products whose function is unknown. Arabidopsis thaliana plants depleted of one of these, the CP 24 light-harvesting complex, have been analyzed. CP 24 -deficient plants showed a decrease in light-limited photosynthetic rate and growth, but the pigment and protein content of the thylakoid membranes were otherwise almost unchanged. However, {{there was a major}} change in the macroorganization of PSII within these membranes; electron microscopy and image analysis revealed the complete absence of the C 2 S 2 M 2 light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) /PSII supercomplex predominant in wild-type plants. Instead, only C 2 S 2 supercomplexes, which are deficient in the LHCIIb M-trimers, were found. Spectroscopic analysis confirmed the disruption of the wild-type macroorganization of PSII. It was found that the functions of the PSII antenna were disturbed: connectivity between PSII centers was reduced, and maximum photochemical yield was lowered; rapidly reversible non-photochemical quenching was inhibited; and the state transitions were altered kinetically. CP 24 is therefore an important factor in determining the structure and function of the PSII light-harvesting antenna, providing the linker for association of the M-trimer into the PSII complex, allowing a specific macroorganization that is necessary both for maximum quantum efficiency and for photoprotective dissipation of excess excitation energy. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Antenna</b> {{systems of}} <b>plants</b> and green algae {{are made up}} of pigment-protein {{complexes}} belonging to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) multigene family. LHCs increase the light-harvesting cross-section of photosystems I and II and catalyze photoprotective reactions that prevent light-induced damage in an oxygenic environment. The genome of the moss Physcomitrella patens contains two genes encoding LHCb 9, a new antenna protein that bears an overall sequence similarity to photosystem II antenna proteins but carries a specific motif typical of photosystem I antenna proteins. This consists of the presence of an asparagine residue as a ligand for Chl 603 (A 5) chromophore rather than a histidine, the common ligand in all other LHCbs. Asparagine as a Chl 603 (A 5) ligand generates red-shifted spectral forms associated with photosystem I rather than with photosystem II, suggesting that in P. patens, the energy landscape of photosystem II might be different with respect to that of most green algae and plants. In this work, we show that the in vitro refolded LHCb 9 -pigment complexes carry a red-shifted fluorescence emission peak, different from all other known photosystem II antenna proteins. By using a specific antibody, we localized LHCb 9 within PSII supercomplexes in the thylakoid membranes. This is the first report of red-shifted spectral forms in a PSII antenna system, suggesting that this biophysical feature might have a special role either in optimization of light use efficiency or in photoprotection in the specific environmental conditions experienced by this moss...|$|R
40|$|Collectively, the {{xanthophyll}} {{class of}} carotenoids perform {{a variety of}} critical roles in light harvesting antenna assembly and function. The xanthophyll composition of higher plant photosystems (lutein, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin) is remarkably conserved, suggesting important functional roles for each. We have taken a molecular genetic approach in Arabidopsis toward defining the respective roles of individual xanthophylls in vivo by using a series of mutant lines that selectively eliminate and substitute a range of xanthophylls. The mutations, lut 1 and lut 2 (lut = lutein deficient), disrupt lutein biosynthesis. In lut 2, lutein is replaced mainly by a stoichiometric increase in violaxanthin and antheraxanthin. A third mutant, aba 1, accumulates normal levels of lutein and substitutes zeaxanthin for violaxanthin and neoxanthin. The lut 2 aba 1 double mutant completely lacks lutein, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin and instead accumulates zeaxanthin. All mutants were viable in soil and had chlorophyll a/b ratios ranging from 2. 9 to 3. 5 and near wild-type rates of photosynthesis. However, mutants accumulating zeaxanthin exhibited a delayed greening virescent phenotype, which was most severe and often lethal when zeaxanthin was the only xanthophyll present. Chlorophyll fluorescence quenching kinetics indicated that both zeaxanthin and lutein contribute to nonphotochemical quenching; specifically, lutein contributes, directly or indirectly, to the rapid rise of nonphotochemical quenching. The {{results suggest that the}} normal complement of xanthophylls, while not essential, is required for optimal assembly and function of the light harvesting <b>antenna</b> in higher <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Under excess illumination, the Photosystem II light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> {{of higher}} <b>plants</b> {{has the ability}} to switch into an {{efficient}} photoprotective mode, allowing safe dissipation of excitation energy into heat. In this study, we show induction of the energy dissipation state, monitored by chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, in the isolated major light-harvesting complex (LHCII) incorporated into a solid gel system. Removal of detergent caused strong fluorescence quenching, which was totally reversible. Singlet-singlet annihilation and gel electrophoresis experiments suggested that the quenched complexes were in the trimeric not aggregated state. Both the formation and recovery of this quenching state were inhibited by a cross-linker, implying involvement of conformational changes. Absorption and CD measurements performed on the samples in the quenched state revealed specific alterations in the spectral bands assigned to the red forms of chlorophyll a, neoxanthin, and lutein 1 molecules. The majority of these alterations were similar to those observed during LHCII aggregation. This suggests that not the aggregation process as such but rather an intrinsic conformational transition in the complex is responsible for establishment of quenching. 77 K fluorescence measurements showed redshifted chlorophyll a fluorescence in the 690 - 705 nm region, previously observed in aggregated LHCII. The fact that all spectral changes associated with the dissipative mode observed in the gel were {{different from those of the}} partially denatured complex strongly argues against the involvement of protein denaturation in the observed quenching. The implications of these findings for proposed mechanisms of energy dissipation in the Photosystem II antenna are discussed. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{truncated}} light-harvesting antenna 2 (tla 2) mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii {{showed a}} lighter-green phenotype, {{had a lower}} chlorophyll (Chl) per-cell content, and higher Chl a/b ratio than corresponding wild-type strains. Physiological analyses revealed a higher intensity for the saturation of photosynthesis and greater Pmax values in the tla 2 mutant than in the wild type. Biochemical analyses showed that the tla 2 strain was deficient in the Chl a-b light-harvesting complex, and had a Chl antenna size of the photosystems that was only about 65 % {{of that in the}} wild type. Molecular and genetic analyses showed a single plasmid insertion in the tla 2 strain, causing a chromosomal DNA rearrangement and deletion/disruption of five nuclear genes. The TLA 2 gene, causing the tla 2 phenotype, was cloned by mapping the insertion site and upon complementation with each of the genes that were deleted. Successful complementation was achieved with the C. reinhardtii TLA 2 -CpFTSY gene, whose occurrence and function in green microalgae has not hitherto been investigated. Functional analysis showed that the nuclear-encoded and chloroplast-localized CrCpFTSY protein specifically operates in the assembly of the peripheral components of the Chl a-b light-harvesting <b>antenna.</b> In higher <b>plants,</b> a cpftsy null mutation inhibits assembly of both the light-harvesting complex and photosystem complexes, thus resulting in a seedling-lethal phenotype. The work shows that cpftsy deletion in green algae, but not in higher plants, can be employed to generate tla mutants. The latter exhibit improved solar energy conversion efficiency and photosynthetic productivity under mass culture and bright sunlight conditions...|$|R
40|$|The light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> {{of higher}} <b>plant</b> photosystem II (LHCII) has the {{intrinsic}} capacity to dissipate excess light energy as {{heat in a}} process termed nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Recent studies suggest that zeaxanthin and lutein both contribute to the rapidly relaxing component of NPQ, qE, possibly acting in the minor monomeric antenna complexes and the major trimeric LHCII, respectively. To distinguish whether zeaxanthin and lutein act independently as quenchers at separate sites, or alternatively whether zeaxanthin fulfills an allosteric role regulating lutein-mediated quenching, the kinetics of qE and the qE-related conformational changes (ΔA 535) were compared in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant/antisense plants with altered contents of minor antenna (kolhcb 6, aslhcb 4), trimeric LHCII (aslhcb 2), lutein (lut 2, lut 2 npq 1, lut 2 npq 2), and zeaxanthin (npq 1, npq 2). The kinetics of the two components of NPQ induction arising from zeaxanthin-independent and zeaxanthin-dependent qE were both sensitive {{to changes in the}} protein composition of the photosystem II antenna. The replacement of lutein by zeaxanthin or violaxanthin in the internal Lhcb protein-binding sites affected the kinetics and relative amplitude of each component as well as the absolute chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime. Both components of qE were characterized by a conformational change leading to nearly identical absorption changes in the Soret region that indicated the involvement of the LHCII lutein 1 domain. Based on these observations, we suggest that both components of qE arise from a common quenching mechanism based upon a conformational change within the photosystem II antenna, optimized by Lhcb subunit-subunit interactions and tuned by the synergistic effects of external and internally bound xanthophylls...|$|R
40|$|The {{flexible}} macro-organisation of the photosynthetic thylakoid membrane allows {{plants to}} respond to changes in environmental conditions. Under excess light conditions light harvesting antenna complexes (LHCII) switch to a protective state, in which excess energy is dissipated as heat - a process called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The rapidly reversible component ofNPQ (qE) {{is dependent on the}} acidification of the thylakoid lumen and is regulated by the xanthophyll cycle. The PsbS protein plays pivotal role in this process, but its mode ofaction is unknown. This thesis presents an investigation of the effects of PsbS on NPQ,particularly exploring its function in the organisation ofthe <b>antenna</b> complexes. Mutant <b>plants</b> lacking or over-expressing PsbS were used in the study ofNPQ. PsbS was demonstrated not to be necessary for the formation of qE, since {{even in the absence of}} the protein there was a small amount of reversible quenching that was ~pH-dependent arid sensitive to inhibition ofthe xanthophyll cycle. The level ofPsbS was shown to affect both the extent and the kinetics of the formation of qE. The temperature sensitivity of qE was also shown to be controlled by PsbS. These data suggest that PsbS is a catalyst ofquenching formation. PsbS was shown to function in the macro-organisation of the thylakoid membranes. The protein affected the macro-structure and the detergent sensitivity of the membranes. In unstacked thylakoids the Mi+-induced re-assembly of the PSIILHCII supercomplexes was shown to be highly dependent on PsbS. By comparing various types of mutants, it was shown that this effect of PsbS depended on the level of expressed protein and not whether it was active in qE formation. It is argued that the roles of PsbS in the Ipacro-structure of the thylakoid membrane and in qE formation both reflect the LHCII-organising properties ofthe protein.
