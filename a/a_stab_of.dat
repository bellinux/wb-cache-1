2500|$|Before being exiled, Amalrik made {{a pilgrimage}} to those places where, in the 14th century, Muscovy was born. Standing before an amazing complex of wooden churches of Kizhi Pogost {{on the banks of}} Lake Onega, he felt <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> wonderment: [...] "How could one and the same people have created such churches and {{destroyed}} so many of them in blind rage?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> misgiving {{shot through}} Val; this was riding very blind.|$|E
60|$|Jack's face, when I {{told him}} about it, was so woebegone that I felt <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> remorse, even {{in the heyday of}} my delight.|$|E
50|$|Pedro Grilo was {{ultimately}} jailed for 12 {{years for the}} murder, <b>a</b> <b>stabbing</b> <b>of</b> activist José Carvalho in Rua da Palma, although he escaped from prison after serving four months.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between gang {{members and the}} warders is a complex and an uneasy one. Under the apartheid regime they feared the warders. They knew that the warders would not be watched by human rights groups, so when there was <b>a</b> <b>stabbing</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> officer the warders would beat the gang members to {{within an inch of}} their lives.|$|R

60|$|Most eloquent, {{and most}} unconscious, was the quick flash of Miss West's eyes to Mr. Pike's big paws, with freshly abraded knuckles, {{resting on the}} rail. It was <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> hurt to me. She knew.|$|E
60|$|It seemed but {{a minute}} later that a buzzing in my ears awoke me, with <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> pain as though my temples were being split with a wedge. On the instant I heard my name cried aloud, and sat up, to find myself {{blinking}} in a broad flood of moonlight over against the agitated face of Dalmahoy.|$|E
60|$|He heard Jake {{shout and}} {{footsteps}} {{farther up the}} street, and tried to lean against the house for support, but slipped and fell upon the pavement. He could neither see nor hear well, but made out that his assailants had slunk away and men were running towards Jake, who stood, calling for help, {{in the middle of}} the street. Shortly afterwards a group of dark figures gathered round and he heard confused voices. He thought Jake knelt down and tried to lift him, but this brought on <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> burning pain and he knew nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2014, a minor moral panic {{occurred}} over the Slender Man after readers of his fiction were connected to several violent acts, particularly <b>a</b> near-fatal <b>stabbing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin.|$|R
2500|$|On August 19, 2011 an altercation {{between two}} {{passengers}} resulted in <b>a</b> fatal <b>stabbing</b> <b>of</b> {{one of the}} involved on the train near the Hollywood and Vine station. [...] The suspect was caught on August 24.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next day}} {{a number of}} revenge attacks occurred. Large numbers of Middle Eastern men {{gathered}} in Punchbowl in Sydney’s West, police being ordered not to confront them. Revenge attacks by Middle Eastern men against white Australias occurred in various suburbs, including <b>a</b> <b>stabbing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man at Woolooware, [...] a man being attacked by an iron bar while in his car, gunshots being fired at parked cars at Christian church services and a church hall in Auburn in the city's west was burned down.|$|R
6000|$|... "It would, my brethren, {{be wrong}} and useless to shed blood; but methinks {{that if this}} apple of discord could be removed a good work would be done not, as our friend the count has suggested, by <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> the dagger; that indeed would be worse than useless. But surely there are scores of {{religious}} houses, where this bird might {{be placed in a}} cage without a soul knowing where she was, and where she might pass her life in prayer that she may be pardoned for having caused grave hazards of the failure of an enterprise in which all the Christian world is concerned." ...|$|E
6000|$|So Herminia gave way. Sadly {{against her}} will she gave way. One morning in early March, she absented herself from {{her place in the}} class-room without even taking leave of her beloved schoolgirls, whom she had tried so hard unobtrusively to train up towards a {{rational}} understanding of the universe around them, and sat down to write a final letter of farewell to poor straight-laced kind-hearted Miss Smith-Waters. She sat down to it with a sigh; for Miss Smith-Waters, though her outlook upon the cosmos was through one narrow chink, was a good soul up to her lights, and had been really fond and proud of Herminia. She had rather shown her off, indeed, as a social trump card to the hesitating parent,--"This is our second mistress, Miss Barton; you know her father, perhaps; such an excellent man, the Dean of Dunwich." [...] And now, Herminia sat down with a heavy heart, thinking to herself what <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> pain the avowal she had to make would send throbbing through that gentle old breast, and how absolutely incapable dear Miss Smith-Waters could be of ever appreciating the conscientious reasons which had led her, Iphigenia-like, to her self-imposed sacrifice.|$|E
6000|$|Prudence, which bids us {{all go to}} the ant for {{wisdom and}} hoard against the day of sickness, was not a {{favourite}} with Thoreau. He preferred that other, whose name is so much misappropriated: Faith. When he had secured the necessaries of the moment, he would not reckon up possible accidents or torment himself with trouble for the future. He had no toleration for the man [...] "who ventures to live only by {{the aid of the}} mutual insurance company, which has promised to bury him decently." [...] He would trust himself a little to the world. [...] "We may safely trust a good deal more than we do," [...] says he. [...] "How much is not done by us! or what if we had been taken sick?" [...] And then, with <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> satire, he describes contemporary mankind in a phrase: [...] "All the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties." [...] It is not likely that the public will be much affected by Thoreau, when they blink the direct injunctions of the religion they profess; and yet, whether we will or no, we make the same hazardous ventures; we back our own health and the honesty of our neighbours for all that we are worth; and it is chilling to think how many must lose their wager.|$|E
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, the KA-BAR {{was tested}} against the Recon 1 in cutting up a gel torso. Mike, wielding the KA-BAR, ripped apart the gel torso with <b>a</b> <b>stabbing</b> speed <b>of</b> 29fps(severing the windpipe, the spinal cord, and every major blood vessel in the neck, starting {{with an initial}} kill shot to an artery) while Rob, wielding the Recon 1, decapitated, amputated, and disemboweled the gel torso with <b>a</b> <b>stabbing</b> speed <b>of</b> 32fps. Both men's stabbing speed {{was determined to be}} slightly less than the punching speed of the average Olympic boxer. The panel was indecisive as to which knife was better and considered both weapons to be equally effective, resulting in a draw.|$|R
50|$|Whenever {{a correct}} answer was given, Mayo would play <b>a</b> {{congratulation}} <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> You! Are! <b>A!</b> Winner! before playing {{the record in}} question. After the record, he would then explain the cryptic clue in as little or much detail as deemed necessary.|$|R
60|$|Joan {{looked at}} the white patient face and was silent. What would be the use of {{senseless}} contradiction. The woman knew. It would only seem <b>an</b> added <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> mockery. She knelt beside the bed, and took the thin hands in hers.|$|R
6000|$|Later I {{heard from}} D'Aulon {{that he had}} bidden John the Lorrainer mark the man with his couleuvrine, for that he did overmuch mischief. But, {{thinking}} of nought save to be foremost in the breach, I ran in, stumbling over the dead man's body, and shouldered {{at the same time}} by Alphonse, who warded off <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> a pike that was dealt at me. Then it was a fair mellay, our men pressing after us through the gap, and driving us forward by mere weight of onset, they coming with all speed against our enemies that ran together {{from all parts of the}} keep, and so left bare the further wall. It was body to body, weight against weight, short strokes at close quarters, and, over our heads, bills striking and foining at the English. Each man smote where he could; we wavered and swayed, now off our feet in the press, now making some yard of ground, and evil was the smell and thick the dust that arose. Meanwhile came the sound of the riving of planks from the other side of the palisade; above the steel points and the dust I saw the Maid's pennon advancing with the face of my lady painted thereon, and I pressed towards it, crying [...] "St. Andrew" [...] with such breath as was in me. Then rang out the Maid's voice, like a clarion, [...] "St. Denis!" [...] and so, stroke echoing stroke, and daggers going at close quarters, beaten on and blinded, deaf and breathless, now up, now down, we staggered forward, till I and the Maid stood side by side, and the English broke, some falling, some flying to the out-gate.|$|E

5000|$|At Las Vegas, Rafael meets Ruby {{and tells}} {{her that he}} was {{returning}} to Cuba after the competition. Burnett (who did not go) reflects on his cruel rejection of Rafael and decides to come to the dance to apologize to Rafael and persuade him not to go back to Cuba. Rafael dances with Patricia and while watching them, Ruby realized that {{she was in love with}} Rafael and felt <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> jealousy seeing them together.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{better not}} speak of that," [...] {{interrupted}} Kitty with bitterness, [...] "it's all over now." [...] And the final tinge of superiority in his manner made her give him <b>a</b> little <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> dismissal. [...] "Good by. I see my cousins coming." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{came forward}} a {{step into the}} room, lurched, and retreated to the safe support of the door. For an instant Sally's {{artificial}} calm was shot through by <b>a</b> swift <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> contempt. It passed, and she was back again in her armour of indifference.|$|R
25|$|In Genesee County on August 4, 2010, it was {{announced}} that a string of stabbings that date back to May 2010 was the work of one man and a multi-jurisdictional task force was set up to investigate. The next week on August 9, 2010 police in Leesburg connected three hammer attacks against black men there via their victims' descriptions of the suspect, video surveillance footage of the attacks that matches his description and vehicle, and the similar mode of operation. The next day Toledo Police claimed <b>a</b> <b>stabbing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> black man there also matched the suspect.|$|R
5000|$|In early December 2010, Waleed Al-Husseini {{posted a}} letter to his family on his blog in which he apologized for {{offending}} Muslims and sought forgiveness for what he called his [...] "stupidity". A friend, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the issue, said Husayen posted the letter in hopes of winning release from prison. Al-Husseini states in his 2015 autobiography Blasphémateur he did not write it, but discovered it on leaving custody and trying to visit his blog."...it was with <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> disappointment that I visited by blog of which the only content was now some words published by the Palestinian Authority, which presented my apologies and asked for forgiveness in my name, for having blasphemed Islam. Five years of work and more than two million visitors down the drain".|$|E
5000|$|On Sunday {{morning in}} July, Isao conducts a kendo {{practice}} for young {{boys in the}} drill hall of the neighbourhood police station. While a detective called Tsuboi talks to him, four Communists are brought to the prison, and Isao feels <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> envy. Iinuma runs an [...] "Academy of Patriotism" [...] in a wing of his large house in Hongō. We learn {{about what happened to}} Iinuma and Miné between 1914 and 1932, and meet the 40-year-old student named Sawa. After Master Kaido's Sunday lecture, Isao shows his two schoolfriends a map of Tokyo, suggesting an air-raid on the areas he has coloured in purple. Later on they have dinner with Makiko at her house, and the four discuss who in Japan most deserves assassination. Isao names Kurahara. Makiko has kept the lilies Isao brought from Izagawa Shrine a month ago, and hands them one each.|$|E
5000|$|Fitzgerald {{consulted}} Dr. Nelson {{complaining of}} “aches around the elbow and shoulder[...] [...] whenever I {{have had a}} great orgy of cokes or coffee." [...] Not long afterward, Fitzgerald believed that he had suffered a mild heart seizure while trying to open a window. When he raised his arms he felt <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> pain that was so sharp it took his breath away; later there remained an unusual stiffness in his arms. Dr. Nelson decided {{this was not a}} heart attack but it was a warning to Fitzgerald to take better care of himself. On Feb 7, 1940, Fitzgerald wrote to Dr. Nelson, telling him that he was not drinking and would pay his medical bill soon. Fitzgerald died suddenly of a myocardial infarct in the apartment of Sheilah Graham, December 21, 1940, 5:15 pm, and Dr. Nelson signed the death certificate. Frances Kroll Ring, Fitzgerald's secretary, wrote that she paid Dr. Nelson's bill ($25) after Fitzgerald's death.|$|E
60|$|Jill {{suffered}} most in her mind; {{for only}} <b>a</b> sharp <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> pain {{now and then}} reminded her of her body; but her remorseful little soul gave her no peace for thinking of Jack, whose bruises and breakages her lively fancy painted in the darkest colors.|$|R
60|$|Susan seated {{herself on}} a cushion on the floor--and with how sharp <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> {{reminded}} me <b>of</b> Fanny and the old, care-free days of Wuthering Heights.|$|R

50|$|Mary {{recalls a}} day, earlier in December, where {{she noticed a}} figure coming up the walk. She {{thought it was the}} ghost {{but it turned out to}} be her husband (a bit of foreshadowing). She remembers being {{determined}} to find out what was bothering Ned and intentionally asking him while they were sitting in the library if he had seen the ghost yet. He replied that he had not. She remembers noticing a change in his demeanor as he opened his mail that evening. He seemed to be relieved of whatever burden he was carrying. She recalls feeling relieved at the change until she opened her mail. Someone sent her a newspaper clipping about the suit that a man named Elwell brought against Ned concerning the Blue Star Mine business deal. When Mary questioned Ned about it, he diffused her queries with “I thought that kind of thing bored you” and he told her the suit had been withdrawn, but he did not reveal why. Mary remembers feeling <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> guilt at not taking an interest in her husband’s business affairs.|$|E
40|$|Media for {{isolation}} of Haemophilus sp. from the conjuctiva were compared in an oasis in southern Tunisia where severe trachoma and seasonal epidemic purulent conjunctivitis are common. Of 89 children tested, IsoVitaleX-supplemented chocolate agar yielded Haemophilus in 87 %, plain chocolate agar in 75 %, sheep blood agar with <b>a</b> <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> Staphylococcus epidermidis in 74 %, and Fildes medium in 58 %. Since other microbial pathogens are easily {{identified in the}} modified blood agar, {{it was the most}} useful single medium...|$|E
