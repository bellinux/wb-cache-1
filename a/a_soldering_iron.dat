5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Br√ºnnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using <b>a</b> <b>soldering</b> <b>iron.</b> Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E

In addition to the big shears anchored in {{a hole in his}} bench he used hand snips and nippers for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (stakes) were used to turn and roll the edges of the tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; <b>a</b> <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> and fire pot were needed to do this.|$|E
25|$|The {{radio was}} built and {{operated}} in the British other ranks' compound. The {{maker of the}} radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by {{a core group of}} three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and <b>a</b> <b>soldering</b> <b>iron.</b> In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a Norton motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.|$|E
2500|$|PP can be melted using a speed welding technique. With speed welding, {{the plastic}} welder, similar to <b>a</b> <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> in {{appearance}} and wattage, is {{fitted with a}} feed tube for the plastic weld rod.

Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use. First he took out <b>a</b> <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> and some plumbing solder, and then small oil lamp, which gave out, when lit {{in a corner of}} the tomb, gas which burned at a fierce heat with a blue flame, then his operating knives, which he placed to hand, and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation.

50|$|For hand soldering, {{the heat}} source tool should be {{selected}} {{to provide adequate}} heat for the size of joint to be completed. <b>A</b> 100 watt <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> may provide too much heat for printed circuit boards, while a 25 watt iron will not provide enough heat for large electrical connectors, joining copper roof flashing, or large stained-glass lead came. Using a tool with too high a temperature can damage sensitive components, but protracted heating by a tool that is too cool or under powered can also cause heat damage, perhaps even detaching PCB traces from the substrate.|$|R

50|$|Resistance {{soldering}} {{is unlike}} using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then {{passed through a}} thermally conductive tip into the joint area. <b>A</b> cold <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance <b>soldering</b> <b>an</b> intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, {{can be used for}} difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.|$|R
40|$|A pair of air-coupled {{ultrasonic}} capacitance transducers with polished metal backplates {{have been}} used to image temperature and Bow fields in gases using ultrasonic tomography. Using a filtered back-projection algorithm and a difference technique, cross-sectional images of spatially variant changes in ultrasonic attenuation and slowness caused by the presence of temperature and Bow fields were reconstructed. Temperature fields were produced in air by <b>a</b> commercial <b>soldering</b> <b>iron,</b> and the subsequent images of slowness variations used to reconstruct the air temperature at various heights above the iron. When compared to measurements made with a thermocouple, the tomographically reconstructed temperatures were found to be accurate to within 5 %. The technique was also able to resolve multiple heat sources within the scan area. Attenuation and Velocity images were likewise produced for flow fields created by an air-jet from a l-mm-diam nozzle, at both 90 and 45 degrees to the scanning plane. The fact that temperature and flow fields can be measured in a gas without the need to insert any measuring devices into the image region is an advantage that may have many useful applications.

50|$|Tellabs traces {{its roots}} {{to a meeting}} in 1975 over a kitchen table in {{suburban}} Chicago. According to company founder Michael Birck, a group of six men with backgrounds in electrical engineering and sales drank coffee and brainstormed ideas for a new telecom company. They aimed to build a company that offered customers products and services that met their specific needs. After raising $110,000 in capital, they incorporated as Tellabs {{in the spring of}} 1975; the name combined the idea of telephones and laboratories. The start-up only had a one-man research department, <b>a</b> second-hand <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> picked up for $25, and an outdated oscilloscope. In a matter of months, Tellabs began making echo suppressors, which suppress annoying echoes on phone calls. During this time, the founding partners drew no salaries. The company went public in July 1980, ending the year with sales of $43.7 million. In September 1981, Tellabs introduced the industry's first echo canceller, an advance over the original echo suppressors that synthesized an echo and electronically subtracted it. By 1990, Tellabs had grown to 2,000 employees at 25 locations globally and sales of $211 million.|$|R
50|$|Copper tubing conducts {{heat away}} {{much faster than}} <b>a</b> {{conventional}} hand-held <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> or gun can provide, so a propane torch is most commonly used to deliver the necessary power; for large tubing sizes and fittings a MAPP-fueled, acetylene-fueled, or propylene-fueled torch is used with atmospheric air as the oxidizer; MAPP/oxygen or acetylene/oxygen are rarely used because the flame temperature {{is much higher than}} the melting point of copper. Too much heat destroys the temper of hard-tempered copper tubing, and can burn the flux out of a joint before the solder is added, resulting in a faulty joint. For larger tubing sizes, a torch fitted with various sizes of interchangeable swirl tips is employed to deliver the needed heating power. In the hands of a skilled tradesman, the hotter flame of acetylene, MAPP, or propylene allows more joints to be completed per hour without damage to copper tempering.|$|R
40|$|Ordinary {{thermocouples}} use {{the well-known}} Seebeck effect {{to measure the}} temperature at the junction of two different conductors. The electromotive force generated by the heat depends on {{the difference between the}} respective thermoelectric powers of the contacting metals and the junction temperature. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the thermoelectric measurement as most often used in nondestructive materials characterization. One of the reference electrodes is heated by electrical means to a preset temperature of 100 ‚Äì 300 ¬∞C, pretty much like the tip of <b>a</b> temperature-stabilized <b>soldering</b> <b>iron,</b> and connected to the inverting (‚àí) input of the differential amplifier driving the indicator. The other electrode is left cold at essentially room temperature and connected to the non-inverting (+) input. The measurement is done quickly in a few seconds to assure (i) that the hot reference electrode is not cooled down perceivably by the specimen and (ii) {{that the rest of the}} specimen beyond the close vicinity of the contact point is not warmed up perceivably. Ideally, regardless of the temperature difference between the junctions, only thermocouples made of different materials, i. e., materials of different thermoelectric power, will generate thermoelectric signal. This unique feature makes the simple thermoelectric tester one of the most sensitive material discriminators used in nondestructive inspection...|$|R
