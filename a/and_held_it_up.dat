5|$|Manchester United {{fashioned}} {{the first}} chance {{of the second half}} after just three minutes, when Rooney cut inside from the right along the face of the penalty area, but his left-footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick. Soon after, Van Nistelrooy received the ball {{on the edge of the}} penalty area <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> before playing a through-ball to Keane, but the Irishman's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney. United then had their third chance in the space of five minutes when Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards, from the left corner of the penalty area.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} for IGN, Travis Fickett extolled Summer Glau's performance, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{as an example}} of her acting ability keeping the whole series from failing. [...] Fickett also {{explained}} that [...] "Self Made Man" [...] received better ratings than the preceding episodes of the series' second season. [...] At the website Television Without Pity (TWoP), the staff review rated the episode a [...] "C", and specifically took issue with the suspension of disbelief required for Cameron's ability to find anything and everything about the Myron Stark storyline in a closed public library; , 757 of their readers awarded it an average grade of [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Olga left Gatchina for {{the first}} time in the early fall of 1888 when the {{imperial}} family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with [...] "a Herculean effort" [...] so that the others could escape. There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes. An official investigation found that the crash was an accident, but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.|$|E

500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{university}} adopted {{blue and}} white as its official colors in 1892. Originally, however, UK students had decided on blue and light yellow prior to the Kentucky-Centre College football game on December 19, 1887. The shade of blue, which is close to a royal blue, was chosen when a student asked the question, [...] "What color blue?" [...] At the time, Richard C. Stoll (who lettered in football at UK in 1889–94) pulled off his necktie <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The students then adopted that particular shade of blue. A year later, UK students officially dropped the light yellow color for white because the two colors did not look good together.|$|E
2500|$|Hart {{began dating}} singer Pink after meeting her in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the 2001 X Games. After {{four years of}} dating, Pink {{proposed}} to Hart in June 2005 via a pit board {{during one of his}} races in Mammoth Lakes, California. She was holding a sign initially asking [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] At first he ignored her and completed another lap of the race; it was only when she changed the sign <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again with it now saying, [...] "I'm serious!", that Hart pulled out of the race to pick Pink up. They married at the Four Seasons resort in Costa Rica on January 7, 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Late in Game 2 of the Conference Finals in Chicago, Vancouver Interim Head Coach Roger Neilson, {{frustrated}} {{with what he}} felt was the poor officiating in the game, placed a white towel {{on the end of}} a hockey stick <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in a gesture mocking surrender (waving the white flag). The players on the Canucks' bench followed suit. When the series shifted to Vancouver for the next two games, the team's fans cheered them on by waving white towels above their heads. The habit stuck, becoming an original Canuck fan tradition now seen across the league and in other sports, known as [...] "Towel Power." [...] The Canucks proceeded to win the series in five games, making it to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in their history.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with this}} match, several others saw tributes toward Speed. The only other Premier League match played {{that day was}} between Liverpool and Manchester City. Craig Bellamy of Liverpool was {{withdrawn}} from Liverpool's squad by his manager Kenny Dalglish, as he was too affected by the news to play. Bellamy played with Speed for Newcastle United and Wales, where Speed had also been his manager. Dalglish himself had signed Speed for Newcastle, and expressed his sadness at the news, saying that he thought Speed {{was not only a}} great footballer but also a great person. Another of Speed's former teammates, Hugo Viana, also paid tribute to him. Viana, a Portuguese international played alongside Speed at Newcastle from 2002 to 2004. After his team Braga had lost 3–2 to Porto, Viana displayed a shirt reading [...] "Gary Rest in Peace". Gareth Bale, who played for Speed at Wales, also gave Speed a last tribute. After scoring Tottenham's opening goal in a 3–0 win at home to Bolton, Bale took off his left boot <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to reveal the stitched words [...] "RIP Gary Speed".|$|E

6000|$|He {{held the}} paper out before him, and began {{pricking}} small holes through it, close together. He {{continued to work}} for some time, <b>and</b> then <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the light. The others understood {{the nature of his}} work, and they could now read: ...|$|R

60|$|Steve had got his hat in {{his hand}} <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> doubled <b>up</b> like a club, and every time that he turned in his restless walk he struck the bar a resounding blow. His eyes seemed to see nothing, {{although}} they moved wildly from side to side.|$|R
60|$|A wild bee {{settled on}} her arm, <b>and</b> she <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> between her <b>and</b> the sun, {{so that she}} might enjoy its dusky glamour. It would not sting her--not to-day! The little blue butterflies, too, kept {{alighting}} on her, who lay there so still. And the love-songs of the wood-pigeons never ceased, nor the faint swish of scything.|$|R
60|$|When a {{light was}} {{procured}} <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>up,</b> <b>it</b> revealed the pretty face of Jean Black, which underwent a wondrous change when she beheld {{the face of}} the prisoner.|$|R

60|$|A {{bright idea}} {{occurred}} {{to the young}} man. He pulled out his handkerchief and, striking a light, set it on fire. She gave him hers, and he made that flare up also. The only available fuel left was the small umbrella the girl had brought; this was also kindled in an opened state, <b>and</b> he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> by the stem till it was consumed.|$|R
6000|$|She {{held her}} peace; for {{the face and}} form before her were unshaped by rage. It {{seemed as if the}} bosom would burst with the {{emotions}} that strove within it. The effort that constrained <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> pent <b>up,</b> was no less formidable than the rage itself: no less bespeaking the violent and dangerous character of the woman who made it. But it succeeded, and she asked, after a silence: ...|$|R
60|$|As he concluded, he {{laid the}} machine on its face, locked it with the little bamboo cross, <b>and</b> then <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in triumph, {{to the delight of}} his white observers, and the blank astonishment of the Eskimos. We say blank, because, unlike the boat, the nature of which they {{understood}} before it had been quite inflated, this machine was to them an absolute mystery, and seemed to be of no use at all.|$|R

60|$|Holmes {{said little}} more, but {{the picture of}} the old roysterer seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were {{continually}} fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, <b>and</b> he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> against the time-stained portrait on the wall.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Emma {{sprang to}} the rescue, {{while all the}} other children, with a burst of exclamations, turned their eyes on mamma.

Don't you think, Tom, Ally pulled out mamma's bag, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> right <b>up</b> before her! Don't you think she'll find out?" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} the {{conspiracy}} was upon the point of collapsing. There {{was something in the}} gentleness of his rebuke, and in his appeal to her mother, which brought the tears to her eyes, and in another instant she would have been kneeling beside him with everything confessed, when the door flew open and her sister Ida came bounding into the room. She wore a short grey skirt, like that of Mrs. Westmacott, <b>and</b> she <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in each hand and danced about among the furniture.|$|R
