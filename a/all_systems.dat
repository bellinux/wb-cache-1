The best position ever achieved by an Itanium2 based system in the list was #2 (while now <b>all</b> <b>systems</b> have dropped off the list), achieved in June 2004, when Thunder (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, Columbia entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there was at least one Itanium-based computer in the top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), and no Itanium system remained on the list in November 2012.|$|E
5|$|At {{the tenth}} RA I {{tropical}} cyclone committee held during 1991, it was {{recommended that the}} intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. Specifically {{it was decided that}} the classifications: Weak Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Depression and Severe Tropical Depression would be changed to Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Storm and Severe Tropical Storm. This change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels <b>all</b> <b>systems</b> as tropical cyclones.|$|E

5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with <b>all</b> <b>systems</b> for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of the spacecraft, where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost <b>all</b> <b>systems</b> today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

40|$|Next {{generation}} {{mobile communication}} does not only denote a new air interface, but a complex software architecture, addressing <b>all</b> <b>system</b> parts from wireless transmission to applications and services including a network and middleware platform. Seamless integration of heterogeneous environments on <b>all</b> <b>system</b> levels is regarded to {{be a key}} requirement.

With respect to these assumptions, we suggest an overall architecture for next generation mobile communication systems. Our approach aims at easy service deployment supported by <b>all</b> <b>system</b> parts. For that, we assume adaptable, cooperating components on open platforms grouped by abstraction layers rather than rigid system layers. Cross layer awareness allows services and applications to make use of available resources. 1...|$|R
