5|$|Luton Town Football Club {{was formed}} on 11 April 1885, {{the product of}} a merger of the two leading local teams, Luton Town Wanderers and Excelsior. Initially based at Excelsior's Dallow Lane ground, the club began making {{payments}} to certain individual players in 1890. The following year, Luton became the first club in southern England to be fully professional. The club was a founder member of the Southern Football League in the 1894–95 season and finished as runners-up in its first two seasons. It then left to help form the United League and came second in that league's inaugural season before joining the Football League (then based mostly in northern and central England) for 1897–98, concurrently moving to a new ground at Dunstable Road. The club continued to enter a team to the United League for two more seasons, and won the title in 1897–98. Poor attendance, high wages and the high travel and <b>accommodation</b> <b>costs</b> that resulted from Luton's distance from the northern heartlands of the Football League crippled the club financially, and made it too expensive to compete in that league. A return to the Southern League was therefore arranged for the 1900–01 season.|$|E

The additional daily service consisted of an evening inbound and early morning outbound flight, which included a night stop for both aircraft and crew in Berlin. To improve capacity utilisation on its Berlin services and cut down on aircraft parking as well as crew <b>accommodation</b> <b>costs,</b> from 1 April 1974, Air France routed both of its daily Orly–Tegel services via Cologne, with aircraft and crew returning to their base at Paris Orly the same day.

25|$|Prior to the Second World War, {{members of}} the Brigade of Guards and retired {{members of the}} Royal Artillery {{performed}} the role of stewards. In 1946 the AELTC offered employment to wartime servicemen returning to civilian life during their demobilisation leave. Initially this scheme extended only to the Royal Navy, followed by the Army in 1947 and the Royal Air Force in 1949. In 1965 London Fire Brigade members {{joined the ranks of}} stewards. The service stewards, wearing uniform, are present in Centre Court and No.'s 1 and 2 courts. In 2015, 595 Service and London Fire Brigade stewards attended. Only enlisted members of the Armed Forces may apply for the role, which must be taken as leave, and half of each year's recruits must have stewarded at Wimbledon before. The AELTC pays a subsistence allowance to servicemen and women working as stewards to defray their <b>accommodation</b> <b>costs</b> for the period of the Championships.

500|$|The pair {{travelled}} through Innsbruck, then {{due south}} to the Brenner Pass into Italy. They continued through Bolzano and Rovereto to Verona and Mantua, before turning west towards Milan. Leopold's financial plans for the journey were broadly {{the same as for}} the family's grand tour—travel and <b>accommodation</b> <b>costs</b> were to be met by concert proceeds. This [...] winter journey to Milan occupied a difficult and unpleasant six weeks, with the weather forcing extended stops. Leopold complained in his letters home about unheated inn rooms: [...] "...freezing like a dog, everything I touch is ice". Early concert receipts were modest; according to Leopold, costs were running at around 50florins a week. After having unwisely boasted about profits made from the grand tour, Leopold was now more cautious about revealing financial details. He tended to emphasise his expenses and minimise his takings, writing, for example: [...] "...On the whole we shall not make much in Italy...one must generally accept admiration and bravos as payment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{their first}} year, the {{majority}} of students live in private accommodation off-campus or in privately owned halls of residence such as those of Unite Group. In recent years, rents and availability of accommodation has seen more second and third year students returning to university halls. The University has a [...] "First-Year Accommodation Guarantee" [...] but {{at the start of the}} 2007-2008 term, and again in 2014-15, it became difficult to fulfill the guarantee due to the high demand for rental property in the rapidly growing city. The university ran out of rooms and had to resort to temporary accommodation (including putting students into hotel rooms, and making kitchens, study rooms and common rooms into dorm rooms) [...] However, any shortage of accommodation was sorted out within the first 4 weeks of term and in most cases within the first 2 weeks. This issue was resolved in 2016, and by 2017 there was a surplus of accommodation in halls of residence, particularly in the lower priced options. The university continues to monitor <b>accommodation</b> <b>costs</b> and where possible offers discretionary support to students, to improve access to higher education.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2009, a {{competition}} called the [...] "Up to Now Pub Quiz" [...] was launched on Facebook. Fans {{were required to}} create teams of five, and were posed with ten questions, related to the band's entire career, each week. The team with the most correct answers at the end will fly to London {{to see one of}} the concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, with a certain part of travel cost paid. The team will be allotted their own private box at the venue, and will get a chance to meet the band afterward. Along the same lines, a Swiss radio station 20 Minuten hosted a similar competition for listeners. They had a pair of tickets for the concert for the Royal Albert Hall concert of 24 November to give away. All flight and hotel <b>accommodation</b> <b>costs</b> were paid for by the radio station. UK radio station Xfm organized {{a competition}} called [...] "Xfm's Snow Patrol Bad Photoshop Challenge", with ten pairs of tickets were up to win. These tickets would enable fans to see the band rehearse in a yet-unnamed location in Brighton at the eve of the Reworked Tour. The challenge was to associate five photoshopped pictures with Snow Patrol song titles. The competition will end on 10 November 2009. A further fifteen pairs of tickets will be given away on air. Tickets for the intimate acoustic show in London for the promotion of Up to Now could only be obtained via two competitions, one organized on Play.com and the other on the band's official website. Both involved answering a simple question. For the HMV singing and performance, wristbands were available from 9am on 3 December 2009. One band was assigned to one person, however, it was not necessary to have one to see the band perform. The bands were required only {{to gain access to the}} signing. Tickets for the mini-festival at Ward Park will go on pre-sale on 9 December 2009, and on general sale on the 11th, priced at £44.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the phenomenal growth of the sharing economy in the travel industry, {{investigating}} its potential impacts on travelers and tourism destinations is of paramount importance. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify how the use of peer-to-peer accommodation leads to changes in travelers’ behavior. Based on two online surveys targeting travelers from the United States and Finland, it was identified that the social and economic appeals of peer-to-peer accommodation significantly affect expansion in destination selection, increase in travel frequency, length of stay, and range of activities participated in tourism destinations. Travelers’ desires for more meaningful social interactions with locals and unique experiences in authentic settings drive them to travel more often, stay longer, and participate in more activities. Also, the reduction in <b>accommodation</b> <b>cost</b> allows travelers to consider and select destinations, trips, and tourism activities that are otherwise cost-prohibitive.
