5|$|The Bicentennial dollars {{were the}} first of the three {{denominations}} to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975. The silver pieces were struck <b>at</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> beginning on April 23, 1975. The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only <b>at</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco)</b> are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II. The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975. Over 220 million were struck. The Bicentennial design was not used after 1976; sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.|$|E

5|$|The mintage of 15,000 {{was struck}} in July 1936. At the Philadelphia and Denver mints, 5,005 pieces were produced, and 5,006 <b>at</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> with the excess from the even {{thousands}} held for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1937 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. The first 200 pieces from each mint were collected in sets of three, with a notarized letter from Melish testifying to what number coins they were. Several of these special sets were sent by Melish to government officials.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} as USS Yancey (AKA-93) on 11 October 1944 {{under the command}} of Commander Edward R. Rice, USNR. After fitting out <b>at</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> California, Yancey received her boat group of 26 landing craft and conducted a shakedown cruise out of San Pedro, California. After post-shakedown alterations and repairs at San Diego, California, she sailed for San Francisco to load cargo from 18 to 24 November. Yancey sailed for Pearl Harbor the next day, and was assigned to Transport Division (TransDiv) 47, Transport Squadron (TransRon) 16 upon her arrival on 2 December.|$|E
5|$|With {{no further}} need for {{hospital}} ships by that time, Shamrock {{was taken out}} of service. After the possibility of refitting the ship to carry home war brides was rejected, Shamrock was turned over to the War Shipping Administration <b>at</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> on 4 February 1946, and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) at Suisun Bay, California. On 30 December 1947, Shamrock was sold to the Walter W. Johnson Co., and on 4 February 1948 was withdrawn from the NDRF for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted <b>at</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
