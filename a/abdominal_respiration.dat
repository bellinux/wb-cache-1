Because of the prevalence at the same time of human influenza and a marked resemblance in the symptoms of the two diseases Koen became convinced that they were the same. He therefore gave the name of "flu " to the new malady of hogs (1). The cardinal features of swine influenza are amply presented in the veterinary literature (1 [...] 6). Swine influenza is essentially a disease of autumn and early winter and reaches epizootic proportions each year. The onset is sudden and the incidence in an affected herd is practically 100 per cent. Fever, anorexia, prostration of an extreme type, cough, and a peculiar <b>abdominal</b> type of <b>respiration</b> are salient features of the disease.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a strategy for}} detection of abdominal adhesions based on cine-MRI data, image processing {{and the production of}} a ‘sheargram’. Abdominal adhesions are a common complication of abdominal surgery and can cause serious morbidity. Diagnosis is difficult and often one of exclusion. A conclusive diagnosis typically requires laparoscopic explorative surgery, which itself may cause further adhesions. A non-invasive means of diagnosis is preferred and likely to aid patient management. Cine-MRI can capture the motion of the <b>abdominal</b> structures during <b>respiration</b> and has shown promise for adhesion detection. However, such images are difficult and time consuming to interpret. A previous PhD considered augmenting cine-MRI by quantifying movement for detection of gross adhesive pathology. This thesis {{presents a}} refined image processing approach aimed at detection of more subtle adhesions to the abdominal wall. In the absence of adhesive pathology, the abdominal contents (bowels, kidneys, liver) slide smoothly against the perimeter of the abdominal cavity – a process termed visceral slide. An adhesion is expected to produce a localised resistance that inhibits smooth visceral sliding. In this PhD, development of a 2 D technique to quantify sliding {{around the perimeter of the}} abdominal cavity (with particular emphasis on the abdominal wall) sought to highlight regions of reduced sliding. Segmentation and image registration were employed to quantify movement and shear, the latter used as an analogue for sliding. The magnitude of shear over all frames in the dynamic MR image sequence was extracted and displayed as a colour plot over the MR image for anatomical context. This final output is termed a ‘sheargram’. Suitability of the technique for diagnosis was assessed through a series of experimental tests and correlation with clinical data. The latter involved a retrospective pilot study incorporating data from 52 patients scanned for suspected adhesions. A total of 141 slices were processed and reported. The validation experiments confirmed the technique had the attributes to accurately and reproducibly report sliding and demonstrated proof of concept for detection of adhered regions. The pilot study confirmed the sheargram matched expert clinical judgement in the vast majority of cases (> 84...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARYVery {{few cases}} of motor neuron {{diseases}} presenting with dispnea as the first symptom {{have been reported in}} literature. On the other hand, {{it is very difficult to}} identify a diaphragmatic paralysis as a cause of respiratory failure in patients without other evidence of muscular weakness. The authors describe two cases of amiatrophic laterat sclerosis in which the presenting symptoms were orthopnea and exertional dispnea. In both cases the cardiological evaluation was irremarkable. The identification of a paradoxial <b>abdominal</b> <b>respiration</b> associated to the radiological evidence of diaphragmatic elevation and a functional pattern of alveolar hypoventilation led us to the clinical suspicion of a primary neuromuscular disease with diaphragmatic involvement. This hypothesis was, in both cases, confirmed by electromiography. At the present, both patients are in a home ventilation program (the first one through a tracheostomy and the second one under nasal non invasive ventilation with BIPAP). The authors conclude drawing some considerations about the difficulties in the diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis as a cause of respiratory failure in patients with amiotrophic lateral sclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{support the}} idea that the use of pacifiers can reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. To {{investigate}} the effect of non-nutritive sucking (NNS), we measured heart rate, <b>abdominal</b> <b>respiration,</b> EMG and arterial oxygen saturation of 20 neonates. Also, in 10 of these neonates, changes in cerebral hemoglobin concentrations were acquired by means of near-infrared spectroscopy. Using a parametric technique to model the heart rate as a sum of exponentially damped sinusoids, two main frequency components were found in the heart rate during NNS: a frequency of approximately 0. 08 Hz due to the alternation of sucking bursts and pauses, and a frequency of approximately 0. 8 Hz that reflects the influence of the respiration. Our analysis shows that it is the alternation of bursts and pauses itself that causes the increased heart rate variability, and that this is not due to increased effort. This suggests that the neuronal mechanism regulating NNS also stimulates the heart rate. From our measurements, no effect of NNS on cerebral or peripheral oxygenation could be found. Furthermore, we show that our model-based signal processing technique is well suited for the analysis of non-stationary biomedical signals. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} the respiration patterns of wasps (Vespula sp.) in their viable temperature range (2. 9 – 42. 4 °C) by measuring CO 2 production and locomotor and endothermic activity. Wasps showed cycles of an interburst–burst type at low ambient temperatures (Ta 31 °C, CO 2 emission became cyclic. With rising Ta they enhanced CO 2 -emission primarily by an exponential increase in respiration frequency, from 2. 6 mHz at 4. 7 °C to 74 mHz at 39. 7 °C. In the same range of Ta CO 2 release per cycle decreased from 38. 9 to 26. 4 μlg− 1 cycle− 1. A comparison of wasps with other insects showed {{that they are}} among the insects with a low respiratory frequency at a given resting metabolic rate (RMR), and a relatively flat increase of respiratory frequency with RMR. CO 2 emission was always accompanied by <b>abdominal</b> <b>respiration</b> movements in all open phases and in 71. 4 % of the flutter phases, often accompanied by body movements.

Subjects consisted of 18 self-referred, highly anxious adults, matched for sex and age, and {{randomly assigned to one of}} the two conditions. Both groups met for three, hour-long, small group (n= 3) sessions. The breathing therapy program consisted of teaching slow, <b>abdominal</b> <b>respiration</b> as a relaxation technique and coping device.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the effect of changes in buoyancy when a swimmer respires in a horizontal posture. We attempted to evaluate the levelness of swimmers' streamline posture by simultaneously measuring the lung capacity and buoyancy under water. The buoyancy was measured based on {{the changes in the}} vertical loads of the upper and lower limbs on the subjects' streamline posture under water. The horizontal x-axis as lung ventilation and the vertical y-axis as buoyancy forms a linear equation y = ax + b. The relation between hand (upper-limb) buoyancy and lung ventilation is defined as y = a 1 x + b 1 and that between foot (lower-limb) buoyancy and lung ventilation as y = a 2 x + b 2. Horizontal levelness was calculated as a ratio by dividing a 2 by a 1 using the inclination (a) values from these formulas for an underwater streamline posture. We defined this ratio as the breathing-balance (BB) ratio. Although the performance levels in the present study did not show any difference in the absolute quantity of air that humans can inhale in a streamline posture, the BB ratio was higher in a statistically significant manner in junior swimmers competing at international levels compared with the other groups of subjects (P < 0. 001). This statistical difference in horizontal levelness, despite the absence of a noticeable difference in the absolute quantity of inhaled air, may be attributable {{to the way in which}} each person inhales and exhales air. Top-level junior swimmers that exhibited a high BB ratio might have inhaled in a way that would counteract the sinking of the lower limbs, for example, through <b>abdominal</b> <b>respiration.</b> When exhaling, on the other hand, they might have let out air gradually to mitigate the acceleration force involved in submerging the lower limbs...|$|E
40|$|Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome (MVPS) is {{a benign}} {{psychosomatic}} cardiac condition that can severely impair one's quality of life. Symptoms targeted {{in this study}} include, atypical chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, panic, and shortness of breath. This study was undertaken {{to examine the effects}} of a diaphragmatic breathing intervention on the symptoms and underlying mechanism of dysautonomia in a small group of symptomatic females with MVPS. The intervention was based on both yoga theory and cardiorespiratory empirical studies. Seven of eight participant's completed the nine week study using a single subject multiple baseline design across subjects. Participant's began a respiratory retraining intervention, in a weekly staggered pair start, after the first week of baseline measurement. Respiratory training consisted of a four week training in diaphragmatic breathing with home practice three times a day. Autonomic, behavioral, and cognitive systems were assessed. Dependent measures included State and Trait Anxiety, Anxiety Sensitivity, a Symptom Checklist, and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA). RSA is a current noninvasive measure of parasympathetic tone. Data on thoracic and abdominal respiratory predominance, respiration rate, diet, exercise, and adherence were also gathered. Data were analyzed via visual inspection of trends and phase average changes. Treatment effect sizes were calculated for standardized measures to indicate the meaningfulness of change. Two of the seven participants demonstrated a decrease in total symptom frequencies over the course of intervention. One participant demonstrated a weekly progression of lowered state anxiety scores from baseline through intervention. In terms of phase averages, three participants showed a lowering of state anxiety. All seven participants demonstrated lowered trait anxiety scores from pre to post intervention. Two of the seven participants demonstrated a meaningful pre to post intervention decrease in anxiety sensitivity. Respiratory training was effective in stabilizing <b>abdominal</b> <b>respiration.</b> Results regarding vagal tone could not be determined due to unreliable ECG data. In general, results were poor with several inconsistencies. Adherence rates were low and it did not appear that a therapeutic level of change in respiration rate was achieved.

However, appropriate rehabilitation plan, initiation time, and optimal duration of PR remain unclear. Lung cancer patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are considered high-risk population for postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) because of poor lung fitness and cardiopulmonary endurance. This study aims {{to assess the impact of}} a one-week, systematic and highly-intensive rehabilitation on surgical lung cancer patients with mild to moderate COPD. Methods A randomized controlled trial with 48 subjects was conducted (24 patients each for the intervention and groups). The intervention group received seven days of systematic, integrated and highly-intensive PR before surgical treatment, including: pharmacotherapy with atomizing terbutaline, pulmicort and infusion of ambroxol; and physical rehabilitation with respiratory training and endurance training. The control group underwent standard preoperative care.

Um animal manifestou a maioria dos sinais referentes ao sistema nervoso observados nos experimentos, com exceção dos sinais de cruzamento dos membros ao caminhar, bocejos, lábios flácidos e exposição do pênis. Outro animal, intoxicado espontaneamente, manifestou somente sintomas digestivos como rolar, “patear”, hipomotilidade/atonia intestinal e impactação do intestino grosso. Um terceiro animal, inicialmente manifestou sintomas digestivos caracterizados por patear, rolar, atonia intestinal e impactação do intestino grosso, com conseqüente desenvolvimento de laminite; na fase final exibiu acentuada sintomatologia nervosa mostrando compressão da cabeça contra obstáculos, incoordenação motora com cruzamento dos membros ao caminhar e relutância em se movimentar. Baseados no quadro clínico observado, são sugeridos possíveis locais de lesão no sistema nervoso. Poisoning by amitraz was experimentally {{reproduced in}} 17 horses and a donkey. First symptoms were observed between 15 min. and 2 h 5 min. after oral administration, and between 6 h 28 min. and 8 h 38 min. after spraying with amitraz. The course of poisoning after oral administration was 4 to 9 days, and after spraying 5 to 6 days. Death of experimental animals occurred only after oral administration. One animal was euthanized after spraying. Doses of 5. 5 mg/kg (1 administration), 5. 8 mg/kg (2 administrations) and doses which varied between 7. 2 and 36. 4 mg/kg (5 administrations) were used when amitraz {{was given by}} mouth, all causing symptoms of poisoning. When the administration of amitraz was by spraying, poisoning was reproduced with solutions of 0. 1 and 0. 2 %. Regarding the nervous system, the main signs observed were recumbency, somnolence, palpebral and auricular ptosis, difficulties in apprehension, chewing and swallowing of food, dragging of the hooves, exposure of the penis, diminished or absent cutaneous sensibility, instability, abduction of the legs, lowering of the head, incoordination, jawning, labial flacity, exposure of the tongue, crossing of the legs when walking, diminished postural response after crossing or abducting the legs, diminished/absent reflex of the upper lip, palatal, tongue, flexor and swallowing reflex, diminished auricular, palpebral and menace reflex. The ambulatory response was diminished when tested by walking in circles of small radius. Regarding the digestive system, the signs were mainly intestinal hypomotility/atony, edema of the lips, abdominal distention, frequent lying down and standing up, rolling on the ground, looking at the flancs, groaning and impaction of the large bowel. Regarding the circulatory system, the main clinical signs were tachycardia, increase of the refilling time of capillaries, congested mucosa and splitting of the cardiac sounds. Regarding the respiratory system, stridor, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, nasal discharge, bradypnoea and <b>abdominal</b> <b>respiration</b> was observed. Beside these signs, there were alterations of the general condition, as apathy and hypothermia. All natural cases occurred after spraying with amitraz. First symptoms were seen 2 to 3 days after the application of amitraz. The course was 6, 7 and 17 days. One animal showed mainly the nervous signs {{as seen in the}} experiments, with exception of the signs of crossing the legs when walking, yawning and exposure of the penis. Another animal had only digestive symptoms as rolling, pawing, intestinal hypomotility/atony and impaction of the large bowel. A third animal initially showed digestive symptoms characterized by pawing, rolling, intestinal atony and impaction of the large bowel, followed by laminitis; in the final stage this animal showed severe nervous signs as pressing the head against obstacles, incoordination with crossing the legs when walking and reluctance to move. Possible location of lesions in the nervous system according to the clinical signs are suggested...|$|E
