2500|$|During {{these years}} Croatia was {{elevated}} {{to the status}} of a kingdom. It is generally said that Duke Tomislav was crowned king in 925, but this is not certain since it is not known when <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> he crowned, or was he crowned at all. However, Tomislav was the first Croatian ruler whom the Papal chancellery honoured with the title king. Tomislav is mentioned as a king in two preserved documents published in the Historia Salonitana and by the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, where Tomislav's rule was specified at 13 years. In a note preceding the text of the Council conclusions in Split in 925 it is written that Tomislav is the king [...] "in the province of the Croats and in the Dalmatian regions" [...] (in prouintia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege). In the 12th canon of the Council conclusions in 925 the ruler of the Croats is called [...] "king" [...] (rex et proceres Chroatorum), while in a letter sent by the Pope John X Tomislav is named [...] "King of the Croats" [...] (Tamisclao, regi Crouatorum). Although there are no inscriptions of Tomislav to confirm the title, later inscriptions and charters confirm that his 10th century successors called themselves [...] "kings".|$|E
