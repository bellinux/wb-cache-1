5|$|The integers, {{together}} with the operation +, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To <b>appropriately</b> understand these structures as a collective, the following abstract definition is developed.|$|E
5|$|The manual offers {{matrices}} {{that address}} {{different types of}} snow {{and the rate of}} snowfall to tailor applications <b>appropriately</b> and efficiently.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements <b>appropriately</b> classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one preview {{wondered}} how the film would fare at the box office. Citing comparisons with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character <b>appropriately,</b> suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments to a successful adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy can be {{used with}} the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally {{advanced}} tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread {{to other parts of the}} body). In <b>appropriately</b> selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding <b>appropriately</b> to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{was among}} the councilman and {{citizens}} who expressed outrage at the light punishment issued by the mayor's office over a multimillion-dollar city contract scheme. Jackson viewed it as a moral issue where the Mayor did not <b>appropriately</b> condemn immoral activity, which in her eyes encourages similar behavior. During a Summer 2008 violent crime rash she {{was among the}} aldermen calling for refocussed emphasis on adequate police support.|$|E
5|$|Monitoring {{this from}} afar, and {{dissatisfied}} with Dohna's timidity in bringing Saltykov to battle, Frederick sent Carl Heinrich von Wedel to take command. Wedel arrived on 20 July {{and established a}} blocking position at Züllichau. This would prevent the Russians from entering Prussian territory and reaching the Oder. He wanted to attack the Russians at dawn the next day, but could not find an <b>appropriately</b> weak location in the Russian defenses.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{consist of}} 15 members who {{may come from}} {{different}} countries. Individuals may prearrange teams or sign up individually, in which case they are randomly grouped into <b>appropriately</b> sized teams. As of the 2013 contest, signup costs ran $19 per person with participation fees going towards Random Acts, a non-profit run by Collins that aims to encourage random acts of kindness.|$|E
5|$|The {{functions}} of the brain depend {{on the ability of}} neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells, and their ability to respond <b>appropriately</b> to electrochemical signals received from other cells. The electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes, most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses.|$|E
5|$|The name later reappeared on some BR diesels. The {{first was}} 47500 which carried the name from 1979 until 1991. Another Class 47, this time 47815, had the name {{bestowed}} {{on it in}} 2005; it is currently (2009) in operation with Riviera Trains. A High Speed Train power car, number 43185, also carries the same name; it is currently, and <b>appropriately,</b> {{a part of the}} First Great Western fleet.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack album for L.A. Noire was {{released}} in May 2011. A second soundtrack, entitled L.A. Noire Remixed EP, {{was released}} on the same day, consisting of six jazz classics remixed by contemporary DJs. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected <b>appropriately</b> with the gameplay and time period. The game's music was nominated for numerous awards.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack album for Red Dead Redemption was {{released}} on iTunes in May 2010. Additional compositions, composed for the game's downloadable content , were released on a second soundtrack in November 2010. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected <b>appropriately</b> with the gameplay and genre. The game's music was nominated for numerous awards. Several tracks became popular and begot cover versions and live performances.|$|E
5|$|All four {{structures}} {{were built in}} a simplified Greek Cross floor plan to signify a religious purpose. Closest to Lake Danebod stands the Folk High School, a three-story wooden building with eight gables. Next to the Folk High School stands the multipurpose Stone Hall, and across the street stands the Gym Hall with its iconic twin towers. Danebod Lutheran Church {{is located on the}} town's main street, <b>appropriately</b> named Tyler Street, and is {{in the shape of a}} Greek cross on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Archpriests {{and priests}} {{would use a}} less ornate mantle in their arms, and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. Although an Orthodox monk (not an abbot) {{displaying}} personal arms is rare, a hieromonk (monk who has been ordained a priest) would <b>appropriately</b> display a monastic hat (klobuk) and a black cloak or veil suggestive of his attire, and a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) would display an orarion behind the shield.|$|E
5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are <b>appropriately</b> grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words <b>appropriately</b> and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Foster enlists Homer to help Ned {{learn how}} to <b>appropriately</b> express emotions. After several failed scripted insults, Homer manages to get Ned to open up about some of his {{repressed}} dislikes, finally admitting he hates his parents, after which he immediately feels better. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released. Outside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned promises that from now on, if anyone does something he does not like, they will hear about it, which Dr. Foster tells him is very healthy.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights extremism, {{concluding that the}} phenomenon is a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are <b>appropriately</b> classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|Human rights {{agreements}} require most {{governments to}} provide {{family planning and}} contraceptive information and services. These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that {{a wide variety of}} safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are <b>appropriately</b> trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the false chanterelle. German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more <b>appropriately</b> placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on its white spores, decurrent gills, and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a subgenus of Clitocybe.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted <b>appropriately.</b> However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress <b>appropriately.</b> When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches {{are very}} vocal, using an {{assortment}} of whistles, trills and calls. Their breeding songs tend to be simple and often identical to their contact calls but longer in duration. The red-breasted nuthatch, which coexists with the black-capped chickadee throughout much of its range, is {{able to understand the}} latter species' calls. The chickadee has subtle call variations that communicate information about the size and risk of potential predators. Many birds recognise the simple alarm calls produced by other species, but the red-breasted nuthatch is able to interpret the chickadees' detailed variations and to respond <b>appropriately.</b>|$|E
5|$|O omnipotent Father, may you deign {{to bring}} rewards to the donor – (you) who above the depths and realms of the heaven {{as well as}} the earth {{and at the same time}} the {{recesses}} of the sea – throughout all this world you rule the angelic citizens of such bounteous merit; and may you grant to grow in me the seed of holy labour by which I may always be able to hymn <b>appropriately</b> your name.|$|E
5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing <b>appropriately.</b> This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 1928 the {{suburban}} line Potsdam-Stadtbahn-Erkner was fully equipped with DC third rail gear. Five trains {{of the new}} DRG Class ET 165 – the type <b>appropriately</b> named Stadtbahn – went into service, still sharing the track with steam trains. By November 1928 all lines leading toward the Stadtbahn, namely the lines from Kaulsdorf, Spandau and Grünau {{as well as the}} Berlin Ringbahn, were fully electrified. Therefore, suburban services to Spandau could be moved from the long-distance tracks to the local tracks. The last steam trains disappeared in 1929 when the ring became fully operated by electric trains. Half-ring trains operated only as peak time services.|$|E
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond <b>appropriately</b> to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus <b>appropriately</b> issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|The Lansbury home at 39 Bow Road was {{destroyed}} by bombing during the London Blitz of 1940–41. There is a small memorial stone dedicated to Lansbury {{in front of the}} current building, <b>appropriately</b> named George Lansbury House, which itself carries a memorial plaque. There is also a memorial to Lansbury in the nearby St Mary & Holy Trinity Church, known as ‘Bow Church’, where Lansbury was a long-term member of the congregation and churchwarden.|$|E
5|$|The company's ship-naming policy {{throughout}} its 87-year period of operations {{was to use}} its home port's name plus a suffix word, often a trade or occupation. The most frequently used name was Manchester Trader, applied to six different vessels between 1898 and cessation of operations in 1985. Some names used <b>appropriately</b> during the First World War, such as Manchester Hero, Manchester Brigade and Manchester Division were not reused after the disposal or loss of those vessels. Some ships operated short-term or on charter retained their original names and did not receive the Manchester prefix.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged, implementation of {{the decision by the}} authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are <b>appropriately</b> allocated.|$|E
