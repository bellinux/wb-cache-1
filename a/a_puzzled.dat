500|$|Some {{time has}} passed (at least two generations). In a remote wooded valley where the Rhine flows, the ageless Rhinemaidens {{continue}} to mourn for the gold, pleading with the [...] "Sun-woman" [...] to send them a champion who will return the gold to them. Siegfried's horn is heard, and he soon appears, having lost his way while hunting. The maidens greet him with their old playfulness and offer to help him, {{for the price of}} the ring on his finger. After a flirtatious exchange, Siegfried offers, apparently sincerely, to give them the ring. But instead of wisely simply accepting his offer, the mood of the naive, formerly flirtatious [...] Rhinemaidens suddenly becomes solemn: they warn Siegfried he will be killed that very day unless he delivers the ring to them. But brave Siegfried will never submit to any such implied threat and declares: [...] "By threatening my life and limb, even if it weren't worth as much as a finger, you won't get the ring from me!" [...] The maidens are scornful of his folly: [...] "Farewell, Siegfried. A proud woman will today become your heir, scoundrel! She'll give us a better hearing". Siegfried is not aware that it is to Brünnhilde that they refer. They swim off, leaving <b>a</b> <b>puzzled</b> Siegfried to ponder their words and to admit to himself that he could happily have seduced any one of them.|$|E

2500|$|If one {{had asked}} black blues fans about Johnson {{in the first}} twenty years after his death, writes Elijah Wald, [...] "the {{response}} {{in the vast majority}} of cases would have been <b>a</b> <b>puzzled</b> 'Robert who?'" [...] This lack of recognition extended to black musicians: [...] "As far as the evolution of black music goes, Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure, and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note". Columbia Records released the album King of the Delta Blues Singers, a compilation of Johnson's recordings, in 1961, which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight {{began his}} lifelong kinship with Native Americans in Devils Lake. The {{first people to}} meet and greet him as he {{stepped down from the}} {{platform}} of the train were a small band of Sioux. [...] "They were a fine healthy lot; and as the travel-worn youth with his carpet-bag and lunch basket looked about for someone from whom he might ask directions, the Chief stepped up and with extended hand, said: [...] "How cola!" [...] Half in fright and with <b>a</b> <b>puzzled</b> hand-shake, the boy made his way toward what seemed to be the white man's town. [...] He passed by a large pile of bones, and wondered what it meant. It was not many days until he was informed, for soon he found himself in full charge of the business of buying and shipping buffalo bones including the very pile which had so aroused his curiosity on arrival in the far west; for this was Indian and buffalo country then, but it proved to be the end for both shortly thereafter. It was the last year for the buffalo; and it was the last year of the happy, healthy, life for the Indians. Indians had killed his great-grandfather and carried on a war of extermination against his forebears in Pennsylvania in the old days. That kindly greeting by the old Sioux Chief quickly dispelled much of the prejudice that had filled his heart through childhood, and soon the youth began to think that Indians were not such terrible folks as Eastern people believed they were.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to rank-and-file member purges, prominent communists were purged, with some subjected to public show trials. [...] These {{were more likely}} to be instigated, and sometimes orchestrated, by the Kremlin or even Stalin, as he had done in the Moscow Trials of the Great Purge in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. They included Koçi Xoxe in Albania and Traicho Kostov in Bulgaria, who were both purged and arrested. After Kostov was executed, Bulgarian leaders sent Stalin a telegram thanking him for the help. [...] In Romania, Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu, Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca were arrested, with Pătrăşcanu being executed. [...] Stalin's NKVD emissary coordinated with Hungarian General Secretary Mátyás Rákosi and his ÁVH head the way the show trial of Hungarian Foreign Minister László Rajk, who was later executed. [...] The Rajk trials led Moscow to warn Czechoslovakia's parties that enemy agents had penetrated high into party ranks, and when <b>a</b> <b>puzzled</b> Rudolf Slánský and Klement Gottwald inquired what they could do, Stalin's NKVD agents arrived to help prepare subsequent trials. The Czechoslovakian party subsequently arrested Slánský himself, Vladimír Clementis, Ladislav Novomeský and Gustáv Husák (Clementis was later executed). Slánský and eleven others were convicted together of being [...] "Trotskyist-zionist-titoist-bourgeois-nationalist traitors" [...] in one series of show trials, after which they were executed and their ashes were mixed with material being used to fill roads on the outskirts of Prague. By the time of the Slánský trials, the Kremlin had been arguing that Israel, like Yugoslavia, had bitten the Soviet hand that had fed it, and thus the trials took an overtly anti-Semitic tone, with eleven of the fourteen defendants tried with Slánský being Jewish.|$|E

2500|$|An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had {{for many}} years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined {{notebooks}} and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged {{in a variety of}} tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's later famous Keep On Truckin' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as [...] "...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had <b>a</b> <b>puzzled</b> expression... his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as [...] "the little prince," [...] and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet." [...] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a [...] "realistic ideal". Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. [...] One [...] "most striking" [...] illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.|$|E
