40|$|Viruses are nanosized, genome-filled protein {{containers}} {{with remarkable}} thermodynamic and mechanical properties. They form by spontaneous self-assembly inside the crowded, heterogeneous cytoplasm of infected cells. Self-assembly of viruses seems {{to obey the}} principles of thermodynamically reversible self-assembly but <b>assembled</b> <b>shells</b> ('capsids') strongly resist disassembly. Following assembly, some viral shells pass through a sequence of coordinated maturation steps that progressively strengthen the capsid. Nanoindentation measurements by atomic force microscopy enable tests {{of the strength of}} individual viral capsids. They show that concepts borrowed from macroscopic materials science are surprisingly relevant to viral shells. For example, viral shells exhibit 'materials fatigue- and the theory of thin-shell elasticity can account - in part - for atomic-force-microscopy-measured force-deformation curves. Viral shells have effective Young's moduli ranging from that of polyethylene to that of plexiglas. Some of them can withstand internal osmotic pressures that are tens of atmospheres. Comparisons with thin-shell theory also shed light on nonlinear irreversible processes such as plastic deformation and failure. Finally, atomic force microscopy experiments can quantify the mechanical effects of genome encapsidation and capsid protein mutations on viral shells, providing virological insight and suggesting new biotechnological applications.

40|$|The {{investment}} casting process is an expendable mold process where wax {{patterns of the}} part and rigging are molded, <b>assembled,</b> <b>shelled</b> and melted to produce a ceramic mold matching {{the shape of the}} component to be cast. Investment casting is an important manufacturing method for critical parts because of the ability to maintain dimensional shape and tolerances. However, these tolerances can be easily exceeded if the molding components do not maintain their individual shapes well. In the {{investment casting}} process there are several opportunities for the final casting shape to not maintain the intended size and shape, such as shrinkage of the wax in the injection tool, the modification of the shape during shell heating, and with the thermal shrink and distortion in the casting process. Studies have been completed to look at the casting and shell distortions through the process in earlier phases of this project. Dr. Adrian Sabau at Oak Ridge National Labs performed characterizations and validations of 17 - 4 PH stainless steel in primarily fused silica shell systems with good agreement between analysis results and experimental data. Further tasks provided material property measurements of wax and methodology for employing a viscoelastic definition of wax materials into software. The final set of tasks involved the implementation of the findings into the commercial casting analysis software ProCAST, owned and maintained by ESI Group. This included: o the transfer of the wax material property data from its raw form into separate temperature-dependent thermophysical and mechanical property datasets o adding this wax material property data into an easily viewable and modifiable user interface within the pre-processing application of the ProCAST suite, namely PreCAST o and validating the data and viscoelastic wax model with respect to experimental result...|$|R

40|$|The {{validity}} of an onion shell model (OSM) for chondrite parent asteroids {{was assessed using}} metallographic cooling rates (MCR) derived from the compositions of metallic Fe-Ni grains.

The MCRs agreed well with cooling rates predicted by fission-track thermometry and Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages. The OSM predicts an inverse correlation between the cooling rate and the petrographic type.

40|$|Mixed-monolayer-protected gold {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} shown to have self <b>assembling</b> ligand <b>shells.</b> Given certain ligand concentrations, the NP shell can spontaneously form complex ordered domains with domain spacing as small as five angstroms. It has been proven that the solubility of NPs synthesized using a one step method is almost solely dependent on the corresponding ligand shell morphology. We have attempted to get {{a better understanding of the}} morphological differences between NPs synthesized in one step and those synthesized through place exchange by comparing their solubility characteristics. Both types NPs were functionalized using different concentrations two immiscible ligands. The place exchanged NPs almost certainly form a type of ripple shell morphology due to the presence of nonmonotonic solubility peaks in polar solvents at low hydrophilic ligand concentrations. Based on the solubility results, we conclude that the ligand shell morphology must be different for place exchanged and one step nanoparticles. The differences are most likely due to the mechanism by which place exchange populates the nanoparticles. by St. Julien Palmer Rosemond III. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Background: The carboxysome is a {{bacterial}} microcompartment {{that consists of}} a polyhedral protein shell filled with ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), the enzyme that catalyzes {{the first step of}} CO 2 fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Methodology/Principal Findings: To analyze the role of RubisCO in carboxysome biogenesis in vivo we have created a series of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus RubisCO mutants. We identified the large subunit of the enzyme as an important determinant for its sequestration into a-carboxysomes and found that the carboxysomes of H. neapolitanus readily incorporate chimeric and heterologous RubisCO species. Intriguingly, a mutant lacking carboxysomal RubisCO <b>assembles</b> empty carboxysome <b>shells</b> of apparently normal shape and composition. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that carboxysome shell architecture is not determined by the enzyme they normally sequester.
