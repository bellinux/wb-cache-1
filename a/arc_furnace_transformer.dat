Therefore, it is necessary to study and analyze the causes of these outages and design an adequate protective device. In this paper the transient overvoltage resulted from vacuum circuit breaker switching arc furnaces of El-Delta for metal and steel company connected to the Egyptian distribution network is presented and discussed. The resulted overvoltage at the circuit breaker contacts can be as high as 3. 0 p. u. While at the transformer terminals, the overvoltage reaches a high value, which can be as high as 2. 44 p. u. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis is used to analyze the overvoltage transients to determine the critical frequencies which must eliminated by the protective devices...|$|E

40|$|Corresponding author) Electric <b>Arc</b> <b>Furnaces</b> (EAFs) are unbalanced, {{nonlinear}} {{and time}} varying loads, {{which can cause}} many problems in the power system quality. As the use of <b>arc</b> <b>furnace</b> loads increases in industry, {{the importance of the}} power quality problems also increase.

In this procedure, the reactive power is measured so that maximum speed and accuracy are achieved. Finally, simulation results verify the accuracy of the load modelling and show the effectiveness of the proposed TCR/FC model for reactive compensating of the EAF...|$|R
