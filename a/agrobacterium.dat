5|$|<b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and <b>Agrobacterium,</b> {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E

25|$|The {{conjugation}} {{machinery of}} some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) {{is capable of}} transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in <b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens, which uses this system to introduce the Ti plasmid and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor). The VirB complex of <b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens is the prototypic system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens (updated {{scientific}} name Rhizobium radiobacter, synonym <b>Agrobacterium</b> radiobacter) is the causal agent of {{crown gall disease}} (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', {{not to be confused}} with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis, confusingly also called transfer RNA), from a plasmid, into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. <b>Agrobacterium</b> species live {{predominantly}} saprophytic lifestyles, so it's {{not uncommon}} even for plant parasitic species of this genus {{to survive in}} the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. <b>Agrobacterium</b> performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA in the plant's genome. More details about this process of plasmid DNA insertion are mentioned in the preceding sections. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes it to become crushed and/or distorted, ultimately leading to reduced water flow in the xylem due to crushed vessels. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the <b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.|$|E

25|$|The Ti and Ri {{plasmids}} {{are themselves}} conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or virulence, operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent <b>Agrobacteria.</b>|$|R
30|$|Transformation rate is {{critical}} {{for the success of}} a transformation system. In order to know the transformation efficiency of this protocol, three batches of experiments were tested using Ubi:eGFP vector. As can be seen in Additional file 1 : Table S 1, transformation rate varied in different batches ranging from 1.2 to 5.2  %. Normally, healthy Phal. orchid capsule contain tens of thousands tiny seeds that appear as dust. A single capsule of Phal. aphrodite can be sown on 8 – 10 agar plates of 9  cm diameter. Each plate can germinate more than 1000 protocorms for <b>Agrobacteria</b> infection. Thus, the selection is rather easy and less labor intensive. Therefore, increase initial <b>Agrobacteria</b> infected protocorms plate numbers can apparently obtain more transgenic Phal. orchid lines.|$|R
25|$|<b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment (plasmid). When <b>Agrobacterium</b> infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA {{is removed from the}} bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E
25|$|Since the Ti plasmid is {{essential}} to cause disease, prepenetration events in the rhizosphere occur to promote bacterial conjugation - exchange of plasmids amongst bacteria. In the presence of opines, A. tumefaciens produces a diffusible conjugation signal called 30C8HSL or the <b>Agrobacterium</b> autoinducer. This activates the transcription factor TraR, positively regulating the transcription of genes required for conjugation.|$|E
25|$|The disease triangle, {{consisting}} of host, environment, and pathogen, {{is an important}} concept, {{especially in regards to}} plant pathology. In this case, the pathogen is <b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens. Agrobacteria have the widest host range of any plant pathogen, so the main factor to take into consideration in the case of crown gall is environment. There are various conditions and factors that make for a conducive environment for A. tumefaciens when infecting its various hosts. For example, the bacterium requires the host plant to be wounded, as this is where the invasion occurs. Factors leading to wounds in plants include cultural practices, grafting, freezing injury, growth cracks, soil insects, and other animals in the environment causing damage to the plant. Thus, in exceptionally harsh winters, it's common to have an increased incidence of crown gall due to the weather-related damage. Along with this, there are methods of mediating infection of the host plant. For example, nematodes can act as a vector to introduce <b>Agrobacterium</b> into plant roots.|$|E
40|$|Transient {{expression}} {{systems are}} intensively {{used to study}} the transactivation potential of transcription factors and to confirm target promoters. Here we present a novel system based on the high-efficiency transformation of cultured Arabidopsis thaliana cells by <b>agrobacteria.</b> To demonstrate the potential of this system, we compared it with a commonly used protoplast transfection assay, and studied the regulation of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway genes by various transcription factors. Both systems led to comparable results on the regulation of the promoters tested. However, the agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation assay needs significantly less time, requires only mixing of cultured plant cells with <b>agrobacteria,</b> is less labour-intensive and allows handling of multiple assays in parallel, making it suitable for medium- to high-throughput analyses. In addition, the binary vectors used are the same for both cell-based assays and stable plant transformations.

50|$|Another {{transformation}} {{method for}} {{plant and animal}} cells is electroporation, which involves subjecting cells to an electric shock, which can make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. In some cases the electroporated cells will incorporate the DNA. Due to the associated cell and DNA damage, the transformation efficiency of biolistics and electroporation is lower than with <b>agrobacteria</b> and microinjection.|$|R

25|$|Agrobacterium-mediated {{transformation}} {{is the easiest}} and most simple plant transformation. Plant tissue (often leaves) are cut into small pieces, e.g. 10x10mm, and soaked for 10 minutes in a fluid containing suspended <b>Agrobacterium.</b> The bacteria will attach {{to many of the}} plant cells exposed by the cut. The plant cells secrete wound-related phenolic compounds which in turn act to upregulate the virulence operon of the <b>Agrobacterium.</b> The virulence operon includes many genes that encode for proteins that are part of a Type IV secretion system that exports from the bacterium proteins and DNA (delineated by specific recognition motifs called border sequences and excised as a single strand from the virulence plasmid) into the plant cell through a structure called a pilus. The transferred DNA (called T-DNA) is piloted to the plant cell nucleus by nuclear localization signals present in the <b>Agrobacterium</b> protein VirD2, which is covalently attached {{to the end of the}} T-DNA at the Right border (RB). Exactly how the T-DNA is integrated into the host plant genomic DNA is an active area of plant biology research. Assuming that a selection marker (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) was included in the T-DNA, the transformed plant tissue can be cultured on selective media to produce shoots. The shoots are then transferred to a different medium to promote root formation. Once roots begin to grow from the transgenic shoot, the plants can be transferred to soil to complete a normal life cycle (make seeds). The seeds from this first plant (called the T1, for first transgenic generation) can be planted on a selective (containing an antibiotic), or if an herbicide resistance gene was used, could alternatively be planted in soil, then later treated with herbicide to kill wildtype segregants. Some plants species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana can be transformed by dipping the flowers or whole plant, into a suspension of <b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens, typically strain C58 (C=Cherry, 58=1958, the year in which this particular strain of A. tumefaciens was isolated from a cherry tree in an orchard at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York). Though many plants remain recalcitrant to transformation by this method, research is ongoing that continues to add to the list the species that have been successfully modified in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{used since}} 1998, iminodisuccinic (IDS) acid biodegrades about 80% after only 7 days.

Specifically, IDS is degraded {{through the use of}} IDS-epimerase and C–N lyase found in <b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens (BY6) which can be harvested on a large scale. Additionally, the reactions catalyzed by both enzymes do not require any cofactors and can thus be applied directly.|$|E
25|$|Several tobacco {{plants have}} been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from N. tabacum {{cultivar}} 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant cytology.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an efficient, versatile, and user-friendly viral engineering and expression system {{that is based on}} in planta assembly of functional viral vectors from separate pro-vector modules. With this new system, instead of supplying a plant cell with a complete viral vector as a mature viral particle, an RNA or a linear DNA molecule, we use <b>agrobacteria</b> to deliver various modules that are assembled inside the cell {{with the help of a}} site-specific recombinase. The resulting DNA is transcribed, and undesired elements such as recombination sites are spliced out, generating a fully functional RNA replicon.

25|$|A study {{published}} in 2015 by scientists from Ghent University and the International Potato Center found that the genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from <b>Agrobacterium,</b> with genes being actively expressed by the plants. The discovery of the transgenes was made while performing metagenomic analysis of the sweet potato genome for viral diseases. Transgenes were observed both in the sweet potato's closely related wild relatives, and also were found in more distantly related wild species. This observation makes cultivated sweet potatoes the first known example of a naturally transgenic food crop.|$|E
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} fixing Rhizobia are {{an interesting}} case, wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the <b>Agrobacterium</b> Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories {{for the production of}} opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.|$|E
25|$|Biological control {{methods are}} also {{utilized}} in managing this disease. In the 1970's and 1980's, A commonly used practice for treating germinated seeds, seedlings, and rootstock was to soak the plant parts in a suspension of K84, a related but not pathogenic species of <b>Agrobacterium,</b> A. radiobacter. K84 produces a bacteriocin (agrocin 84) {{which is an}} antiobiotic specific against related bacteria, including A. tumefaciens.This method, which was successful at controlling the disease on a commercial scale, had the risk of K84 transferring its resistance gene to the pathogenic Agrobacteria. Thus, in the 1990's, use of a genetically engineering strain of K84, known as K-1026, was created. This strain is just as successful in controlling crown gall as K84 without the caveat of resistance gene transfer.|$|E

40|$|Background: Ferns, being {{vascular}} yet seedless, present unparalleled {{opportunities to}} investigate important ques‑ tions regarding the evolution {{and development of}} land plants. Ceratopteris richardii, a diploid, homosporous fern has been advanced as a model fern system; however, the tenuous ability to transform the genome of this fern greatly limited its usefulness as a model organism. Here we report a simple and reliable Agrobacterium‑mediated method for generating transient and stable transformants of mature C. richardii gametophytes. Results: Transformation success was achieved by enzyme treatment that partially digested the cell walls of mature gametophytes to facilitate <b>Agrobacteria</b> infection. Co‑incubation of <b>Agrobacteria</b> with enzymatically treated gameto‑ phytes was sufficient to generate transient transformants at a frequency of nearly 90 % under optimal conditions. Sta‑ ble transformation was achieved {{at a rate of}} nearly 3 % by regenerating entire gametophytes from single transformed cells from T 0 gametophytes on selective media. Conclusions: This transformation method will allow for the immediate observation of phenotypes in the haploid gametophytes of transformed plants, as well as the generation of stably transformed C. richardii lines for further analysis. Transformation capability will greatly facilitate gene functional studies in C. richardii, more fully realizing the potential of this model fern species.

25|$|Crown gall disease {{caused by}} <b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens can be {{controlled}} via {{a variety of different}} methods. The best means of control for this disease is by taking preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools if these tools are used on infected trees and shrubs, performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields. Another useful practice is to avoid wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation, such as budding and not grafting plants, since wounds are the main means of bacterial entry. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial ABC {{transporters}} {{are essential}} in cell viability, virulence, and pathogenicity. Iron ABC uptake systems, for example, are important effectors of virulence. Pathogens use siderophores, such as Enterobactin, to scavenge iron {{that is in}} complex with high-affinity iron-binding proteins or erythrocytes. These are high-affinity iron-chelating molecules that are secreted by bacteria and reabsorb iron into iron-siderophore complexes. The chvE-gguAB gene in <b>Agrobacterium</b> tumefaciens encodes glucose and galactose importers that are also associated with virulence. Transporters are extremely vital in cell survival such that they function as protein systems that counteract any undesirable change occurring in the cell. For instance, a potential lethal increase in osmotic strength is counterbalanced by activation of osmosensing ABC transporters that mediate uptake of solutes. Other than functioning in transport, some bacterial ABC proteins are also involved in the regulation of several physiological processes.|$|E
25|$|Mahyco {{licensed}} {{and used}} the cry1Ac gene obtained from Monsanto and two supporting genes (nptII and aad). The cry1Ac gene is under the transcriptional control of an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter, which ensures the gene is expressed in all the brinjal's tissue throughout its complete life cycle. NptII and aad are selectable marker genes, nptII is used to identify transgenic plants from non-transgenic, and aad is used to identify the transformed bacteria used during {{the development of the}} construct. Aad contains a bacterial promoter and is not expressed in the Bt brinjal. The completed construct was inserted into young cotyledons from the brinjal plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated technique. <b>Agrobacterium</b> naturally inserts DNA into plants from its Ti plasmid, and scientists use this to insert genes of interest into various plants. The transformed plants were regenerated and analyzed for the presence of the gene through Southern blotting. The plants' progeny were also analyzed to identify lines segregating in a Mendelian fashion.|$|E

50|$|In plants the DNA is {{generally}} inserted using Agrobacterium-mediated recombination, {{taking advantage of}} the <b>Agrobacteriums</b> T-DNA sequence that allows natural insertion of genetic material into plant cells. Another method is biolistics, where particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos. Another transformation method for plant and animal cells is electroporation. This involves subjecting the cell to an electric shock, which can make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. Due to the damage caused to the cells and DNA the transformation efficiency of biolistics and electroporation is lower than agrobacterial mediated transformation and microinjection.|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of opines from 43 naturally occurring crown gall tumors on several plant species was analyzed {{for the presence}} of agropine, chrysopine, iminodiacid, an unidentified leucinopine-like iminodiacid (IDA-B), mannopine, octopine, nopaline, DL- and LL-succinamopine, leucinopine and heliopine. Opine utilization patterns of <b>agrobacteria</b> and fluorescent pseudomonads resident in a tumor were then analyzed and compared for agreement with the opine isolated from that tumor. Nopaline was the most common opine found and was detected in tumors from cherry, blackberry, grape, and plum. Octopine was not found, although octopine-catabolizing bacteria were isolated from several tumors. A new, previously undescribed iminodiacid of the succinamopine-leucinopine type (provisionally designated IDA-B) was isolated from tumors of wild blackberry. Field tumors from apple, blueberry and grape yielded no detectable opines, even though opine-utilizing bacteria were present. Bacterial isolates from plum and cherry showed the best correspondence between the opine in tumors (nopaline) and the presence of bacteria that catabolized that opine. However, several unusual opine catabolic combinations were identified, including isolates that catabolized a variety of opines but were nonpathogenic. More variability was observed among isolates from field tumors on the remaining plant species. We isolated novel mannopine-nopaline type <b>agrobacteria</b> from field tumors of cherry, plum and blackberry that induced tumors containing either mannopine (plus agropine) or nopaline, but not both.
