That is, the ailerons are used primarily to directly roll the wings, and the rudder is used to [...] "coordinate" [...] (to keep the sideslip angle near-zero during the rolling motion).

50|$|The {{geometry}} of most aileron linkages can be configured {{so as to}} bias the travel further upward than downward. By excessively deflecting the upward aileron, profile drag is increased rather than reduced and separation drag further aids in producing drag on the inside wing, producing a yaw force {{in the direction of}} the turn. Though not as efficient as rudder mixing, aileron differential is very easy to implement on almost any airplane and offers the significant advantage of reducing the tendency for the wing to stall at the tip first by limiting the downward <b>aileron</b> <b>deflection</b> and its associated effective increase in angle of attack.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{is used on}} rudders, elevators and ailerons, with methods refined over the years. Two illustrations of aircraft rudders, published by Flight Magazine in 1920, illustrate early forms, both with curved leading and trailing edges. Both are mounted so that {{the area of the}} balancing surface ahead of the hinge is less than that of the rudder behind. Various layouts have been tried over the years, generally with smaller balance/rudder areas. Most fall into one of two categories: horn balanced, with small extensions of the control surfaces ahead of the hinge lines at their tips, or inset balanced with extension(s) of the control surface into cut-outs in their supporting fixed surface. Frise ailerons use a variant of the latter balance, with the nose of the up-going surface projecting below the wing, but not vice versa, to provide both balancing and asymmetric drag. Irving balanced ailerons have no projections but harness the <b>aileron</b> <b>deflection</b> induced change of pressure above and below the wing, sensed via the hinge gap, to assist the motion.|$|E

50|$|By careful {{design of}} the {{mechanical}} linkages, the up aileron {{can be made to}} deflect more than the down aileron (e.g., US patent 1565097). This helps reduce the likelihood of a wing tip stall when <b>aileron</b> <b>deflections</b> are made at high angles of attack. The idea is that the loss of lift associated with the up aileron carries no penalty while the increase in lift associated with the down aileron is minimized. The rolling couple on the aircraft is always the difference in lift between the two wings. A designer at de Havilland invented a simple and practical linkage and their de Havilland Tiger Moth classic British biplane became one of the best-known aircraft, and one of the earliest, to use differential ailerons.|$|R
