30|$|Network {{theory has}} been tremendously {{successful}} in simplifying and understanding complex biological systems (Wang 2011). Previous attempts to understand various diseases through network system biology approach have revealed deep insight into complex diseases (Barabási <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2011; Cho et al. 2012; Furlong 2013; Wang <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2012; Draghici <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2007). Few of these studies entails that various types of cancers are interlinked to each other through few pathways as well as these common pathways {{are found to be}} altered among different diseases (Goh <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2007). Further analysis of centrosome (a cellular organelle) dysfunction under the network theory framework reveals the importance of highly connected proteins (hubs) as well as those proteins connected with these hub proteins (Pujana <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2007; Chuang <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2007). Network studies pertaining to epigenetic modifications, gene regulations, gene expressions, PPI’s provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease. Additionally, these network studies helped in finding functionally important proteins {{as well as some of}} the missing pathways in cancer (Wang <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2012; AlQuraishi <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2014; Kar <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2009; Jonsson <b>and</b> Bates 2006). Essentially, these network studies provided a global understanding to biological processes and protein interactions (Barabási <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2011; Goh <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2007; Creixell <b>and</b> et <b>al.</b> 2015; Califano 2014).|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundBiofilms are surface-associated {{microbial}} {{communities with}} significant environmental and medical impact. Here, {{we focus on}} an adherence mechanism that permits biofilm formation by Candida albicans, the major invasive fungal pathogen of humans. ResultsThe Als surface-protein family has been implicated in biofilm formation, and we show that <b>Als</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Als</b> 3 have critical but redundant roles. Overexpression of several other Als proteins permits biofilm formation in a biofilm-defective als 1 /als 1 als 3 /als 3 strain, thus arguing that the function of Als proteins in this process is governed by their respective expression levels. The surface protein Hwp 1 is also required for biofilm formation, and we find that a mixture of biofilm-defective hwp 1 /hwp 1 <b>and</b> <b>als</b> 1 /als 1 als 3 /als 3 strains can form a hybrid biofilm both in vitro and in vivo in a catheter infection model. Complementary function of Hwp 1 <b>and</b> <b>Als</b> 1 <b>and</b> 3 seems to reflect their interaction because expression of Hwp 1 in the heterologous host S. cerevisiae permits adherence to wild-type C. albicans, but not to an als 1 /als 1 als 3 /als 3 strain. ConclusionsThe complementary roles of Hwp 1 <b>and</b> <b>Als</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Als</b> 3 in biofilm formation are analogous to the roles of sexual agglutinins in mating reactions. This analogy suggests that biofilm-adhesin complementarity may promote formation of monospecies biofilms...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium (Al) rhizotoxicity {{coincides with}} low pH; however, {{it is unclear}} whether plant {{tolerance}} to these two factors is controlled by the same mechanism. To address this question, the Al-resistant alr 104 mutant, two Al-sensitive mutants (<b>als</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>als</b> 5), <b>and</b> wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana were compared in long-term exposure (solution culture) and in short-term exposure experiments (H+ and K+ fluxes, rhizosphere pH, and plasma membrane potential, Em). Based on biomass accumulation, <b>als</b> 5 <b>and</b> alr 104 showed tolerance to low pH, whereas alr 104 was tolerant to the combined low-pH/Al treatment. The sensitivity of the <b>als</b> 5 <b>and</b> <b>als</b> 3 mutants to the Al stress was similar. The Al-induced decrease in H+ influx at the distal elongation zone (DEZ) and Al-induced H+ efflux at the mature zone (MZ) were higher in the Al-sensitive mutants (<b>als</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>als</b> 5) than in the wild type and the alr 104 mutant. Under combined low-pH/Al treatment, alr 104 and the wild type had depolarized plasma membranes for the entire 30 [*]min measurement period, whereas in the Al-sensitive mutants (<b>als</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>als</b> 5), initial depolarization to around – 60 [*]mV became hyperpolarization at – 110 [*]mV after 20 [*]min. At the DEZ, the Em changes corresponded to the changes in K+ flux: K+ efflux was higher in alr 104 and the wild type than in the <b>als</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>als</b> 5 mutants. In conclusion, Al tolerance in the alr 104 mutant correlated with Em depolarization, higher K+ efflux, and higher H+ influx, which led to a more alkaline rhizosphere under the combined low-pH/Al stress. Low-pH tolerance (als 5) was linked to higher H+ uptake under low-pH stress, which was abolished by Al exposure...|$|R
