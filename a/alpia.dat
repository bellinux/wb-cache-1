Anise and the Association made news in 2001 after they publicly denounced NBC-TV's First Years, a television show that documented the life of first-year lawyers. The show was later cancelled after the first season. Anise founded I Love My Lawyer Day, a day of [...] "no lawyer bashing" [...] and lawyer appreciation that takes place on the 1st Friday of November each year.

U projektu su sudjelovali partneri iz Slovenije i Hrvatske, a između ostalih aktivnosti u kojima je sudjelovao, Hrvatski restauratorski zavod proveo je i arheološka istraživanja u sklopu kojih je izvedena dokumentacija LiDAR tehnologijom, arheološka rekognosciranja terena, arheološka sondiranja i geofizikalna mjerenja. Zahvaljujući provedenim aktivnostima, načinjena je najdetaljnija snimka dijelova ostataka toga obrambenog sustava do sada, definirane su dvije do sada nepoznate obrambene kule, locirana trasa prometnice koja se pružala kroz dolinu Mlake i detektirana još jedna potencijalna, do sada nepoznata utvrda na položaju Deuce kod Prezida. The {{defensive}} system {{known as}} Claustra <b>Alpia</b> Iularium {{is one of}} the largest and most complex monuments of Late Antiquity in Croatia. This remarkably spacious defense zone stretches also into the territory of neighboring Slovenia. Its strategic importance at the time it was operating surpassed the local boundaries in much the same way as it does today. Unfortunately, the raising of public and even professionals’ awareness about the significance of this defensive system is – despite many centuries of interest for its remains and a century of research – still in its very beginning. So it was with the aim of collecting new information about the system and developing public awareness of its importance that in 2015 the project Claustra – Stone Barriers of the Roman Empire was realized. This was an international project in which the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Slovenia took part as the leading partner, collaborating with the Croatian Conservation Institute, the National Museum of Slovenia, the Žmergo Association from Opatija and the Primorje–Gorski Kotar County. The project was financed by the IPA Croatia – Slovenia programme. The cultural heritage of the Claustra <b>Alpia</b> Iularium system represents for us principally a spacious archaeological zone, and with few historical records it is the archaeological research that is our primary source of information on when the system originated and how it operated, as well as about the principle by which it functioned. It was for this reason that the Croatian Conservation Institute, among its other activities on the project conducted a series of archaeological investigations aimed at finding and documenting thus far unknown Portions of the system, defining the academic and research potential of this monument, and collecting information on its existing condition that are necessary in order to draw up a better conservation study and management plan. Because of its specific character, pertaining to a very large area it occupies and dense vegetation that covers it, in the course of research some contemporary non-destructive methods of documentation were used, such as LiDAR or GPR imaging, in addition to traditional archaeological methods such as probing or survey. Thanks to the activities conducted, a most detailed image so far has been made of the remains of the defensive system; two thus far unknown defensive towers have been located, as well as a road that stretched across the valley of Mlaka, while another potential fortification has been located at the site of Deuce near Prezid. The research also confirmed that there is a great deal of questions yet to be answered, and pointed to a need for further research in order for us to better understand this complex defensive system. In addition, the project confirmed and asserted the view that the whole system of Claustra should be seen as a single monument and treated uniformly across its entire spanning area. Therefore, it is important to carry on with the collaboration initiated by this project between the institutions in charge from both countries, and in the future include all relevant institutions, units of local government, organizations and individuals in order to be able to better manage the Claustra heritage through coordinated procedures and activities. This indeed is the only way for the public to begin appreciating the Claustra as a monument whose importance and manifold value far surpass our state or regional borders...|$|E

Trata de uma pesquisa histórica que tem por objetivo {{investigar}} a história da alfabetização de surdos no Espírito Santo, nas décadas de 1950 a 1970, a partir da tese inicial de que a educação/alfabetização de crianças surdas, no Espírito Santo, nesse período, tinha por finalidade ensinar a língua nacional, por meio da oralização, tendo em vista o projeto desenvolvimentista adotado pelo então Presidente da República, Juscelino Kubistchek. Fundamenta-se nas concepções de Marc Bloch (2001), ao considerar a História como a ciência dos homens no tempo, com o objetivo de compreender a ação humana, de acordo com as condições históricas de sua época, e nas contribuições da concepção bakhtiniana de linguagem, em especial, no conceito de texto como enunciado, {{considerando que}} cada texto/documento traz em seu bojo uma história vivida por sujeitos em dado contexto social e histórico. Nessa direção, a partir da análise de documentos escolares, textos jornalísticos, cartilhas, materiais pedagógicos e documentos oficiais, o trabalho se estruturou no sentido de conhecer o contexto nacional que deu origem às primeiras iniciativas de descentralização na educação de surdos, culminando com a criação de salas especiais em vários Estados brasileiros, incluindo o Espírito Santo. As repercussões, em âmbito local, foram analisadas a partir de dois eixos. No primeiro, focalizaram os aspectos políticos, evidenciando que a desresponsabilização do Poder Público facilitou a parceria entre a esfera pública e a esfera privada na configuração das classes especiais, dentro das escolas comuns. No segundo, destacaram que o Método Oral e o Método Perdoncini, que fundamentaram o processo de alfabetização e que tinham como finalidade ensinar a língua oficial do País, na modalidade oral, dialogaram com as concepções pedagógicas e psicológicas da época, tornando o processo claramente escolar. Conclui que o período foi marcado por um projeto educacional consistente e coerente com os postulados da época, tendo na ação responsável e polifônica da professora <b>Álpia</b> Couto-Lenzi a sua principal interlocutora. This work integrates a research group {{developed by the}} line of research Education and Languages belonging to the Post-Graduation Program of the Espírito Santo State Federal University. It is about a historic research that aims at investigating the history of literacy of the deaf in the State of Espírito Santo, from 1950 to 1970, based on the initial thesis that education/literacy of the deaf children, in Espírito Santo, in that period, had the purpose to teach the national language through oralization, owing to the developmental project adopted by the Federal President, Juscelino Kubistchek. The work is based on Marc Bloch (2001) conceptions, by considering the History as the science of men in time, with the purpose to understand the human action according to the historic conditions of that time and on {{the contribution of the}} Bakhtin conceptions of language, specially, the text concept as enunciation, taking into consideration that each text/document brings in its central a history lived by subjects in a certain social and historical context. This way, from the analysis of school documents, journalistic texts, booklets, pedagogical materials and official documents, the work is structured in the sense of understanding the national context that gave rise to the first initiations of decentralization concerning the education of the deaf, culminating with the creation of special classes in several Brazilian states, including Espírito Santo. The repercussions, in local ambit, were analyzed from two axes. In the first one, the political aspects were analyzed, highlighting that the Government disclaimer favored the partnership between the public sphere and the private one in the configuration of the special classes, within the regular schools. The second one stood out that the Oral Method and the Perdoncini Method, which rooted the literacy process and aimed at teaching the country’s official language, regarding the oral modality, dialogued with the pedagogical and psychological conception of that time, making the process clearly educational. The work concludes that the period was marked by an educational project considered consistent and coherent with the postulates of that time, having in the responsible and polyphonic action of the Teacher <b>Álpia</b> Couto-Lenzi its main interlocutor...|$|E
