For repeater is used on the Khatulistiwa Plaza does not affect the measurement of RSCP and Ec/No, only affect the measurement throughput, this indicates that the repeater does not work optimally, {{based on the results of}} the analysis of this is because the repeater is used Repeater RD- 1840 works at a frequency of GSM 1800 MHz, while the frequency of the transmitter Node B to the 3 G network is 2100 MHz, it is recommended that you should use the repeater SP- 2110, SP- 2100 because the repeater is working on WCDMA 2100 MHz frequency...|$|E
