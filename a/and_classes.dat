Ain't is used throughout the United Kingdom, with its geographical distribution increasing over time. It is also {{found throughout the}} United States, including in Appalachia, the South, New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Upper Midwest. In its geographical ubiquity, ain't is to be contrasted with other folk usages such as y'all, which is confined to the South region of the United States.|$|E
5|$|An aspect weaver is a metaprogramming utility for aspect-oriented {{languages}} {{designed to}} take instructions specified by aspects (isolated representations of a significant concepts in a program) and generate the final implementation code. The weaver integrates aspects into the locations specified by the software as a pre-compilation step. By merging aspects <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> (representations {{of the structure of}} entities in the program), the weaver generates a woven class.|$|E
5|$|At the {{affected}} college all lessons were cancelled {{for the remainder}} of the week, <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> were relocated to a temporary facility. The town's other schools remained open. A candlelight vigil was held near the school grounds on the day after the shooting, and Kauhajoki Church held a memorial service on the evening of September 23. The Finnish Red Cross announced that some of the proceeds from its annual fund drive would be contributed towards helping students and teachers affected by the incident.|$|E
50|$|ČD <b>Class</b> 163.2 <b>and</b> some ZSSK <b>Class</b> 163 {{locomotives}} were rebuilt from ČD <b>and</b> ZSSK <b>Class</b> 162. This {{was caused}} by lack of fast dual system locomotives as only one Class 362 locomotive was built. This situation solved ČD by switching the bogies between locomotives of ČD Class 363 (same as ŽSR/ZSSK <b>Class</b> 363) <b>and</b> <b>Class</b> 162, ŽSR by switching only the speed-change box <b>and</b> axletrees between <b>Class</b> 363 <b>and</b> <b>Class</b> 162. After that procedure, the locomotives were classified ČD <b>and</b> ŽSR/ZSSK <b>Class</b> 362 <b>and</b> ČD <b>Class</b> 163.2 <b>and</b> ŽSR/ZSSK <b>Class</b> 163.|$|R

In 1971 the area of the campus was expanded by , more than doubling its size, to accommodate the move of the School of Medical Sciences, until then located across several buildings in Campinas, to the new campus. This expansion saw the construction of a massive public hospital, the Hospital das Clínicas (HC), which began serving the public in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Double {{standards}} between genders <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> {{are exposed}} throughout the novella. Odysseus commits adultery with Circe while expecting Penelope to remain loyal to him. The maids' {{relations with the}} suitors are seen as treasonous and earn them an execution. Penelope condemns Helen for her involvement in getting men killed at Troy. At the same time, Penelope excuses her involvement in getting the maids killed even though, as Atwood reveals, Penelope enlisted the maids to spy on the suitors and even encouraged them to continue after some were raped.|$|E

During World War II, enrollment declined to only five graduates between 1943 and 1945, <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> were moved to the undergraduate library as the United States Navy used Gatke Hall. In 1946, enrollment rebounded with a total of 92 students, the largest student body {{of the law}} school up to that date.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the lines operation, the Prussian Locomotives T9, G8, and G10 were used. Later the Reichsbahn <b>Class</b> 50 <b>and</b> <b>Class</b> 52 were used and for passenger service the Class 38 (Prussian P8) <b>and</b> <b>Class</b> 23 were used. After that DB railbuses <b>Class</b> 795 <b>and</b> <b>Class</b> 798 were used for passenger traffic. After 1975 the military trains used the Diesel Locomotives <b>Class</b> 218 <b>and</b> BR 211/212. Today the DB <b>Class</b> 232 <b>and</b> <b>Class</b> 290 are used.|$|R

5|$|In {{its first}} year, the AES counted 1 million {{attendees}} at its lectures <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> held throughout Australia and vicinity. By {{the end of}} the war, 10 million had attended its classes and 64,000 had enrolled in correspondence courses. The AES staff had given 150,000 lectures, presented 31,000 recitals, and shown 3,200 films. Libraries established by the service held 750,000 books. Circulation of the service's journal, Salt, reached 250,000. The service also published a second periodical, the Current Affairs Bulletin, which was distributed to officers for use as a source for lectures on current affairs.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{generating}} {{a set of}} woven source code, some AspectJ weavers instead weave the aspects <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> together directly into bytecode, acting both as the aspect weaver and compiler. While {{it is expected that}} the performance of aspect weavers which also perform the compilation process will require more computation time due to the weaving process involved. However, the bytecode weaving process produces more efficient runtime code than would usually be achieved through compiled woven source.|$|E
5|$|Street Dance Kemp Europe (SDK Europe) is a {{competition}} and dance convention founded in 2004 in Jedovnice, Czech Republic.

Daytime hours are reserved primarily for dance workshops <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> taught by an international pool of instructors; competitive events are held at night. All of the classes, workshops, and competitive events are held outside and—although hotels or cottages are an option—many participants stay in tents and camp outside on the SDK event grounds.|$|E

5|$|The Brooklyn Free School is a private, ungraded, {{democratic}} free {{school in}} Fort Greene, Brooklyn, founded in 2004. Students {{range in age}} from 4 to 18 years old. The school follows the noncoercive philosophy of the 1960s/70s free school movement schools, which encourages self-directed learning and protects child freedom of activity. There are no grades, no tests, <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> are non-compulsory. As of 2015, the school enrolls 80 students and has about 24 graduates.|$|E
5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups <b>and</b> <b>classes</b> persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E

More recent studies have placed this group near section Bryastrum, so it is placed there below. Also of note, the placement of the section Regiae in relation to Aldrovanda and Dionaea is uncertain. Since the section Drosera is polyphyletic, it shows up multiple times in the cladogram (*).|$|E
