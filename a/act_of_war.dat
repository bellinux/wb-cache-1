5|$|The {{whaleboat}} {{managed to}} rendezvous with Catalpa the following day, which then {{headed out to}} sea. They were chased by the steamship SS Georgette, which had been commandeered by the colonial governor. Though Georgette {{caught up with the}} whaler on 19 April, Catalpa master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on Catalpa would be considered an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson, sent {{a request for}} provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating {{the gravity of the}} crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.|$|E

5|$|Manuel's {{attention}} was again drawn to Antioch in 1156, when Raynald of Châtillon, the new Prince of Antioch, {{claimed that the}} Byzantine emperor had reneged on his promise to pay him a sum of money and vowed to attack the Byzantine province of Cyprus. Raynald arrested {{the governor of the}} island, John Komnenos, who was a nephew of Manuel, and the general Michael Branas. The Latin historian William of Tyre deplored this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> against fellow Christians and described the atrocities committed by Raynald's men in considerable detail. Having ransacked the island and plundered all its wealth, Raynald's army mutilated the survivors before forcing them to buy back their flocks at exorbitant prices with what little they had left. Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years, the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home.* T. F. Madden, The New Concise History of the Crusades, 65 Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor.|$|E
5|$|The three {{beings are}} {{discovered}} to be reptilian humanoids, {{and in a}} scuffle, they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the beings are {{a new form of}} Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; {{she is a member of}} the warrior caste, awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{initiating}} the war, Argentina had not prepared {{a plan for}} the subsequent defence of the islands. The military dictatorship that governed the country at the time regarded the seizure of the Falklands as a political act to obtain a diplomatic bargaining position, and not as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Consequently they were taken by surprise when the British responded with a large-scale mobilization, and a task force to retake the islands.|$|E
25|$|The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to make {{a proper}} declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations. Thus, surprise attacks are illegal under the Islamic jurisprudence.

25|$|Early on 19 April the refuelled and now {{heavily armed}} Georgette {{returned}} and came alongside the whaler, demanding {{the surrender of}} the prisoners and attempting to herd the ship back into Australian waters.

The Volunteers therefore changed their name, in August, to the Irish Republican Army. In this way the 1918 elections led to the outbreak of the Anglo-Irish War, giving the impression that the election sanctioned the war.|$|E
