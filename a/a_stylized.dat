On January 6, 2015, the Provo City Council unanimously selected the city's new flag, a new design that incorporated the city's new logo (adopted in 2012).|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Shepseskare continued {{the construction of the}} funerary complex of his predecessor. As Neferefre had died after a short reign, his pyramid complex was far from finished and neither the burial chamber nor the mortuary temple had been built. The planned pyramid was thus hastily changed into a square mastaba representing <b>a</b> <b>stylized</b> primeval hill and the accompanying mortuary temple was completed during the reign of Nyuserre.|$|E

5|$|Snowflakes {{are also}} {{often used as}} symbols {{representing}} winter or cold conditions. For example, snow tires which enhance traction during harsh winter driving conditions are labelled with a snowflake on the mountain symbol. <b>A</b> <b>stylized</b> snowflake {{has been part of}} the emblem of the 1968 Winter Olympics, 1972 Winter Olympics, 1988 Winter Olympics, 1998 Winter Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} {{animated}} in <b>a</b> <b>stylized</b> way, which Tartakovsky says {{was influenced by}} the Merrie Melodies cartoon The Dover Boys at Pimento University. Dexter's Laboratory, however, was staged in a cinematic way, rather than flat and close to the screen, to leave space and depth for the action and gags. Tartakovsky was also influenced by other Warner Bros. cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, Japanese mecha anime, and the UPA shorts.|$|E

5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents <b>a</b> <b>stylized</b> example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>stylized</b> {{flower of}} a Hippeastrum {{cultivar}} (under its common name of amaryllis) is used internationally {{as a symbol}} for organizations associated with Huntington's disease, a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system. The widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant. The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth {{and development of the}} Huntington's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.|$|E
5|$|As a {{particularly}} conspicuous forest flower, T. grandiflorum was designated the provincial emblem of Ontario in 1937 (Flora Emblem Act), {{and as the}} state wild flower of Ohio in 1987. As a symbol of Ontario, <b>a</b> <b>stylized</b> trillium flower features prominently on the official flag of the province's French-speaking community. It is also frequently used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority to represent Ontario in grants of arms. Although a network of laws make picking wildflowers illegal in the province on any Crown or provincially owned land, it is not, unlike widely believed, specifically illegal (or necessarily harmful) to pick the species in Ontario.|$|E

5|$|Pedra da Gávea is a {{mountain}} in Tijuca Forest, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Differential weathering {{on one side}} of the rock has created what is described as <b>a</b> <b>stylized</b> human face. Markings on another face of the rock have been described as an inscription. Some individuals, such as Bernardo de Azevedo da Silva Ramos, have advanced the position that the inscription is of Phoenician origin and possibly proof of pre-Columbian contact from Old World cultures. Alternative theories proposed include that the rock was the site of a Viking colony or that it is connected with suspected UFO activity.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, <b>a</b> <b>stylized</b> version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite {{the adoption}} of an official seal, the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.|$|E
5|$|Ramboasalamarazaka {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in his father's Zafimamy court at Ikaloy. There {{he received a}} traditional education, including mastery of fanorona, a local board game believed to develop intelligence {{and the ability to}} think strategically. Young nobles being groomed for leadership roles typically learned to perform kabary (<b>a</b> <b>stylized</b> form of public address), including the judicious use of ohabolana (proverbs) to persuasively make a point. Young Merina princes also often learned to play the valiha, a bamboo tube zither then reserved for Merina and Zafimamy nobles. Around the age of 12, Ramboasalamarazaka continued his education under the supervision of his grandfather, King Andriambelomasina, at Amboatany and the royal court in Ambohimanga.|$|E
5|$|Tech Tower is {{considered}} an iconic representation of Georgia Tech and {{of higher education in}} Atlanta. It is often featured in marketing materials and merchandise for the Institute and its silhouette is recognized throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Tower, Georgia Tech's undergraduate research journal, is named after Tech Tower. Kessler Campanile, <b>a</b> <b>stylized</b> bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide branding campaign in the mid-1990s, was designed to look like a modernized version of Tech Tower. The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself would be a more appropriate symbol.|$|E
