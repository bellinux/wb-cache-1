40|$|Introduction: This report {{provides}} {{a description of}} resource exploration, the role of governments, and examines the exploration licencing process. It summarises the regulatory approvals that explorers are required to obtain in order to undertake mineral and energy resource exploration, specifically in relation to land access, Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage, environment and public geoscience information. It also assesses non-financial barriers relating to workforce issues — labour skills, workplace relations and workplace health and safety. Key points: 	Mineral and energy resource exploration in Australia is {{a small part of}} the economy, equivalent to 0. 5 per cent of GDP in 2011 - 12. The sector 2 ̆ 7 s significance is in discovering commercially valuable resources that sustain the operations of mineral and energy extraction industries — which represented 9 per cent of GDP in 2011 - 12. 	The number, size and quality of resource discoveries in Australia is declining over the longer term, and the exploration sector is experiencing rising costs and lower productivity. 	Governments regulate resource exploration for three broad reasons: 	 		the mineral and energy resources are owned by the Crown 		exploration may impact on existing and future land uses such as agriculture, or damage sites of environmental and heritage significance 		exploration may have effects beyond the area being explored, such as on the regional environment and nearby communities. 	 	 	Many stakeholders are dissatisfied with the current regulatory arrangements: 	 		some explorers claim that governments are discouraging exploration by increasing compliance costs, extending approval times and increasing regulatory uncertainty 		some community groups claim that regulations are insufficient to protect heritage, environmental and community values and agricultural uses of the land, and that regulators are not being sufficiently diligent in protecting those values and land uses. 	 	 	Regulatory processes that impose unnecessary burdens on resource explorers or inhibit exploration can be reformed by: 	 		ensuring stronger and simpler coordination, transparency and accountability of exploration licence approval processes 		making land access decisions that take into account the benefits of exploration to the wider community, and that are appropriate to the level of risk posed by exploration as informed by sound evidence 		improving access to the existing knowledge of Indigenous heritage and <b>accrediting</b> <b>state</b> and territory government processes which meet Australian Government standards of Indigenous heritage protection 		addressing state, territory and Commonwealth environmental approvals processes that are duplicative and are not commensurate with the risk and significance of the environmental impacts of exploration. 	 	 	Explorers highly regard the accessibility and provision of pre-competitive data by Australia 2 ̆ 7 s geological survey organisations. However, the effectiveness of state and territory geological survey organisations is hampered because significant shares of their budgets are from short-term funding initiatives...|$|E

The meanings of autonomy and accountability of the USNY’s overseas campuses are far more complex and hybrid than those within the U.

40|$|ASEE 2009 Science and {{engineering}} (S&E) are two disciplines {{that are highly}} receptive to the changes in demand for products and services. These disciplines can either be leading in nature, viz., they create the demand in the market (push) for new products and/or services, or can adopt the changes caused by the varying market conditions (pull). Regardless of the reason, both science {{and engineering}} {{have the responsibility to}} be compatible with the emerging needs of the market. This fact is also true for the institutions awarding science and engineering degrees. Such higher education institutions also require continuous monitoring and evaluation to be able to remain competitive in the educational arena. Generally, educational institutions are evaluated for their (i) academic affairs, and (2) administrative and financial operations. Academic affairs are monitored by outside authorities such as professional <b>accrediting</b> agencies, <b>State</b> Departments of Higher Education, and the regional accrediting bodies (i. e., NEASC), whereas outcome assessment for administrative and financial operations are handled by the Board of Trustees and the regional accrediting body. In addition, educational institutions also have internal assessment processes conducted to (1) ensure the ability to meet and/or exceed the national educational standards, (2) to be compatible with the mission and vision statements of the organization, and (3) to guarantee the continuous improvement of students, academic and administrative personnel. This internal assessment process embodies a broad spectrum of performance criteria such as curriculum development and revision, contributions to the literature, ethnicity/gender profiles, budget allocation, and student and personnel development. Therefore, several factors that are tangible and intangible in nature have to be considered during internal reviews, thus creating a complex problem environment for the evaluators/decision makers.

In 1940, and {{until the end of}} World War II, Bakhtin lived in Moscow, where he submitted a dissertation on François Rabelais to the Gorky Institute of World Literature to obtain a postgraduate title, a dissertation that could not be defended until the war ended. In 1946 and 1949, the defense of this dissertation divided the scholars of Moscow into two groups: those official opponents guiding the defense, who accepted the original and unorthodox manuscript, and those other professors who were against the manuscript’s acceptance. The book's earthy, anarchic topic was the cause of many arguments that ceased only when the government intervened. Ultimately, Bakhtin was denied a higher doctoral degree (Doctor of Sciences) and granted a lesser degree (Candidate of Sciences, a research doctorate) by the <b>State</b> <b>Accrediting</b> Bureau. Later, Bakhtin was invited back to Saransk, where he took on the position of chair of the General Literature Department at the Mordovian Pedagogical Institute. When, in 1957, the Institute changed from a teachers' college to a university, Bakhtin became head of the Department of Russian and World Literature. In 1961, Bakhtin’s deteriorating health forced him to retire, and in 1969, in search of medical attention, Bakhtin moved back to Moscow, where he lived until his death in 1975.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityCritical {{thinking}} {{has long been}} considered an essential feature of competent nursing practice. This requirement challenges those teaching nursing {{to find a way}} to measure this essential element. The National League of Nursing <b>Accrediting</b> Commission (NLN-AC) <b>states</b> that one of the essential program outcomes for nursing programs is that their graduates demonstrate critical thinking (2003). With this mandate in mind, it is important for educators to develop ways of measuring critical thinking in their nursing students. This project was designed to develop a tool that could be used to measure critical thinking in A. D. N. (associate degree of nursing) students' written care plans. A rubric was developed using Scheffer and Rubenfeld's (2000) seventeen consensus dimensions of critical thinking in nursing practice. This includes ten habits of mind and seven cognitive skills that a critically thinking nurse incorporates into her daily practice. Once the rubric was developed, a group of nine faculty from a small community college in southeastern Washington piloted it by applying it to three different nursing care plans that were randomly selected from a group of twenty possible recent submissions. Findings demonstrated that there was high agreement between raters, and faculty were able to clearly differentiate Habits of Mind from Cognitive Skills, but they were not able to clearly differentiate between individual concepts. Suggestions for further refinement of the Critical Thinking Rubric include: (a) providing education to enhance a deeper understanding of Habits of Mind and Cognitive Skills, (b) changing the scale on the evaluation tool to allow for a wider choice of responses, and (c) selecting a larger number and a wider variety of student work samples to further enhance reliability and validity of the rubric...|$|R

Results: Chiropractic and naturopathy, two examples of CAMs, have different levels {{of control over}} their curricula. The key learning areas (Medical Sciences, Profession-Specific Subjects, Research Methodology, Professional Studies and Clinical Training) identified in the study were similar in chiropractic and naturopathy curricula. Within the different chiropractic or naturopathic courses, the percentage of the courses allocated to the key learning areas were comparable; however, there were differences when comparison was made between chiropractic courses on one hand and naturopathy courses on the other. On average, chiropractic courses allocated 45. 9 % of their curricula to medical sciences, whereas university-based naturopathy courses allocated 26. 2 % to medical science and non-university naturopathy courses allocated 23. 1 %. Conclusion: Chiropractic registration guarantees a uniform level of training for all practitioners. This training was found to comply with accreditation board requirements. The naturopathy courses in the study had elected to comply with the requirements for state government and professional association accreditation, and a level of uniformity was evident amongst the various courses. It is pertinent to note that although both groups of practitioners are entitled to practise as primary contact practitioners, chiropractors and naturopaths had markedly different focuses on medical science training. We suggest a review of naturopathy curricula is warranted in the context of uniformity of training for primary contact practitioners. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Internships, {{before and}} after graduation, are the most {{essential}} link connecting students {{to the world of}} practice. Yet, by all accounts, internship is perhaps the most troubled phase of the continuing education of architects. During this century, as architectural knowledge grew more complex, the apprenticeship system withered away and schools assumed much of the responsibility for preparing architects for practice. However, schools cannot do the whole job. It is widely acknowledged that certain kinds of technical and practical knowledge are best learned in the workplace itself, under the guidance of experienced professionals. All <b>state</b> <b>accrediting</b> boards require a minimum period of internship-usually about three years-before a person is eligible to take the licensing exam. The National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) allows students to earn up to two years of work credit prior to acquisition of an accredited degree. The Intern Development Program (IDP), launched by NCARB and the American Institute of Architects in 1979, provides the framework for internship in some forty states. The program was designed to assure that interns receive adequate mentoring, that experiences are well-documented, and that employers and interns allocate enough time to a range of educational and vocational experiences to prepare students for eventual licensure. As the IDP Guidelines state, “The shift from school to office is not a transition from theory to pragmatism. It is a period when theory merges with pragmatism [...] It's a time when you: apply your formal education to the daily realities of architectural practice, acquire comprehensive experience in basic practice areas, explore specialized areas of practice, develop professional judgment, continue your formal education in architecture, and refine your career goals. i Whatever its accomplishments, however, we found broad consensus that the Intern Development Program has not, by itself, solved the problems of internship. Though we found mutually satisfying internship programs at several of the firms we visited or heard about around the country, at many others interns told us they were not receiving the continuing education and experience they needed. The truth is that architecture has serious, unsolved problems compared with other fields when it comes to supplying on-the-job learning experiences to induct students into the profession on a massive scale. Medicine has teaching hospitals. Beginning teachers work in actual classrooms, supported by school taxes. Law offices are, for the most part, in a better financial position to support young lawyers and pay them living wages. The architecture profession, by contrast, must support a required system of internship prior to licensure in an industry that has neither the financial resources of law or medicine, the stability and public support of teaching, nor a network of locations like hospitals or schools where education and practice can be seamlessly connected. And many employers acknowledged those problems. “The profession has all but undermined the traditional relationship between the profession and the academy,” said Neil Frankel, FAIA, executive vice president of Perkins & Will, a multinational firm with offices in New York, Chicago, Washington, and London. “Historically, until the advent of the computer, the profession said,'Okay, go to school, then we in the profession will teach you what the real world is like. 'With the coming of the computer, the profession needed a skill that students had, and has left behind the other responsibilities. i One intern told us she had been stuck for months doing relatively menial tasks such as toilet elevations. Another intern at a medium-sized firm told us he had been working sixty to seventy hours per week {{for a year and a}} half. “Then my wife had a baby and I'slacked off'to fifty hours. The partner called me in and I got called on the carpet for not working hard enough. i “The whole process of internship is being outmoded by economics,i one frustrated intern told us. “There's not the time or the money. There's no conception of people being groomed for careers. The younger staff are chosen for their value as productive workers. i “We just don't have the best structure here to use an intern's abilities to their best,i said a Mississippi architect. “The people who come out of school are really problems. I lost patience with one intern who was demanding that I switch him to another section so that he could learn what he needed for his IDP. I told him,'It's not my job to teach you. You are here to produce. '“ What steps might help students gain more satisfying work opportunities, both during and after graduation?...|$|R
