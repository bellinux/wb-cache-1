Having spent the intervening years dissecting any scripts {{he could get his}} hands on, and comparing them to the television output, Roddenberry advised the head of the studio's story department that he could write scripts as good as the ones they were using.

500|$|At the time, Crane was {{intermittently}} {{employed as}} <b>a</b> <b>free-lance</b> <b>writer,</b> contributing articles to various New York City newspapers. He began writing {{what would become}} The Red Badge of Courage in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View, New Jersey. Crane conceived the story {{from the point of}} view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war's reality. He took the private's surname, [...] "Fleming," [...] from his sister-in-law's maiden name. He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. Because he could not afford a typewriter, he carefully wrote in ink on legal-sized paper, occasionally crossing through or overlying a word. If he changed something, he would rewrite the whole page. He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894.|$|E

In August 1991, Casolaro was found dead in a hotel room where he was staying. The initial coroner's report ruled his death suicide, but Casolaro's family and friends were suspicious, and a lengthy second autopsy was conducted.

5000|$|However, Abert {{warns that}} the reason why Grimm's Journal [...] "nonetheless needs {{to be treated with}} caution is due to the {{personality}} of its principal contributor, for Grimm was not sufficiently well trained as a musician to do justice to the art that he was describing, nor was he the man to let slip the opportunity for a flash of wit or eloquent turn of phrase, even if it meant violating the truth in the process." [...] Grimm's second prediction {{at the end of the}} same letter didn't turn out as prescient as the first one: [...] "If these children live, they will not remain at Salzburg.
