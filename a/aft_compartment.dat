25|$|The two SRBs were {{designated}} as flight set 122 by contractor Alliant Techsystems and were made up from one new segment and remaining segments reused across 54 earlier shuttle missions {{dating back to}} STS-1. Inside the VAB, engineers attached a large sling to Discovery and the orbiter was rotated vertical. The orbiter was lifted into the high bay where its external tank (ET-137) and boosters were waiting to be mated. During the mating operations, an internal nut pre-positioned inside the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> of the orbiter slipped out of position and fell away inside the compartment. Engineers initially were worried that the orbiter {{would have to be}} removed from the ET and placed back in a horizontal orientation to make repairs. However, later they successfully accessed the area inside the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment,</b> and re-positioned the nut to complete the repairs. The bolting of the orbiter to its ET ('hard mate') was completed early in the morning of 11 September 2010 at 09:27 EDT.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 9 A.M., {{with the}} {{submersible}} {{about to be}} lifted {{out of the water}} with a towline back onto the ship, a water alarm sounded in the aft sphere, a self-contained part of the submersible containing machinery and oil storage. The towline had apparently fouled on the aft sphere hatch and wrenched it open. With the sound of water entering the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment,</b> Pisces III became inverted and began to sink back to the seabed. The aft sphere was now fully flooded. The additional weight of water now added over a tonne of extra weight to the submersible.|$|E
25|$|On 14 October 2010, {{engineers}} at {{the launch pad}} first discovered a small leak in a propellant line for Discoverys orbital maneuvering system (OMS) engines. The leak was detected after they noticed a fishy smell coming from the aft of the shuttle, {{thought of as a}} sign of fuel vapor in the air. Upon inspection, the leak was found at a flange located at the interface where two propellant lines met in Discoverys <b>aft</b> <b>compartment.</b> The line carried monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) propellant, one of two chemicals (the other is an oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide) used to ignite the OMS engines. Engineers replaced an Air Half Coupling (AHC) flight cap. However, the new cap failed to solve the problem since vapor checks still showed signs of a leak. An aspirator was activated to collect the vapor at the leak-site allowing work to continue in other locations around the aft segment of Discovery.|$|E
50|$|At 20:30, the {{survivors}} trapped in Pacocha released their messenger buoy {{and attempted to}} call <b>aft</b> <b>compartments</b> on the sound-powered telephone. There was no response.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} {{was divided into}} three decks, the upper two for passengers and the lower for cargo. The two passenger decks were divided into forward and <b>aft</b> <b>compartments,</b> separated by the engines and boiler amidships.|$|R
50|$|The Air Ministry ordered one {{aircraft}} {{for evaluation}} as a trainer, {{it was first}} flown in June 1930. After evaluation the Air Ministry ordered a total of sixteen aircraft for pilot and navigator training (in three batches) to Air Ministry Specification 15/32. Designated the A.29 the Serval-powered aircraft had room for six students, it had provision to fit gun mountings in the bow and <b>aft</b> <b>compartments,</b> it could also carry four 50 lb practice bombs.|$|R
25|$|The United States Air Corps {{wanted the}} {{aircraft}} to perform high altitude research and {{to test the}} feasibility of a pressurized cabin. The Corps contracted with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to produce the aircraft at a total cost of $112,197. The requirements called for an aircraft capable of flying at no less than 25,000ft (7,620m) and having an endurance of ten hours {{with at least two}} hours above 25,000ft (7,620m). Major Carl Greene and John Younger, both structures experts who worked for the Air Corps Engineering Division at Wright Field in Ohio were responsible for the design of the pressurized cabin structure. Greene and Younger worked with Lockheed to modify a Model 10 Electra with a new fuselage consisting of a circular cross-section that was able to withstand up to a 10psi differential. New, smaller windows were used to prevent a possible blowout while operating at high pressure differentials. The cabin pressurization was provided by bleeding air from the engines' turbo supercharger, the compressor outlet fed into the cabin and was controlled by the flight engineer. This system was able to maintain a cabin altitude of 12,000ft (3,658m) while flying at 30,000ft (9,144m). The fuselage was divided into two compartments, a forward pressurized compartment, and an aft unpressurized compartment. The forward compartment housed two pilots, a flight engineer, and up to two passengers. The <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> provided accommodation for one passenger and could be used only at low altitudes since it lacked pressurization.|$|E
25|$|The first launch {{attempt was}} delayed by 24 hours due to weather concerns, {{including}} multiple weather violations in NASA's launch rules beginning over 2 {{hours before the}} scheduled launch. During the second attempt on Wednesday morning, {{a problem with a}} LH2 fill-and-drain fuel valve inside Discoverys <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> led to another scrubbing. The problem arose when sensors did not detect the closure of the valve when commanded to do so. The issue was thought to be with the sensors rather than the valve itself. After inerting the orbiter's tank, which involved draining it, tests were conducted on the valves. Despite the valves working normally, another delay was called for to have more confidence in the system, and to give the console operators who performed the test some rest. The launch team evaluated the issue, passing on a possible launch window on 27 August 2009 at 01:10 EDT. The launch was delayed until 23:59 EDT, 28 August 2009, to allow the engineers to be fully satisfied with the vehicle. Later the mission was cleared for launch which involved a flight rule waiver for cycling the valve and a discussion to analyze the test failure of an Ares-1 booster that was similar to the SRBs used for the mission. NASA feared another delay when storms formed near the Kennedy Space Center on 28 August 2009, but the weather cleared in time for a successful launch of Discovery at 23:59 EDT.|$|E
500|$|As she was sinking, the torpedo boats fired their 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns at the survivors, killing about forty. The torpedo boats also {{fired at}} the {{transport}} Biobio, which {{had been trying to}} rescue the surviving crew. Including Captain Go√±i, 106 men survived out of the 288 aboard.The entire engagement lasted nine minutes, and Blanco Encalada sank two minutes after the torpedo hit. As Lynch and Condell left the harbor, they spotted the transport Aconcagua, which they attacked with their 14-pounder guns (after ruling out their Gatling guns due to their potential for overkill). The Aconcagua surrendered after {{an hour and a half}} battle, but the torpedo ships were unable to seize her due to an approaching ship which they thought was the Chilean cruiser Esmeralda. It turned out to be the neutral HMS Warspite. The Almirante Lynch was slightly damaged in the battle, suffering hits to her steam-pipe and flooding in her <b>aft</b> <b>compartment,</b> but besides that, the two torpedo boats were undamaged.|$|E
50|$|On 7 December 1921, the uncommissioned {{submarine}} {{conducted a}} dive off Penfield Reef in Long Island Sound {{as part of}} builder's trials. A manhole plate {{in one of the}} aft ballast tanks was left unsecured, several <b>aft</b> <b>compartments</b> flooded, and S-48 sank in 80 feet (24 meters) of water. The crew, contractor's personnel, and naval observers brought the bow to the surface and escaped through a torpedo tube to a tug which took them to New York City.|$|R
50|$|In {{a nuclear}} safe condition, and with {{sufficient}} stability {{to allow it}} to surface, Captain Britanov surfaced K-219 on battery power alone. He was then ordered to have the ship towed by a Soviet freighter back to her home port of Gadzhievo, 7000 km away. Although a towline was attached, towing attempts were unsuccessful, and after subsequent poison gas leaks into the final <b>aft</b> <b>compartments</b> and against orders, Britanov ordered the crew to evacuate onto the towing ship, but remained aboard K-219 himself.|$|R
25|$|When {{the bow of}} Haudaudine {{collided}} with the coral reef, the ship swerved around and her stern hit the reef several times, flooding the <b>aft</b> <b>compartments.</b> Within three hours the stern had settled down and the captain gave an order to abandon ship for the crew of 25 and three passengers. After the lifeboats had been launched, Haudaudine heeled to port, capsized and sank on the reef with seven feet of water over the starboard side. The lifeboats reached Port Moneo and Bourail in the following morning.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{watertight}} compartments {{are used}} in the Los Angeles-class submarines. The forward compartment contains crew living spaces, weapons-handling spaces, and control spaces not critical to recovering propulsion. The <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> contains the bulk of the submarine's engineering systems, power generation turbines, and water-making equipment. [...] Some submarines in the class are capable of delivering SEALs through either the dry deck shelter system or the advanced SEAL delivery system (program canceled in 2006 and rendered unusable in 2009). [...] A variety of atmospheric control devices are used to allow the vessel to remain submerged {{for long periods of time}} without ventilating, including an electrolytic oxygen generator, which produces oxygen for the crew and hydrogen as a byproduct. The hydrogen is pumped overboard but there is always a risk of fire or explosion from this process.|$|E
2500|$|All {{landing craft}} designs (and landing ship designs for ships {{intended}} to beach) {{must find a}} compromise between two divergent priorities; the qualities that make a good sea boat are opposite those that make a craft suitable for beaching. The LCA keel was produced from Canadian rock elm which was treated with steam to make it pliable and then shaped using a keel block and wedges. Twenty-four mahogany latitudinal frame pieces were joined to the keel providing the overall structure. The craft had a hull built of double-diagonal mahogany planking. The sides were plated with [...] "10lb. DIHT" [...] armour, a heat treated steel based on D1 steel, in this case Hadfield's Resista ¬º". Steps were taken {{to ensure that the}} boat would not sink when swamped. In the bow section between the armoured doors and the ramp, each bulkhead was packed with [...] of Onazote buoyant material. The same Onazote packing was placed along both hull sides for the length of the well, and [...] filled the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Fairmile is {{a wooden}} hulled {{passenger}} vessel. Her hulls-form is very fine for a vessel of her type; {{it is based}} on a destroyer hull, albeit much smaller, as her original speed was some 20 knots. The hull is split into watertight compartments, the midships compartment is the engine room, housing twin Gardner diesels, and an <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> contains the toilet facilities. The main deck has a forward open passenger deck. Aft of this, the forward deckhouse contains a chart room. [...] In the centre of the main deck is a raised open deck area, surrounding the funnel, and with the open flybridge above the chartroom. [...] Aft of the funnel is the main passenger lounge, originally the sick-bay, now named [...] "Churchill's", in honour of Winston Churchill. [...] The saloon is decorated with memorabilia of Churchill, including his profile etched on the side windows, and contains a bar. Both of the deckhouses are surrounded by an open passenger promenade deck. [...] At the stern of the vessel, the former open deck has been enclosed with an awning.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, three pad {{workers were}} killed by a nitrogen-rich {{atmosphere}} in the <b>aft</b> engine <b>compartment</b> of the Space Shuttle Columbia at the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39.|$|R
5000|$|On November 13, 2014, a Learjet 60 {{carrying}} Bono {{and other}} people from Dublin to Berlin lost an <b>aft</b> cargo <b>compartment</b> door while flying, however the plane landed safely in Berlin.|$|R
5000|$|February 21, 1970: Swissair Flight 330 crashed near W√ºrenlingen, Switzerland {{while trying}} {{to return to the}} airport after a bomb detonated in the <b>aft</b> cargo <b>compartment,</b> killing all nine crew and 38 passengers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> {{was located}} around the {{periphery}} of the command module at its widest part, just forward of (above) the aft heat shield. The compartment was divided into 24 bays containing 10 reaction control engines; the fuel, oxidizer, and helium tanks for the CM reaction control subsystem; water tanks; the crushable ribs of the impact attenuation system; and a number of instruments. The CM-SM umbilical, the point where wiring and plumbing ran from one module to the other, was also in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment.</b> The panels of the heat shield covering the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> were removable for maintenance of the equipment before flight.|$|E
50|$|Columbia was {{rolled out}} to Pad A {{for the second}} time 9 August to support a 1 September launch date. Two days before launch, the {{avionics}} box on the BBXRT portion of the ASTRO-1 payload malfunctioned and had to be changed and retested. Launch was rescheduled for 6 September. During tanking, high concentrations of hydrogen were again detected in the orbiter's <b>aft</b> <b>compartment,</b> forcing another postponement. NASA managers concluded that Columbia had experienced separate hydrogen leaks from the beginning: one of the umbilical assembly (now replaced) and one or more which had resurfaced in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment.</b> Suspicion focused on the package of three hydrogen recirculation pumps in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment.</b> These were replaced and retested. A damaged Teflon cover seal in the main engine number three hydrogen prevalve was replaced. Launch was rescheduled for 18 September. The fuel leak in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> resurfaced during tanking, and the launch was scrubbed again. The STS-35 mission was put on hold until problem resolved by a special tiger team assigned by the Space Shuttle director.|$|E
50|$|Further delays {{were caused}} by the burst of a {{hydraulic}} flex hose in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> during the Flight Readiness Test. The lines were removed and inspected and three replacements were installed.|$|E
50|$|On 20 December 1944, Kashima was {{modified}} at Kure Arsenal with its torpedo tubes replaced by two unshielded twin 40-caliber Type 89 127 mm HA-gun mounts, four triple-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns, {{along with a}} Type 22 surface-search radar, hydrophones and sonar. Two Type 2 infra-red communication devices were also installed. Kashimas <b>aft</b> <b>compartments</b> were modified into concrete-protected magazines for up to 100 depth charges, with four depth charge throwers and two rails installed on the quarterdeck. In addition, eight Type 96 single mount 25 mm AA guns were added, bringing the total number to 38 barrels, and a Type 13 air-search radar was also installed.|$|R
50|$|On 25 March 1944, Kashii was reassigned {{directly}} to Headquarters, General Escort Command, and was modified for anti-submarine warfare at Kure Arsenal. Its torpedo tubes were removed {{and replaced by}} two Type 89 127 mm twin mount HA guns. Four triple mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns were also installed bringing the total to 20 barrels (4x3, 4x2), a Type 21 air-search radar was fitted and hydrophones and sonar were also added. Kashiis <b>aft</b> <b>compartments</b> were modified into concrete-protected magazines for up to 300 depth charges. Four depth charge throwers and two rails are installed on the quarterdeck. The modification work was completed by 29 April 1944.|$|R
50|$|Britanov {{was ordered}} to have his ship towed to Gadzhievo, her homeport, which was 7,000 {{kilometers}} (about 4,300 miles) away. The attempts to tow the ship were unsuccessful, and poison gas began to leak in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartments.</b> Against orders, Britanov ordered the crew evacuated to the towing ship, while he remained onboard K-219. Seeing that Britanov - in their judgement - was not acting efficiently enough, the Soviet Navy's high command ordered the security officer, Valery Pshenichny, to assume command and resume the patrol. Before that order could be carried out, K-219 sank {{to the bottom of}} the Hatteras Abyss. The cause is unknown, but it is presumed that Captain Britanov may have scuttled the ship.|$|R
50|$|In addition, one of orbiter five {{general purpose}} {{computers}} failed completely, {{along with one}} of the multiplexer demultiplexers that control orbiter hydraulics ordinance and orbiter maneuvering system / reaction control system functions in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
50|$|On July 2, 1979, MPTA-098 {{suffered}} major {{structural damage}} {{due to a}} fractured fuel valve on Space Shuttle Main Engine number 2002. The fracture allowed hydrogen to leak into the enclosed <b>aft</b> <b>compartment,</b> raising the pressure to beyond the structural capability of the heat shield supports, severely damaging the structure.|$|E
5000|$|The Command Module {{attitude}} control system consisted of twelve 93 lbf N {{attitude control}} jets; ten were located in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment,</b> and two pitch motors in the forward compartment. Four tanks stored 270 lb of monomethylhydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. They were pressurized by 1.1 lb of helium stored at [...] in two tanks.|$|E
5000|$|While {{examining}} the wreckage SLC operators discovered that two NCOs and seven sailors {{were still alive}} trapped {{in one of the}} <b>aft</b> <b>compartments</b> of the submarine. [...] The situation was critical: the compartment was slowly flooding and the escape door was jammed distorted by the explosion. After several hours of work, all seven men managed to get to the surface with the help of divers, two men died because they didn't follow the instructions. Of the seven survivors two sailors, unfortunately, died later of embolism. Overall, Iride lost 35 men (3 officers, 9 non-officers and 23 sailors) with 17 survivors. All four SLCs were rcovered with minor damage, and brought back to La Spezia by Calipso. The first assault operation had ended in disaster.|$|R
50|$|The launch was {{originally}} scheduled for 18 December 1985, but the closeout of an <b>aft</b> orbiter <b>compartment</b> was delayed, {{and the mission}} was rescheduled for the following day. However, on 19 December, the countdown was stopped at T-14 seconds due to an out-of-tolerance turbine reading on the right SRB's hydraulic system.|$|R
5000|$|Her minelaying {{arrangements}} were [...] "highly ingenious, but extremely complicated", filling two <b>aft</b> <b>compartments.</b> A compensating tube {{ran down the}} center of the two spaces, to make up for the lost weight as mines were laid, as well as to store eight additional mines. The other mines were racked in three groups around this tube, two in the fore <b>compartment,</b> one <b>aft,</b> with a hydraulically driven rotating cage between them. Mines were moved by hydraulic worm shafts, the aft racks connecting directly to the launch tubes, which had vertically sliding hydraulic doors (rather than the usual hinged ones of torpedo tubes). Each launch tube was normally loaded with four mines, and a water 'round mines (WRM) tube flooded to compensate as they were laid, then pumped into the compensating tube. Eight mines could be laid in 10 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-six men (one officer, Ensign Joseph H. Patterson; 23 enlisted men; and two {{civilian}} technicians, Donald M. Smith and Charles M. Wood) {{were trapped}} in a flooded <b>aft</b> <b>compartment</b> and died. The remaining 32 naval personnel and a third civilian, naval architect Harold C. Preble, spent up to 39 hours in the sunken vessel before they {{were brought to the}} surface by the McCann Rescue Chamber which was used for the first time. Survivors of the USS Squalus were brought up in four trips as the diving bell rode a cable attached to the forward escape hatch of the submarine. A naval board of inquiry concluded that ‚Äúa mechanical failure in the operating gear of the engine induction valve,‚Äù had caused flooding of the <b>aft</b> <b>compartment.</b> The USS Squalus was later salvaged, repaired and returned to sea as the renamed , receiving credit for sinking seven enemy vessels in World War II.|$|E
50|$|In {{a notable}} {{accident}} in 1981, {{shortly before the}} launch of the first Space Shuttle mission, five technicians lost consciousness and two of them died after they entered the Orbiter <b>aft</b> <b>compartment.</b> Nitrogen had been used to flush oxygen from the compartment as a precaution against fire. They were not wearing air packs because of a last minute change in safety procedures.|$|E
50|$|The two SRBs were {{designated}} as flight set 122 by contractor Alliant Techsystems and were made up from one new segment and remaining segments reused across 54 earlier shuttle missions {{dating back to}} STS-1.

2500|$|This {{would imply}} there were {{survivors}} {{in the forward}} compartments of the submarine, and {{a report by the}} Lochranza pier master of seeing smoke candles on the surface gives further weight to this theory. [...] Those not killed in the initial flooding in the <b>aft</b> <b>compartments</b> might have therefore attempted to use the forward escape hatch to leave the submarine and tried {{to make it to the}} surface, an endeavour that ultimately ended in failure. [...] The submarine was not reported overdue until the following morning, and search vessels were finally deployed to the area twenty three hours later. [...] It was during this time that a spotter plane observed a small concentrated patch of oil over what is now known to be Vandal's position. Three hours later this patch had drifted away and dispersed. [...] All other hatches and external openings to the sea were discovered to be closed, and there were no external signs of hull damage, or collision.|$|R
50|$|When not in use, the Fa 330 was stowed in two {{watertight}} <b>compartments</b> <b>aft</b> of the conning tower. Recovering, dismantling, and stowing the Fa 330 took approximately 20 {{minutes and}} was a difficult operation.|$|R
