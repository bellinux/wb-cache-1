30|$|The {{view that}} {{depressive}} and <b>anxious</b> <b>states</b> {{can be viewed}} as continuums raises the question of how we define the poles of these continuums.

30|$|The {{majority}} of general assessment tools in clinical practice {{are concerned with}} depressive and <b>anxious</b> <b>states.</b> For example, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS: Lovibond & Lovibond [1995]), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS: Zigmond & Snaith [1983]) and the Duke Anxiety-Depression (DUKE-AD: Parkinson [2002]) {{as well as many}} measures specifically developed to assess either depressive or <b>anxious</b> <b>states</b> such as the Beck Depression and Anxiety Scales (Beck et al.

Such tools aid assessment and treatment and can be used by therapists to monitor their client's progress and by researchers to evaluate clinical efficacy (see also, Fischer & Corcoran [2007]).|$|R

30|$|As already noted, in {{clinical}} practice and research {{the two most}} widely assessed affective states are depression and anxiety. Psychiatry regards clinical depression and anxiety as discrete disorders separate from normal states. Psychologists, on the other hand, have tended to adopt a continuity model. In other words, clinical states of depression and anxiety and milder versions of these states {{may be seen as}} both falling on the same conceptual continuums. On this basis, much experimental work with mild depressive and anxious populations has informed our understanding and treatment of these clinical states. As such, an assumption we make in this paper is that depressive and <b>anxious</b> <b>states</b> can be understood using a continuity model.|$|R

40|$|The study {{attempted}} {{to integrate the}} cognitive content-specificity and tripartite litera-tures {{to create a more}} holistic model of the emotional, physiological, and cognitive phenomenology of depression and anxiety. In addition, the constructs of hopelessness and worry were used to clarify ambiguous findings in the cognitive content-specificity research and to identify possible cognitive correlates of high NA and low PA. The results from 124 clients at a university counseling center supported this attempt at in-tegrating these literatures. Overall, there was good evidence that worry is a cognitive correlate of high NA. Consequently, we view worry and high NA as features of a con-stellation of correlated indices that are shared with both depressed and <b>anxious</b> mood <b>states.</b> Alternatively, the results also support the position that hopelessness is a cogni-tive correlate of low PA. These features—low PA and hopelessness—define correlated indices that help discriminate depressed from <b>anxious</b> <b>states.</b> We view this integration of the cognitive and emotional literatures as providing evidence for a comprehensive map of the emotional and cognitive phenomenology in depression and anxiety.

40|$|Objectives Multiple {{studies have}} implied {{a pivotal role}} for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) within the anxiety network. Previously, our {{research}} group showed that the BST is hyperactive in anxious rats, that electrolytic lesions reduce the expression of conditioned anxiety and that high-frequent stimulation (HFS) in this brain region alleviates symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder. The aims of our current study are two-fold. First, we hypothesized that HFS (> 100 Hz) in the BST reduces the expression of conditioned anxiety (Experiment (Exp) 1). Secondly, we aimed to scrutinize neuronal BST activity during <b>anxious</b> and non-anxious <b>states</b> in our model (Exp 2). Materials & Methods Exp 1 : Electrodes and cannulas were implanted in male Wistar rats, targeting the BST region. After recovery, all animals were conditioned to {{a context in which}} they received electric footshocks. On the next day, the animals were re-exposed to this context, and contextual anxiety was quantified through freezing and startle measurements. Rats either received BST lesions one day earlier (LES; n= 9); electrical BST stimulation during the test session (STIM; n= 13); or no intervention (CTRL; n= 12). Finally, an open field test was conducted to evaluate effects of BST manipulations on non-conditioned anxiety and motor behavior. Exp 2 : Male Wistar rats were implanted with bipolar recording electrodes in the BST. All animals underwent context conditioning as described for Exp 1, with or without shock administration during training (ANX; n= 14 and CTRL; n= 13, respectively). Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded during baseline and test sessions. Results Exp 1 : We found that LES rats displayed significantly reduced freezing and startle measurements compared to CTRL rats. Interestingly, freezing values were lower in STIM vs. CTRL, indicating anxiolytic effects of stimulation. BST interventions did not affect unconditioned anxiety or motor behavior in an open field. Exp 2 : Preliminary analyses showed significant differences in low-frequency band power between <b>anxious</b> and non-anxious <b>states.</b> Discussion We find that HFS in the BST produces anxiolytic effects, albeit to a lesser extent than those obtained by ablative surgery. Furthermore, we demonstrated altered neuronal BST activity during <b>anxious</b> <b>states</b> in our rat model, which may be used to improve stimulation effects in future experiments (e. g. closed-loop stimulation). Our findings underline the therapeutic potential of HFS in the BST for disorders which are hallmarked by pathological anxiety. Further research will be necessary to assess the translatability of these findings to the clinic. Conclusions In summary, we showed that (1) electrical BST stimulation reduces anxiety and that (2) the BST displays altered neural activity during <b>anxious</b> <b>states</b> in our rat model. status: accepte...|$|R

30|$|The {{view that}} {{depressive}} and <b>anxious</b> <b>states</b> represent one pole with states of positive functioning {{at the other}} pole {{is consistent with the}} circumplex model of emotions (Russell [1980]; Russell & Barrett [1998]). The circumplex model of emotions is defined by the two dimensions of pleasantness-unpleasantness and high activation-low activation. Seen this way, depression is a state of low pleasantness and low activation and anxiety is a state of low pleasantness and high activation. The opposite state to depression is therefore characterised by high pleasantness and high activation. The opposite state to anxiety is characterised by high pleasantness and low activation. Although the circumplex of emotions has attracted much attention in emotion research (Ekkekakis [2013]), its application to positive clinical psychology has been limited (see, Joseph & Wood [2010]). The implication, however, is that depression and anxiety may be represented by dimensional structures continuous with these polar opposite states.|$|R

60|$|Well! I made no halt there, and I soon {{dropped the}} very queer small boy and went on.

60|$|When Asaph {{came within}} sight of his sister's house he was amazed to see a phaeton and a gray horse {{standing}} in front of the gate. From this it was easy to infer that the doctor was in the house. What on earth could have happened? Was anything the matter with Marietta? And if so, why did she send for a physician who lived at a distance, instead of Doctor McIlvaine, the village doctor? In a very <b>anxious</b> <b>state</b> of mind Asaph reached the gate, and irresolutely went into the yard. His impulse was to go to the house and see what had happened; but he hesitated. He felt that Marietta might object to having a comparative stranger know that such an exceedingly shabby fellow was her brother. And, besides, his sister could not have been overtaken by any sudden illness. She had always appeared perfectly well, and there would have been no time during his brief absence from the house to send over to Timberley for a doctor.|$|E

But those who rate them at the highest (higher a great deal, indeed, than I dare to do) are of opinion, that, upon the ground of such advantages, we cannot at this time hope to make any treaty of peace which would not be ruinous and completely disgraceful. In such an <b>anxious</b> <b>state</b> of things, if dawnings of success serve to animate our diligence, they are good; if they tend to increase our presumption, they are worse than defeats. The state of our affairs shall, then, be as promising as any one may choose to conceive it: it is, however, but promising. We must recollect, that, with but half of our natural strength, we are at war against confederated powers who have singly threatened us with ruin; we must recollect, that, whilst we are left naked on one side, our other flank is uncovered by any alliance; that, whilst we are weighing and balancing our successes against our losses, we are accumulating debt to the amount of at least fourteen millions in the year. That loss is certain.|$|E
30|$|Both the SDHS and the STAI- 6 were {{developed}} {{for use in}} clinical contexts and are reliable and valid clinical tools for assessing depressive and <b>anxious</b> <b>states,</b> respectively. However, each is limited insofar as its use a general purpose tool, assessing as each does {{only a portion of}} the circumplex of affective states (Joseph & Wood [2010]). What is unusual about these two scales, compared to most of the other measures of depression and anxiety available, is that they both contain an equal balance of positive and negatively worded items. Other measures could have been selected but these were favored for their individual brevity and the fact that used in combination the total number of items to be completed was only 12, which is sufficiently short to be useful to clinicians, such that the measure could be quickly administered, used alongside other traditional measures if required, and for repeated session by session use.|$|R
30|$|Since the {{emergence}} of positive psychology (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi [2000]) it has however become accepted {{that the absence of}} psychological distress and dysfunction does not equate to the presence of positive functioning (e.g., Maddux et al. [2004]). Low scores on measures that indicate the absence of depressive and <b>anxious</b> <b>states</b> do not indicate the presence of positive states of mind. For example, {{one of the most prominent}} measures is the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al. [1961]). Scores on the BDI have a potential range of 0 to 63. A score of 63 indicates intense depressive experience. A score of zero on the BDI indicates the absence of depressive experiences, as would be expected given its exclusive pathological wording, but a score of zero does not indicate the presence of positive functioning. For two people scoring zero, one could be high on positive functioning, the other low (Joseph & Lewis [1998]). By itself the BDI does not provide a measure of positive functioning.|$|R

Peace of mind is thus generally associated with bliss, happiness and contentment.|$|R
50|$|An <b>anxious</b> <b>state</b> at {{the time}} of {{learning}} can create a stronger aversion to the stimuli. A stronger aversion can lead to stronger associations in memory between the stimulus and response, therefore enhancing the memory of the response to the stimulus. When extinction is attempted in male and female humans, compared to a neutral control without anxiety, extinction does not occur. This suggests that memory is enhanced for learning, specifically fear learning, when anxiety is present.|$|E
50|$|Attention is {{the process}} by which a {{concentration}} is focused on a point of interest, such as an event or physical stimulus. It is theorized that attention toward a stimulus will increase ability to recall information, therefore enhancing memory. When threatening information or a stimulus that provokes anxiety are present, it is difficult to release attention from the negative cue. When in a state of high anxiety, a conceptual memory bias is produced toward the negative stimulus. Therefore, it is difficult to redirect the attention focus away from the negative, anxiety provoking cue. This increases the activation of the pathways associated with the threatening cues, and thus increases the ability to recall the information present while in a high <b>anxious</b> <b>state.</b> However, when in a high <b>anxious</b> <b>state</b> and presented with positive information, there is no memory bias produced. This occurs because it is not as difficult to redirect attention from the positive stimulus as it is from the negative stimulus. This {{is due to the fact}} that the negative cue is perceived as a factor in the induced stress, whereas the positive cue is not.|$|E

Many studies have successfully demonstrated the relationship between sleep deprivation and anxiety in clinical research.

However, the same efficacy is not found on basic studies that deal with the relationship between paradoxical sleep and anxiety. The great majority of studies which approach this matter in animal models do not present results that may be applied to clinical practice and this is basically due to two reasons: inconsistency among results and lack of replicability as related to clinical studies. It has to be emphasized that the use of animal models is extremely useful, mainly under experimental conditions which cannot be ethically or plausibly be approached in human beings. So, the present theoretical assay tries to evaluate in a brief and critical manner the applicability of animal models in sleep deprivation under a translational perspective...|$|R

Objectives: To analyze the association between <b>anxious</b> <b>states</b> of children about dentists and their preference of dentist attire and gender in the dental office. Materials and Methods: The 9 - 12 -year-old middle school children were selected for the study. Children were asked to fill a questionnaire containing children′s fear survey schedule-dental subscale (CFSS-DS) and asked to prefer dental attire from four different pictures displaying the single anonymous dentist in four different attires in the same operator. The CFSS-DS gave the anxiety scale, and age, gender, and experience were also plotted against children preference in an apron, protective wear, and gender preference. Results were tabulated and statistically analyzed using Chi-square test. Results: About 718 (62 %) were scored as anxious children. Of all anxious children, 502 (69. 9 %) had preference of colored attires of the dentist, and 408 (66. 8 %) anxious children preferred dentist with protective wear. Female dentists were preferred by 452 (66 %) anxious children. Same gender preference was also prevalent...|$|R
