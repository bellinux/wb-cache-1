2500|$|Another {{intended}} {{agent was}} the highly decorated former RAF Squadron-Leader Frederick Joseph Rutland who helped the Japanese navy develop aircraft carriers in the 1920s, {{and in the}} 1930s was deployed as a secret agent in the US. But for problems with establishing his cover in Hawaii as a whisky importer, Rutland {{might have been the}} key Japanese naval intelligence spy supporting the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Furthermore, the Japanese did not need Abwehr assistance, having a consulate in Hawaii which had on its staff an undercover IJN intelligence officer, Takeo Yoshikawa. The consulate had reported to IJN Intelligence for years, and Yoshikawa increased the rate of reports after his arrival. (Sometimes called a [...] "master spy", he was in fact quite young, and his reports not infrequently contained errors.) Pearl Harbor base security was so lax Yoshikawa had no difficulty obtaining access, even taking the Navy's own harbor tourboat. (Even had he not, hills overlooking the Harbor were perfect for observation or photography, and were freely accessible.) Gossip with taxi drivers is supposed to have been one of his sources as well. Some of his information, and presumably other material from the Consulate, was hand-delivered to IJN intelligence officers aboard Japanese commercial vessels calling at Hawaii prior to the War; at least one is known to have been deliberately routed to Hawaii for this purpose during the summer. Most, however, seem to have been transmitted to Tokyo, almost certainly via cable (the usual communication method with Tokyo). Many of those messages were intercepted and decrypted by the U.S.; most were evaluated as routine intelligence gathering all nations do about potential opponents, rather than evidence of an <b>active</b> <b>attack</b> plan. None of those currently known, including those decrypted after the attack when there was finally time to return to those remaining undecrypted, explicitly stated anything about an attack on Pearl Harbor. The only exception was a message sent from the Hawaiian Consulate on 6 December, which was not decrypted until after the 7th, thus making it moot with respect to U.S. foreknowledge. No cable traffic was intercepted in Hawaii until after David Sarnoff of RCA agreed to assist during a visit to Hawaii immediately before the 7th. Such interception was illegal under U.S. law, though it had been going on sub rosa in New York for some time. Farago's postscript offers a viewpoint from RCA personnel. In the final analysis, illegal co-operation of American cable companies changed little or nothing, since radio intercept stations were picking up some of the consular traffic anyway, and American intelligence failed to make optimum use of the information in any case.|$|E

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of many cryptographic protocols, {{it is useful to}} distinguish two classes of attacks: passive attacks in which an adversary eavesdrops on messages sent between honest users and <b>active</b> <b>attacks</b> (i. e., “man-in-the-middle ” attacks) in which — in addition to eavesdropping — the adversary inserts, deletes, or arbitrarily modifies messages sent from one user to another. Passive attacks are well characterized (the adversary’s choices are inherently limited) and techniques for achieving security against passive attacks are relatively well understood. Indeed, cryptographers have long focused on methods for countering passive eavesdropping attacks, and much work in the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s has dealt with formalizing notions of security and providing provably-secure solutions for this setting. On the other hand, <b>active</b> <b>attacks</b> are not well characterized and precise modeling has been difficult. Few techniques exist for dealing with <b>active</b> <b>attacks,</b> and designing practical protocols secure against such attacks remains a challenge.

30|$|Contrary to {{the passive}} methods, <b>active</b> <b>attacks</b> enable the {{intruder}} to {{directly or indirectly}} influence data content transmitted in the WSN.

50|$|They {{demonstrated}} that adding hammy words - {{words that are}} more likely to appear in ham (non-spam email content) than spam - was effective against a naïve Bayesian filter, and enabled spam to slip through.

50|$|In June 2005, Yaniv Shaked and Avishai Wool {{published}} a paper describing both passive and active methods for obtaining the PIN for a Bluetooth link. The passive attack allows a suitably equipped attacker to eavesdrop on communications and spoof, if the attacker {{was present at}} the time of initial pairing. The active method makes use of a specially constructed message that must be inserted at a specific point in the protocol, to make the master and slave repeat the pairing process. After that, the first method can be used to crack the PIN. This attack's major weakness is that it requires the user of the devices under attack to re-enter the PIN during the attack when the device prompts them to. Also, this <b>active</b> <b>attack</b> probably requires custom hardware, since most commercially available Bluetooth devices are not capable of the timing necessary.|$|E
