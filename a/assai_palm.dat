40|$|The Amazonian <b>assai</b> <b>palm</b> {{has a great}} {{socioeconomic}} importance, {{but most}} of its commercial plantations take place in uplands and low natural fertility soils, what may hinder its development. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of nutrient omission on growth and nutritional status of <b>assai</b> <b>palm</b> seedlings (Ver-o-Peso cultivar). The experimental design was completely randomized, with 14 treatments and 5 replicates. The treatments consisted of complete fertilization with liming; no fertilization and no liming (control); complete fertilization with individual omission of N, P, K, Ca, Ca with no liming, Mg, Mg with no liming, S, B, Cu and Zn. Plant height, stem diameter and dry mass, leaf and total shoot dry mass, and leaf nutrients content and accumulation were evaluated. The initial growth of the <b>assai</b> <b>palm</b> plants was limited by the omission of P, N, K, Ca, Mg and Cu. The production of leaf dry mass was decreasingly affected by the omission of P > Cu > N > K > Mg, while leaf area was limited by the individual omissions of Ca > N > P > K > Mg > Zn. Plant development, measured by relative growth of shoots, was affected by lack of Ca > P > N > Mg > Cu > K, with an average reduction of 31 %. The nutrients most needed by the <b>assai</b> <b>palm</b> plants, as evidenced by nutrients contents and accumulation in the leaf dry mass, are: N > K > S > Ca > Mg > P > Mn > Zn > B > Cu...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to estimate the genetic variability and selection gain in the characters related with fruits in <b>assai</b> <b>palms,</b> 68 progenies collected in populations from Afuá city and planted in Amapá state were evaluated. The experiment was conducted in random blocks with two replications and four useful plants per plot. The following characters were evaluated: fruit longitudinal diameter (DLF), the fruit greatest transversal diameter (DTMA), the smallest fruit diameter (DTME); mass from one hundred fruits (P 100) and, in bunches: total fruit mass (PTC). There are differences between progenies, denoting the possibility of selection gains. In general, the inheritabilities were medium or high for the characters, but always lower for PTC. The coefficient CVg/CVe was favorable in DTMA and DTME and unfavorable to PTC; the correlations between characters were positive and significant, the selection gain was 16. 65 % for PTC and from - 1. 29 % to - 7. 60 % in the other characters; the selected progenies were able to associate the desired values in the evaluated characters. The obtained conclusions were that there is high environmental contribution in the phenotypic manifestation of the progenies once the fruit metric dimensions had lower environmental effects and higher genetic effect; there is possibility of genetic gains which are important to breeding programs of this species using the characters simultaneously, although the values had been low, mainly due to the positive correlation presence, where there is preference for reduced fruit size with productivity increase...|$|R
40|$|Physiological and {{biochemical}} {{aspects of}} <b>assai</b> <b>palm</b> during seed germination and early seedling growth were investigated. Seeds collected from plants growing in flooded and upland forests {{were used to}} determine the influence of normoxic (aerobic) and anoxic (anaerobic) conditions in germination and the initial and average time of development in the roots and shoots. After 75 days, seedlings germinated under normoxia were transferred to trays and submitted to flooding. Seed reserves (lipids, proteins, soluble sugars and starch) were monitored for quiescent and germinated seeds maintained under normoxic and anoxic conditions, as well as after 5, 10 and 20 days of seedling growth. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was quantified in roots and leaves of seedlings without or with flooding (partial and total). Seeds were not able to germinate under anoxia. Different strategies of storage mobilization of lipids, proteins, soluble sugars and starch were observed in seeds of each environment. ADH activity was induced by anoxia, with the highest level observed in the leaves. This study showed that, under normoxic conditions, the best developmental performance of <b>assai</b> <b>palm</b> seeds, from flooded or upland forest areas, during germination was associated with primary metabolites mobilization and seedling flooding tolerance with increased ADH activity. We conclude that the <b>assai</b> <b>palm</b> is well adapted to the anoxic conditions provoked by flooding...|$|E

The moisturizing mask formulation was composed of zinc oxide (5. 0 %) and moisturizing cream constituted of triceteareth- 4 phosphate (and) cetyl alcohol (and) stearyl alcohol (and) sodium cetearyl sulfate (and) oleth- 10 (qs 50 g). To this formulation was added hibiscus flowers glycolic extract (2. 5 %), <b>assai</b> <b>palm</b> glycolic extract (1. 5 %), black mulberry glycolic extract (1. 5 %) and papaw glycolic extract (2. 0 %). The formulation was stored in aseptically clean recipients, away from humidity and light, in fresh and airy places. The results of the microbiological analysis on the counting of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi), of the above mentioned formulation, revealed a bioburden < 10 CFU/mL in all samples. Such data indicate adequate microbiological quality of the tested products, according to official recommendations. Furthermore, it was not detected the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, assuring the harmlessness of the formulation.

40|$|Caracterizou-se a diversidade genética entre acessos de açaizeiro por meio de marcadores RAPD. Foram analisados 116 acessos conservados na coleção de germoplasma da Embrapa Amazônia Oriental, Belém, PA com base em 28 primers. A matriz binária foi utilizada para a obtenção das dissimilaridades genéticas, pelo complemento artimético do coeficiente de similaridade de Dice, e também para a análise de bootstrap. As dissimilaridades genéticas foram representadas em um dendrograma gerado pelo método UPGMA. Os primers revelaram 263 bandas polimórficas e apresentaram ampla diversidade genética entre os acessos, variando de 0, 06 a 0, 67, sendo dois acessos de Chaves, PA, os mais divergentes. Mas, alguns acessos da mesma procedência apresentaram baixas dissimilaridades. O dendrograma permitiu a formação de oito grupos, delimitados pela dissimilaridade genética média (dg m: 0, 40) : dois formados por um único acesso; dois constituídos por dois acessos e os demais por vários subgrupos com acessos de diferentes locais. O número ideal de bandas para a estimativa da diversidade genética entre os 116 acessos foi de 180. Logo, o número de bandas empregado neste estudo foi eficiente para caracterizar com precisão as relações genéticas entre os acessos de açaizeiro. Os acessos divergentes devem ser úteis na formação de coleções nucleares e em programas de melhoramento genético.
