5|$|All three named commanders were slain {{during the}} battle, and Khalid was {{selected}} as the commander. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> his heavily outnumbered army of 3,000 men against an army of 10,000 of the Byzantine Empire and Ghassanid Arabs in what would be known as the Battle of Mu'tah. Khalid assumed command of the Muslim army at the crucial moment, and defeated the Byzantine forces even when another 10,000 soldiers had arrived as reinforcements for the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their metabolism {{and go into}} torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still {{fairly easy to}} cross. Local inhabitants were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> fields on the other side, or even to live {{on one side and}} work on the other. Refugees were able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E
5|$|Yamato is the {{director}} of the Japan Meteorological Agency, Geomagnetism Research Department which was established by his own Hotsuin family.

50|$|During September 1777, General Henry Clinton, {{head of the}} British Expeditionary Forces in America, {{selected}} Schuyler Mansion for {{his headquarters}} {{during one of his}} more important raiding operations which included the famed Battle of Second River. The Mansion stood until 1924, a period of 214 years, when it was torn down by a land development company, despite the company's offers to transfer the land an organization that would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the property.|$|R
5|$|Both parties {{reached a}} {{settlement}} on 20 April 2007, agreeing {{to drop their}} respective lawsuits. Under {{the terms of the}} settlement, Thompson has been barred from suing to ban the sale or distribution of games by Take-Two or its subsidiaries. He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 a new {{committee}} was formed, {{under which the}} club emerged from the doldrums. Manager Paul Ogden took over in 1969 and led the club to two Staffordshire County League championships, followed in quick succession by two Manchester League titles. After the second Manchester League win, Leek joined the Cheshire County League, where they were league champions at the second attempt in the 1974–75 season, but after Ogden left in 1975 to take over as manager of Northwich Victoria a series of managers came and went in quick succession without being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> this level of success.|$|E
5|$|Marcus {{continued}} {{throughout his}} tenure to hold tightly to his father's assurance {{that he would}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> and act on his political convictions while running the business. He supported the United Nations in its early years, an unpopular position in Dallas for that time. In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) land {{development}} is common, especially in urban areas. Management of 3 D land rights, restrictions and responsibilities (3 D RRRs) {{is one of}} the most important challenges in current land-administration systems, most of which are equipped with cadastres <b>able</b> only <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> information in a 2 D spatial information environment...|$|R
5|$|Maritime trade {{along the}} coast of East Africa was {{facilitated}} by trade winds in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between land masses. Gedi and other large, contemporary mainland sites often had poor anchorages compared to later sites {{along the coast}}, considering the exposure of their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and water depth upon approach. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi and other large mainland sites were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a high degree of economic success. Their success in trade may have been influenced by the early establishment of trade routes and available commercial support from their hinterlands.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov {{volunteered for}} his 437-day flight {{to learn how}} the human body would respond to the {{micro-gravity}} environment on long-duration missions to Mars. Upon returning from his second spaceflight, Polyakov held {{the record for the}} most total time in space. This record, however, was later broken by Sergei Avdeyev and is currently held by Gennady Padalka. Data from Polyakov's flight has been used by researchers to determine that humans are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a healthy mental state during long-duration spaceflight just as they would on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or not}} these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E
5000|$|Others, such as Joseph Rosenberg of the Catholic Community Relations Council {{said that}} the landmarking of Phase III would put an undue burden on St. Anthony of Padua Church and the work it does for the {{immigrant}} community, and some residents complained that landmarking would make the upkeep of their buildings more difficult and expensive, with one remarking [...] "Landmarking our block will force us to sell our building as we’ll no longer be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> it. You will have created a museum but destroyed a community." ...|$|R

5000|$|Rona was {{restored}} to original condition by her last private owner, John Palmer, taking over nine years. The fact that Rona has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>maintained</b> as a fully operational sailing vessel for over 110 years is probably {{largely due to}} her construction in kauri pine (Agathis australis), which is a fine-grained timber of excellent quality for boat-building.|$|R
5|$|Under {{the special}} {{condition}} of Hong Kong's high-degree autonomy, the territory is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> an independent customs area and separate immigration policy {{from those of}} China. This separate exercise of customs and immigration, subject to conditional reviews, is recognised by foreign nations through their legislature, such as the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act. Hong Kong maintains an international border with mainland China across 5 border control stations by land, 3 entry and exit points by sea and the International Airport. Applications for entry permits are, however, handled by Chinese Embassies for Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 {{to cut back}} on the gifts given to the Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of the}} relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} fees {{themselves were}} a significant {{legacy of the}} expansion effort. Smith claims US$14 to $15 million was brought in and that it saved the league. A more modest assessment suggests expansion saved the Stampeders and Tiger-Cats—both teams were undeniably in distress during the era—and that the other Canadian teams were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> have <b>maintain</b> a semblance of stability.|$|R
5|$|Among African slaves, Catholicism was the {{religion}} of the majority. Most slaves came originally from the midwestern and southwestern portions of the African coast. For over four centuries this region had been the subject of Christian mission activities. Some Africans and their descendants, however, held onto elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism. This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé. Islam was also practiced among a small minority of African slaves, although it was harshly repressed {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had been completely extinguished. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated. Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled farther west, where they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> their diverse polytheistic beliefs, or were restricted to aldeamentos (reservations), where they eventually converted to Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|As a Klingon moon, Praxis, explodes without warning, the {{starship}} USS Excelsior, commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu, {{is struck by}} the shock wave and its crew discovers {{that much of the}} moon has been obliterated. The loss of their key energy production facility and the destruction of the Klingon homeworld's ozone layer throws the Klingon Empire into turmoil. No longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a hostile footing, the Klingons sue for peace with their longstanding enemy, the United Federation of Planets. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons revert to a more belligerent approach, Starfleet sends the USS Enterprise-A to meet with the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to negotiations on Earth. Enterprises captain, James T. Kirk, whose son David was murdered by Klingons years earlier, opposes the negotiations and resents his assignment.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
