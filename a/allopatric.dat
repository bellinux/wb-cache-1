5|$|A {{year before}} their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Evolution which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of <b>allopatric</b> speciation might suggest a possible resolution.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on Gould moved away from wedding punctuated {{equilibrium}} to <b>allopatric</b> speciation, particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation. Gould was particularly attracted to Douglas Futuyma's work {{on the importance of}} reproductive isolating mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern or Chinese spot-billed duck is {{currently}} introgressing into the mallard {{populations of the}} Primorsky Krai, possibly due to habitat changes from global warming. The Mariana mallard was a resident <b>allopatric</b> populationin most respects a good speciesapparently initially derived from mallard-Pacific black duck hybrids; unfortunately, it became extinct in the late 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} Caspian Sea region in the east, and reach north to central Fennoscandia. Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern crested newt and the marbled newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, <b>allopatric</b> distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|E. eastwoodiae, E. nelsonii, E. rupestris, and E. verbenacea {{are also}} pollinated by hummingbirds. These four species {{as well as}} E. cardinalis and E. nelsonii produce {{bisexual}} flowers and are self-compatible. This approximate ratio of insect vs hummingbird pollination holds true {{for the rest of}} the genus. There have been two separate transformations to hummingbird pollination. Pollination changes are highly affected by changes in flower morphology. E. cardinalis and its sister species E. cinnabarina likely evolved via <b>allopatric</b> speciation.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the woolly hare(Lepus oiostolus),but is now {{treated as a}} separate species. Cai and Feng (1982) and Wang(1985) elevated it to species status based on morphological and ecological differences from the woolly hare. In 2005, {{it was found that}} molecular phylogenetics indicated the Yunnan hare and the woolly hare to be sister taxa, and they may exhibit <b>allopatric</b> speciation or parapatric speciation. It might also be related to the Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis) and probably be its northern form.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>allopatric</b> forms {{previously}} {{regarded as}} conspecific are treated by Rasmussen and Anderton as full species. Most of these {{had previously been}} proposed elsewhere, but the book introduced a number of innovations of its own. Experts on Asian birds, Nigel Collar and John Pilgrim, in 2008 analysed Rasmussen and Anderton's proposed changes, indicating which had previously been proposed by other authors, and which were novel, and required further justification.|$|E
5|$|Tatuidris tatusia is {{the only}} species in Tatuidris, a {{monotypic}} genus and {{one of only two}} extant genera in the subfamily Agroecomyrmecinae. A new species, T. kapasi, was described by Lacau & Groc in 2012, but has now been relegated to a junior synonym under T. tatusia based on the extent of the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad geographic range. Analysis of DNA barcodes indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing <b>allopatric</b> differentiation.|$|E
5|$|The second mode of {{speciation}} is peripatric speciation, {{which occurs}} when small populations of organisms become isolated {{in a new}} environment. This differs from <b>allopatric</b> speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically {{much smaller than the}} parental population. Here, the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.|$|E
5|$|During the Kimmeridgian, Europe {{was covered}} by the shallow inland Tethys Ocean, with exposed landmasses being a series of {{scattered}} archipelagos. Highly variable sea levels supported a highly diverse insular crocodilian fauna, with biodiversity (that of atoposaurids in particular) being driven strongly by <b>allopatric</b> speciation. The two species of Knoetschkesuchus were part of similar faunas, in both of which they functioned as small predators ecologically partitioned from the other contemporary crocodilians; {{it is likely that}} these faunas originated through dispersal over larger landmasses. A similar faunal exchange occurred with the Wessex-Weald Basin of England.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each {{basidiospore}} develops into a self-sterile mycelium which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., {{with all}} cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of P.stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated <b>allopatric</b> populations differ in bioluminescence and taste, {{the results revealed}} a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian collections, {{as well as between}} and within Oceanian collections.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{has been}} {{observed}} multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature. In sexually reproducing organisms, speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence. There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is <b>allopatric</b> speciation, which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by habitat fragmentation or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms. As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated {{from the rest of}} their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher (Toxostoma curvirostre) is a {{medium-sized}} mimid {{that is a}} member of the genus Toxostoma, native to the southwestern United States and much of Mexico. Referred to as the default desert bird, it is a non-migratory species. Several subspecies have been classified since 1827, though there is no consensus on the number. <b>Allopatric</b> speciation is believed to have played a major role in the variations of the curve-billed. It shares striking similarities in appearance with another Toxostoma member, Bendire's thrasher. Nevertheless, it is recognized for its grey color and sickle-shaped bill. It generally resides in desert regions of the United States and Mexico, but can inhabit areas predominately populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of <b>allopatric</b> speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E
5|$|Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori {{defined the}} new genus Neophema in 1891, placing the {{turquoise}} parrot within it {{and giving it}} its current scientific name. There is little geographical variation, with some minor local differences {{in the amount of}} orange on the belly. In 1915, Gregory Mathews described a subspecies dombrainii from Victoria on the basis of more prominent red on the scapulars; however, this distinction was not confirmed on review with New South Wales specimens, and hence no subspecies are recognised. One of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema, it is most closely related to the scarlet-chested parrot. The two are an <b>allopatric</b> species pair, and are the only two species in the genus to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism—where the male and female are different in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{requires}} {{a degree of}} reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in <b>allopatric</b> speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E
5|$|The crested newts are {{believed}} to have originated in the Balkans and radiated in a brief time interval between 11.5 and 8 mya: First, the Balkan–Asian group (the Anatolian, Balkan and southern crested newt) branched off from the other crested newts, probably in a vicariance event caused by the separation of the Balkan and Anatolian land masses. The origin of current-day species is not fully understood so far, but one hypothesis suggests that ecological differences, notably in the adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle, may have evolved between populations and led to parapatric speciation. Alternatively, the complex geological history of the Balkan peninsula may have further separated populations there, with subsequent <b>allopatric</b> speciation and the spread of species into their current ranges.|$|E
25|$|Parasites infect hosts {{within their}} same {{geographical}} area (sympatric) more effectively. This phenomenon supports the Red Queen hypothesis, {{which states that}} interactions between species, such as host and parasites, lead to constant natural selection for coadaptation. Parasites track the locally common hosts' phenotypes, so the parasites are less infective to <b>allopatric</b> hosts, those from different geographical regions. When populations of lake snails were exposed to two pure parasites (digenetic trematode), whether sympatric parasites, <b>allopatric</b> parasites or a mixture, the parasites were more effective in infecting their sympatric snails than their <b>allopatric</b> snails. The parasites were apparently adapted to infect local populations of snails.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} in assigning or removing species rank {{is compounded by}} the lack of data on behaviour and breeding patterns of the taxa. Similar species are <b>allopatric,</b> and there is no data on whether the species freely interbreed or not. Data on voice and behaviour is similarly poor.|$|E
25|$|The Congo's {{formation}} {{may have}} led to the <b>allopatric</b> speciation of the bonobo and the common chimpanzee from their most recent common ancestor. The bonobo is endemic to the humid forests in the region, as are other iconic species like the Allen's swamp monkey, dryas monkey, aquatic genet, okapi and Congo peafowl.|$|E
25|$|Apis florea and Apis andreniformis {{are small}} honey bees of {{southern}} and southeastern Asia. They make very small, exposed nests in trees and shrubs. Their stings are often incapable of penetrating human skin, so the hive and swarms {{can be handled}} with minimal protection. They occur largely sympatrically, though they are very distinct evolutionarily and {{are probably the result}} of <b>allopatric</b> speciation, their distribution later converging.|$|E
25|$|Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori erected the new genus Neophema in 1891, {{placing the}} scarlet-chested parrot within it {{and giving it}} its current {{scientific}} name. It is one of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema, and is most {{closely related to the}} turquoise parrot. The two are an <b>allopatric</b> species pair, and are the only two species in the genus to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|The {{rufous-naped lark}} is {{geographically}} very variable, and {{is taken to}} form a species complex with the <b>allopatric</b> red-winged lark of East Africa, and perhaps with the Somali lark. It is a smaller version of the first, with a finer bill and shorter tail, but their morphological and vocal features do not intergrade where their ranges meet. The rufous nape is an equivocal field character, being absent in the tropical races and in some individuals.|$|E
25|$|Bird song is an {{integral}} part of bird courtship and is a pre-zygotic isolation mechanism involved in the process of speciation. Many <b>allopatric</b> sub-species show differences in calls. These differences are sometimes minute, often detectable only in the sonograms. Song differences in addition to other taxonomic attributes have been used in the identification of new species. The use of calls has led to proposals for splitting of species complexes such as those of the Mirafra bushlarks.|$|E
25|$|Speciation is the lineage-splitting {{event that}} results in two {{separate}} species forming from a single common ancestral population. A widely accepted method of speciation is called <b>allopatric</b> speciation. <b>Allopatric</b> speciation begins when a population becomes geographically separated. Geological processes, such as the emergence of mountain ranges, the formation of canyons, or the flooding of land bridges by changes in sea level may result in separate populations. For speciation to occur, separation must be substantial, so that genetic exchange between the two populations is completely disrupted. In their separate environments, the genetically isolated groups follow their own unique evolutionary pathways. Each group will accumulate different mutations as well as be subjected to different selective pressures. The accumulated genetic changes may result in separated populations that can no longer interbreed if they are reunited. Barriers that prevent interbreeding are either prezygotic (prevent mating or fertilisation) or postzygotic (barriers that occur after fertilisation). If interbreeding is no longer possible, then they will be considered different species. The result of four billion years of evolution is the diversity of life around us, with an estimated 1.75million different species in existence today.|$|E
25|$|Four {{species of}} {{imperial}} pigeon {{are found in}} Philippines and Sulawesi. All have a distinct pale band across {{the centre of the}} tail, and a rich green or purple dorsum. This grouping shares characteristics and distribution with Ptilinopus, and forms a link between the genera. The pink-belled (D. poliocephala) and the white-bellied (D. forsteni) imperial pigeon are similar and <b>allopatric</b> species. The Mindoro (D. mindorensis) and the grey-headed (D. radiata) imperial pigeons differ in size but are otherwise similar.|$|E
25|$|The {{lesser grey shrike}} is {{a smaller}} and {{comparatively}} short-tailed bird. It can best be recognized by the rather large black area above the bill, almost reaching to the forehead and without a white stripe above it. In flight, the wide instead of pointed black tail end of L. minor is characteristic. The African species are completely <b>allopatric</b> with L. excubitor; they lack white scapulars (grey-backed fiscal) or wingspots (Mackinnon's fiscal) and differ in some other details, particularly the tail pattern.|$|E
25|$|The pied {{imperial}} pigeons form {{a discrete}} group of large white pigeons with black wingtips, found in New Guinea and its islands, and northern Australia. Goodwin recognised three species; the pied (D. bicolor) the white (D. luctuosa) and the Torresian (D. spilorrhoa). The three <b>allopatric</b> species {{are closely related}} and subsequent authors have challenged this ranking, Johnstone including all three in a single species. Gibbs et al. group D. bicolor and D. spilorrhoa together, but adds the yellow-tinted imperial pigeon (D. subflavescens) as another species. Frith includes D. subflavescens as a race of D. spilorrhoa. Sibley and Monroe (1990) follow Goodwin.|$|E
25|$|This {{species of}} white-headed tamarin {{is thought to}} have diverged from the other Amazonian forms such as S. leucopus. This is {{supported}} by morphological considerations of the transition from juvenile to adulthood, during which the fur coloration patterns change significantly and are similar between the two species. Hershkovitz proposed that the separation of the two species happened in the Pleistocene {{at the height of the}} Atrato River, where it intersected the Cauca-Magdalena. At that time, the area was covered by a sea, which created a geographic barrier that caused the species to diverge through the process of <b>allopatric</b> speciation. Today, the two species are principally separated by the Atrato River.|$|E
25|$|The Appalachian {{salamanders}} Plethodon hoffmani and P. cinereus display no morphological differences, eating habits, or {{resource use}} exploitation differences among <b>allopatric</b> populations; when the species occurs in sympatry; however, they exhibit morphological differentiation that {{is associated with}} segregation in prey size. Where these two species co-occur, P. hoffmani has a faster closing jaw required for larger prey, and P. cinereus has a slower, stronger jaw for smaller prey. Other studies have found Plethodon salamander species that demonstrate character displacement from aggressive behavioral interference rather than exploitation. That is, morphological character displacement between the two species is due to aggressive interaction between them rather than the exploitation of different food resources.|$|E
25|$|The Australian painted lady's {{distribution}} {{is restricted to}} Australia. The closely related V. cardui is found {{throughout the rest of}} the world, so the two species have an <b>allopatric</b> distribution. Within Australia, the Australian painted lady is commonly found throughout southern Australia, below the Tropic of Capricorn line. It is uncommon to find this butterfly in Queensland, and it is completely absent from the far north of the country, in the tropical rainforests. Although it is most common in Australia, it has also become common throughout New Zealand following periodic migrations across the sea, from Australia. Since the butterflies do not reproduce or overwinter in New Zealand, they are only considered an established species in Australia. Within its range, it is found in urban areas.|$|E
25|$|Ernst Mayr's key {{contribution}} to the synthesis was Systematics and the Origin of Species, published in 1942. It asserted the importance of {{and set out to}} explain population variation in evolutionary processes including speciation. He analysed in particular the effects of polytypic species, geographic variation, and isolation by geographic and other means. Mayr emphasized the importance of <b>allopatric</b> speciation, where geographically isolated sub-populations diverge so far that reproductive isolation occurs. He was skeptical of the reality of sympatric speciation believing that geographical isolation was a prerequisite for building up intrinsic (reproductive) isolating mechanisms. Mayr also introduced the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations. Before he left Germany for the United States in 1930, Mayr had been influenced by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch, who in the 1920s had analyzed the geographic distribution of polytypic species, paying particular attention to how variations between populations correlated with factors such as differences in climate.|$|E
500|$|The Danube {{crested newt}} {{is found in}} three <b>allopatric</b> areas of {{distribution}} from central to eastern Europe: ...|$|E
500|$|When Eldredge and Gould {{published}} their 1972 paper, <b>allopatric</b> speciation {{was considered}} the [...] "standard" [...] model of speciation. This model was popularized by Ernst Mayr in his 1954 paper [...] "Change of genetic environment and evolution," [...] and his classic volume Animal Species and Evolution (1963).|$|E
500|$|<b>Allopatric</b> {{speciation}} {{suggests that}} species with large central populations are stabilized by their large volume {{and the process}} of gene flow. New and even beneficial mutations are diluted by the population's large size and are unable to reach fixation, due to such factors as constantly changing environments. If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates. Smaller populations on the other hand, which are isolated from the parental stock, are decoupled from the [...] effects of gene flow. In addition, pressure from natural selection is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. If most evolution happens in these rare instances of <b>allopatric</b> speciation then evidence of gradual evolution in the fossil record should be rare. This hypothesis was alluded to by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper: ...|$|E
500|$|Early in his career, Gould and Niles Eldredge {{developed}} {{the theory of}} punctuated equilibrium, according to which evolutionary change occurs relatively rapidly, alternating with longer periods of relative evolutionary stability. It was Gould who coined the term [...] "punctuated equilibria", but the idea was first presented in Eldredge's doctoral dissertation on Devonian trilobites and {{in an article published}} the previous year on <b>allopatric</b> speciation.|$|E
