5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults <b>are</b> <b>terrified</b> of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E

500|$|The story {{takes place}} during three years (1933–35) of the Great Depression in the fictional [...] "tired old town" [...] of Maycomb, Alabama, {{the seat of}} Maycomb County.

Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer.

The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years.

500|$|In {{the second}} part, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under {{the more radical}} {{influence}} of Zawahiri and his rich Saudi acolyte Osama bin Laden, join the neoconservative-influenced Reagan administration to combat the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the Eastern Bloc begins to collapse in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the [...] "Evil Empire's" [...] defeat. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union {{was on the verge}} of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe they have the power to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and Algeria. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism to scare the people into rising up against their leaders. But the people <b>are</b> <b>terrified</b> by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way to hang on to power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims.|$|E
