Though Eriksson maintained in press conferences that {{his personal life}} was <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter,</b> his relationships with Jonsson in 2002 and Alam in 2004 were subject to tabloid headlines for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a CPRF member of the Duma, advocated {{for the removal of}} any reference to God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E
5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E

25|$|On 16 December 2009, the {{national}} Parliament debated whether to make homosexuality a criminal offense, with a punishment of 5–10 years' imprisonment.

Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama, however, condemned and refuted reports that the Government intended to criminalize homosexual acts, saying that sexual orientation is <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter,</b> not a state business.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{public schools}} have a sex {{education}} program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect {{at the onset of}} menarche (often this takes place during the 4th grade). Historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model. Then, and to an extent now, menstruation was <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> and a girl's menarche was not a community phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|The New Encyclopedia of Islam {{states that}} after the early period, with some notable exceptions, the {{practice}} in Islam regarding atheism or various forms of heresy, grew more tolerant {{as long as it}} was <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter.</b> However heresy and atheism expressed in public may well be considered a scandal and a menace to a society; in some societies they are punishable, at least to the extent the perpetrator is silenced.

25|$|Adultery is a {{crime in}} Taiwan and the Philippines. It was a crime in Japan until 1947 and until 2015, in South Korea.

Previously, adultery was criminalized in 1953, and violators were subject to 2 years in prison, {{with the aim of}} protecting women from divorce. The law was overturned because the court found that adultery is <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> which the state should not intervened in. Adultery is not a crime in Mainland China, but is a ground for divorce.|$|E

25|$|Most {{assemblies}} do {{not take}} an offering during the time their Sunday sermons are preached; but some, not all, do take an offering at the Breaking of Bread meetings. Only those in fellowship are expected to give. Many assemblies see tithing (the giving of 10 percent of one's income) as a commandment for Israel from the Old Testament law and not binding on Christians, although some assemblies do encourage tithing. Instead, the amount given is normally left to the giver and is <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> {{between the individual and}} the Lord.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Egyptian Islam was {{a complex and}} diverse religion. Although Muslims agreed on the faith's basic tenets, the country's various social groups and classes applied Islam {{differently}} in their daily lives. The literate theologians of Al-Azhar University generally rejected the version of Islam practiced by illiterate religious preachers and peasants in the countryside. Most upper- and upper-middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression was <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cut across class lines, were present in most cities and in many villages.|$|E
25|$|Though {{known to}} keep her faith <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter,</b> her {{religion}} and proximity to the king made her the target of anti-Catholic sentiment. Catherine occupied herself with her faith. Her piety was widely known and was a characteristic in his wife that the King greatly admired; in his letters to his sister, Catherine's devoutness is described almost with awe. Her household contained between four and six priests, and in 1665, Catherine decided to build a religious house east of St James's to be occupied by thirteen Portuguese Franciscans {{of the order of}} St Peter of Alcantara. It was completed by 1667 and would become known as The Friary.|$|E

The PRI has allied with the PAN to block legislation concerning LGBT rights in some states (except in two cases).

25|$|The Shia Ismaili {{caliphate}} of the Fatimids made Egypt their center, {{and made}} Cairo their capital. Egypt's various social groups and classes apply Islam differently {{in their daily}} lives. The literate theologians of Al-Azhar generally reject the popular version of Islam practised by religious preachers and peasants in the countryside, which is heavily Sufi-influenced. Sufism has flourished in Egypt since Islam was first adopted. Most upper- and middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression is <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life.

Sauvé did recover, and was released from care on March 3, though the illness had delayed her installation ceremony, which had been scheduled to take place that month.

25|$|Before the 1960s, most non-Pentecostal Christians who {{experienced}} the Pentecostal baptism in the Holy Spirit typically kept their experience <b>a</b> <b>private</b> <b>matter</b> or joined a Pentecostal church afterward. The 1960s saw a new pattern develop where {{large numbers of}} Spirit baptized Christians from mainline churches in the US, Europe, {{and other parts of}} the world chose to remain and work for spiritual renewal within their traditional churches. This initially became known as New or Neo-Pentecostalism (in contrast to the older classical Pentecostalism) but eventually became known as the Charismatic Movement. While cautiously supportive of the Charismatic Movement, the failure of Charismatics to embrace traditional Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking alcohol, smoking, and restrictions on dress and appearance initiated an identity crisis for classical Pentecostals, who were forced to reexamine long held assumptions about what it meant to be Spirit filled. The liberalizing influence of the Charismatic Movement on classical Pentecostalism can be seen in the disappearance of many of these taboos since the 1960s. Because of this, the cultural differences between classical Pentecostals and charismatics have lessened over time. The global renewal movements manifest many of these tensions as inherent characteristics of Pentecostalism and as representative of the character of global Christianity.|$|E

The courts were reluctant to impose any significant sanctions on those convicted of {{domestic violence}}, largely because it was viewed as a misdemeanor offense.|$|R
