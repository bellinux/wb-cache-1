Concepts of product quality are first reviewed and the key characteristics of Chinas international trade in fresh produce are outlined based on a detailed analysis from the UN Comtrade international trade data at the 2, 4 digit and finally 6 digit levels. High quality fresh and chilled vegetables are identified through their average unit export values. In 2005, China was the 4 th largest exporter of vegetables in the world with a 9. 8 percent share of world trade, and almost a 6 percent share in fresh and chilled vegetables. The competitiveness of China in world trade in high value fresh produce is assessed through a trade-shares accounting and decomposition approach which enables both structural and performance effects on Chinas exports to be isolated, and the contributions its major trading partners have made to changes its share of world trade.

Broadly this is the approach followed in the present paper; however, the trend 'parameter' capturing ultimate <b>market</b> <b>share</b> at a fixed level of price competitiveness is itself made a logistic function of the logarithm of the relative price variable measuring such competitiveness.

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{market performance}} in the U. S. food manufacturing product classes for 1982 and the effect cooperatives have as market participants. It addresses the public policy concern that cooperatives may obtain market power through favorable public policy and may exercise that market power {{to the detriment of}} society through under price-enhancement. Because of this concern the partial antitrust exemption granted cooperatives under the Capper-Volstead Act of 1992 is likely to re-emerge on the public policy agenda. A basic industrial organization structure-performance model extended by the theory of cooperatives is used to test the effect of cooperatives on market performance, here measured as the market's price-cost margin. After controlling for differences in the geographic size of markets and the effects of demand growth on prices, key structural elements affecting margins included measures of concentration, the degree of product differentiation and capital utilization and the minimum efficient scale. Cooperative theory predicts improved performance in markets where cooperatives are present through the 'competitive yardstick' effect. The underlying hypothesis that the degree of cooperative participation is inversely related to the level of price-cost margins has rarely been fully tested across a large cross section of food manufacturing markets because of limited market data on cooperation participation. This study used a Special Tabulation of Census of Manufacturers data for 1982 to construct a continuous variable representing the <b>aggregate</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of the 100 largest agricultural marketing cooperatives in each of 134 food product classes. This extended structure-performance model was then estimated using ordinary least squares methods. The cooperative share of market sales had a significant, negative impact on the level of margins supporting the yardstick effect hypothesis that cooperatives improve market performance. Product differentiation, measured by advertising-to-sales ratios, was positively related to margins but at a decreasing rate as advertising intensity increased. Capital intensity and minimum efficient scale were insignificant factors. These results serve to confirm the basic industrial organization model and provide empirical support for the competitive yardstick effect of cooperatives on market performance.

40|$|Financial {{framework}} {{conditions for}} the expansion of world trade are set to improve over the coming years. Nominal dollar interest rates may head downwards, for two reasons: deceleration of U. S. growth, and a lowering of international credit costs required to stabilize the fragile debt situation of many developing countries (the strong rise in dollar interest rates during 1994 has largely contributed towards the breaking of the Mexico crisis). The dollar may remain undervalued, thereby alleviating the debt burden not only of the U. S. but also of developing countries. Export buoyancy is expected to further shift towards the rising economies in South-East Asia and Latin America; reform countries in eastern Europe should also gain international market shares, while industrialized countries should see their <b>aggregate</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> fall. World trade growth is projected to accelerate from the pace obtaining since the mid- 1980 s, to an average 6 ½ percent p. a. until 1999. The three major economies – the U. S., Japan, and Germany – are expected to grow at a similar pace. U. S. output growth should attain around 2 ½ percent p. a., with falling dollar interest rates and a low exchange rate supporting both investment and exports. Fiscal consolidation may dampen growth only to a limited extent, as it is brought about primarily via higher taxes for top income earners who may accommodate the income squeeze by lowering their savings. Western European countries stand to benefit from the implementation of the single market and from EU enlargement, but the strive for convergence towards the Maastricht criteria will require severe measures of budget consolidation in many countries. In all, GDP in OECD-Europe is projected to rise at an annual average 2 ¼ percent, with the German economy expanding at a faster pace of 2 ¼ percent, due mainly to the ongoing catching-up process in the new Länder. In Japan, rapid growth of investment and exports is unlikely to continue, if only because of the largely overvalued Yen. Annual GDP growth up to 1999 is projected at 2 ½ percent.

40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{significance}} of the Arab import market for the global community this study focuses on how the market shares of leading exporters in the Arab world have evolved {{over the past two}} decades. In first part of the analysis I looked at the trends of these market shares over time and in comparison to other developing regions. I investigated the market shares of the United States, China, Japan and the <b>aggregate</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of four largest European economies (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom). Since GCC constitutes the largest and most important sub-regional import market inside the Arab world, the study focuses on GCC with more detail. The trend analysis revealed that during 1988 - 2007 the United States, Japan and European countries have lost market share in Arab markets. China’s market share, which was very small {{at the beginning of this}} period, enjoyed a substantial growth over these two decades. The market shares of European countries and the United States were relatively stable before 2000 and most of this market loss was realized during 2000 - 2007. For Japan on the other hand the market loss was most substantial during the first half of 1990 s followed by another noticeable loss during 2005 - 2007. China’s market share grew at a slow pace up until 2000, followed by faster growth during 2001 - 2007. In the second part of this analysis I used statistical regression models to investigate the impact of important geopolitical events on relative market shares of the same exporters that were studied in the first section. In {{light of the}} complex diplomatic and security relations between the United States and Arab countries it might be the case that Arab imports from the US are sensitive to the ups and downs of the US-Arab relations. To investigate this theory I focused on four important geopolitical events: Gulf War I (1991), Second Palestinian Intifada (2000 - 2001), The September 11 terror attack (2001) and the US invasion of Iraq (2003 - 2004). In my statistical model the dependent variables are the market shares of the leading exporters to each Arab country or bloc of countries. The statistical results suggest that the Gulf War I and the US invasion of Iraq have both been associated with changes in US market share in Arab imports. We observe a positive association between Gulf War I and the US market share in GCC countries and the aggregate imports of Arab countries in 1991 and 1992. On the other hand we observe a negative association between the invasion of Iraq and the US market share in aggregate imports of the Arab world. Among GCC countries this negative association is only significant for the US market share in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the analysis shows a strong and positive growth in market shares of Asia and Europe during 2003 and 2004 which are associated with the US invasion of Iraq. The results for the second intifada/September 11 event are mixed. This period is associated with an increase in US market share in Bahrain and a negative market share in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. No significant association is detected in other GCC countries or in the aggregate imports of GCC as a group. Nevertheless we observe a negative association between this pair of events and the US market share in the aggregate imports of Arab countries. ...|$|E

40|$|Product {{differentiation}} in durable-goods {{markets is}} often {{complicated by the}} fact that decision processes for the market participants are intrinsically dynamic. For example, consumers can employ a variety of consumption patterns with actions that vary in time, even for a single brand of goods. Transaction costs in selling used goods prompt consumers to think ahead in order to avoid adverse lock-ins, and hence have a strong influence on the endogenous formation of these patterns. Likewise, producers have to choose their production/pricing strategies so that the demands on new and used goods are balanced, and the percentages of sold and leased new goods are properly allocated. We study pricing issues in product differentiation under this kind of setting with both monopoly and duopoly market structures. In our model, products are vertically differentiated and are treated exogenously. Consumers are heterogeneous and have the incentive to segment themselves into various consumption classes. Producers can concurrently sell and lease new goods. When selling off-lease used goods producers need to incur disposal costs. Used-goods markets are assumed to be competitive.

40|$|EPA’s {{justification}} for proposing to reduce ethanol mandates in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is that consumer demand for ethanol is not {{high enough to}} meet the original targets. About 13. 7 billion gallons of ethanol can be consumed in E 10, which contains 10 % ethanol. The original mandate for conventional biofuel (widely assumed to be corn ethanol) was supposed to increase to 15 billion gallons in 2016. This would require that 1. 3 billion gallons of ethanol {{would need to be}} consumed in gasoline-ethanol blends that contain more than 10 % ethanol. The two blends that contain more than 10 % ethanol approved for sale are E 15 and E 85. The number of stations that sell E 15 is currently quite small whereas almost 3, 000 stations sell E 85. Thus EPA focuses on the contribution of potential E 85 sales to make its claim that there is insufficient demand for ethanol to support a mandate of 15 billion gallons. EPA writes in its proposed rule: “Thus we believe it is possible for the market to reach volumes perhaps as high as 600 million gallons under favorable pricing conditions” (p. 61). Adding this 600 million gallons to 13. 7 billion gallons of ethanol consumed in E 10 means that EPA believes that a maximum of 14. 3 billion gallons of ethanol can be consumed in the United States. This is why EPA proposes to reduce mandates for the non-advanced biofuel from 15 to 14 billion gallons in 2016. Estimation of the demand for E 85 requires data matching various E 85 price levels with the corresponding amount of E 85 sales. A rich source of data was provided to us that we used to estimate directly the proportion of U. S. owners of flex vehicles who buy E 85 at various price points. The data contains daily station fuel sales and prices of a major Midwest chain of retail gasoline outlets. We report on how owners of flex vehicles in two metropolitan areas respond to changes in the price of E 85 and extrapolate the results to the national level. Perhaps uniquely, this chain’s <b>aggregate</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> in these two metro areas was much greater than 90 %, thus allowing us to estimate the proportion of owners of flex vehicles in the area who chose to switch from E 10 to E 85 at various price levels. Using these new direct estimates of consumer demand, we find that owners of current flex vehicles in all US metro areas would consume 250 million gallons of E 85 if it was priced at parity on a cost per mile basis with E 10, and one billion gallons of ethanol if E 85 were priced to save drivers 23 % on a cost per mile basis. These estimates assume that no new E 85 stations are installed. If new stations were installed so that drivers in metro areas had the same driving distance to an E 85 station as drivers do in one of our study areas, then more than one billion gallons of ethanol would be consumed in E 85 in US metro areas if E 85 were priced to save FFV drivers 10 % on a cost per mile basis. These estimates significantly understate total US E 85 consumption because consumption in non-metro areas is not included. Our results show that meeting the original 15 billion gallon RFS ethanol target in 2016 is feasible. The two key conditions needed to meet this consumption level is to allow the market for RINs to work as intended, which will allow the price of E 85 to fall to induce consumers to buy the fuel, and for EPA to set a consistent policy signal to industry that they will indeed have to meet this target. A clear and consistent message from EPA is needed to foster investment in fueling stations that will allow enough consumers to access E 85...|$|E

Given our problem statement of Sect. 2 and the corresponding model (2)–(4), we are interested in <b>aggregate</b> measures (<b>market</b> <b>shares,</b> total patronage etc.) instead of individual choice probabilities. Data on customer demand are usually given as an aggregate measure (number of customers, for example).

The answer depends on the specification of the utility v_ij. If v_ij does not contain characteristics of the customers (age, income, and so forth) then the choice probability x_ij applies to all customers in i ∈ I in the same way and thus, (2) is a proper formulation. In contrast, the incorporation of customer characteristics in v_ij will improve the accurateness of x_ij (Koppelman and Bhat 2006, pp 21 – 23 and pp 41 – 46).

40|$|Discrete choice models {{estimated}} using hypothetical choices made in {{a survey}} setting (i. e., choice experiments) are widely used to estimate the importance of product attributes {{in order to make}} product design and marketing mix decisions. Choice experiments allow the researcher to estimate preferences for product features that do not yet exist in the market. However, parameters estimated from experimental data often show marked inconsistencies with those inferred from the market, reducing their usefulness in forecasting and decision making. We propose an approach for combining choice-based conjoint data with individual-level purchase data to produce estimates that are more consistent with the market. Unlike prior approaches for calibrating conjoint models so that they correctly predict <b>aggregate</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> for a "baseline" market, the proposed approach is designed to produce parameters that are more consistent with those that can be inferred from individual-level market data. The proposed method relies on a new general framework for combining two or more sources of individual-level choice data to estimate a hierarchical discrete choice model. Past approaches to combining choice data assume that the population mean for the parameters is the same across both data sets and require that data sets are sampled from the same population. In contrast, we incorporate in the model individual characteristic variables, and assert only that the mapping between individuals' characteristics and their preferences is the same across the data sets. This allows the model to be applied even if the sample of individuals observed in each data set is not representative of the population as a whole, so long as appropriate product-use variables are collected that can explain the systematic deviations between them. The framework also explicitly incorporates a model for the individual characteristics, which allows us to use Bayesian missing-data techniques to handle the situation where each data set contains different demographic variables. This makes the method useful in practice {{for a wide range of}} existing market and conjoint data sets. We apply the method to a set of conjoint and market data for minivan choice and find that the proposed method predicts holdout market choices better than a model estimated from conjoint data alone or a model that does not include demographic variables. discrete choice modeling, conjoint analysis, choice experiments, data enrichment, hierarchical models, missing-data methods, Bayesian estimation...|$|R

Marginal distributions are generally available at the census tract level, but joint distributions are only available for Metropoli-tan Statistical Areas which are generally much larger than the market for a single retail store. Joint distributions over demographics are an important input into mixed logit demand models for <b>aggregate</b> data. <b>Market</b> <b>shares</b> that vary systematically with demographics are essential for relieving the restrictions imposed by the Independence from Irrelevant Alternative property of the logit model. We approach this problem by formulating a parametric function that incorporates both the city-wide joint distributional information and marginal information specific to the retail store’s market area. To estimate the function, we form moment conditions equating the moments of the parametric function to observed data, and we input these into a GMM objective. In one of our illustrations we use four marginal demographic distributions from each of eight stores in Dominick’s Finer Foods data archive to estimate a four dimensional joint distribution for each store. Our results show that our GMM approach produces estimated joint distributions that differ substantially from the product of marginal distri...|$|R
40|$|Loyalty {{discounts}} are nonlinear tariffs {{that condition}} rebates or marginal prices on meeting <b>aggregate</b> purchase or <b>market</b> <b>share</b> targets. These discounts are widespread, {{and are often}} the impetus for consumers to form buying groups, or group purchase organizations (GPOs). This paper models the competitive effects of {{the introduction of a}} GPO into a market within which the preferences of the GPO's members are horizontally differentiated. While nonlinear tariffs are an effective way for a monopolist to extract consumer surplus, when two suppliers compete using such schedules, the results are far more competitive in comparison to simple Bertrand–Nash competition with linear tariffs. This result holds when the product of each of the suppliers is attractive to a substantial portion of consumers. In our model, the nonlinear schedule puts all customers “in play ” to a degree that contrasts sharply with the competition at the margin characteristic of constant per unit prices. Moreover, competing in nonlinear tariffs removes allocative inefficiency that can result from single price competition...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} the {{development}} of an <b>aggregate</b> air itinerary <b>market</b> <b>share</b> model. In order to achieve this, multinomial logit models are applied to distribute the city-pair passenger demand across the available itineraries. The models are developed at an aggregate level using open-source booking data for a large group of city-pairs within the US air transport system. Although there is a growing trend in the use of discrete choice models in the aviation industry, existing air itinerary share models are mostly focused on supporting carrier decision-making. Consequently, those studies define itineraries at a more disaggregate level using variables describing airlines and time preferences. In this study, we define itineraries at a more aggregate level, i. e. as a combination of flight segments between an origin and destination, without further insight into service preferences. Although results show some potential for this approach, there are challenges associated with prediction performance and computational intensity...|$|R
40|$|Ten years ago, {{persistent}} dysfunctionalities on mortgage markets {{inherited from}} the previous decade greatly contributed to the largest financial crisis in half a century. Since then, significant deleveraging processes have been observed in some EU markets, such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain, where the ratios of outstanding residential lending to household disposable income have contracted markedly. In these economies, the 2016 volumes recorded for both outstanding and gross residential lending were much below 2007 levels, although a timid recovery could be observed in recent years. By contrast, the volume of mortgage activities moved around significant upward paths in Belgium, France, Germany and Sweden, and stagnated somewhat in the Netherlands and Denmark. In terms of products, excluding Sweden, the share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) for gross residential lending has been moving along downward trends in all the analysed mortgage markets. And these downward trends have deepened in all countries (excluding the UK and Sweden) {{in the last three}} years. As a result, the <b>aggregate</b> ARM <b>market</b> <b>share</b> contracted markedly in the last decade. Whereas fluctuations in current spreads between ARM rates and fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) rates appeared overall to be a powerful driver behind the ARM <b>market</b> <b>share</b> over the last decade, this impact seemed to trail off in the last four years. In the current context where FRMs are considered to be historically low, many households are likely to anticipate increases in fixed interest rates on the foreseeable horizon, resulting in greater preference for FRMs, no matter the level of spreads. Other factors related to mortgage and household characteristics could also impact on this preference for FRMs: the average amount of mortgages, evolution of household income, etc. Finally, some encouraging signs of convergence in recent years in spreads, ARM <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> as well as ratios of household residential debt to disposable income could contribute somehow to reinforcing the consistency and efficiency of euro monetary policy...|$|R
40|$|We thank James Peck and {{participants}} in an Ohio State University seminar for helpful comments. Loyalty discounts are nonlinear tariffs that condition rebates or marginal prices on meeting <b>aggregate</b> purchase or <b>market</b> <b>share</b> targets. These discounts are widespread, {{and are often}} the impetus for consumers to form buying groups, or group purchase organizations (GPOs). This paper models the competitive effects of {{the introduction of a}} GPO to a market for which the GPO’s member preferences are horizontally differentiated. We show that although in a monopoly setting, nonlinear tariffs are an effective way to extract consumer surplus, when suppliers compete using such schedules, the results are far more competitive than simple Bertrand-Nash competition with linear tariffs. In our model, the nonlinear schedule puts all customers “in play ” to a degree that contrasts sharply with the competition at the margin characteristic of constant perunit prices. We demonstrate that asymmetry in preferences does not disturb the efficiency or the price advantage for consumers of our results, but that with asymmetrical preferences, <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> for the preferred supplier are higher than under constant per-unit prices. Finally, we examine the effects of bundling discount schedules across product categories when oligopolists compete with nonlinear tariffs...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze the evolution of domestic Origin- Destination (O-D) traffic and fares at the Top 200 airports in the United States between 1990 and 2008. The impetus behind this research is {{to shed light on}} the differences in trends between the largest and smallest, primary and secondary, hub and non-hub airports, and to measure the impact of Low Cost carriers (LCC) on traffic, fares and competition. Furthermore, case studies of five multi-airport systems located within major US metropolitan areas were performed to identify the trends shaping multi-airport systems. We find that domestic O-D passenger traffic at the Top 200 commercial airports in the United States increased by more than 52 % between 1990 and 2005, but dropped by 2 % from 2005 to 2008 because of the global economic downturn. Average fares at the Top 200 airports increased by 14 % during the "golden 90 s", decreased by 13 % between 2000 and 2005, but rebounded by 16 % between 2005 and 2008, as a result of soaring jet fuel prices and reduced capacity. Low Cost carriers' share of the total domestic O-D traffic in the US is still growing, although leveling off, reaching 34 % in 2008. LCC entry focused initially on largest airports, then grew rapidly in second and third airport tiers. As a result, in 2008, 95 of the Top 200 airports had an LCC <b>aggregated</b> <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than 20 %, up from 27 airports in 1990. We show that LCC's effective entrance or substantial growth at a particular airport had a significant impact lowering average fares and stimulating passenger volumes. However in recent years, this market stimulation effect has been leveling off, as the gap in average fares between LCC and Network Legacy carriers (NLC) has narrowed. Secondary airports {{played a critical role in}} accommodating the increase in demand for air traffic in the nation's largest metropolitan areas: They served 19. 8 % of the total domestic O-D passenger traffic in the 15 studied multi-airport systems in 2008, compared to 16. 9 % in 1990, highlighting their increasing importance. Finally, the airport concentration levels, as measured by the average weighted Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, increased by 8 % during the studied period, demonstrating that the Top 200 -airport sample is more concentrated in 2008 compared to 1990. by Mehdi Ben Abda.

40|$|Modeling <b>aggregate</b> <b>market</b> {{response}} is a core issue in marketing research. In this research, we extend previous forecasting comparative research {{by comparing the}} forecasting accuracy of feed-forward neural network models to the premier market modeling technique, Multiplicative Competitive Interaction (MCI) models. Forecasts are compared in two separate studies: (1) the Information Resources Inc. (IRI) coffee dataset from Marion, IN and (2) the A. C. Nielsen catsup dataset from Sioux Falls, SD. Our results suggest neural networks are a useful substitute for MCI models when there are too few observations available to estimate a fully-extended MCI model. Implications are discussed.
