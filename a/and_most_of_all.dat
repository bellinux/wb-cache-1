5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> to heart.|$|E
5|$|While Tiberius was in Capri, rumours abounded as to {{what exactly}} he was doing there. Suetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, {{including}} graphic depictions of child molestation, and cruelty, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> his paranoia. While heavily sensationalized, Suetonius' stories at least {{paint a picture of}} how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.|$|E
5|$|While {{the actual}} pitched battle was short, the French infantry, under Marshal Marmont, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the cavalry, under General Emmanuel de Grouchy, {{launched}} a relentless pursuit that rode down the enemy. Retreating in slow-moving square formations {{in broad daylight}} and along some excellent cavalry terrain, the Coalition forces suffered very heavy losses, with several squares broken by the French cavalry. At nightfall, combat ceased and Blücher opted for an exhausting night march {{in order to take}} his remaining forces to safety.|$|E

5|$|I have labored {{to make a}} {{covenant}} with myself, that affection may not press upon judgment; for I suppose there is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it. And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of de Vere? For where is Bohun? Where is Mowbray? Where is Mortimer? Nay, which is more, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.|$|E
5|$|The 1859 {{publication}} of Darwin's theory in On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life is often considered the central {{event in the}} history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous Vestiges of Creation had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and common descent {{by the end of the}} 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.|$|E

25|$|Gallo is also {{threatened}} by the Breton language revival, because Breton is gaining ground in territories that were not previously part of the main Breton-speaking area, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> because Breton appears as the national language of Brittany, thus leaving no place for Gallo.|$|E
25|$|We were magic {{from the}} time he walked out from the curtain …you don't try to explain those things. You just take them and you use them and you enjoy them <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> you {{appreciate}} them, because they don't happen often, they happen once in a rare while.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses are {{generally}} safe {{as long as}} they are used correctly. Complications from contact lens wear affect roughly 5% of wearers yearly. Improper use of a contact lens may affect the eyelid, the conjunctiva, <b>and,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> the whole structure of the cornea. Poor lens care can lead to infections by various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and Acanthamoeba (Acanthamoeba keratitis).|$|E

25|$|The pre-history of {{the valley}} of the Draa goes back {{thousands}} of years, as is evidenced by the many rock art engravings or petroglyphs in its surroundings <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> by the find of the Venus of Tan-Tan. This statue is possibly the oldest human figurine ever found. It dates back more than three hundred thousand years.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{stability}} of the Principate was continually shaken by the Saracen attacks <b>and,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> by internal struggles. In 1056, one of the numerous plots led to the fall of Guaimar. His weaker son Gisulf II succeeded him, but the decline of the principality had begun. In 1077 Salerno reached its zenith but soon lost all its territory to the Normans.|$|E
25|$|From his {{length of}} {{practice}} and time with Morihei Ueshiba, Ruddock {{was one of the}} most experienced Aikidoka in Europe but it's widely acknowledged in Aikido circles that he was very discreet about it, which was in keeping with his teaching style: humble, kind and not aggressive but yet very focused and relaxed when he moved <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> very effective.|$|E

40|$|Hal Maier {{has played}} many roles in my life: {{he has been}} my teacher, my boss, my advisor, my colleague, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>and</b> best <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> my friend. In all those roles, he has {{exhibited}} enthusiasm, patience, tact, and brilliance. Not at all a bad combination, I would say. This is an article in tribute to Harold G. Maier...|$|R
25|$|Opponents {{of the law}} {{claimed that}} the {{government}} didn’t seek advice from the students adequately. They were also unsatisfied that minority ethnic languages would not be taught at institutes of higher education. They also stated that under the new law, universities would not be independent from Ministry of Education <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> {{they point out that}} the law will not recognize the formation of student and teacher unions.|$|E
25|$|When MacKillop {{returned}} to Australia in January 1875, after {{an absence of}} nearly two years, she brought approval from Rome for her sisters and the work they did, materials for her school, books for the convent library, several priests <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> 15 new Josephites from Ireland. Regardless of her success, she still {{had to contend with}} the opposition of priests and several bishops. This did not change after her unanimous election as superior general in March 1875.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2016, the BI market noted record profits of approximately $9 billion, as modern suites respond to greater productivity demands than plain data analytics.

Another recognizable feature is customization, which allows companies to make every BI system work {{in accordance with their}} operational rules.|$|E

50|$|Dunja Knebl is most {{noted for}} her crystal-clear voice and very simple music arrangements, often only with improvised {{instruments}} or even without any. The songs she sings are slow, mellow and often sad <b>and</b> melancholic. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> {{she likes to}} record songs she has never heard.|$|R
50|$|His large map of Brazil, an {{important}} event in cartography {{was published in}} 1647.

25|$|Brittany {{has several}} {{historical}} capital cities. When {{it was an}} independent duchy, the Estates of Brittany, which {{can be compared to}} a parliament, met in various towns: Dinan, Ploërmel, Redon, Rennes, Vitré, Guérande, <b>and,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> Vannes, where they met 19 times, and Nantes, 17 times. The Court and the government were also very mobile, and each dynasty favoured its own castles and estates. The dukes mostly lived in Nantes, Vannes, Redon, Rennes, Fougères, Dol-de-Bretagne, Dinan and Guérande. It is interesting to notice that all these towns except Vannes are located in Upper Brittany, thus not in the Breton speaking area.|$|E
25|$|Roger Bacon (1214–94), Doctor Admirabilis, {{joined the}} Franciscan Order around 1240 where, {{influenced}} by Grosseteste, Alhacen and others, he dedicated himself to studies where he implemented {{the observation of}} nature and experimentation {{as the foundation of}} natural knowledge. Bacon wrote in such areas as mechanics, astronomy, geography <b>and,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> optics. The optical research of Grosseteste and Bacon established optics as an area of study at the medieval university and formed the basis for a continuous tradition of research into optics that went {{all the way up to}} the beginning of the 17th century and the foundation of modern optics by Kepler.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} consequences of the Secular Franciscan charism is that the spiritual formation of the OFS must cater for those whose vocation is, motivated by the dynamic power of the Gospel, to live in secular circumstances. Intimate union with Christ {{lies at the heart of}} the OFS vocation. Therefore, Secular Franciscans should seek to encounter the living and active person of Christ in their brothers and sisters, in Sacred Scripture, in the Church and in liturgical activity. They do this by studying, loving <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> by living in an integrated way the human and evangelical aspects of their life.|$|E

5|$|Taoism {{tends to}} {{emphasize}} various {{themes of the}} I Ching, the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, detachment from desires, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> important <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> wu wei. However, the concepts of those keystone texts cannot be equated with Taoism as a whole.|$|R
