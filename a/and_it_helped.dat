5|$|Regarded as {{pioneers of}} live music {{performance}} and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, {{making use of}} innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems. From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic rock music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London. Their slide-and-light show {{was one of the}} first in British rock, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> them become popular among London's underground.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxable value}} of an estate was {{initially}} assessed from the Domesday Survey, but other methods were later employed, such as valuations based on the sworn testimony of neighbours or {{on the number of}} plough-teams the taxpayer used. Carucage never raised as much as other taxes, but nevertheless helped to fund several projects. It paid the ransom for Richard's release in 1194, after he was taken prisoner by Leopold V, Duke of Austria; it covered the tax John had to pay Philip II of France in 1200 on land he inherited in that country; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> to finance Henry III's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood {{directors}} and writers, the Hollywood Ten, intending {{to ask them}} to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a blacklist which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged, prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress Jean Muir, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.|$|E

5|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{football}} evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Côte d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|Other promotional campaigns {{included}} introducing bound {{versions of}} {{the first chapter of}} the novel, across city bookstores. Tripathi felt that a celebrity name associated with the book would do wonders for its promotion. Hence he sent the book to various known faces in the publishing world like Anil Dharker and Prahlad Kakkar. Ultimately, when Tripathi's agent Tiwari decided to publish around 5,000 copies of the book himself, they already had the celebrity preview attached to it, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> in promotion. The UK publication rights of the Shiva trilogy, including The Immortals of Meluha was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books, with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group, acting on behalf of the author and Bahri from Red Ink Literary Agency. The book would be released in the United States in summer 2013. In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album is an extension of The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech in the books. Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album. This was the first time ever that an original soundtrack was made for a book series.|$|E

25|$|Many Coptic intellectuals hold to Pharaonism, {{which states}} that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep {{heritage}} in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> bridge the divide between those groups.

25|$|Paradise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton (1608–1674). The first version, {{published}} in 1667, consisted of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged into twelve books (in {{the manner of}} Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout and {{a note on the}} versification. It is considered by critics to be Milton's major work, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> solidify his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest English poets of his time.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the exact}} legal {{implications}} of the judgement are unclear when analysed by lawyers, the judgement was generally taken {{at the time to}} have determined that slavery did not exist under English common law and was thus prohibited in England.

Somersett's case became {{a significant part of the}} common law of slavery in the English-speaking world <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> launch the movement to abolish slavery.|$|E

The band had also gained great success in Japan where the single Motorcycle Man had stayed in the charts for almost 6 months.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolution}} was {{unusual for the}} surprise it created throughout the world: it lacked many of the customary causes of revolution (defeat at war, a financial crisis, peasant rebellion, or disgruntled military), occurred in a nation that was experiencing relative prosperity, produced profound change at great speed, was massively popular, resulted in the exile of many Iranians, and replaced a pro-Western authoritarian monarchy with an anti-Western authoritarian theocracy based {{on the concept of}} Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists (or velayat-e faqih).

25|$|Among Indo-European peoples, astrology {{has been}} dated to the 3rd {{millennium}} BC, with roots in calendrical systems {{used to predict}} seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Until the 17th century, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> drive the development of astronomy. It was commonly accepted in political and cultural circles, {{and some of its}} concepts were used in other traditional studies, such as alchemy, meteorology and medicine. By the end of the 17th century, emerging scientific concepts in astronomy, such as heliocentrism, were irrevocably undermining the theoretical basis of astrology, which subsequently lost its academic standing.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, 1996, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the re-branding to US Airways, the airline placed an order for up to 400 Airbus A320-series narrow body aircraft, with 120 firm orders {{at the time of}} the order signing. At the time, the order was regarded as the largest bulk aircraft request in history. In 1998, the airline followed with an order for up to 30 Airbus A330-series wide-body aircraft, with an initial firm order for seven of the Airbus A330-300 airliners.

Custer reported killing 103 warriors and some women and children; 53 women and children were taken as prisoners. Estimates by the Cheyenne of their casualties were substantially lower (11 warriors plus 19 women and children). Custer had his men shoot most of the 875 Indian ponies they had captured. The Battle of Washita River was regarded as the first substantial U.S. victory in the Southern Plains War, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> force {{a significant portion of the}} Southern Cheyenne onto a U.S.-assigned reservation.|$|E
