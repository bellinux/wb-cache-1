5|$|The Landing at Lae was an amphibious landing to {{the east}} of Lae and then the {{subsequent}} advance on the town during the Salamaua–Lae campaign of World War II. Part of Operation Postern, which was undertaken to capture the Japanese base at Lae, the landing was undertaken between 4 and 6 September 1943 by Australian troops from the 9th Division, supported by US naval forces from the VII Amphibious Force. The first major amphibious operation undertaken by the Australian Army since the failed Gallipoli Campaign, the Australians invested a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> into planning the operation.|$|E

The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers shored up the port side of the hull with bags of grout, installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.|$|E

In an earlier interview, Baba commented that the team behind the series put a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and development in keeping the series fresh while retaining the base elements across each installment. The positive reaction of gamers in the US to Symphonia influenced the way the various teams developed titles after that point. Speaking in 2014, production manager Denis Lee said that, since Symphonias release, the popularity of the series has grown. In response, Bandai Namco have focused on getting more entries out in western territories. Much of their research about what titles to release or develop in the future revolves around direct conversation with Tales series fans at gaming conventions and special events.|$|E

Self-efficacy {{is thought to be}} predictive of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioural change, so although self-efficacy is not a behavioural change theory per se, it is an important element of many of the theories, including the health belief model, the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} sound {{generated}} by flow over cavities {{at high speed}} has been well funded {{by the federal government}} so a considerable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> has been made. The problem relates to flow over aircraft cavities in flight such as bomb bays or wheel wells. Flow over a cavity in a surface can result in excitation of a feedback loop and nearly pure tones. Unlike the edge tone noted above, the cavity edge is typically square, but also can be an edge as part of a thin structural shell. Cavities can be separated into shallow or deep ones, the difference being that for deep cavities a Class III (acoustical) feedback path may be controlling. Shallow cavities are addressed here and are those in which the cavity length L is greater than the cavity depth D.|$|E

25|$|The {{merchant}} vessel The Abyssinian, of 1000 tons, arrived at Ascension Island on 16 May 1856 in a sinking state with five {{feet of water}} in her hold and the water rising {{at a rate of}} two feet an hour. The master and crew were exhausted from pumping and stated {{that they were going to}} abandon her. Instead, between 18 May and 22 July 111 men, crew from Tortoise and 24 Africans, removed 800 tons of cargo from The Abyssinian, uncovering the leak, which they fixed. Then over 17 days Tortoises boats returned the cargo. The master tendered a payment of £800. She then continued on her journey to London. The salvors took the case to court, which found that value of the salvage was £23,464. The court ruled that given the value of the vessel and cargo, her state, and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> expended to save the voyage and cargo, £800 was too little. It awarded them £1,500. Shares were allocated in proportion to the number of days each salvor was employed on the occasion.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that, {{in addition to}} its base functions, the insula {{may play a role in}} certain higher-level functions that operate only in humans and other great apes. The spindle neurons found at a higher density in the right frontal insular cortex are also found in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is another region that has reached a high level of specialization in great apes. It has been speculated that these neurons are involved in cognitive-emotional processes that are specific to primates including great apes, such as empathy and metacognitive emotional feelings. This is supported by functional imaging results showing that the structure and function of the right frontal insula is correlated with the ability to feel one's own heartbeat, or to empathize with the pain of others. It is thought that these functions are not distinct from the lower-level functions of the insula but rather arise as a consequence of the role of the insula in conveying homeostatic information to consciousness. The right anterior insula aids interoceptive awareness of body states, such as the ability to time one's own heartbeat. Moreover, greater right anterior insular gray matter volume correlates with increased accuracy in this subjective sense of the inner body, and with negative emotional experience. It is also involved in the control of blood pressure, in particular during and after exercise, and its activity varies with the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> a person believes he/she is exerting.|$|E
