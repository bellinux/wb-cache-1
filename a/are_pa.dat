50|$|Thus, using John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern {{expected}} utility functions, Fearon {{finds the}} expected utility for war for states A and B, which <b>are</b> <b>PA</b> - CA and (1 - PA) - CB, where PA is A's probability {{of winning a}} war, CA is A's costs for war (proportional to how much they value the utility), and CB is B's costs for war (proportional to how much they value the utility). With simplification, if X is A's share of a peaceful settlement, Fearon finds that peace is better than war when PA - CA < X < PA + CB. A satisfactory X exist if PA + CB > PA - CA, or CA + CB > 0. Because CA and CB are individually greater than 0, so is their sum. Therefore, the inequality holds and so some settlement is mutually preferable to war.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a class of}} integrity constraints which describe admissible lifecycles of database objects, and which can be specified by transition graphs. We present an algorithmic scheme for monitoring such constraints in temporal databases which efficiently support the concept of valid-time. The keys to efficient monitoring lie in storing lifecycle situations with respect to constraints, in utilizing the property of graphs being iteration-invariant, and in using basic operations of temporal databases to determine validity intervals. In particular, we give hints how to extend monitoring to transactions that involve retroactive and proactive modifications. 1 Introduction Specifying and monitoring integrity constraints is essential for every kind of database application system {{in order to ensure}} its correctness and reliability. This applies to temporal databases as it has applied to conventional (nontemporal) databases. In conventional databases, integrity constraints <b>are</b> <b>pa</b> [...] ...|$|E

The logic of PRA allows only quantifier-free formulas, which are thought of as being universally quantified, and PRA has the induction scheme for quantifier-free formulas, expressed as a proof rule. Also, for each primitive recursive function f, PRA contains a function symbol for f and has the recursive definition of f as an axiom. Clearly, PRA is much weaker tha [...] ...|$|E
