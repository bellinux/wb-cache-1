As the demand for non-business began during the first battles of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, the agency had to change {{its name to the}} St. Petersburg <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Agency</b> (SPTA). As there was no change of headquarters and almost no change in its staff and function, it was a mere rebranding.|$|R

50|$|While the {{government}} continued its censorship policy, {{the number of}} daily and weekly newspapers grew beyond its control. The solution was to slant the news before it was published. This {{was done by the}} St. Petersburg <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Agency,</b> which supported the tsars while increasing the public's political literacy. Between 1904 and 1917 it circulated factual information supplied by {{the government}} in order to create public opinion supporting the country's rapid industrialization as promoted by Sergei Witte, the Minister of Finance. Recognizing the power of the news agency for propaganda purposes, the Bolsheviks took over the <b>telegraph</b> <b>agency</b> in 1917.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the turn}} of the century (i.e., circa 1900), Wolff, Havas, and Reuters formed a news cartel, {{dividing}} up the global market into three sections, in which each had more-or-less exclusive distribution rights and relationships with national agencies. Each agency's area corresponded roughly to the colonial sphere of its mother country. Reuters and the Australian national news service had an agreement to exchange news only with each other. Due to the high cost of maintaining infrastructure, political goodwill, and global reach, newcomers found it virtually impossible to challenge the big three European agencies or the American Associated Press. In 1890 Reuters (in partnership with the Press Association, England's major news agency for domestic stories) expanded into [...] "soft" [...] news stories for public consumption, about topics such as sports and [...] "human interest". In 1904, the big three wire services opened relations with Vestnik, the news agency of Czarist Russia, to their group, though they maintained their own reporters in Moscow. During and after the Russian Revolution, the outside agencies maintained a working relationship with the Petrograd <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Agency,</b> renamed the Russian <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Agency</b> (ROSTA) and eventually the <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Agency</b> of the Soviet Union (TASS).|$|R
