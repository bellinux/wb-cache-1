They climbed to #3 the following week as the Horns beat Baylor and former #3 Penn State lost. The win over Baylor was the 829th win for the UT football program, which tied Notre Dame for 2nd {{in the list of}} college football's ten most victorious programs.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{win over}} Leicester City, Burnley were drawn against Queens Park Rangers at Turf Moor in the Second Round. Despite <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>performance</b> by their opponents, Burnley progressed to the Third Round with a 4–2 win, in which Bob Kelly struck {{twice in the}} first half and Joe Anderson scored either side of half time. In the Third Round, Burnley were handed an away tie at Hull City, who at the time were {{struggling}} in the Football League Second Division and had won only two matches in the previous five months. Despite being without first-team regulars George Halley and Joe Anderson through injury, Burnley were expected to win comfortably, not having lost since 4September 1920. Hull City played above all expectations and Burnley suffered a 0–3 defeat after being 0–1 behind at half time.|$|E

Proposed- 1 - 1 model exhibits <b>a</b> <b>good</b> TMD stroke reduction performance under pulse-type ground motion against Proposed- 1 model while the structural response under long-period ground motion increases. Proposed- 1 - 2 model has <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reduction <b>performance</b> of TMD spring reaction under long-period ground motion and pulse-type ground motion against Proposed- 1 model. Proposed- 1 - 3 model shows <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reduction <b>performance</b> of structural response under long-period ground motion against Proposed- 1 model while the TMD-supporting member reactions under long-period ground motion and pulse-type ground motion cause some problems. Proposed- 2 model exhibits <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reduction <b>performance</b> of TMD stroke under pulse-type ground motion against Proposed- 1 model and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reduction <b>performance</b> of TMD-supporting inertial mass damper reaction under long-period ground motion and pulse-type ground motion against Imass TMD model. Imass model shows <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reduction <b>performance</b> of structural response under long-period ground motion against Proposed- 1 model while the TMD-supporting member reactions under long-period ground motion and pulse-type ground motion cause some problems.

In 2005 the club was demoted to the Série B, the second level of the Brasileirão.|$|E

He {{appeared in the}} BBC productions Clarissa and Lady Chatterley (1993) with Joely Richardson. In 1990, Bean starred in Jim Sheridan's adaption of the John B. Keane play The Field. Also in 1990, {{his role as the}} journalist Anton in Windprints examined the difficult problems of apartheid in South Africa. In 1996, he combined his love of football with his career to finally achieve his childhood dream of playing for Sheffield United, as Jimmy Muir in the film When Saturday Comes. Although the film was not critically acclaimed, Bean received credit for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>performance.</b> In August 1997, Bean appeared in what became a famous Sky Sports commercial for the upcoming 1997–98 Premier League season. His football related work continued in 1998 when he narrated La Coupe de la Gloire, the official film of the 1998 FIFA World Cup held in France.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} public and one private {{universities}} in Hong Kong, the oldest being the University of Hong Kong (HKU), established in 1910–1912. The Chinese University of Hong Kong {{was founded in}} 1963 to fulfill {{the need for a}} university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. Competition among students to receive an offer for an undergraduate programme is fierce as the annual number of intakes is limited, especially when some disciplines are offered by select tertiary institutions, like medicine which is provided by merely two medical schools in the territory, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those who fail to enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university if they have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>performance</b> in these sub-degree courses.|$|E

5|$|As local {{football}} {{continued to}} expand after the war, {{and with the}} success of the newly formed Yorkshire League, demand for another senior team in York arose. At a meeting held at the Co-operative Hall in York on 6 May 1922, {{the decision was made to}} form the York City Association Football and Athletic Club Limited, with W. H. Shaw as chairman. Despite having neither a ground nor players, an application was made for election to the Football League; this was unsuccessful, but the club was admitted to the Midland League on 10 June 1922. York's first match was away to Notts County reserves on 6 September 1922, and despite <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>performance</b> the team lost 4–2. York had to play their first two home matches at Mille Crux, the ground of Messrs Rowntree & Company Limited, because their Fulfordgate ground was not ready. Their first match at Fulfordgate came on 20 September 1922, with a 4–1 victory against Mansfield Town. York finished 1922–23 in 19th place; they had been placed midtable in early March 1923 but failed to win any of their remaining 14 fixtures. In the same year, York reached the final of the North Riding Senior Cup, but lost 4–2 to Middlesbrough reserves at Ayresome Park on 10 March 1923. The club's first season proved disappointing financially, with a loss of £718 reported, and as a consequence Shaw relinquished the chairmanship to Arthur Brown. York entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1923–24 and reached the first qualifying round, losing 3–1 to Mexborough Town in a second replay. They again ranked 19th in the table with an almost identical record to the previous season's.|$|E
