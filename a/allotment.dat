5|$|As late as December 31, neither {{team had}} sold its entire <b>allotment</b> of 17,500 tickets. Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's <b>allotment.</b> Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} fans who avoided paying face value for tickets—US$125—by buying them on the {{secondary}} market, often {{for as little as}} 99 cents.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its <b>allotment</b> of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket <b>allotment.</b> An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket <b>allotment</b> and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E

The <b>allotments</b> ranged in size from 27-40 acres, and were known as the Drayton Swamp Agricultural Reserve. Six of these [...] "Swamp allotments" [...] were offered at auction in November 1849. As there were no bidders for these <b>allotments,</b> they were resubmitted to auction in October 1850, at which time William Horton, a publican of Drayton, {{acquired}} <b>allotments</b> five and six. <b>Allotments</b> one to four and the remaining six <b>allotments</b> were auctioned in March 1851; <b>allotments</b> seven to nine were acquired by Horton and <b>allotments</b> 10-12 were purchased by Sydney businessmen Thomas Sutcliffe Mort and Alexander Campbell Brown, and their Toowoomba partner Thomas Ayerst.

The territory of Croatia was split into nine digital-TV <b>allotment</b> regions. The analog broadcast network was switched off gradually (by the digital-TV <b>allotment</b> regions) beginning on 26 January 2010. The process was completed, achieving digital switchover on 5 October 2010, but geographically isolated areas were left with analog broadcasts. The last analog TV transmitter in Croatia was shut down on 30 September 2011, as DVB-T coverage was extended to 98.5 percent of households in Croatia and no less than 95 percent of households {{in each of the}} <b>allotment</b> regions.

5|$|Partially {{because of}} this fact, ticket sales were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat <b>allotment,</b> while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their <b>allotment.</b> These figures increased slightly as the game day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the secondary market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E

The Beaumont House estate was given the name 'Claremont' by Short.

5|$|Ticket {{sales for}} the game were {{relatively}} rapid. By Dec. 7, Virginia Tech had sold almost its entire initial <b>allotment</b> of 12,500 tickets, Florida State fans had purchased approximately 6,800 tickets, and total ticket sales neared the 50,000 mark. Tech's sales increased to more than 13,000 by Dec. 14, and Virginia Tech officials requested an initial <b>allotment</b> from the Gator Bowl. Four days later, more than 60,000 tickets had been sold, and there were expectations that the game would be a sellout. The growing demand for tickets was demonstrated by an incident in which nearly 200 all-access passes to the game were stolen in transit from the printer and resold, causing a police search for the culprits.|$|E
5|$|A {{cultivator}} of olives, Davenport {{had planted}} {{a limited number}} of olives around Beaumont House in 1852 after he purchased the land the year before.

He also planted mulberry trees for producing silk on the estate grounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} weeks after the matchup was announced, Virginia Tech sold its <b>allotment</b> of 15,000 tickets, while Nebraska sales lagged, only {{reaching}} the 5,000 mark {{in the time it}} took Tech to sell its <b>allotment.</b> The slow Nebraska sales were largely due to fans who had booked trips to the Sugar Bowl in anticipation of a victory by the Cornhuskers in the Big 12 championship game. Disappointed by the loss, many people elected not to make the trip to Miami. By December 27, four days prior to the game, Tech had increased its total to 15,500, while Nebraska improved to 8,000 sold. The game was the first Orange Bowl to be played at Miami's professional football arena, Pro Player Stadium, instead of Orange Bowl stadium. The move was made in order to secure the Orange Bowl's place in the Bowl Alliance, as Pro Player Stadium was a more modern facility with a larger seating capacity.|$|E

5|$|Tickets officially {{went on sale}} December 4, {{and three}} days later, Virginia Tech had sold out its entire initial <b>allotment</b> of 15,000 tickets. A second <b>allotment</b> of 2,400 tickets was sold out in a few hours, leaving ticketless fans disgruntled. Many fans who were turned away at the Virginia Tech ticket office bought tickets from the {{secondary}} market or traveled to New Orleans in hopes of buying tickets at the game. So many Virginia Tech fans traveled to the game that the Montgomery County school district extended its winter break one day to avoid a shortage of teachers and students. The crowds also caused problems at Roanoke Regional Airport, the nearest airport to Virginia Tech. Forty-three aircraft chartered by Virginia Tech fans arrived in New Orleans on a single day.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of poor {{attendance}} at ACC championship games in Tampa, Florida, organizers hoped moving the game to Charlotte, closer to the geographic center of the conference, would result in improved ticket sales. That hypothesis was borne out as early public sales approached 28,000 tickets before the participating teams were officially announced. After the announcement, each school sold its <b>allotment</b> of 10,000 tickets, and the more than 50,000 publicly available tickets were purchased at a rapid pace. ACC officials and Charlotte boosters each said they {{were satisfied with the}} pace and quantity of ticket sales.|$|E
50|$|The {{household}} servants or dependents {{attached to}} the personal service were merely set free, while the landed peasants received their houses and orchards, and <b>allotments</b> of arable land. These <b>allotments</b> were given over to the rural commune (mir), which was made responsible for the payment of taxes for the <b>allotments.</b> For these <b>allotments</b> the peasants had to pay a fixed rent which could be fulfilled by personal labour. The <b>allotments</b> could be redeemed by peasants {{with the help of}} the Crown, and then they were freed from all obligations to the landlord. The Crown paid the landlord and the peasants had to repay the Crown, for forty-nine years at 6% interest. The financial redemption to the landlord was not calculated on the value of the <b>allotments,</b> but was considered as a compensation for the loss of the compulsory labour of the serfs. Many proprietors contrived to curtail the <b>allotments</b> which the peasants had occupied under serfdom, and frequently deprived them of precisely the parts of which they were most in need: pasture lands around their houses. The result was to compel the peasants to rent land from their former masters.|$|R

50|$|Estes {{worked out}} a method to {{purchase}} large numbers of cotton <b>allotments,</b> by dealing with farmers who had been dispossessed of land through eminent domain. He convinced the farmers to purchase land from him in Texas and transfer their <b>allotments</b> there, with a mortgage agreement delaying the first payment for a year. Then he would lease the land and <b>allotments</b> back from the farmer for $50 per acre. Once the first payment came due, the farmer would intentionally default and the land would revert to Estes; in effect, Estes had purchased the cotton <b>allotments</b> with the lease fees. However, because the original sale and mortgage were a pretext rather than a genuine sale, it was illegal to transfer the cotton <b>allotments</b> this way. Estes, however, a smooth talker revered by many of his fellow members of the Churches of Christ, asserted the allegations as politics.|$|R
