5|$|Sir Bert Millichip {{served as}} Albion {{chairman}} from 1974 to 1983, {{after which he}} chose to concentrate on his role {{as chairman of the}} Football Association. In 1996, the club became a public limited company, issuing shares to supporters at £500 and £3,000 each. The shares were quoted on the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Market,</b> but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004. The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited, the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited. Jeremy Peace took up the post in 2002, after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager Gary Megson forced Thompson to quit the club.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath F.C. {{became a}} limited company in 1888; its first share issue {{was to the}} value of £650. The board was made up of local {{businessmen}} and dignitaries until 1965, when the club was sold to Clifford Coombs. By the mid-1980s the club was in financial trouble. Control passed from the Coombs family to former Walsall F.C. chairman Ken Wheldon, who cut costs, made redundancies, and sold off assets, including the club's training ground. Still unable to make the club pay, Wheldon sold it to the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain. Debt was still increasing when matters came to a head; the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars' businesses into receivership. The club continued in administration for four months until Sport Newspapers' proprietor David Sullivan bought the Kumars' 84% holding for £700,000 from BCCI's liquidator in March 1993. Birmingham City plc, of which the football club was a wholly owned subsidiary, was floated on the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Market</b> (AIM) in 1997 with an issue of 15million new shares, raising £7.5million of new investment.

25|$|Piotroski and Srinivasan (2008) {{examine a}} {{comprehensive}} sample of international companies that list onto U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges {{before and after}} the enactment of the Act in 2002. Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K. exchanges from 1995–2006, they find that the listing preferences of large foreign firms choosing between U.S. exchanges and the LSE's Main Market did not change following SOX. In contrast, they find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms choosing between the Nasdaq and LSE's <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Market</b> decreased following SOX. The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance. The screening of smaller firms with weaker governance attributes from U.S. exchanges is consistent with the heightened governance costs imposed by the Act increasing the bonding-related benefits of a U.S. listing.|$|E

We found that market value responds significantly to changes in ke and kr.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{research}} report investigates {{the history and}} current status of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Alternative Exchange and its performance over time. The focus is on comparing the AltX with the JSE Main Board, the JSE top 40, The JSE Small Cap Index and London’s <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investments</b> <b>Market</b> AIM. The different listing requirements and the JSE Main Board will be explored. It then goes further to compare {{the performance of the}} JSE with that of AltX and AIM over time. A comparison between listings and de-listings is drawn between the AltX and the JSE Main Board. Complete risk analysis is then conducted in an attempt to compare the risk of listing on AltX, JSE and AIM and determine whether the AltX holds more risk than the other exchanges given its relaxed listing requirements and market sentiment around AltX. In comparing risk analysis with market sentiment as well as actual results, it can be concluded that AltXwhen analysed using beta; standard deviation; maximum draw down; Value at Risk; and the Sharpe ratio, does not carry significantly more risk than the JSE Main Board or AIM. The AltXdoes meet its requirements and is doing what it is designed to do, namely offering an opportunity for small and medium sized companies to raise capital and providing investors with the opportunity to become shareholder and trade in those shares as well as being a spring board to the JSE Main Board, but that moving to the Main Board does not always create more value for shareholders or has a positive influence on share price or liquidity. This brings the conclusion that company performance is still based on the individual performance of the company and not dependant on where the company is listed...|$|R

After the fall of Lehman Brothers, often described as being “too big to fail” the decision was made to increase supervision, focussed on fund managers of <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> funds, real estate funds included. This graduation thesis describes the impact of AIFMD on real estate fund managers and the potential effects on the real estate <b>investment</b> <b>market.</b> Through the use of a cost-impact survey on fund managers and by conducting interviews with institutional investors, the main research question has been answered. This report argues that, in general, the cost impact for large, institutional real estate fund managers is not significant. However, smaller, private real estate fund managers do suffer a significant cost impact. This probably has far-reaching consequences for the real estate <b>investment</b> <b>market.</b> The report also presents the expected transparency benefits for the real estate <b>investment</b> <b>market,</b> caused by AIFMD.
