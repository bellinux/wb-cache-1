5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. <b>A</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> {{extensive}} description of galaxy types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. His designs followed the model of an influential design cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish {{what is now called}} the old-style serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, but with <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> structured and upright design.|$|E
5|$|On September13, 1966, NY111 was realigned {{south of}} Hauppauge to follow <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> {{westerly}} alignment to the hamlet of Islip along Joshua's Path and Islip Avenue, two streets that ran {{parallel to the}} route's original path on Carleton Avenue and Wheeler Road. Ownership and maintenance of NY111's former routing was transferred to Suffolk County, which redesignated the road as CR17. The ultimately cancelled eastern extension of the Northern State Parkway would have crossed NY111 just south of Village of the Branch at a point north of Mount Pleasant Road. An interchange between the parkway and NY111 was planned at that location.|$|E

5|$|The {{section of}} NY78 between NY5 {{in the town}} of Amherst and the Lake Ontario {{shoreline}} in Newfane was originally designated New York State Route32 in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY32 was absorbed into NY78, which ran from Gainesville to Newfane upon assignment. From East Aurora to Depew, NY78 originally used <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> easterly alignment along several local streets and a section of NY422. Two realignments in the 1930s moved the route onto its modern alignment, and NY78's original routing between East Aurora and Depew was briefly designated NY78A during the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|Within Remsen, NY28B {{became known}} as Prospect Street as it headed westward for three blocks through the {{residential}} southeastern part of the village. In {{the last of the}} three, the route crossed over Cincinnati Creek just before intersecting Main Street. While Prospect Street ended here, NY28B turned south onto Main Street, following it for two blocks to a junction with Steuben Street. Here, NY28B turned west, passing through <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> rural area as it approached the divided highway carrying NY12 and NY28 around {{the western edge of the}} village. NY28B ended upon meeting the arterial at the western village line.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E

5|$|Crossing {{the river}} by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs {{up to the}} main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back {{to the level of the}} railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E
5|$|In Harrison, NY120 passes several mansions on {{both sides}} of the highway as it {{gradually}} turns northwestward and approaches I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). The route parallels the western edge of the freeway for several blocks to Westchester Avenue, where NY120 meets the southern end of NY120A, an alternate route through the easternmost part of Westchester County. While NY120A heads east toward Port Chester, NY120 takes on the Westchester Avenue name as the two directions of the route split to follow collector/distributor roads running northwestward along both sides of I-287. The route remains on the frontage roads for about a half-mile (0.8km) to another section of Purchase Street, where NY120 turns to follow <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> northward track through another residential section of Harrison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, the Eyalet of Egypt, a {{province}} of the Ottoman Empire, ordered a series of ironclad warships from foreign shipyards. Iclaliye was the last vessel to be ordered by the Egyptian government. The contract was awarded to the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1868. By this time, Egyptian efforts to assert their independence had angered Sultan Abdülaziz, who on 5 June 1867 demanded Egypt surrender all of the ironclads ordered from foreign shipyards. After lengthy negotiations, Egypt surrendered Iclaliye and the other Egyptian ironclads {{in exchange for the}} central government recognizing greater autonomy, transforming the Eyalet into the Khedivate of Egypt. Iclaliye was a slightly enlarged version of the earlier s that had been built in France, carrying <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> powerful armament.|$|E

5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> narrow than normal pubic arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
5|$|NY31E {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY31 {{in the village}} of Middleport in eastern Niagara County. The route heads north as Main Street, overlapping with NY271 (which also begins at NY31) through the mostly residential village. Just south of the Erie Canal, NY31E and NY271 enter Middleport's small business district, centered on the junction of Main and State Streets. Here, NY31E and NY271 split, with NY31E following State Street eastward through the eastern portion of the community. Along this stretch, the route serves Royalton–Hartland High School and Royalton-Hartland Middle School before exiting Middleport and entering <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> open area of the town of Royalton. NY31E runs past undeveloped land to the north and a smattering of homes to the south on its way into the Orleans County town of Shelby New York|Ridgeway]].|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} eruptions at Mount Hood {{occurred}} {{within the past}} 1,800 years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily {{to the south and}} west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers. The last eruptive period took place around 220 to 170 years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions. The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now-eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781 to 1782 with <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of the explorers Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907.|$|E

5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E
