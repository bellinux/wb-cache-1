5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether lifting the trawl doors and sweeps from <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> can reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. We {{carried out a}} catch {{comparison}} and catch ratio analysis between two gear setups, one with the trawl doors and sweeps <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> (<b>the</b> traditional way) {{and the other with}} the doors and sweeps lifted. The study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing with the doors and sweeps <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed,</b> <b>the</b> gear is significantly more efficient <b>at</b> catching flatfish. <b>The</b> gear setup with the doors and sweeps <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than the gear setup with the doors and sweeps lifted. This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases with fish size. The results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as lifting the doors and sweeps from <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if lifting the doors and sweeps from <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R

5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E

He later appears to the disciples, {{breathes}} on them, and gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the catch of 153 fish <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.|$|E

In Bulgarian service, {{the submarine}} patrolled the Bulgarian Black Sea coast and had encounters with Russian vessels on several occasions. After the war ended, the submarine was surrendered to France in February 1919 and scrapped at Bizerta in August 1921. However, in July 2011 Viceadmiral Manushev, Commander of the Bulgarian Navy, announced that the submarine, discovered in 2010 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> bottom near the town of Varna, is UB-8.

5|$|On the Byzantine side, Emperor Michael III had {{assembled}} his army {{to counter the}} Arab raid, and met them at a battle in an area called Marj al-Usquf ("Bishop's Meadow") by Arab sources, a highland near Malakopeia, north of Nazianzus. The battle was bloody with many casualties on both sides; according to the Persian historian al-Tabari, only a thousand of Umar's army survived. Nevertheless, the Arabs managed to escape the Byzantines and continue their raid north into the Armeniac Theme, eventually reaching the Black Sea and sacking {{the port city of}} Amisos. The Byzantine historians report that Umar, enraged <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> blocking his advance, ordered it to be lashed, but this is most likely inspired by the similar account of Xerxes during the Persian Wars.|$|E

5|$|In 1741, the Chamouny {{valley and}} its glaciers {{on the north}} side of the massif were {{discovered}} and written about by two aristocratic travelling Englishmen, named William Windham and Richard Pococke. The descriptions of their exploits were published across Europe, bringing the mountains of the Mont Blanc range to the attention of a wide audience for the first time. In 1760, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure offered a large financial prize to the first people who successfully ascended Mont Blanc. The summit was finally attained on 8 August 1786 by two Chamonix men, the guide Jacques Balmat and Dr. Michel Paccard. The decades that followed saw the gradual opening up of Chamonix to the world, as well as the rest of the Mont Blanc massif. The many published accounts of climbs and impressive sights amongst or around the mountain range attracted numerous wealthy and notable visitors, for whom a visit to marvel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Ice (the Mer de Glace) became a fashionable thing to experience.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> Dead <b>Sea</b> is an {{excellent}} natural laboratory for the investigation of Reactive Bromine Species (RBS) chemistry, due to the high RBS levels observed in this area, combined with anthropogenic air pollutants up to several ppb. The present study investigated the basic chemical mechanism of RBS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Dead <b>Sea</b> using a numerical one-dimensional chemical model. Simulations were based on data obtained from comprehensive measurements performed <b>at</b> sites along <b>the</b> Dead <b>Sea.</b> <b>The</b> simulations showed that the high BrO levels measured frequently <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Dead <b>Sea</b> could only partially {{be attributed to the}} highly concentrated Br − present in <b>the</b> Dead <b>Sea</b> water. Furthermore, <b>the</b> RBS activity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Dead <b>Sea</b> cannot solely be explained by a pure gas phase mechanism.

The shear failure depth of north-west area is within 4 m, and that at south-east is relatively large, beyond 4 m in depth. (3) The shear failure of Chengdao Sea was mainly controlled by wave stress in <b>seabed.</b> <b>The</b> shear failure region and depth calculated in this paper can be referred in oil engineering facilities design and construction...|$|R
5|$|The Syriac, Jonah, who {{had helped}} Khalid enter the city by the East Gate, showed him a {{short-cut}} to Antioch. Leading a cavalry regiment, Khalid caught up with a convoy of Byzantine refugees from Damascus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> near Antioch. The three-day truce had passed; Khalid's cavalry attacked the convoy during a heavy rain. In the subsequent battle, Khalid reportedly killed both Thomas and Harbees in a duel. After the Battle, known as the Battle of Marj-ud-Deebaj (Battle of Brocade Meadow), the Muslims took {{a great amount of}} brocade as booty. In addition, Thomas' wife, the daughter of Heraclius, was captured. According to chronicles, the Greek man Jonah, who guided Khalid on the short cut to Antioch, got his fiance, but she committed suicide. Khalid offered Jonah the daughter of Emperor Heraclius, whom he refused. Khalid sent her back to her father. Jonah died two years later in the Battle of Yarmuk.|$|E

40|$|Offshore {{wind farms}} {{are being built}} at a high rate {{around the world to}} meet the demand for {{renewable}} energy. We studied fish and sessile communities on and around offshore wind-turbine foundations in <b>the</b> southern Baltic <b>Sea,</b> 7 years after construction, using visual census techniques to determine how fish, sessile-invertebrate and algal communities are affected by the introduction of such structures. Fish assemblages were dominated by two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens) that were found in large shoals in close association with <b>the</b> vertical surface. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed,</b> close to <b>the</b> foundation, the black goby (Gobius niger) was recorded in large numbers. The most obvious difference in fish densities was found between wind-power foundations extending through the entire water column and the surrounding open waters. Fouling assemblages on the vertical foundation surfaces and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> just below differed from those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> further away by having higher coverage of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and less algal growth. The results from the present study suggest that the introduction of offshore wind turbines in marine waters could {{have a positive effect on}} fish numbers and the presence of sessile invertebrates...|$|R
