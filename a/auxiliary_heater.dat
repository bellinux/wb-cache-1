40|$|Solar-assisted cooling {{technology}} has enormous potential for air-conditioning applications since both {{solar energy supply}} and cooling energy demand are well correlated. Unfortunately, market uptake of solar cooling technologies has been slow due to the high capital cost and limited design/operational experience. In the present work, different designs and operational modes for solar heating and cooling (SHC) absorption chiller systems are investigated and compared {{in order to identify}} the preferred design strategies for these systems. Three control scenarios are proposed for the solar collector loop. The first uses a constant flow pump, while the second and third control schemes employ a variable speed pump, where the solar collector (SC) set-point temperature could be either fixed or adjusted to the required demand. Series and parallel arrangements, between the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>heater</b> and the storage tank, have been examined in detail from an energy efficiency perspective. A simulation model for different system layouts is developed in the transient system simulation environment (TRNSYS, Version 17). Simulation results revealed that the total solar fraction of the plant is increased by up to 11 % when a variable speed solar loop pump is used to achieve a collector set-point temperature adjusted according to the building load demand. Another significant finding {{of this study is that}} a parallel configuration for the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>heater</b> out-performs a conventional series configuration. The yearly performance of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>heater</b> in parallel with the storage tank enhances the plant solar fraction, and the average collector efficiency, by up to 13 % and 9 %, respectively (as compared to the same components in series).

40|$|As {{alternative}} fuels {{are becoming more}} common, technologies need to adjust to them. Natural gas {{is one of the}} {{alternative fuels}} that has grown during the latest years in the transport sector. Natural gas consists of around 97 % methane and is the cleanest fossil fuel. The use of natural gas can make it easier to transition to biogas as it has equivalent properties. Today Scania CV AB's trucks fuelled by natural gas are using auxiliary cabin heaters driven by diesel. This means that the natural gas trucks have two fuels on-board the truck. The goal of this project is to find a concept to eliminate the diesel fuel and replace it with an auxiliary cabin heater driven by another energy source. It will improve the heating solution and make it superior from an environmental perspective. The result of the project lead to a short-term solution with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>heater</b> fuelled by natural gas.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of time and spatial partition heating to a solar water heating system. The heating effect and system performance were analyzed under the continuous and whole space heating and time and spatial partition heating using TRNSYS. The results were validated by comparing with the test results of the demonstration building. Compared to continuous and whole space heating, the use of time and spatial partition heating increases the solar fraction by 16. 5 %, reduces the auxiliary heating by 7390 MJ, and reduces the annual operation cost by 2010 RMB. Under time and spatial partition heating, optimization analyses were conducted for the two system capacity parameters of the solar collector area and tank volume and the one operation parameter of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>heater</b> setting outlet temperature. The results showed that a reasonable choice of the solar collector area can reduce the dynamic annual cost, the increased tank volume is advantageous to heat storage, and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>heater</b> setting outlet temperature have greater influence on the indoor heating effect.

40|$|Solar cooling is a {{promising}} {{way for a}} sustainable air-conditioning system. However, since solar has intermittent output, it is usually backed-up by a conventional heater. Thus, it still needs electricity or fossil fuel to operate stabily. This study presents the effect of ratio of heat delivered by solar to the total heat delivered to an adsorption chiller (solar fraction) on the economic performance of a solar cooling system. This cooling system need covers cooling demand for an office building in a tropical region (Kuala Lumpur). Cooling demand was simulated using well-known energy analysis software for building, Equest. Flat-plate collectors and an adsorption chiller were {{the main component of}} the cooling system. Flat-plate collecters were simulated using another software, Watsun, and the adsorption chiller was based on our simulation model that is comparable with other studies. Economic performance was analyzed by life cycle cost analysis. Solar fraction of 0. 33, 0. 74 and 0. 98 were studied. It was found that none of the solar fraction studied can generate Net Profit under subsidized electricity. It was also found that a natural gas boiler is a better solution than an electric heater as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>heater</b> in term of economic. For a natural gas boiler, Net Profit increased when solar fraction decreased; the highest one was solar fraction of 0. 33 with US 15, 600.

40|$|As small {{satellites}} 2 ̆ 7 power-to-external area ratios increase, so {{does the}} ordeal of securing the necessary thermal radiator area. To provide robust temperature control for any conceivable power density, two new concepts are proposed: a satellite architecture based on deployed equipment modules for increased radiator area, and thermal switches on each package mounted to module panels. A beneficial synergy comes from employing these independent concepts on small satellites whose exterior panels serve as both equipment mounting decks and thermal radiators. Hypothetical examples of multiple module deployments demonstrate the potential for dramatic increases in effective radiator area that allows a comfortably large hot-case margin. Cold-case temperature control comes from thermal switches that vary package-to-deck interface pressure {{as a function of}} package temperature to provide high interface resistance at low temperature. Two such switches based on the temperature dependent properties of shape memory alloy and paraffin are described. Positive and negative comparisons are made to conventional thermal design and deployed radiators.

Mathematical models of absorption chiller, flat-plate collector, water storage tank with auxiliary heating unit and conditioned-space psychrometry have been coupled with real weather data of Kolkata, India.

40|$|A {{strength}} of parabolic trough {{concentrating solar power}} (CSP) plants {{is the ability to}} provide reliable power by incorporating either thermal energy storage or backup heat from fossil fuels. Yet these benefits have not been fully realized because thermal energy storage remains expensive at trough operating temperatures and gas usage in CSP plants is less efficient than in dedicated combined cycle plants. For example, while a modern combined cycle plant can achieve an overall efficiency in excess of 55 %; <b>auxiliary</b> <b>heaters</b> in a parabolic trough plant convert gas to electricity at below 40 %. Thus, one can argue the more effective use of natural gas is in a combined cycle plant, not as backup to a CSP plant. Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) systems avoid this pitfall by injecting solar steam into the fossil power cycle; however, these designs are limited to about 10 % total solar enhancement. Without reliable, cost-effective energy storage or backup power, renewable sources will struggle to achieve a high penetration in the electric grid. This paper describes a novel gas turbine / parabolic trough hybrid design that combines solar contribution of 57 % and higher with gas heat rates that rival that for combined cycle natural gas plants. The design integrates proven solar and fossil technologies, thereby offering high reliability and low financial risk while promoting deployment of solar thermal power...|$|R
