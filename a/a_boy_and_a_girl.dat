5|$|The plot of {{the film}} was best convened through a {{published}} synopsis in trade which introduced {{the names of the}} cast and the backstory. Eugenie Freeman and Paul Temple, marry and have two children, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> The parents have been unemployed, but the film starts with the parents finding work in an upcoming production at a theater.

She provides one week for the Temple family to pay up.|$|E
5|$|Tradition {{has it that}} {{a church}} {{dedicated}} to the Holy Trinity stood at the summit until it was razed by the Ottomans; in another version, the church crumbled after <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> sinned within. Before 2005, there was a custom {{to pick up a}} stone at a certain distance from the peak and carry it to the supposed site of the church in the belief that when a sufficient quantity of stones were collected, the church would rebuild itself. A new church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was consecrated on the site by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 31 July 2005.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{religious}} imagery, the frescoes of the Donja Kamenica church {{also include}} eleven portraits of contemporary historical figures, separated into four compositions. Three of the compositions are uncaptioned, making {{the identification of}} the people practically impossible. The first composition is located in the cella and depicts two men preserved from the waist up, of which one holds a model of the church, and a child, of which only the head is visible today. The second composition was painted on the upper west wall of the narthex and portrays a man, a woman, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> with the man also holding a model of the church, a common symbol of donorship. Art historian Dragana Frfulanović believes that the images of men holding models in both compositions depict the same person, the main donor. The third composition is in the cella and depicts two men: a monk and a priest.|$|E
5|$|Craig {{retired from}} {{first-class}} cricket at just 26years {{of age in}} 1962, but continued playing for Mosman in Sydney grade cricket on weekends until 1969. His marriage to Rosslyn Carroll in 1962 and his pharmaceutical career prevented him from applying himself fully to cricket. The couple had <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> {{as well as an}} adopted son. Craig joined the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm Boots, rising to the position of managing director. He later served {{on the board of directors}} of the Bradman Museum in Bowral and later became its chairman. He was a board member of the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) for three years and served on the Trust of the Sydney Cricket Ground for varying periods from 1968 to 1996, totalling 18years. Upon first being appointed in 1968 to replace Stan McCabe, Craig was the youngest ever trustee of the SCG. One of the most controversial incidents during this time occurred in 1977–78 during the period of the breakaway World Series Cricket, which wanted to install floodlights at the SCG. The NSWCA opposed this, while the government sided with WSC. As a result of Craig's support of the NSWCA, the government dismissed him. Craig retired as the managing director of Boots' Australian subsidiaries. Craig was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997 for his contributions to cricket as a player and administrator. He died in Bowral from cancer on 16 November 2014.|$|E

25|$|The main {{shopping}} centre is the , {{which was built}} in 1974 as 'The Gracechurch Shopping Centre'. It changed its name after being bought by The Mall Company and was, {{by the end of}} 2008 rebranded 'The Mall, Sutton Coldfield'. The Mall complex also includes a multi-storey car park. As a result of investment, the appearance of the {{shopping centre}} was improved in 2006 which included the installation of a glass roof above one of the walkways and the removal of a public square to form a cafe and extra retail units. There are now plans to construct a food court above Bishop's Court in the shopping centre. The shopping centre was formerly home to three bronze sculptures that depict, respectively, <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> on rollerskates, a boy with a dog, and <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> playing leapfrog, which have been moved to Rectory Park.|$|E

Two carved figures of <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> which {{are believed to have}} stood over the boys' and girls' entrances to the school were installed first in the Greencoat Building, and later in the Greencoat Courtyard in the new school at Wallington.|$|E

500|$|However, the woodcut that {{accompanied}} the first recorded version of the rhyme showed two boys (not <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl)</b> and used the spelling Gill not Jill. This earliest printed version comes from a reprint of John Newbery's Mother Goose's Melody, {{thought to have been}} first published in London around 1765. The rhyming of [...] "water" [...] with [...] "after" [...] was taken by Iona and Peter Opie to suggest that the first verse may date from {{the first half of the}} 17th century.|$|E
500|$|... is a Japanese {{science fiction}} drama {{original}} video animation (OVA) short film directed, written, produced, character designed, storyboarded, cinematographed, edited, and animated by Makoto Shinkai.

500|$|The {{game has}} {{traditionally}} {{been seen as a}} nonsense verse, particularly as the couple go up a hill to find water, which is often thought to be found at the bottom of hills. Vinegar and brown paper were a home cure used as a method to draw out bruises on the body. The phrase [...] "Jack and Jill" [...] was in use in England as early as the 16th century to indicate <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> A comedy with the title Jack and Jill was performed at the Elizabethan court in 1567-68, and the phrase was used twice by Shakespeare: in A Midsummer Night's Dream, which contains the line, [...] "Jack shall have Jill; Nought shall go ill" [...] (III:ii:460-2), and in Love's Labour's Lost, which has the lines, [...] "Our wooing doth not end like an old play; Jack hath not Jill" [...] (V:ii:874–5). These lines suggest that it was a phrase which indicated a romantically attached couple, as in the proverb [...] "a good Jack makes a good Jill".|$|E
