Materials and methods. The retrospective cohort study postoperatively used a combination of ECMO and continuous renal replacement therapy in 27 cardiac surgical patients aged over 18 years with severe cardiopulmonary insufficiency concurrent with acute kidney lesion. In all cases, the continuous renal replacement therapy circuit was switched into the line after an ECMO pump. The end points of the study were the duration of dialysis-dependent acute renal failure, the frequency of complications, and hospital mortality. Results. In all cases with a favorable outcome, the duration of continuous renal replacement therapy was 3 days longer than that of ECMO. There were no cases of recovery if the duration of continuous renal replacement therapy was shorter than that of ECMO and the duration of the latter was more than 10 days. The duration of sympathomimetic support (> 3. 5 days) was shown to be an independent and significant predictor of  death (AUC 0. 99; CI 99. 9 %, 0. 96 — 1. 0) in the patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy and ECMO. It was established that the number of inotrophic drugs (> 2) and the highest lactate level (> 1. 99 mmol/l) could be used to predict hospital mortality in patients with acute kidney injury and severe cardiopulmonary insufficiency (AUC 0. 85 and 0. 86; sensitivity/specificity 0. 83 / 0. 67 and 0. 86 / 0. 67, respectively).

40|$|This article investigates {{whether the}} European Ombudsman {{acts as an}} ‘independent’ {{institution}} vis-à-vis the European Parliament (EP). This is a relevant question because while the Ombudsman is appointed by and reports to the EP, it can also conduct inquiries into {{the work of the}} EP, in instances of alleged maladministration. Based on the empirical examination of all decisions following an inquiry by the Ombudsman in cases against the EP for an eleven-year period (2004 – 2015), plus the review of two recent landmark own-initiative inquiries, we inductively construct three roles played by the Ombudsman in relation to the EP, namely: ‘arbitrator’, ‘transparency watchdog’, and ‘vessel for civil society concerns’. These roles are used to operationalize the concept of independence. We conclude that the Ombudsman acts independently and is not a mere <b>auxiliary</b> <b>organ</b> of the European legislature. This is most apparent in the ‘transparency watchdog’ role, where the European Ombudsman has ensured the release of information empowering citizens to hold the Parliament accountable, or—failing that—has stimulated debate concerning such information (for instance, on the MEPs’ financial allowances) both within the Parliament itself and in the wider public domain...|$|E

Freud ([1930] 1962) echoed a common teleological fantasy of the prom-ises of prostheses by pronouncing: With every tool man is perfecting his own organs, whether motor or sensory, or is removing the limits to their functioning [...] Man has, as it were, become a prosthetic god.

Over the last 45 years, some scientists have claimed that a number of molecules are human pheromones, but these claims have little scientific validity. The first chemical identification of a pheromone, the silk moth’s female sex pheromone (bombykol), achieved by the German chemist Adolf Butenandt and after this finding, four steroid molecules have been described as human pheromones: androstenone, androstenol, androstadienone and estratetraenol. The possibility of human pheromones has been downplayed in part because in the past, it has been assumed erroneously that we have a poor sense of smell.

40|$|Detecting and {{locating}} prey {{are key to}} predatory success within trophic chains. Predators use various signals through specialized visual, olfactory, auditory or tactile sensory {{systems to}} pinpoint their prey. Snakes chemically sense their prey through a highly developed <b>auxiliary</b> olfactory sense <b>organ,</b> the vomeronasal organ (VNO). In natricine snakes {{that are able to}} feed on land and water, the VNO plays a critical role in predatory behavior by detecting cues, known as vomodors, which are produced by their potential prey. However, the chemical nature of these cues remains unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that specific proteins–parvalbumins–present in the cutaneous mucus of the common frog (Rana temporaria) may be natural chemoattractive proteins for these snakes. Here, we show that parvalbumins and parvalbumin-like proteins, which are mainly intracellular, are physiologically present in the epidermal mucous cells and mucus of several frog and fish genera from both fresh and salt water. These proteins are located in many tissues and function as Ca 2 + buffers. In addition, we clarified the intrinsic role of parvalbumins present in the cutaneous mucus of amphibians and fishes. We demonstrate that these Ca 2 +-binding proteins participate in innate bacterial defense mechanisms by means of calcium chelation. We show that these parvalbumins are chemoattractive for three different thamnophiine snakes, suggesting that these chemicals {{play a key role in}} their prey-recognition mechanism. Therefore, we suggest that recognition of parvalbumin-like proteins or other calcium-binding proteins by the VNO could be a generalized prey-recognition process in snakes. Detectin...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Earthworms {{are capable}} of osmotic and ionic {{regulation}} while living in a dilute balanced salt solution. When transferred from soil to pond-water (PW) their body weight increases by 15 percent due to a net uptake of water. This results in an initial dilution of the coelomic fluid (CF). Subsequently, Na and Cl are accumulated in net amounts returning the CF ionic concentration to {{the same level as}} when the animals were in soil (75 mM Na/ 1, 47 mM Cl/ 1). Water is taken up across the skin. Although worms in PW do drink, the amount is minimal. In a steady state, the rate of water uptake and loss must be equal. Water is voided as a hypo-osmotic urine from the nephridia. The clearance of Inulin and Dextran from the CF is about 75 μl/ 10 g-hr. Since some water is probably reabsorbed from the nephridia, this gives a maximum estimate of urine excretion. Worms living in PW use their gastro-intestinal tract as an <b>auxiliary</b> excretory <b>organ.</b> Fluid excreted from the rectum is hypo-osmotic and hypo-ionic to the CF. It is hypothesized that fluid entering the esophagous, {{at the level of the}} calciferous gland, is an ultrafiltrate of the blood. Chloride is reabsorbed from the esophageal fluid in exchange for HCO₃ ions. The esophageal fluid enters the crop. Fluid in the crop is similar in composition to the CF except that the Cl concentration is lower (2 mM/l). As the fluid passes down the intestine Na is reabsorbed in exchange for NH₄, resulting in the formation of a dilute rectal fluid. Earthworms living in a dilute aquatic environment accumulate Na and Cl against an elecrochemical gradient by active transport across the skin. Sodium and Cl are transported independently. To maintain electrical neutrality, Na is probably exchanged for NH₄ or H ions and Cl exchanged for HCO₃. Kinetic analysis of the Na transport system for PW acclimated worms indicates a V[subscript m] of 1. 1 μeq Na/ 10 g-hr and a K[subscript s] of 1. 6 mM Na/ 1. These values suggest the epithelium is less permeable to Na than in most fresh-water animals. The ion transport systems are delicately regulated. A dilution of the CF increases the rate of active transport of both Na and Cl. Sodium efflux is unchanged but the Cl efflux is reduced. The mechanism of regulation is unknown; however, neuroendocrine mediation has been implicated. It is concluded that earthworms can adapt to an aquatic environment. However, they do possess some characteristics which distinguish them from truely fresh-water animals. The use of the gastro-intestinal tract for producing a dilute fluid excreta is unique. The relative low skin permeability to Na results in a Na transport rate much lower in magnitude than fresh-water organisms of comparable size...|$|R
