5|$|The LU {{decomposition}} factors matrices <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> {{of lower}} (L) and an upper triangular matrices (U). Once this decomposition is calculated, linear {{systems can be}} solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> UDV∗, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, the German chemist Otto Hahn, {{a student}} of Rutherford, {{directed}} neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get transuranium elements.

In 1944, Hahn received the Nobel prize in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.|$|E

5|$|Metformin {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was completely forgotten, as other guanidine analogs, such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin.|$|E

5|$|Any {{astatine}} {{present at}} {{the formation of the}} Earth has long since disappeared; the four naturally occurring isotopes (astatine-215, -217, -218 and -219) are instead continuously produced {{as a result of the}} decay of radioactive thorium and uranium ores, and trace quantities of neptunium-237. The landmass of North and South America combined, to a depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), contains only about one trillion astatine-215 atoms at any given time (around 3.5 × 10−10 grams). Astatine-217 is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium-237. Primordial remnants of the latter isotope—due to its relatively short half-life of 2.14 million years—are no longer present on Earth. However, trace amounts occur naturally <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of transmutation reactions in uranium ores. Astatine-218 was the first astatine isotope discovered in nature. Astatine-219, with a half-life of 56 seconds, is the longest lived of the naturally occurring isotopes.|$|E

This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared {{to be involved in}} the game. Some of the players the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of the country, {{in order to promote}} its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only {{in combination with other}} elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E

5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Imaginos is the {{eleventh}} studio album by the American hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult (commonly shortened as BÖC). It {{was released in}} 1988, and was their last recording with their original record label, CBS/Columbia Records. The album took nearly eight years to complete and was originally intended {{to be the first}} in a trilogy of solo albums by Blue Öyster Cult drummer and songwriter Albert Bouchard. Bouchard was fired in August 1981, and CBS rejected the album in 1984, but a re-worked version was eventually published <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of the band. Many musicians contributed to the project over this eight-year span, including Joe Satriani and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, but some band members were barely involved in the recording process. Thus, Imaginos is often considered more as a project of producer and lyricist Sandy Pearlman than as a true album of the band.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of small installations, {{convenience}} may outweigh cost. There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>product</b> of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E

The crest of Argentina's national federation in rugby union features a jaguar; however, because of a journalist error, the country's national team is nicknamed Los Pumas. In {{the spirit of the}} ancient Mayan culture, the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City adopted a red jaguar as the first official Olympic mascot.|$|E
