5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand {{into the face of}} one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of life–one of many horses in the movie.|$|E
25|$|Other {{writers such}} as US General Westmoreland, and {{journalist}} Peter Braestrup argue that negative press reports contributed to an attitude of defeatism and despair <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> American troops were winning against the VC. As such they claim, Tet was a major strategic political and psychological triumph for Communist forces in the conflict.|$|E
25|$|In this play, Menander {{handles the}} typical formula of {{separation}} and reunion {{in a particularly}} elegant way. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> when the breakup between Glykera and Polemon seems to be final, with the removal of her belongings from Polemon's house, the recognition scene starts: Pataikos sees her birth clothes and recognizes Glykera as his daughter, and this in turn leads to her reconciliation with Polemon.|$|E

25|$|Sir Stamford Raffles lost no {{time after}} January 1819, when he landed on Singapore River among the orang laut, in {{bargaining}} with the Temenggong, the Johor chief who then ruled the place, having settled in 1811. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> of landing, Raffles must have realised {{the importance of}} the river for, in the same year of 1819, the north bank was drained for government buildings and, in 1822, the south bank was reclaimed and a retaining wall and steps were built.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of January 8, the Very Rev. William Dubourg, Vicar General, offered Mass at the altar on which the statue of Our Lady of Prompt Succor had been placed.

25|$|Before {{he could}} be ordained a priest, Gabriel died in the retreat at Isola del Gran Sasso {{the early hours of}} February 27, 1862, in the {{presence}} of the community, holding close an image of Our Lady of Sorrows and smiling peacefully. Those who were with Gabriel when he died reported that at the moment of death, he sat up in bed and his face became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> of his death.|$|E
25|$|Theologically, {{one major}} {{controversy}} {{of the age}} was the Immaculate Conception. Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception. His many sermons on the Virgin Mary shaped the Mariological approach {{of a large number}} of Franciscans who followed his approach for centuries after his death. Gradually the idea that Mary had been cleansed of original sin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> of her conception began to predominate, particularly after Duns Scotus dealt with the major objection to Mary's sinlessness from conception, that being her need for redemption. The very divine act, in making Mary sinless at the first instant of her conception was, he argued, the most perfect form of redemption possible.|$|E

Bourget, at that time a close friend of Huysmans as of Wilde, admired it greatly; Paul Valéry called it his 'Bible and his bedside book' and this is what it became for Wilde. He said to the Morning News: 'This last book of Huysmans {{is one of the best}} I have ever seen'. It was being reviewed everywhere as the guidebook of decadence. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> that Wilde was falling in with social patterns, he was confronted with a book which even in its title defied them.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Ecuador was divided {{during these years}} among three segments: those favoring the status quo, those supporting union with Peru, and those advocating independence for the former audiencia. The latter group was to prevail following Venezuela's withdrawal from Gran Colombia <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> that an 1830 constitutional congress had been called in an ultimately futile effort to stem the growing separatist tendencies throughout country. In May of that year, a group of Quito notables met to dissolve the union with Gran Colombia, and in August, a constituent assembly drew up a constitution for the State of Ecuador, so named for its geographic proximity to the equator, and placed General Flores in charge of political and military affairs. He remained the dominant political figure during Ecuador's first 15 years of independence.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} the opera, Poulenc {{composed}} little else; exceptions were two mélodies, and a short orchestral movement, [...] "Bucolique" [...] in a collective work, Variations sur le nom de Marguerite Long (1954), to which his old friends from Les Six Auric and Milhaud also contributed. As Poulenc was writing the last pages of his opera in October 1955, Roubert {{died at the age}} of forty-seven.

500|$|Although Howe was not {{injured in}} the battle, it had a {{pronounced}} effect on his spirit. [...] According to British historian George Otto Trevelyan, the battle [...] "exercised a permanent and most potent influence" [...] especially on Howe's behaviour, and that Howe's military skills thereafter [...] "were apt to fail him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> when they were especially wanted." [...] Despite an outward appearance of confidence and popularity with his troops, the [...] "genial six-footer with a face some people described as 'coarse'", privately often exhibited a lack of self-confidence, and in later campaigns became somewhat dependent on his older brother Richard (the admiral in the Royal Navy, also on station in the Colonies) for advice and approval.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine when slave trading began in the archaic period. In Works and Days (8th century BC), Hesiod owns numerous dmōes although their status is unclear. The presence of douloi is confirmed by lyric poets such as Archilochus or Theognis of Megara. According to epigraphic evidence, the homicide law of Draco (c. 620 BC) mentioned slaves. According to Plutarch, Solon (c. 594-593 BC) forbade slaves from practising gymnastics and pederasty. By the end of the period, references become more common. Slavery becomes prevalent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> when Solon establishes the basis for Athenian democracy. Classical scholar Moses Finley likewise remarks that Chios, which, according to Theopompus, was the first city to organize a slave trade, also enjoyed an early democratic process (in the 6th century BC). He concludes that [...] "one aspect of Greek history, in short, is the advance hand in hand, of freedom and slavery." ...|$|E

Eliza Brătianu, the PNL leader's wife, placed Averescu's ascension in the context of Greater Romania's creation through the addition of Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transylvania (while making use of the condescending National Liberal tone towards the Romanian National Party that was emerging triumphant in previously Austro-Hungarian Transylvania): ...|$|E
