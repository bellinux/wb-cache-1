Halkett ordered that the ship's stores and guns be thrown overboard in order to lighten her and float her free, but despite these efforts she remained stuck fast in the sands.|$|E

MD 27 was widened and resurfaced from Westminster to south of Warfieldsburg between 1950 and 1954; this work included a relocation at Spring Mills. Work {{on the highway}} from south of Warfieldsburg to Taylorsville <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Mount Airy; both widening and resurfacing projects got underway in 1954 and were completed in 1956. Construction began on reconstructing and widening MD 31 from Manchester to Westminster in 1957. This project involved several relocations of the highway, including moving Manchester Road to its present terminus at MD 30, {{by the time it}} was completed in 1960. Sections of old road became segments of MD 852, including MD 852G between Westminster and Mexico.|$|E

A display in 1647 at Lincoln's Inn Fields commemorated [...] "God's great mercy in delivering this kingdom from the hellish plots of papists", and included fireballs burning in the water (symbolising a Catholic association with [...] "infernal spirits") and fireboxes, their many rockets suggestive of [...] "popish spirits coming from below" [...] to enact plots against the king. [...] Effigies of Fawkes and the pope were present, the latter represented by Pluto, Roman god of the underworld.|$|E
500|$|During the Mughal era, [...] "it was {{a common}} mode of {{execution}} in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant." [...] Captain Alexander Hamilton, writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan ordered an offending military commander to be carried [...] "to the Elephant Garden, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death". The Mughal Emperor Humayun ordered the crushing by elephant of an imam he mistakenly believed {{to be critical of}} his reign. Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor Jahangir, is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The French traveler François Bernier, who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment. Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of Delhi, elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces [...] "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".|$|E

Labes opened [...] "Everyone" [...] by playing a clavinet figure in [...] time. A flute comes in, playing the melody after Morrison has sung four lines, with Schroer playing the harmony underneath on soprano saxophone. Although Morrison says {{the song is}} just a song of hope, Hinton says its lyrics suggest a more troubled meaning, as [...] 1969 was {{the year in which}} The Troubles broke out in Belfast. The final track, [...] "Glad Tidings", has a bouncy beat but the lyrics, like [...] "Into the Mystic", remain largely impenetrable, according to Hinton. In his opinion, [...] "the opening line and closing line, 'and they'll lay you down low and easy', could be either about murder or an act of love." [...] In Hage's opinion, [...] "'Glad Tidings' was a premonition of the future, as for the next four decades, Morrison would continue to use a song here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> vent about the evils of the music industry and the world of celebrity." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the most}} egregious offence an {{individual}} could commit, viewed as seriously as though the accused had personally attacked the monarch, high treason demanded the ultimate punishment. [...] But whereas men guilty of this crime were hanged, drawn and quartered, women were drawn and burned. [...] In his Commentaries on the Laws of England the 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone noted that the sentence, [...] "to be drawn to the gallows, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> be burned alive", was [...] "full as terrible to the sensation as the other". [...] Blackstone wrote that women were burned rather than quartered as [...] "the decency due to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies". [...] However, an observation by historian Jules Michelet, that [...] "the first flame to rise consumed the clothes, revealing poor trembling nakedness", may, {{in the opinion of}} historian Vic Gatrell, suggest that this solution is [...] "misconceived". [...] In The Hanging Tree, Gatrell concludes that the occasional live burial of women in Europe gave tacit acknowledgement to the possibility that a struggling, kicking female hanging from a noose could [...] "elicit obscene fantasies" [...] from watching males.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Ibn al-Ash'ath himself had joined the army from the outset or whether, {{according}} to an alternative tradition, he {{had been sent to}} Kirman to punish a local leader who had refused to help the governors of Sistan and Sind. After taking up the leadership of the army, Ibn al-Ash'ath led it to Sistan, where he united the local troops with the [...] "Peacock Army". He rejected a peace offer from the Zunbīl and—in marked contrast to his predecessor's direct assault—began a systematic campaign to first secure the lowlands surrounding the mountainous heart of the Zunbīls kingdom: slowly and methodically, he captured the villages and fortresses one by one, installing garrisons in them and linking them with messengers. After accomplishing this task, he withdrew to Bust to spend the winter of 699/700. Once al-Hajjaj received Ibn al-Ash'ath's messages informing him of the break in operations, however, he replied in what L. Veccia Vaglieri described as [...] "a series of arrogant and offensive messages ordering him to penetrate into the heart of Zabulistan <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> fight the enemy to the death". Ibn al-Ash'ath called an assembly of the army's leadership, in which he informed them of al-Hajjaj's orders for an immediate advance and his decision to refuse to obey. He then went before the assembled troops and repeated al-Hajjaj's instructions, calling upon them to decide what should be done. The troops clearly resented [...] "the prospect of a long and difficult campaign so far from Iraq" [...] (G. R. Hawting), denounced al-Hajjaj, proclaiming him deposed, and swore allegiance to Ibn al-Ash'ath instead. Ibn al-Ash'ath's brothers, however, as well as the governor of Khurasan, al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, refused to join the rebellion. Ibn al-Ash'ath hastily concluded an agreement with the Zunbīl, whereby if he was victorious in the coming conflict with al-Hajjaj, he would accord the Zunbīl generous treatment, while if he was defeated, the Zunbīl would provide refuge. With his rear secure, Ibn al-Ash'ath left representatives at Bust and Zaranj, and his army set out on the return journey to Iraq, picking up more soldiers from Kufa and Basra, who were stationed as garrisons, along the way. By the time the army reached Fars, it had become clear that deposing al-Hajjaj could not be done without deposing Caliph Abd al-Malik as well, and the revolt evolved from a mutiny into a full-blown anti-Umayyad uprising, with the troops renewing their oath to Ibn al-Ash'ath.|$|E
