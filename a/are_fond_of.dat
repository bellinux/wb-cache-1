5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, the key {{challenge}} to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations. This network revolved around treaty making, and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings, and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. Whereas classical writers <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> making ethical and legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded diplomacy {{as a form of}} war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.|$|E

Residents of Cooch Behar <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> music and generally listen to Rabindra Sangeet, Bengali bands, Hindi pop music and the local Bhawaiya Sangeet. The local Bengali dialect, is different from the one spoken in Kolkata. It is closer to that of East Bengal and a mix of Assamese and Rajbangsi language.|$|E
25|$|Aleppo is {{considered}} one of the main centres of Arabic traditional and classic music with the famous Aleppine Muwashshahs, Qudud Halabiya and Maqams (religious, secular and folk poetic-musical genres). Aleppines in general <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> Arab classical music, the Tarab, and it is not a surprise that many artists from Aleppo are considered pioneers among the Arabs in classic and traditional music. The most prominent figures in this field are Sabri Mdallal, Sabah Fakhri, Shadi Jamil, Abed Azrie and Nour Mhanna. Many iconic artists of the Arab music like Sayed Darwish and Mohammed Abdel Wahab were visiting Aleppo to recognize the legacy of Aleppine art and learn from its cultural heritage.|$|E

500|$|Battle Royale {{has been}} {{critically}} acclaimed abroad. In Entertainment Weekly, writer Stephen King included {{it as one}} of the seven books in his 2005 summer reading list, after it was recommended to him by novelist Kelly Braffet (writer of Josie and Jack). King described Battle Royale as [...] "an insanely entertaining pulp riff that combines Survivor with World Wrestling Entertainment. Or maybe Royale is just insane." [...] He also notes that it has some similarities to his own novel The Long Walk. He concludes the brief review with a [...] "No prob," [...] as [...] "Takami's Springsteen-quoting teenagers <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> saying." ...|$|E

500|$|He then {{quotes a}} Mr. Townson's {{account of how}} crossbills feed on pine cones, {{inserting}} their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways, opening the cone. Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy, describing in detail (nearly a page) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales. Only then does he return to Mr. Townson, quoting him as saying [...] "The degree of the lateral power is surprising, and they <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> exercising it for amusement; they are, therefore, not a little mischievous. My pets would often come to my table whilst I was writing, and carry off my pencils... and tear them to pieces in a minute." [...] Yarrell then adds an observation of his own, and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist: [...] "Notwithstanding Buffon's assertion to the contrary, they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument." [...] He goes on to criticise Buffon's description of the crossbill's beak as [...] "an error and defect of Nature, and a useless deformity" [...] as [...] "an erroneous and hasty conclusion". Yarrell concludes by writing [...] "I have never met with a more interesting, or more beautiful example, of the adaptation of means to an end, than {{is to be found}} in the beak, the tongue, and their muscles, in the Crossbill".|$|E

500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards equivocation. [...] Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by [...] "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards [...] "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" [...] apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. [...] Mrs Russell, attractive to [...] "a number of clients among the youth, who <b>are</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her [...] "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". [...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated {{so as not to}} be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E
