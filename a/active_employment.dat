25|$|Hamilton {{was widely}} lauded for his daring feat. The House of Assembly in Jamaica awarded him a £300 sword. King George III created him a Knight Bachelor on 1 February 1800. Hamilton also {{received}} a Naval Gold Medal for the action.

The wounded Hamilton was sent home to recover aboard the Jamaica packet, but on her voyage she was captured by the French and Hamilton was taken prisoner. He was sent to Paris, where he seems to have come to the attention of Napoleon Bonaparte. Hamilton spent six months in prison, before being released and repatriated, having been exchanged for four French midshipmen. He finally made it to London, in time to be present at a special banquet held by the Court of Common Council of the City of London to celebrate the anniversary of his cutting out of the Hermione. Here he received his gold box and the freedom of the city. He was also offered a pension of £300 a year for his wounds, which he turned down. He was both rich enough from his prize money not to need the pension, and also feared that taking it might be used as an excuse not to give him <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> again.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: to {{accomplish}} the analysis of influence of the training loadings on the indices of the functional state and physical qualities in different age periods of sportsmen-veterans. Material & Methods: researches were conducted with the sportsmen-veterans (football players) of the different age groups (35 – 40; 41 – 45; 46 – 55) who continued to employ and participate in competitions after finishing of active performances in professional commands. The methods of determination of level of motive qualities and indices of the functional state of footballers-veterans were used. Results were calculated by the methods of mathematical statistics. Results: the results of long-term researches of determination of dynamics of changes of motive qualities level and functional state indices during age period 35 – 55 -years of football players are presented. Conclusions: it is determined that during the research period the most changes of level of physical qualities and indices of functional state are received {{in the period of}} 35 – 40 years, that is caused by plummet of the training and competitive loadings after <b>active</b> <b>employments</b> in professional soccer commands. ...|$|R

Within twenty-four hours she was hoping to be gone; her father and mother must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything got ready. Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough. The happiness she was imparting, too, happiness very little alloyed by the black communication which must briefly precede it--the joyful consent of her father and mother to Susan's going with her--the general satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded, and the ecstasy of Susan herself, was all serving to support her spirits.|$|R

40|$|The {{unemployment}} {{is an important}} economic {{as well as social}} problem which has a negative influence on not only the unemployed and their family but also our society. The society is trying {{to face up to the}} unemployment through a lot of ways. Measures of the <b>active</b> politics of <b>employment</b> are one of the possibilities of an increase in the employment rate. One of the tools of the <b>active</b> politics of <b>employment</b> is a contribution toward the creation of a socially efficient self-employment job. The purpose of this thesis was to conduct a survey of problems of the tools of the <b>active</b> politics of <b>employment</b> related to a support of beginning entrepreneurs. The first partial aim was to analyse the beginning entrepreneurs supported by these tools in South Bohemia. The second partial aim was to get a feedback from the beginning entrepreneurs supported by these tools of the <b>active</b> politics of <b>employment</b> in the Pisek District in the years 2007 through 2011 about how this support from the Employment Office helped them at the start of a business. The research part first included a secondary analysis of data related to the provision of the contribution toward the creation of the socially efficient self-employment job in South Bohemia. Then the data from the respondents who had received the given contribution were gathered through the qualitative research. The research included 11 participants who concluded a contract concerning the support given to the beginning entrepreneurs in the Pisek District after 2007. The findings result in the fact that some unemployed people can assert themselves at the market only if they start a business. All respondents agreed that this contribution had helped them at the start of their business even though the amount had not been large enough for many of them. The findings of the thesis bring information on the contribution toward the creation of the socially efficient self-employment job and the analysis of the information within South Bohemia. The findings can become a base for other researches related to the tools of the <b>active</b> politics of <b>employment</b> and they can also be used as a feedback for the Employment Office of the Czech Republic...|$|R

He appears to have held no further commands until October 1770, when he commissioned the 40-gun [...] {{during the period of}} the Falklands Crisis, when it was feared that war might break out with Spain. In the event, the crisis passed without breaking into open hostilities and Saxton paid Phoenix off in January 1771. In July 1771 he married Mary Bush.|$|E

Ever since the realization of the sacrament, I have been turned upside down". The eccentric Gordon was very religious, but he departed from Christian orthodoxy on a number of points. Gordon believed in reincarnation. In 1877, he wrote in a letter: [...] "This life is only {{one of a series of}} lives which our incarnated part has lived. I have little doubt of our having pre-existed; and that also in the time of our pre-existence we were actively employed. So, therefore, I believe in our <b>active</b> <b>employment</b> in a future life, and I like the thought." [...] Gordon was an ardent Christian cosmologist, who also believed that the Garden of Eden was on the island of Praslin in the Seychelles. Gordon believed that God's throne from which He governed the universe rested upon the earth, which was further surrounded by the firmament.|$|E
