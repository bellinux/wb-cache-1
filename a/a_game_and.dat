5|$|A {{video game}} {{walkthrough}} is a guide aimed towards improving a player's skill {{within a particular}} video game and often designed to assist players in completing either an entire video game or specific elements. Walkthroughs may alternatively be set up as a playthrough, where players record themselves playing through <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> upload or live-stream it to the internet. Walkthroughs may be considered guides on helping to enhance the experience of players, to assist towards unlocking game achievements or simply {{as a means to}} socialise with like-minded individuals as a distraction from everyday life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{investigate}} <b>a</b> two-person zero-sum <b>game</b> with fractional loss function, {{which we call}} the two-person zero-sum fractional game.

But, in many cases, {{it seems to be}} difficult to search directly for <b>a</b> <b>game</b> value <b>and</b> <b>a</b> saddle point of the fractional game. Thus, we study the existence and the properties of <b>a</b> <b>game</b> value <b>and</b> <b>a</b> saddle point for the game with the loss function including a parameter, which we call the two-person zero-sum parametric game. We show that, under various conditions, <b>a</b> <b>game</b> value <b>and</b> <b>a</b> saddle point of the parametric <b>game</b> with <b>a</b> special parameter are those of the fractional game. 1...|$|R

Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> {{there was talk of}} folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or {{near the bottom of the}} league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E

Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} season as a {{full-time}} MLB umpire, West umpired the game in which Willie McCovey hit his 500th career home run.

In 1981, West worked first base for Nolan Ryan’s fifth career no-hitter. On October 13, 1981, West was 28 when he became the youngest NL umpire to call an LCS. In 1983, West was suspended for three days and fined US$500 after a shoving incident with Atlanta Braves manager Joe Torre.

5|$|On August 27, as Columbus {{hosted the}} Havana Sugar Kings, Roberts became only the fifth player in International League history to hit four {{home runs in}} <b>a</b> <b>game</b> (<b>and</b> the first since Newark's Bob Seeds in 1938). It {{was also the first}} 4-home-run game in {{franchise}} history, as well as the first time a player on any team had performed the feat in Columbus. Roberts had struck only four home runs in 69 previous games with the Jets. Prior to the 1957 season, Roberts was traded to the New York Yankees as the player to be named later in a trade that sent former American League Most Valuable Player Bobby Shantz to the Yankees. In 1957 Roberts played with the New York Yankees minor league affiliate in Denver. At the end of the season, Roberts received several votes in the final tally for Most Valuable Player of the American Association, finishing behind Carl Willey of the Wichita Braves. Roberts never again reached the Majors, becoming a journeyman in the minor leagues and at one point played baseball in Nicaragua.|$|E

By September 27, with one week left in the season, the Cubs had battled back to within <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>and</b> a half game of the Pirates in the National League standings as the two teams met for a crucial three-game series.

5|$|On July 9, 2015, Davis {{signed a}} five-year, $145 million {{contract}} extension with the Pelicans. On November 6, he tied his career-high of 43 {{points in a}} loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On December 1, he tied a career-high 9 blocked shots in an offensive off night against the Memphis Grizzlies. On December 20, in a win over the Denver Nuggets, Davis scored a single-quarter career-high 19 first quarter points to finish the game with 27. On January 15, Davis converted an alley oop dunk from Jrue Holiday with 2 seconds remaining to give New Orleans a 109–107 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.

The following day, he {{was named to the}} NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge lineup. On February 21, in a win over the Detroit Pistons, Davis scored a franchise-record 59 points and pulled down 20 rebounds. The previous franchise record was 50 points by Jamal Mashburn exactly 13 years earlier against the Memphis Grizzlies. Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Webber as the only NBA players with 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game since 1983. Davis also became just the 20th player in NBA history to score at least 59 points in <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> became the youngest player in NBA history to score 59 points in <b>a</b> <b>game,</b> <b>and</b> the second youngest (behind Bob McAdoo) to record 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game. The 59 points was an NBA-wide season high at the time. The total was not surpassed until the final night of the season when Kobe Bryant posted 60 in his final career game. Davis posted a third 40-point game (40 points and 13 rebounds) on March 9 against the Charlotte Hornets. On March 20, he was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season with a left knee injury and a torn labrum in his left shoulder.
