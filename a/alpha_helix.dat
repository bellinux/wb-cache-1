25|$|Cystatin C is a non-glycosylated, basic protein (isoelectric {{point at}} pH 9.3). The crystal {{structure}} of cystatin C {{is characterized by}} a short <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> and a long <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> which lies across a large antiparallel, five-stranded beta sheet. Like other type 2 cystatins, it has two disulfide bonds. Around 50% of the molecules carry a hydroxylated proline. Cystatin C forms dimers (molecule pairs) by exchanging subdomains; in the paired state, each half is made up of the long <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> and one beta strand of one partner, and four beta strands of the other partner.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, {{based on}} the {{structures}} of amino acids and peptides and the planar nature of the peptide bond, Pauling, Robert Corey and Herman Branson correctly proposed the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> and beta sheet as the primary structural motifs in protein secondary structure. This work exemplified Pauling's ability to think unconventionally; central to the structure was the unorthodox assumption that one turn of the helix may well contain a non-integer number of amino acid residues; for the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> it is 3.7 amino acid residues per turn.|$|E

25|$|The {{hydrogen}} bonds lie roughly {{in the plane}} of the sheet, with the peptide carbonyl groups pointing in alternating directions with successive residues; for comparison, successive carbonyls point in the same direction in the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix.</b>|$|E
25|$|The basic {{region of}} HIV-Tat protein is {{suggested}} {{to form an}} <b>alpha</b> <b>helix.</b> The basic region is involved in RNA (TAR, trans-activation response element) binding and Tat proteins thus belong {{to the family of}} arginine-rich motif (ARM) RNA binding proteins.|$|E
25|$|Plastid {{terminal}} oxidase is {{an integral}} membrane protein, or more specifically, an integral monotopic protein and is bound to the thylakoid membrane facing the stroma. Based on sequence homology, the enzyme is predicted to contain four <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> domains that encapsulate a di-iron center. The two iron atoms are ligated by six essential conserved histidine and glutamate residues – Glu136, Glu175, His171, Glu227, Glu296, and His299. The predicted structure {{is similar to that}} of the alternative oxidase, with an additional Exon 8 domain that is required for the plastid oxidase’s activity and stability. The enzyme is anchored to the membrane by a short fifth <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> that contains a Tyr212 residue hypothesized to be involved in substrate binding.|$|E
5000|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the MenH enzyme in E.coli (SHCHC synthase) exists as a complex of three protein molecules shown in the diagram. SHCHC synthase forms an alpha/beta hydrolase fold with a central set of seven parallel beta sheets surrounded by <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes</b> on both sides. A cap of five <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes</b> serves to enclose the active site. The enzyme exists in an open form until it binds the substrate, when it morphs into a closed form with an active catalytic triad.|$|R

25|$|Crick {{taught himself}} the {{mathematical}} theory of X-ray crystallography. During {{the period of}} Crick's study of X-ray diffraction, researchers in the Cambridge lab were attempting to determine the most stable helical conformation of amino acid chains in proteins (the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix).</b> Linus Pauling {{was the first to}} identify the 3.6amino acids per helix turn ratio of the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix.</b> Crick was witness to the kinds of errors that his co-workers made in their failed attempts to make a correct molecular model of the alpha helix; these turned out to be important lessons that could be applied, in the future, to the helical structure of DNA. For example, he learned the importance of the structural rigidity that double bonds confer on molecular structures which is relevant both to peptide bonds in proteins and the structure of nucleotides in DNA.|$|E
25|$|IL-2 is {{a member}} of a {{cytokine}} family, each member of which has a four <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> bundle; the family also includes IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. IL-2 signals through the IL-2 receptor, a complex consisting of three chains, termed alpha, beta and gamma. The gamma chain is shared by all family members.|$|E

50|$|Compatible {{parameters}} for proteins were introduced by Monticelli et al.. Secondary structure elements, like <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes</b> and beta sheets (β-sheets), are constrained.

50|$|More {{testing is}} needed to {{evaluate}} the performance of different implicit solvation models and parameter sets. They are often tested only for a small set of molecules with very simple structure, such as hydrophobic and amphiphilic <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes</b> (α). This method was rarely tested for hundreds of protein structures.|$|R
25|$|In 1951 and 1952, {{together}} with William Cochran and Vladimir Vand, Crick {{assisted in the}} development of a mathematical theory of X-ray diffraction by a helical molecule. This theoretical result matched well with X-ray data for proteins that contain sequences of amino acids in the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> conformation. Helical diffraction theory turned out to also be useful for understanding the structure of DNA.|$|E
25|$|In general, this {{phenomenon}} will be exhibited in absorption bands of any optically active molecule. As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by most biological molecules, {{because of the}} dextrorotary (e.g. some sugars) and levorotary (e.g. some amino acids) molecules they contain. Noteworthy as well is that a secondary structure will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix,</b> beta sheet and random coil regions of proteins and the double helix of nucleic acids have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{proteins}} in the gamma secretase complex are heavily modified by proteolysis during assembly and maturation of the complex; a required activation step {{is in the}} autocatalytic cleavage of presenilin to N- and C-terminal fragments. Nicastrin's primary role is in maintaining {{the stability of the}} assembled complex and regulating intracellular protein trafficking. PEN-2 associates with the complex via binding of a transmembrane domain of presenilin and, among other possible roles, helps to stabilize the complex after presenilin proteolysis has generated the activated N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. APH-1, which is required for proteolytic activity, binds to the complex via a conserved <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> interaction motif and aids in initiating assembly of premature components.|$|E
50|$|PSI-blast based {{secondary}} structure PREDiction (PSIPRED) {{is a method}} used to investigate protein structure. It uses artificial neural network machine learning methods in its algorithm. It is a server-side program, featuring a website serving as a front-end interface, which can predict a protein's {{secondary structure}} (beta sheets, <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes</b> and coils) from the primary sequence.|$|R
50|$|The c14orf93 protein has 9 isoforms. The {{most common}} and largest isoform has 538 AAs, a {{molecular}} weight of 58.7 kdal, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.7. This protein is globular with a conserved C-terminus, a mixed charge cluster from 371 to 399, and a high scoring uncharged segment from 28 to 58. SDSC PELE consensus data predicts 15 <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes</b> and 8 beta strands.|$|R
50|$|The {{protein in}} its longest form has 8 exons. There is another {{possible}} isoform, but experimental confirmation is lacking - possibly due to it being produced at low levels {{because of an}} immature stop codon. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that the protein does not have transmembrane structure and is composed of both <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes</b> and beta sheets. There have been conflicting numbers for SPATS1 isoelectric points. Several sources have said 6.68, while two others suggested that it is higher, 7.04 and 7.47.|$|R
25|$|In 1948 Pauling {{discovered}} that many proteins included helical (see <b>alpha</b> <b>helix)</b> shapes. Pauling had deduced this structure from X-ray patterns and from attempts to physically model the structures. (Pauling was also later to suggest an incorrect three chain helical DNA structure based on Astbury's data.) Even {{in the initial}} diffraction data from DNA by Maurice Wilkins, {{it was evident that}} the structure involved helices. But this insight was only a beginning. There remained the questions of how many strands came together, whether this number was the same for every helix, whether the bases pointed toward the helical axis or away, and ultimately what were the explicit angles and coordinates of all the bonds and atoms. Such questions motivated the modeling efforts of Watson and Crick.|$|E
25|$|In February 1953, Francis Crick and James Watson of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University {{had started}} to build a {{molecular}} model of the B form of DNA using data similar to that available to both teams at King's. Much of their data was derived directly from research done at King's by Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin's research was completed by February 1953, ahead of her move to Birkbeck, and her data was critical. Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation {{of the structure of}} the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> by Linus Pauling in 1951, but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.|$|E
25|$|The Generalized Born (GB) model {{augmented}} {{with the}} hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area (SA) term is GBSA. It {{is among the}} most commonly used implicit solvent model combinations. The use of this model in the context of molecular mechanics is termed MM/GBSA. Although this formulation has been shown to successfully identify the native states of short peptides with well-defined tertiary structure, the conformational ensembles produced by GBSA models in other studies differ significantly from those produced by explicit solvent and do not identify the protein's native state. In particular, salt bridges are overstabilized, possibly due to insufficient electrostatic screening, and a higher-than-native <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> population was observed. Variants of the GB model have also been developed to approximate the electrostatic environment of membranes, which have had some success in folding the transmembrane helixes of integral membrane proteins.|$|E
40|$|A broad {{repertory}} of G-protein-coupled receptors shows effective coupling {{with the}} haematopoietic G 16 protein. In the present study, individual residues along the C-terminal <b>alpha</b> 5 <b>helix</b> of Galpha 16 were examined {{for their contributions}} in defining receptor-coupling specificity. Residues that are relatively conserved within, but diverse between, the subfamilies of cloned Galpha subunits were mutated into the corresponding Galpha(z) residues. Six G(i) -linked receptors with different coupling efficiencies to Galpha 16 were examined {{for their ability to}} utilize the various Galpha 16 mutants to mediate agonist-induced inositol phosphate accumulation and Ca 2 + mobilization. Co-operative enhancements of receptor coupling were observed with chimaeras harbouring multiple mutations at Glu 350, Lys 357 and Leu 364 of Galpha 16. Mutation of Leu 364 into isoleucine appeared to be more efficient in enhancing receptor recognition compared with mutations at the other two sites. Mutation of a stretch of six consecutive residues (362 - 367) lying {{towards the end of the}} <b>alpha</b> 5 <b>helix</b> was found to broaden significantly the receptor-coupling profile of Galpha 16, and the effect was mediated partly through interactions with the beta 2 -beta 3 loop. These results suggested that a stretch of six distinctive residues at the <b>alpha</b> 5 <b>helix</b> of Galpha 16 is particularly important, whereas other discrete residues spreading along the <b>alpha</b> 5 <b>helix</b> function co-operatively for determining the specificity of receptor recognition...|$|R
50|$|Sequence {{found in}} RASEF protein that {{contains}} 35 amino acids (36 {{in the second}} one). The two EF hand domains are consecutively located at the “beginning” of the protein. Its name “N-terminal” indicates an amino group (characteristic of this group of biomolecules, {{as well as the}} C- terminal ending). The first one goes from the 8th amino acid to the 42nd, and the other to the 42nd to the 77th.“EF hand” refers to the shape of this domain (similarity with the right hand’s morphology). Ca+2 ions are responsible for this structure, which by binding metals join two <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes.</b>|$|R

Proneural genes encode a group of bHLH proteins that play crucial roles in controlling cell fate in a variety of tissue types. [...] Basic helix-loop-helix proteins are characterized by two <b>alpha</b> <b>helixes</b> separated by a loop.

25|$|His work on {{chemical}} bonding marks {{him as one}} of {{the founders}} of modern quantum chemistry. The Nature of the Chemical Bond was the standard work for many years, and concepts like hybridization and electronegativity remain part of standard chemistry textbooks. While his Valence bond approach fell short of accounting quantitatively for some of the characteristics of molecules, such as the color of organometallic complexes, and would later be eclipsed by the molecular orbital theory of Robert Mulliken, Valence Bond Theory still competes, in its modern form, with Molecular Orbital Theory and density functional theory (DFT) as a way of describing the chemical phenomena. Pauling's work on crystal structure contributed significantly to the prediction and elucidation of the structures of complex minerals and compounds. His discovery of the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> and beta sheet is a fundamental foundation for the study of protein structure.|$|E
25|$|For {{the better}} part of two years, Crick worked on the {{physical}} properties of cytoplasm at Cambridge's Strangeways Research Laboratory, headed by Honor Bridget Fell, with a Medical Research Council studentship, until he joined Max Perutz and John Kendrew at the Cavendish Laboratory. The Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge was under the general direction of Sir Lawrence Bragg, who had won the Nobel Prize in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg was influential in the effort to beat a leading American chemist, Linus Pauling, to the discovery of DNA's structure (after having been pipped at the post by Pauling's success in determining the <b>alpha</b> <b>helix</b> structure of proteins). At the same time Bragg's Cavendish Laboratory was also effectively competing with King's College London, whose Biophysics department was under the direction of Randall. (Randall had refused Crick's application to work at King's College.) Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins of King's College were personal friends, which influenced subsequent scientific events as much as the close friendship between Crick and James Watson. Crick and Wilkins first met at King's College and not, as erroneously recorded by two authors, at the Admiralty during World War II.|$|E
25|$|When Watson came to Cambridge, Crick was a 35-year-old {{graduate}} student (due {{to his work}} during WWII) and Watson was only 23, but he already had a Ph.D. They shared {{an interest in the}} fundamental problem of learning how genetic information might be stored in molecular form. Watson and Crick talked endlessly about DNA and the idea that {{it might be possible to}} guess a good molecular model of its structure. A key piece of experimentally-derived information came from X-ray diffraction images that had been obtained by Wilkins, Franklin, and Gosling. In November 1951, Wilkins came to Cambridge and shared his data with Watson and Crick. Alexander Stokes (another expert in helical diffraction theory) and Wilkins (both at King's College) had reached the conclusion that X-ray diffraction data for DNA indicated that the molecule had a helical structure—but Franklin vehemently disputed this conclusion. Stimulated by their discussions with Wilkins and what Watson learned by attending a talk given by Franklin about her work on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Their hurry to produce a model of DNA structure was driven in part by the knowledge that they were competing against Linus Pauling. Given Pauling's recent success in discovering the <b>Alpha</b> <b>helix,</b> they feared that Pauling might also be the first to determine the structure of DNA.|$|E

The N-terminal two helices of the homeodomain are antiparallel and the longer C-terminal helix is roughly perpendicular to the axes established by the first two. It is this third helix that interacts directly with DNA via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as indirect interactions via water molecules, which occur between specific side chains and the exposed bases within the major groove of the DNA.|$|R
