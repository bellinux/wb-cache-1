25|$|Preobrazhenskaya Zastava (Преображенская Застава, 2003) {{is a whole}} block (308 {{apartments and}} retail stores) {{designed}} during the early 1930s with a style similar to the Art Deco adaptations by of Iofan and Vladimirov. An unusual example which <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a period piece, not a modern replica.|$|E
25|$|New postconstuctivist {{or early}} stalinka {{buildings}} are rare. Preobrazhenskaya Zastava (Преображенская Застава) mixed-use project (two blocks, 308 apartments and retail stores) {{was completed in}} 2002–2005. Unusually for present-day Moscow, it <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a period piece, not a cheap modern replica. There are no trademark square columns or slim porticos, yet {{it is the best}} attempt to recreate a style of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|From outside, {{the temple}} <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a ekakuta (single tower and shrine) temple {{because the two}} lateral shrines are simple {{extensions}} of {{the wall of the}} mantapa. Their towers are a later addition. This {{is a classic example of}} a trikuta (three shrines and towers) that looks like a ekakuta. A large open hall with tall pillars was added during later times making the original porch and closed mantapa look like the inner portion of the temple. The central shrine has five projections per side and the tower is complete though without the kalasha (decorative structure on top). Since the shrine is square in plan, the topping roof (a helmet like sculptured stone) follows the same plan. There are three tiers of decorative smaller roofs bearing their own kalasa that form the body of the main tower. The superstructure on top of the vestibule (forming the nose) has only two tiers of decorative roofs. This is why the sukanasi looks like an extension of the main tower. The two lateral shrines also have five projections per side. The top of these shrines and the wall of the mantapa are crowned with a row of decorated roofs just like the main shrine.|$|E

500|$|Despite the film's {{generally}} mixed reception, critics praised Sawa's {{performance as}} Alex. [...] Holden of The New York Times commented that [...] "The disaster and Alex's premonitions {{set up a}} heavy-handed fable about death and teenage illusions of invulnerability". David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews remarked [...] "Sawa's personable turn as the hero is matched by a uniformly effective supporting cast rife with familiar faces (i.e. Seann William Scott, Brendan Fehr, Tony Todd, etc)...," [...] while Leydon of Variety pointed out that [...] "Sawa is credible as the second-sighted Alex—unlike many other actors cast a teen protagonists, he <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> he might still be attending high school—but the supporting players are an uneven bunch". LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Sawa and Ali Larter's pairing, saying that [...] "Larter and Sawa, who becomes more scruffy and wild-eyed as the film progresses, make an appealing pair".|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing to have happen {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|First Contact {{garnered}} positive reviews on release. Ryan Gilbey of The Independent {{considered the}} film wise {{to dispense with}} the cast of The Original Series: [...] "For the first time, a Star Trek movie <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> something more ambitious than an extended TV show," [...] he wrote. Conversely, critic Bob Thompson felt that First Contact was more {{in the spirit of}} the 1960s television series than any previous installment. The Globe and Mail Elizabeth Renzeti said that First Contact succeeded in improving on the [...] "stilted" [...] previous entry in the series, and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style." [...] Adrian Martin of The Age noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans: [...] "Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry will just have to struggle to comprehend as best they can," [...] he wrote, but [...] "cult-followers will be in heaven". The New York Times Janet Maslin said that the [...] "film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees" [...] of the series, while Variety Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non-fans alike would enjoy the film. While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change, Maslin said that without the original stars, [...] "The series now lacks [...] much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be, something the noncultist is never less likely to enjoy." [...] For one thing, this film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees. }} Conversely, Roger Ebert called First Contact one of the best Star Trek films, and James Berardinelli found the film the most entertaining Star Trek feature in a decade; [...] "It has single-handedly revived the Star Trek movie series, at least from a creative point of view," [...] he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|Much of Off Beats tone {{is derived}} from its {{relation}} to urban culture. The fictional version of New York City that Quick has constructed is incredibly rich in detail, with attention to minuscule factors such as street addresses and subway/bus commute schedules. Often, the establishing shots of a scene will concentrate on landscape to capture in essence how a given area affects or portrays characters within that scene. Examples include shots of busy traffic and corner stores, Tory's messy room, and a dilapidated park. References are made to such problems as gang warfare, counterfeiting, illegal immigration, arms dealing, and terrorism {{in the form of}} bomb threats. Conspiracy theory and hacker subculture are also subjects that are explored. Editor Lillian Diaz-Przybyl has commented:"It features a spot-on, great depiction of New York. Everything Fake does wrong with setting, this does right. The location sets a brilliant backdrop for a really great story with a smart Walter Mitty twist, and cute guys to boot! It's truly manga with an American sensibility. The character designs are unique and appealing, the romance is sweet and understated, and it <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> Queens, which makes me really happy." ...|$|E
