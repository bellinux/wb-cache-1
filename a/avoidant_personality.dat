Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, <b>avoidant</b> <b>personality</b> disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E

25|$|Social anxiety {{varies in}} degree and severity. For some people, it is {{characterized}} by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases {{it can lead to}} a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. Those suffering from this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including <b>avoidant</b> <b>personality</b> disorder.|$|E
25|$|MAOIs {{have been}} found to be {{effective}} in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, atypical depression or mixed anxiety and depression, bulimia, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as borderline personality disorder. MAOIs appear to be particularly effective in the management of bipolar depression according to a recent retrospective-analysis. There are reports of MAOI efficacy in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), trichotillomania, dysmorphophobia, and <b>avoidant</b> <b>personality</b> disorder, but these reports are from uncontrolled case reports.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} traits {{identified}} in first degree relatives of those diagnosed with schizophrenia {{associated with the}} spectrum. Other spectrum approaches include more specific individual phenomena which may also occur in non-clinical forms in the general population, such as some paranoid beliefs or hearing voices. Some researchers have also proposed that <b>avoidant</b> <b>personality</b> disorder and related social anxiety traits should be considered part of a schizophrenia spectrum. Psychosis accompanied by mood disorder may be included as a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, or may be classed separately as below.|$|E
40|$|The present thesis explores whether mentalization-based {{psychotherapy}} (MBT), on theoretical grounds, may {{be applicable}} {{in the treatment}} of patients with <b>avoidant</b> and paranoid <b>personality</b> disorders. We describe the development of mentalization and the principles of MBT. Characteristics of the two diagnostic groups in question are presented and compared with borderline personality disorder, for which the effectiveness of MBT has been empirically documented. We discuss whether patients with <b>avoidant</b> and paranoid <b>personality</b> disorders have mentalizing failures and whether MBT might be an applicable treatment alternative for such disorders. If so, we further explore weather modifications are needed in order to increase the effectiveness of MBT treatment for the relevant diagnostic groups. Our analyses indicate that both patients with avoidant and patients with paranoid personality disorders consistently manifest mentalizing failures. We therefore suggest that MBT might be useful for these patients, but in order to achieve optimal results, the treatment needs to be adapted. Finally, we provide some ideas for potential modifications for each personality disorder. As our conclusions are only tentative, there is a need of studies, empirically addressing the effect of MBT for <b>avoidant</b> and paranoid <b>personality</b> disorders...|$|R

The {{empirical}} and theoretical literature suggest that several proposed personality disorders (PDs) - Masochistic/Self-Defeating, Depressive, and Vulnerably Narcissistic - may be related through a common self-representation know as Malignant Self-Regard (MSR). To assess this construct, the MSR Questionnaire (MSRQ) was developed. Though its initial psychometric properties were very strong, the present study extended these findings by examining {{the relationship of the}} MSRQ with measures of other PDs and depressive subtypes, and by establishing four-week and eight-week test-retest reliability in two samples (Ns = 840, 911) of undergraduate students. The MSRQ was internally consistent and temporally stable over four and eight weeks. It was positively correlated with measures of introjective and anaclitic depression, measures of Self-Defeating, Depressive, and Vulnerably Narcissistic personalities (rs ranging between 0. 60 and 0. 82), and other select PDs. After controlling for depressive symptoms and self-esteem, the highest remaining partial correlations were with Vulnerably Narcissistic, Self-Defeating, Depressive, and <b>Avoidant</b> <b>personalities.</b> A factor analysis of the MSRQ with measures of other PDs yielded a two-factor solution, with MSR loading most strongly on one factor, along with Vulnerably Narcissistic, Avoidant, Depressive, and Self-Defeating personalities. It is concluded that MSR is a psychometrically supported construct that might have good clinical utility in explaining personality pathology that has historically been difficult to assess...|$|R

25|$|SAD shows a {{high degree}} of co-occurrence with other {{psychiatric}} disorders. In fact, a population-based study found that 66% of those with SAD had one or more additional mental health disorders. SAD often occurs alongside low self-esteem and most commonly clinical depression, perhaps {{due to a lack of}} personal relationships and long periods of isolation related to social avoidance. Clinical depression is 1.49 to 3.5 times more likely to occur in those with SAD. Anxiety disorders are also very common in patients with SAD, in particular generalized anxiety disorder. <b>Avoidant</b> <b>personality</b> disorder is also highly correlated with SAD, with comorbidity rates ranging from 25% to 89%.|$|E
25|$|Social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) and ORS have some demographic and clinical similarities. Where the social anxiety and avoidance behavior is primarily focussed on concern about body odors, ORS {{is a more}} appropriate diagnosis than <b>avoidant</b> <b>personality</b> disorder or SAD. Body dismorphic disorder (BDD) {{has been described as}} the closest diagnosis in DSM-IV to ORS as both primarily focus on bodily symptoms. The defining difference between the two is that in BDD the preoccupation is with physical appearance not body odors. Similarly, where obsessive behaviors are directly and consistently related to body odors rather than anything else, ORS is a more appropriate diagnosis than obsessive compulsive disorder, in which obsessions are different and multiple over time.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies show}} that, {{although}} brats move on average every 3 years, {{they do not}} grow accustomed to moving. The constantly changing environment and openness to others has a price. Rather than develop problem-solving skills, there is a temptation to simply leave a problem without resolving it. If a person does not like somebody or gets into a fight, they know {{that in a few}} years somebody will move and the problem will disappear. On the other hand, when brats marry it is generally for life; over two thirds of brats over 40 are married to their first spouse. Studies show that many brats become very adaptable {{as a result of the}} mobile lifestyle, But there is also a higher than average incidence, among a minority of military brats, of <b>Avoidant</b> <b>Personality</b> Disorder and Separation Anxiety Disorder.|$|E
25|$|On the {{negative}} side, {{studies show that}} some former military brats struggle to develop and maintain deep, lasting relationships, and can feel like outsiders to U.S. civilian culture. The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships with people and developing emotional attachments to specific places, as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to a war zone and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents. In some cases {{there is also the}} loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability. A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed). A significant minority of ex-military brats may exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, <b>Avoidant</b> <b>Personality</b> Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, etc.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{mention of}} the {{psychiatric}} term social phobia (phobie des situations sociales), {{was made in the}} early 1900s. Psychologists used the term [...] "social neurosis" [...] to describe extremely shy patients in the 1930s. After extensive work by Joseph Wolpe on systematic desensitization, research on phobias and their treatment grew. The idea that social phobia was a separate entity from other phobias came from the British psychiatrist Isaac Marks, in the 1960s. This was accepted by the American Psychiatric Association and was first officially included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The definition of the phobia was revised in 1989 to allow comorbidity with <b>avoidant</b> <b>personality</b> disorder, and introduced generalized social phobia. Social phobia had been largely ignored prior to 1985.|$|E
40|$|A {{previous}} study in proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM/DM- 2) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM- 1) using brain {{positron emission tomography}} demonstrated a reduced cerebral blood flow in the frontal and temporal regions associated with cognitive impairment.

Nineteen patients with genetically determined PROMM/DM- 2 and 21 patients with moderately severe DM- 1 underwent neuropsychological testing and neuropsychiatric interviews. DM- 1 and PROMM/DM- 2 patients had significantly lower scores on tests of frontal lobe function compared to controls. Neuropsychiatric interviews demonstrated an <b>avoidant</b> trait <b>personality</b> disorder in both patient groups. Brain single photon emission computed tomography showed frontal and parieto-occipital hypoperfusion.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Psychology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Adult {{attachment}} and personality traits can impact an individual???s attributions of perfectionism. This study explored {{the predictor variables}} of adult attachment (anxious and <b>avoidant)</b> and <b>personality</b> traits on the criterion variable of multidimensional perfectionism as measured by four dimensions of perfectionism; Adaptive, Maladaptive, High Standards, and Order, subscales that divide perfectionism into adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists. Adaptive perfectionists manifest the positive qualities of perfectionism while maladaptive perfectionists manifest the negative qualities. A multiple regression analysis yielded four significant prediction models of perfectionism. The models indicate {{that there is a}} significant relationship that exists between the weighted linear composite of the independent variables as specified by the model and each criterion variable of perfectionism. Adult attachment did not significantly predict any dimension of perfectionism. The results suggest that personality traits are a potential implication in the formulation of these four perfectionism dimensions. Psycholog...|$|R

There were no differences in personality disorder cognitions between eating disorder diagnoses. This study also examines {{the possibility that there}} are clusters of patients, differentiated by patterns of personality disorder cognition.

40|$|Both <b>avoidant</b> and {{borderline}} <b>personality</b> disorder (APD and BPD) are theoretically {{associated with}} temperamental vulnerabilities, adverse attachment experiences, and negative (pessimistic or catastrophic) {{reactions to the}} threat of perceived rejection; however, more work is needed to differentiate how these processes account for the etiology and maintenance of both disorders. In this study, 156 adults completed questionnaires measuring APD and BPD features, temperament (sensory-processing sensitivity), mood, and attachment experiences. A vignette task was devised to examine pessimistic cognitive-affective reactions in situations signaling potential rejection. Both APD and BPD were associated with temperamental sensitivity, but BPD was uniquely linked with a subscale measuring sensitivity to mental and emotive stimuli, whereas APD was uniquely linked with a subscale measuring the control and avoidance of aversive stimulation. Compared to APD, BPD was more strongly linked with negative moods (anxiety, anger, sadness) and insecure attachment to parents, whereas APD was more strongly linked (than BPD) to pessimistic cognitive-affective responses to rejection-related situations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{personality}} disorders are prescribed psychotropic medications with greater frequency {{than almost any}} other diagnostic group. Prescribing practices in these populations are often based on anecdotal evidence rather than rigorous data. Although evidence-based psychotherapy remains an integral part of treatment, Axis II psychopathology is increasingly conceptualized according to neurobiological substrates that correspond to specific psychopharmacological strategies. We summarize the best available evidence regarding medication treatment of personality disordered patients and provide optimal strategies for evidence-based practice. Most available evidence is concentrated around borderline and schizotypal {{personality disorders}}, with some additional evidence concerning the treatment of <b>avoidant</b> and antisocial <b>personality</b> disorders. Although maladaptive personality symptoms respond to antidepressants, anti-psychotics, mood stabilizers, and other medications, evidence-based pharmacotherapy is most useful in treating circumscribed symptom domains and induces only partial improvement. Most available evidence supports use of medication in reducing impulsivity and aggression, characteristic of borderline and antisocial psychopathology.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study investigated self- and other-esteem responses to either fully supportive or less supportive interpersonal feedback in college students with <b>avoidant</b> and borderline <b>personality</b> disorder features (APD and BPD, respectively). Disturbances in self-esteem and in evaluations of others {{are central to}} definitions of both APD and BPD, but {{the extent to which}} such interpersonal appraisals are responsive to contextual features, such as evaluative feedback from others, is not yet clear. In theory, we would expect that individuals with pronounced PD features would show more inflexible and more negative self- and other-evaluations than those without PD features. In this study with 169 undergraduates, APD but not BPD features were associated with other-contingent state self-esteem and other-esteem. A significant interaction indicated that highly avoidant respondents felt particularly negatively about themselves and their close others in situations that conveyed subtle criticism but not in situations signaling unequivocal support. This suggests that their self- and other-esteem, rather than being rigidly negative, is instead highly contingent upon interpersonal feedback. Such context-contingency has implications for the trait-like description of diagnostic characteristics within current taxonomies and is in line with contemporary dynamic models of personality structure and process...|$|R

Using a regression model of bias based on theory of educational test bias, this study investigated differences in regression lines of men and women in the relationship between presence of a diagnostic criterion and level of impairment. We found relatively little evidence of sex bias in the DSM-IV criteria for these four personality disorders. However, eight of nine borderline personality disorder criteria did display a functional disparity between men and women on a measure of global functioning. Perhaps these borderline criteria are functioning differently for men than women and should be the focus of future research...|$|R
