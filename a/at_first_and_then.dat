25|$|After {{leaving the}} World Wrestling Federation in 1991, Roma turned to pro boxing, {{competing}} under Paul Roma {{since it was}} the name that he thought had the most recognition factor. He had a sum total of three professional boxing matches. In his debut match on March 6, 1992 Roma lost via TKO in the fourth round to a fighter named Jerry Arentzen, when his trainer threw in the towel. The victory was one of Arentzen's two wins in 22 matches. On April 1, 1992 he defeated Norman Fortini and then on May 5, 1992 he fought and defeated Norman Shrink, this was both Fortini's and Shrink's only professional boxing match ever. After the third fight Roma stopped boxing and returned to professional wrestling on the independent circuit <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> eventually WCW.|$|E
25|$|The play {{features}} {{three groups}} of characters that interact slightly <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> come together in the Battle of Shrewsbury, where {{the success of the}} rebellion will be decided. First there is King Henry himself and his immediate council. He is the engine of the play, but usually in the background. Next there is the group of rebels, energetically embodied in Henry Percy ("Hotspur") and including his father, the Earl of Northumberland and led by his uncle Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester. The Scottish Earl of Douglas, Edmund Mortimer and the Welshman Owen Glendower also join. Finally, at the centre of the play are the young Prince Hal and his companions Falstaff, Poins, Bardolph, and Peto. Streetwise and pound-foolish, these rogues manage to paint over this grim history in the colours of comedy.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} plunderable portables from the Etruscan tombs of Etruria are the finely {{engraved}} gemstones set in patterned gold to form circular or ovoid pieces intended {{to go on}} finger rings. Of the magnitude of one centimeter, they are dated to the Etruscan floruit from {{the second half of}} the sixth to the first centuries BC. The two main theories of manufacture are native Etruscan and Greek. The materials are mainly dark red carnelian, with agate and sard entering usage from the third to the first centuries BC, along with purely gold finger rings with a hollow engraved bezel setting. The engravings, mainly cameo, but sometimes intaglio, depict scarabs <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> scenes from Greek mythology, often with heroic personages called out in Etruscan. The gold setting of the bezel bears a border design, such as cabling.|$|E

25|$|According to Ward, when, {{in about}} 1,500 million years, the {{distance}} of the Moon, which is continuously increasing from tidal effects, has increased from the current 60.3 to approximately 66.5 Earth radii, resonances from planetary effects will push precession to 49,000 years <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> when the Moon reaches 68 Earth radii in about 2,000 million years, to 69,000 years. This will be associated with wild swings in the obliquity of the ecliptic as well. Ward, however, used the abnormally large modern value for tidal dissipation. Using the 620-million year average provided by tidal rhythmites of about half the modern value, these resonances will not be reached until about 3,000 and 4,000 million years, respectively. However, due to the gradually increasing luminosity of the Sun, the oceans of the Earth will have vaporized long before that time (about 2,100 million years from now).|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{worked hard}} to reduce the defense budget. This meant some {{immediate}} cutbacks in Fiscal Year 1953 funds and {{a concerted effort to}} economize in subsequent years. Total obligational authority approved by Congress during Wilson's tenure decreased significantly <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> began to creep back up, but remained lower than the Truman administration's last budgets (that were inflated because of the Korean War). The TOA for FY 1953, Truman's final Defense budget, was $44.2 billion. TOA in subsequent fiscal years was: 1954, $30.4 billion; 1955, $33.7 billion; 1956, $33.06 billion; 1957, $39.7 billion; and 1958, $41.1 billion. Especially after 1954, when the Democrats regained control of Congress, the Wilson-Eisenhower effort to curb defense expenditures provoked growing criticism. The Air Force, even though the New Look enhanced its role, opposed the decision to cut back from the Truman goal of 143 wings, and its congressional supporters tried repeatedly, sometimes successfully, to appropriate more money for air power than the administration wanted. The other services, especially the Army, objected to force reductions ordained by the New Look. Both General Ridgway, who retired as Army chief of staff in June 1955, and his successor, General Maxwell D. Taylor, believed that the Army was receiving too small a share of the military budget.|$|E

500|$|While {{developing}} the series, Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry envisioned Susan {{as a girl}} next door and chose her to convey this image. In the original pilot, the character's surname was spelled [...] "Meyer" [...] but had to be changed to [...] "Mayer" [...] for clearance purposes. Cherry commented, [...] "I knew Susan {{was going to be}} my anchor character, and I didn't really know my take on her <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> {{it occurred to me that}} one of these women should be divorced... I thought there was something so real about a woman saying, 'I don't have much time left,' and when this available hunky guy moves onto the street, something in her saying 'Let me at him'". The character is a compendium of single mothers in Cherry's life [...] "desperate to land a man". He also drew upon his own personal experiences while creating the character.|$|E

500|$|Both sexes of all {{subspecies}} have horns, {{with those}} of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of the maximum horn length is , recorded from a Namibian red hartebeest. The horns of the western hartebeest are thick and appear U-shaped from the front and Z-shaped from the sides, growing backward <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> forward, ending with a sharp backward turn. The horns of the red and the Lelwel hartebeest {{are similar to those}} of the western hartebeest, but appear V-shaped when viewed from the front. The Lichtenstein's hartebeest has thick parallel ringed horns, with a flat base. Its horns are shorter than those of other subspecies, curving upward then sharply forward, followed by an inward turn at an angle of about 45° and a final backward turn. The horns of Swayne's hartebeest are thin and shaped like parentheses, curving upward and then backward. The horns of the Tora hartebeest are particularly thin and spread out sideways, diverging more than in any other subspecies.|$|E
500|$|When Tankersley was four, {{her father}} died by suicide, {{believed}} to be partly attributed to his defeat for renomination in 1924. [...] Her mother remarried in 1932 to Albert Gallatin Simms, a congressman from New Mexico, lawyer, and banker. Tankersley spent part of her childhood on her mother's Rock River dairy farm in Byron, Illinois, and later moved to the Southwest {{with her mother and}} stepfather, living at a ranch owned by Simms in Albuquerque, New Mexico, <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> moving in 1937 to the Trinchera Ranch, a [...] property in Colorado that her mother had purchased. Tankersley attended a boarding school in Virginia and spent summers in the West. Her love of horses in general and the Arabian horse in particular came from those years: [...] "Right away, my stepfather bought me a cow pony, and I wore it out... So my mother got me a [...] Arabian that I couldn't wear out." [...] She also showed horses on the East Coast in the 1930s. Her interest in Arabian horses led her to meet several major breeders of the time, including Jimmie Dean of Traveler's Rest, Roger Selby, W.R. Brown and Carl Raswan.|$|E
