40|$|I’d like {{to thank}} you <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> us today. Let me start by sharing some {{information}} about today’s format. Each caller will have three minutes to make their comments. We will notify you when you have 30 seconds left in your comment period, so please at that point wrap up your other comments to allow other speakers an opportunity to be heard. Panelists will not be answering questions or responding to statements today that are voiced during this comment period. So please keep your comments professional, succinct and relevant to today’s topic. This session is being recorded and it will be available for playback at a later date and with that we look forward to the input and participation of everyone who is registered. At this point, I am going to turn it over to Jim Williams. Jim Williams, Manager, FAA UAS Integration Office: Good afternoon or good morning to everyone. Thank you, John, and let me add my welcome to those of you on the line who are participating in this listening session. I would like to provide you with some background information and go over ground rules for how the session will work.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} {{a study of}} the corrosion resistance {{as a function of the}} holding time on the interface generated during the process of brazing an AISI 304 to AISI 316 L stainless steels by using a non-commercial Fe 60 Ni 12 Cr 8 P 13 B 7 metallic glass alloy ribbon by induction heating at 1000 ºC into a chamber with an Ar controlled atmosphere. Samples of the austenitic stainless steels were joined in a sandwich-like arrangement using the Fe-based metallic glass ribbon. Corrosion experiments carried out in distilled water and 3. 5 wt. % sodium chloride solution revealed that the corrosion resistance was higher for samples tested in the distilled water than the latest medium <b>for</b> <b>all</b> dwell <b>joining</b> times, since in the former medium the samples passivated. It was also found that the highest corrosion resistance was achieved <b>for</b> samples <b>joined</b> <b>for</b> a dwelling time of 4 minutes...|$|R
40|$|Punch {{riveting}} {{with solid}} rivets is an admitted technology in joining by forming of metallic workpieces. Conventional this technology workes with a rigid anvil. This causes {{the disadvantage of}} dimensioning {{the width of the}} coining ring separately <b>for</b> every single <b>joining</b> task to avoid a prematurely coining during the stamping stage. The starting point for improvement respectively for the removal of these negative properties is the two-parted design of the anvil. Thus there can be realized a plane surface of coining ring and anvil ring during the stamping process. So an equal coining ring can be used <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>joining</b> tasks. The analyses show the advantages of the partitioned anvils especially in joining of different materials with distinct differences in strength. The use of two-parted anvils effects essential convenient technological conditions and an extended range of application of solid punch riveting...|$|R

40|$|Wafer bonding {{describes}} <b>all</b> technologies <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> {{two or more}} substrates {{directly or}} using certain intermediate layers. Current investigations are focused on so-called low temperature bonding as a special direct bonding technology. It is carried out without intermediate layers and at temperatures below 400 °C. In addition to the wafer materials, the toughness of the bonded interface also depends on the bonding process itself. It can vary for different pre-treatments. Furthermore, an increase of the annealing temperature leads to a higher toughness of the bonded interface. The fracture toughness is a suitable value to describe the damage behaviour of the bonded interface. Based on a micro-chevron-specimen, the fracture toughness can be determined either numerically or by combining numerical analysis with experimental measurement of the maximum force. The maximum force is measured during a micro-chevron-test using a Mode I loading. The minimum of the stress intensity coefficient can be determined by a FE-simulation only. One possibility to estimate the stress intensity coefficient is the compliance method. The compliance of the whole specimen increases with a growing crack. The stress intensity coefficient can be directly derived from the simulated compliance and the crack length itself. The paper {{is focused on the}} micro-chevron-test for direct bonded silicon-silicon wafers. Additional to the estimation of dimensionless stress intensity coefficient as a function of geometry, the influence of different pre-treatments and annealing temperatures on the measured maximum force are analysed and discussed...|$|R

The Israeli Broadcasting Authority (IBA) {{announced}} on 20 March 2017, {{that they were}} preparing for Rising Star 2018 (the selection process for Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest), thus confirming their provisional intent to participate at Eurovision 2018. However, on 9 May 2017 the IBA was shut down after the final broadcast of their regular nightly news programme. As a consequence, all regular programming on television and radio were discontinued, with the television stations of the IBA displaying an informational slide and the radio stations playing music. The second semi-final and final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 were the last programmes transmitted by the IBA. The new broadcasting corporation, Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC), branded as KAN (כאן) is not member of the EBU, which is a requirement {{to participate in the}} Song Contest. IPBC is expected to apply for EBU membership later this year and if accepted, Israel will continue to participate. The government passed a law splitting new corporation into two entities - one in charge for entertainment programs and the second is for news, which may create an obstacle <b>for</b> either entity <b>joining</b> the EBU. However, the High Court of Justice issued a temporary injunction, blocking the split. If the split is cancelled permanently, the new Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation meets <b>all</b> requirements <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> the EBU.

50|$|Bantsuma went on {{to produce}} many films under his {{production}} company, but Orochi {{was the only one}} he personally kept the negative for. His agency hit a low point during the period 1931-1935. During this time, his production company was very much a ‘one-man agency’, where the directors were only acting to please Bantsuma. His acting skills gradually became old and outdated so his films did not do very well. In 1935, Bantsuma worked with the renowned director Hiroshi Inagaki in his first talkie film, Niino Tsuruchiyo (1935), but his rather feeble voice was unpopular with the audience.
