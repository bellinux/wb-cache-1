5000|$|Another set of {{cognitive}} theories related to cross-race effect focuses on how social categorizaion and individuation biases face memory. Some {{researchers believe that}} the inability for ingroup members' to recognize differences in the features of outgroup members can be explained through cognitive disregard. They find that the likelihood of falsely identifying {{a member of an}} out-group stems from an <b>automatic</b> <b>encoding</b> of a face without processing its unique features. Thus, when presented with an out-group member who has a similar face to the one that was encoded, the in-group member automatically, but incorrectly determines that the face has been [...] "seen" [...] before. These studies conclude that diminishing the cross race effect requires individuals to process ethnically-differing faces with the goal of encoding with individuation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{requirement}} of the department for aviation accident investigation, a computer information system of processing the broken tape of flight data recorder has been designed. The main principles of the system are that magnetic track images are first preprocessed using image processing techniques, furthermore, the position coordinates of tracks are obtained using image recognizing techniques, finally, the data corresponding to track coordinates are obtained by encoding the track coordinates using the serial-parallel scanning method that is specially designed. The accurate ratio of <b>automatic</b> <b>encoding</b> is 99. 3 %. The times of <b>automatic</b> <b>encoding</b> are reduced to proximate 5 seconds from about 4 hours of two operators for one frame track image.

In three experiments, observers judged whether the changes in two successive visual sequences followed the same or different rhythms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} a synchronous data-flow language providing full functionality with a modular reset operator. This operator {{can be considered as}} a basic primitive for describing dynamic reconfigurations in a purely data-flow framework. The extension proposed here is conservative with respect to the fundamental properties of the initial language: reactivity (i. e, execution in bounded memory and time) and referential transparency are kept. The reset operator is thus compatible with higher-order. This is obtained by extending the clock calculus of the initial language and providing a compilation method. We illustrate the use of this operator by describing an <b>automatic</b> <b>encoding</b> of Mode-automata. All the experiments presented in the paper has been done with Lucid Synchrone, an ML extension of Lustre...|$|E

40|$|Processing simple or complex texts (MIME type - application) often {{requires}} <b>automatic</b> recognition of <b>encoding</b> and language. Some types of files or pages contain an internal {{information about the}} encoding method. There might be some conflicts, however, eg. between the HTTP header and the meta tag. Sometimes {{it may be useful}} to verify the accuracy of the file encoding even when the encoding is known. In case that the identification of encoding is not available it is necessary to use a method of <b>automatic</b> recognition of <b>encoding</b> and language. One such method is an n-grams method. It has been used many times to categorize texts in many programs and in various programming languages. Based on tests results, it seems that the automatic recognition of the Czech language and other Slavic languages is less successful than the recognition of Western languages. Determining the reasons and searching for better solutions is therefore beneficial even nowadays. The length of the input text and the use of various languages in one document are important parameters.

The penalty of approximation is quantified by substitution and concatenation costs which grade what unit contexts are interchangeable and where concatenations are not perceivable.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this article are to {{elucidate}} trends and perspectives {{in the field of}} cognitive style research and to propose an integrated framework to guide future research. This is accomplished by means of a comprehensive literature review of the major advances and the theoretical and experimental problems that have accumulated over the years and by a discussion of the promising theoretical models that can be further developed, in part, with modern neuroscience techniques and with research from different psychological fields. On the basis of the research reviewed in this article, the author suggests that cognitive styles represent heuristics that individuals use to process information about their environment. These heuristics can be identified at multiple levels of information processing, from perceptual to metacognitive, and they can be grouped according to the type of regulatory function they exert on processes ranging from <b>automatic</b> data <b>encoding</b> to conscious executive allocation of cognitive resources...|$|R

In this paper, the impact of automatic region-of-interest (ROI) coding on perceived quality of mobile video is investigated. The evidence, {{which is based on}} perceptual comparison analysis, shows that the coding strategy improves perceptual quality. This is particularly true in low bit rate situations. The ROI detection method used in this paper is based on two approaches: - (1) automatic ROI by analyzing the visual contents automatically, and; - (2) eye-tracking based ROI by aggregating eye-tracking data across many users, used to both evaluate the accuracy of automatic ROI detection and the subjective quality of <b>automatic</b> ROI <b>encoded</b> video. The perceptual comparison analysis is based on subjective assessments with 54 participants, across different content types, screen resolutions, and target bit rates while comparing the two ROI detection methods.

40|$|Children are {{generally}} masterful imitators, both rational and flexible in their reproduction of others' actions. After observing an adult operating an unfamiliar object, however, young children will frequently overimitate, reproducing {{not only the}} actions that were causally necessary but also those that were clearly superfluous. Why does overimitation occur? We argue that when children observe an adult intentionally acting on a novel object, they may automatically encode all of the adult's actions as causally meaningful. This process of <b>automatic</b> causal <b>encoding</b> (ACE) would generally guide children to accurate beliefs about even highly opaque objects. In situations where some of an adult's intentional actions were unnecessary, however, it would also lead to persistent overimitation. Here, we undertake a thorough examination of the ACE hypothesis, reviewing prior evidence and offering three new experiments to further test the theory. We show that children will persist in overimitating even when doing so is costly (underscoring the involuntary nature of the effect), but also that the effect is constrained by intentionality {{in a manner consistent}} with its posited learning function. Overimitation may illuminate not only the structure of children's causal understanding, but also the social learning processes that support our species' artefact-centric culture...|$|R

The intervention, designed for {{men who have sex}} with men, simulates the interpersonal, emotional, and contextual cues of a sexual scenario. One group viewed an interactive version of the video in which they actively made decisions. A second group passively viewed a non-interactive version. Subjects reporting higher levels of post-intervention negative affect experienced greater subsequent risk-reduction, F(1, 96) = 13. 1, p <. 001. This effect was qualified by a significant interaction with interactivity, F(1, 96) = 9. 62, p =. 003, such that the relationship between higher negative affect and risk-reduction was much stronger in the interactive condition.

Furthermore, Korsakoff amnesics showed neither disproportionately impaired incidental nor intentional location recognition memory relative to alcoholic controls.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 28 - 35) A long-standing {{finding in}} psychology with important real-world implications {{is that people}} seem to automatically notice and remember information such as the race or gender {{of the people they}} see, in turn leading to the activation of related stereotypes. Some evolutionary perspectives consider the <b>automatic</b> <b>encoding</b> of race at least to be a misfiring of a mechanism for tracking coalition membership, due to racial conflicts in American society making it an accurate shorthand for coalitional conflict. Separating race from coalition has been shown to reduce automatic racial encoding, but not other characteristics like gender. In a political context, it was hypothesized that the focus on the conflict between political parties in general elections would overshadow the influence of race in how people view and remember politicians, compared to primary elections, which lack this dimension of inter-party conflict. Participants completed a Who Said What task, matching statements with the politicians who made them; the patterns of errors were examined to reveal <b>automatic</b> <b>encoding.</b> When reading about a primary election, Republicans but not Democrats automatically encoded politicians??? race. When reading about a general election, Republicans no longer significantly encoded race, but rather encoded party affiliation. The same experimental design was replicated testing if the encoding of gender and then age could be similarly reduced. Both gender and age make evolutionary sense for encoding, which suggest that separating coalition information should have no effect and this was mostly born out in the data. Gender was encoded very strongly by members of both parties across conditions. Democrats again did not encode party affiliation, while Republicans did. Conversely only Republicans encoded age in the primary condition while both parties encoded age in the general election condition, where party affiliation was not significantly encoded. This somewhat matches previous literature, which finds that party stereotypes overlap with gender but not age. Overall, a focus on party does not seem to reduce this automatic social categorization. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the current and future political environment (particularly the 2016 Presidential race), including directions for future research...|$|E

40|$|People with {{absolute}} pitch (AP) {{are assumed to}} be unique in operating an <b>automatic</b> verbal <b>encoding</b> when recognizing musical pitch. It is therefore assumed that tonal stimuli with musical pitch may produce a specific interference in performing certain tasks requiring some sort of verbal encoding. In the auditory Stroop experiment, participant heard sung syllables and required to name their musical pitch (pitch naming) or simply repeat the syllables (syllable shadowing). Listeners without AP suffered interference from incongruent syllables in pitch naming, but did not from incongruent pitches in syllable shadowing. In contrast, listeners with AP suffered substantial interference in shadowing syllables sung with incongruent pitch as well as in naming pitches sung with incongruent syllables. In the experiment of irrelevant sound effect, sequences of randomly-ordered seven musical-pitch syllables (mi, so, la, etc.) or digits were presented visually as to-be-recalled items. Irrelevant sounds (piano tones, spoken syllables, or spoken digits) accompanied the to-be-recalled items. Participants were required to recall the visual items in order as exactly as presented ignoring the auditory stimuli. Both listeners with and without AP showed the greatest substantial interference effect in recalling items with which irrelevant speech sounds accompanied. Most interestingly, the piano tones produced significantly greater interference for the listeners with AP than for the listeners without AP. These results support the assumption that listeners with AP can’t suppress pitch labeling even when it brings disadvantages. 1...|$|R
