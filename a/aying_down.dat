"My {{name has}} been sounded, and that in no gentle strains," [...] {{returned}} the Pilot, scornfully, [...] "when a whole people have quailed at it, the craven cowardly wretches flying before the man they had wronged. I have lived to bear the banners {{of the new republic}} proudly in sight of the three kingdoms, when practised skill and equal arms have in vain struggled to pluck it <b>down.</b> <b>Ay!</b> Alice, the echoes of my guns are still roaring among your eastern hills, and would render my name more appalling than inviting to your sleeping yeomen." ...|$|R
60|$|None can admire {{like a young}} man. Of all youth's {{passions and}} pleasures, {{this is the most}} common and least alloyed; and every flash of Alan's black eyes; every aspect of his curly head; every graceful reach, every easy, {{stand-off}} attitude of waiting; <b>ay,</b> and <b>down</b> to his shirt-sleeves and wrist-links, were seen by John through a luxurious glory. He valued himself by the possession of that royal friend, hugged himself upon the thought, and swam in warm azure; his own defects, like vanquished difficulties, becoming things on which to plume himself. Only when he thought of Miss Mackenzie there fell upon his mind a shadow of regret; that young lady was worthy of better things than plain John Nicholson, still known among schoolmates by the derisive name of 'Fatty'; and he felt, if he could chalk a cue, or stand at ease, with such a careless grace as Alan, he could approach the object of his sentiments with a less crushing sense of inferiority.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{investigations}} of magnetic properties, crystal and magnetic structures on TbMnO_ 3 prepared in various ways, namely, as conventional polycrystalline sample and two nano particle specimens (synthesized with a sol-gel method at temperatures of 800 and 850 ^∘C). The X-ray and neutron diffraction data confirm the orthorhombic crystal structure (space group Pbnm, No. 62) without noticeable differences of the lattice parameters for poly- and nanocompounds. For the polycrystalline sample, a subsequent ordering of the Mn and Tb sublattices with decreasing temperature was observed. Namely, the Mn sublattice exhibits a modulated magnetic structure with the propagation vector k = (0, k_x, 0) in between 41 - 5 K. Below T = 21 K, {{a change from}} a collinear (A_y mode) into non-collinear (A_yG_z mode) structure was evidenced. Further decreasing of temperature below 10 K results in magnetic ordering of the Tb sublattice (modulated G_xA_yF_[z mode). For nanoparticle compounds, magnetic ordering in the Mn and Tb sublattices is described by propagation vector k = (0, k_y, 0), with ky components higher than observed for polycrystalline sample. The magnetic ordering in the Mn sublattice is described by a collinear <b>Ay</b> mode <b>down</b> to 1. 6 K where the Tb moment becomes ordered (G_[xA_y mode). The observed broadening of the Bragg peaks connected to the Tb sublattice suggests the cluster-like character of its magnetic structure...|$|R

Is not a man's soul, even in this just and {{peaceful}} land, and far oftener in lands which are still neither just nor peaceful--Is not a man's soul, I say, sometimes among lions?--among greedy, violent, tyrannous persons, {{who are ready to}} entangle him in a quarrel, shout him <b>down,</b> <b>ay,</b> or shoot him down; literally ready to eat him up? Are not the children of men still too often set on fire; on fire with wild party cries, with superstitions which they do not half understand, with brute excitements which pander to their basest passions, running like fire from head to head, and heart to heart, till whole classes, whole nations sometimes, are on fire, ready like fire to consume and destroy all they touch; and like fire, to consume and destroy themselves likewise? ...|$|R
6000|$|Excuse these remarks. I {{have been}} on the whole much interested, and {{sometimes}} amused. Are you aware that the praiser of this [...] "brave gymnasium" [...] has not seen a canoe nor taken a long walk since '79? that he is rarely out of the house nowadays, and carries his arm in a sling? Can you imagine that he is a back-slidden communist, and is sure he will go to hell (if there be such an excellent institution) for the luxury in which he lives? And can you believe that, though it is gaily expressed, the thought is hag and skeleton in every moment of vacuity or depression? Can you conceive how profoundly I am irritated by the opposite affectation to my own, when I see strong men and rich men bleating about their sorrows and the burthen of life, in a world full of [...] "cancerous paupers," [...] and poor sick children, and the fatally bereaved, <b>ay,</b> and <b>down</b> even to such happy creatures as myself, who has yet been obliged to strip himself, one after another, of all the pleasures that he had chosen except smoking (and the days of that I know in my heart ought to be over), I forgot eating, which I still enjoy, and who sees the circle of impotence closing very slowly but quite steadily around him? In my view, one dank, dispirited word is harmful, a crime of lèse-humanité, a piece of acquired evil; every gay, every bright word or picture, like every pleasant air of music, is a piece of pleasure set afloat; the reader catches it, and, if he be healthy, goes on his way rejoicing; and it is the business of art so to send him, as often as possible.|$|R

We stand but a poor chance as we go creepin' 'long {{shore in}} them rotten tubs, that are well named `Coal-Coffins.' Why, if it comes on thick squally weather or a gale when yer dodgin' off an' on, the `Coal-Coffins' go down by dozens. Mayhap at the first burst o' the gale you're hove on your beam-ends, an' away go the masts, leavin' ye to drift ashore or sink; or p'raps you're sharp enough to get in sail, and have all snug, when, just as ye're weatherin' a headland, away goes the sheet o' the jib, jib's blowed to ribbons, an' afore ye know where ye are, `breakers on the lee bow!' is the cry. Another gust, an' the rotten foretops'l's blow'd away, carryin' the fore-topmast by the board, which, of course, takes the {{jib-boom}} along with it, if it an't gone before. Then it's `stand by to let go the anchor.' `Let go!' `Ay, <b>ay,</b> sir.' <b>Down</b> it goes, an' the `Coffin's' brought up sharp; not a moment too soon, mayhap, for ten to one but you see an' hear the breakers, roarin' like mad, thirty yards or so astern. It may be good holdin' ground, but what o' that?--the anchor's an old 'un, or too small; the fluke gives way, and ye're adrift; or the cable's too small, and can't stand the strain, so you let go both anchors, an' ye'd let go a dozen more if ye had 'em for dear life; but it's o' no use. First one an' then the other parts; the stern is crushed in a'most afore ye can think, an' in two minutes more, if not less, it's all up with ye, unless there's a lifeboat at hand." ...|$|R
