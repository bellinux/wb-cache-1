5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) {{with a solution}} of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400°C {{for a few minutes}} results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3.

5|$|Other {{tensions}} included Donen's hit films {{compared to}} Vincente Minnelli's Brigadoon (which Kelly was closely involved in and {{had wanted to}} direct) flop, and Kelly's own ambitious film Invitation to Dance, both financially unsuccessful. During the shooting of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Donen often complained about his budgetary constraints, while Brigadoon had a much larger budget. Around that time Kelly's unsuccessfully attempted dramatic <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> The Devil Makes Three and Seagulls Over Sorrento also flopped, and his marriage to Betsy Blair was ending.|$|E
5|$|The Bill {{had a large}} regular cast {{to support}} the number of episodes that were {{produced}} each year.

A number of cast members have played multiple roles in the series, and in other British soap operas and dramas.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in her acting career came in December 1947, when she {{appeared}} as Galileo's daughter Virginia in the New York production of Bertolt Brecht's play Galileo, starring Charles Laughton {{in the title role}} and directed by Joseph Losey. Unlike her previous roles, Galileo was a straight dramatic role with no dancing. The play helped establish her reputation as a legitimate actress.

5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> a sense of urgency, had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E
5|$|Kyra, {{formerly}} known by her title the Seer, is a fictional character from the American television supernatural drama Charmed, which aired on The WB Television Network (The WB) from 1998 to 2006. The character {{was created by}} executive producer Brad Kern and portrayed by actress Charisma Carpenter. Carpenter was invited on the show after <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> Charmed cast member Holly Marie Combs on the ABC Family television film See Jane Date (2003). The actress' original contract was a guest star role that included three episodes in season seven, with media outlets reporting the possibility of Carpenter becoming a series regular.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} Vortigaunts is {{drastically}} {{changed in}} Half-Life 2. Now acting as allies to the player, Vortigaunts have been freed {{as a result of}} protagonist Gordon Freeman killing the Nihilanth at the end of Half-Life. Instead of <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> hostility towards humanity, the Vortigaunts are actively engaged in assisting the human resistance against the Combine, a multi-dimensional empire that has invaded and occupied Earth in between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Vortigaunts are frequently seen at resistance compounds and stations, often performing maintenance work or providing help with experiments, and sometimes assist the player by using their energy abilities to recharge the player's HEV suit. However, a number of Vortigaunts are still in captivity, as at various points in the game, Vortigaunts are shown used as slave labor by the Combine; for example, one Vortigaunt is seen cleaning the floor of a Combine train station with a broom, wearing a similar collar to those worn in Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|When Gaveston without {{permission}} returned from exile later the same year, a Baronial council entrusted Pembroke and The Earl of Surrey, {{with the task}} of taking him into custody. This they did on 19 May 1312, but not long after Thomas of Lancaster, <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> the Earls of Warwick, Hereford and Arundel, seized Gaveston and executed him on 19 June. This criminal act had the effect of garnering support for the King, and marginalising the rebellious earls. As far as Pembroke is concerned, the seizing and execution of a prisoner in his custody was a breach of the most fundamental chivalric codes, and a serious affront to his honour. The event must therefore be seen as pivotal in turning his sympathies away from the rebels and towards the King.|$|E
5|$|William was re-elected to York after Murdac's {{death in}} 1153. When William {{attempted}} to enter York on 9 May 1154, Robert, along with Osbert de Bayeux, tried to prevent his entry, but their attempt was unsuccessful and they {{then went to}} Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and appealed in vain against William's actions. It is possible that Robert feared that William would remove Robert from the deanship. After William's death, Robert, once more <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> Osbert, pressured the cathedral chapter of York to elect Stephen's choice of Roger de Pont L'Évêque as the new Archbishop of York. Osbert was later accused of poisoning William, and was deprived of his office and clerical status when he could not clear himself from the accusation. Although Robert was associated with Osbert's opposition to William, {{there is no evidence}} that Robert was ever thought to have been involved in the possible poisoning of William.|$|E

5|$|King William {{appears to}} have left the {{initiative}} for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and did nothing to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand {{appears to have}} been a member of the royal council, and able to move freely about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> bad faith. Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that Bosch used the outer panels to establish a Biblical setting for the inner elements of the work, and the exterior image is generally interpreted as set in an earlier time {{than those in the}} interior. As with Bosch's Haywain triptych, the inner centerpiece is flanked by heavenly and hellish imagery. The scenes depicted in the triptych are thought to follow a chronological order: flowing from left-to-right they represent Eden, the garden of earthly delights, and Hell. God appears as the creator of humanity in the left hand wing, while the consequences of humanity's failure to follow his will are shown in the right.However, in contrast to Bosch's two other complete triptychs, The Last Judgment (around 1482) and The Haywain (after 1510), God is absent from the central panel. Instead, this panel shows humanity <b>acting</b> <b>with</b> apparent free will as naked men and women engage in various pleasure-seeking activities. According to some interpretations, the right hand panel is believed to show God's penalties in a hellscape.|$|E
