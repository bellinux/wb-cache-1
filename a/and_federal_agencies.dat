5|$|The Nokota {{horse is}} a feral and semi-feral horse breed {{located in the}} {{badlands}} of southwestern North Dakota in the United States. The breed developed in the 19th century from foundation bloodstock consisting of ranch-bred horses produced from the horses of local Native Americans mixed with Spanish horses, Thoroughbreds, harness horses and related breeds. The Nokota was almost wiped out during the early 20th century when ranchers, in cooperation with state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agencies,</b> worked together to reduce competition for livestock grazing. However, when Theodore Roosevelt National Park {{was created in the}} 1940s, a few bands were inadvertently trapped inside, and thus were preserved.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} {{successfully}} bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release back into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US Endangered Species Act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons {{were removed from the}} United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund and state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agencies</b> – through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{restructured}} the organization's {{leadership and}} policies. He reduced budgets and boosted fundraising, alleviating {{the concerns of}} corporate sponsors while recruiting new ones. Romney worked {{to ensure the safety}} of the Games following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by coordinating a $300million security budget. He oversaw a $1.32billion total budget, 700employees, and 26,000volunteers. The federal government provided approximately $400million to $600million of that budget, much of it a result of Romney's having aggressively lobbied Congress <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agencies.</b> It was a record level of federal funding for the staging of a U.S. Olympics. An additional $1.1billion of indirect federal funding came to the state in the form of highway and transit projects.|$|E
