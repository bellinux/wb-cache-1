40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{to examine the relationship}} among the circulating levels of nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) and gas parameters and body temperature in horses before and after a standardized exercise test (SET). Total levels of NOx were calculated as the sum of nitrite (NO 3 -) and nitrate (NO 2 -) levels. The results indicate that blood gas parameters were significantly modified at short time <b>after</b> <b>SET</b> (5 minutes), normalizing at 30 minutes <b>after</b> <b>SET.</b> A significant increase of body temperature (P <. 001) and plasma NOx levels (P <. 05) was observed at both 5 and 30 minutes <b>after</b> <b>SET.</b> A linear correlation between the postexercise values of NOx and body temperature (r(2) = 0. 501, P <. 01) was found. According to these data, plasma NOx could be involved in thermoregulation during physical exercise in horses; further studies are necessary to investigate this association and to understand the systems that permit animals to maintain homeostasis during body exercise...|$|R
