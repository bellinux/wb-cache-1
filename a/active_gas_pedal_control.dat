40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a Swedish national experiment with different types of Intelligent Speed Adaptation, 300 vehicles are being equipped with an <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> in the city of Lund. The <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> provides drivers with counter-force whenever they try to exceed the pre-set speed limit. During the experiment the equipment will be continuously set on the actual speed limit. The vehicles will also be equipped with digital maps with all the speed limits within the city limit and a GPS system. Both private- and company cars, including professional drivers will participate in the trial. All vehicles will be equipped with data logging facilities. The selection of the test drivers is made by age groups, gender and attitude to the <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> (positive and negative). An extensive evaluation will be carried out in order to study driver behaviour, acceptance and effects on safety, travel time and the environment. In {{order to be able to}} observe any attitude changes in the city, surveys with 750 citizens are carried out before the start of the project and after the project has been realised. In order to study driver reactions and behaviour, in-car observations with the help of “Wiener fahrprobe” will be carried out. In order to see any changes in the attitude and acceptance of the test drivers, they will be interviewed when recruited, during the test drives and after the trial. A number of drivers will also be asked to fill in a diary every day on their driving. Driving data will be logged in the test cars and speed profiles, <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> activity, travel time and exhaust emissions will be analysed. In order to measure possible system effects, a number of studies will be carried out in the field: traffic counting, speed measurements, observations of interactions between road-users, observation of frequency in driving against red. Accidents in the city also will be analysed. Similar studies will be carried out in a control city in order to be able to see if possible changes in Lund are due to the ISA-equipped cars...|$|R
50|$|A {{gasoline}} engine is fed by either a carburetor with a butterfly valve or an air receiver with a throttle valve and fuel injectors. In {{both cases the}} operated valves (in case of car - the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal),</b> <b>control</b> the volume of air-fuel mixture taken into the engine and control engine speed. Finally the combustion cycle requires an ignition system in form of an electric spark, that is circuited to a switch (in case of car - the ignition key). Thus in the rare case of throttle linkage rupture, {{it is very easy}} to bring a runaway petrol engine to a stop by switching off the ignition.|$|R
50|$|Let’s use the act {{of driving}} the auto once more for our example (see Figure 7). When a driver is driving the car, the primary path is the <b>Control</b> element (<b>gas</b> <b>pedal)</b> and the Feedback element (speedometer and street signs). Once a stop sign is {{detected}} ahead, the driver will take the foot off the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> (primary <b>control)</b> and press the brake <b>pedal</b> (alternate <b>control).</b> Note that the driver is no longer looking at the speedometer or street signs once the auto gets to the stop sign. The driver is looking for other cars that may cross his path. In other words, the driver {{is looking for a}} different set of feedback sources. Once he feels it is safe to go, he will go back to the primary control and feedback and the primary path.|$|R
40|$|The homotrimeric DNA {{replication}} protein {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) is regulated by both ubiquitylation and sumoylation. We study the appearance {{and the impact}} of these modifications on chromosomal replication in frog egg extracts. Xenopus laevis PCNA is modified on lysine 164 by sumoylation, monoubiquitylation, and diubiquitylation. Sumoylation and monoubiquitylation occur during the replication of undamaged DNA, whereas diubiquitylation occurs specifically in response to DNA damage. When lysine 164 modification is prevented, replication fork movement through undamaged DNA slows down and DNA polymerase δ fails to associate with replicating chromatin. When sumoylation alone is prevented, replication occurs normally and neither monoubiquitylation nor sumoylation are required for the replication of simple single-strand DNA templates. Our findings expand the repertoire of functions for PCNA ubiquitylation and sumoylation by elucidating a role for these modifications during the replication of undamaged DNA. Furthermore, they suggest that PCNA monoubiquitylation serves as a molecular <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> that <b>controls</b> the speed of replisome movement during S phase...|$|R
40|$|Life {{occurs in}} {{concentrated}} `Ringer Solutions' derived from seawater that Lesser Blum studied {{for most of}} his life. As we worked together, Lesser and I realized that the questions asked of those solutions were quite different in biology from those in the physical chemistry he knew. Biology is inherited. Information is passed by handfuls of atoms in the genetic code. A few atoms in the proteins built from the code change macroscopic function. Indeed, a few atoms often control biological function in the same sense that a <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>controls</b> the speed of a car. Biological questions then are most productive when they are asked in the context of evolution. What function does a system perform? How is the system built to perform that function? What forces are used to perform that function? How are the modules that perform functions connected to make the machinery of life. Physiologists have shown that much of life is a nested hierarchy of devices, one on top of another, linking atomic ions in concentrated solutions to current flow through proteins, current flow to voltage signals, voltage signals to changes in current flow, all connected to make a regenerative system that allows electrical action potentials to move meters, under the control of a few atoms. The hierarchy of devices allows macroscopic properties to emerge from atomic scale interactions. The structures of biology create these devices. The concentration and electrical fields of biology power these devices, more than anything else. The resulting organisms reproduce. Evolution selects the organisms that reproduce more and thereby selects the devices that allow macroscopic control to emerge from the atomic structures of genes and proteins and their motions.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation focuses on supporting drivers in the longitudinal control of their vehicle during car-following. The goal of the research is the human-centred development of a haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> interface that comfortably supports drivers in maintaining a safe separation with a leading vehicle during car-following. Two different approaches {{were found to be}} suitable for implementation as haptic information providers through the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal.</b> The first approach was to add a force to the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> dynamics which would have {{to be related to the}} safe-field-of-travel ahead of the own vehicle and changes therein. The <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> dynamics, that is, the force/pedal-position relationship is not changed by this approach. The second approach was to change the stiffness of the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> by adding a virtual stiffness to the inherent stiffness of the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal.</b> By doing so, the dynamics of the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> are changed depending on the changes detected in the safe-field-of-travel. In both approaches, an electrical actuator provides the additional force or stiffness. The main hypothesis of this dissertation is the assumption that with the appropriate haptic feedback of longitudinal traffic information drivers will adopt a force-task in <b>controlling</b> the haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedal.</b> Experimental verification leads to the conclusion that the stiffness feedback design with time-to-contact information scaled by time headway performs best in this respect.

40|$|A haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> {{feedback}} system is developed that provides car-following information via haptic cues from the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal.</b> During normal car-following situations, the haptic feedback (HF) cues were sufficient to reduce control activity and improve car-following performance. However, in more critical following situations, drivers use the brake pedal to maintain separation with the lead vehicle. A deceleration control (DC) algorithm is designed that, {{in addition to}} the HF, provided increased deceleration upon release of the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> during car-following situations that required faster deceleration than releasing the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> alone would do. For the design, a driver model for car following in different situations was estimated from driving simulator data. A Monte Carlo analysis with the driver model yielded subjective decision points, where drivers released the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> to start pressing the brakes. This enabled the definition of a reaction field, which determined the needed deceleration input for the DC algorithm. The tuned DC algorithm was tested in a fixed-base driving simulator experiment. It was shown that the active deceleration support improved the car-following performance while reducing the driver brake pedal input magnitude in the conditions tested. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{literature}} suggests that haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedals</b> can assist the driver in search of maximum fuel economy. This study investigated three haptic pedal designs, each with high and low intensities of feedback, in a rapid prototyping, paired comparison design. Twenty drivers took part, experiencing the systems in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Results suggested that drivers were best guided towards an “idealized” (most fuel efficient) <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> position by force feedback (where a driver feels a step change in <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> force) as opposed to stiffness feedback (where a driver feels a changing <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> firmness). In either case, high levels of force/stiffness feedback were preferred. Objective performance measures mirrored the subjective results. Whilst the short-term nature (brief system exposure) of this study led to difficulties in drawing longer-term conclusions, {{it would appear that}} force feedback haptics are better suited than stiffness feedback to augment an effective driver interface supporting “green” driving...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Visual cues {{that are}} {{relevant}} to safe car driving are generally not supported by redundant non-visual cues, resulting in increased accident risk when visual attention is misallocated. Haptic <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> feedback, also referred to as longitudinal impedance, may assist drivers in proper and timely reallocation of their visual attention. A solution is presented for translating the relevant two-dimensional situation in front of the driver into a total hazard level from which <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> feedback force is calculated. Car driving simulations, that include a RADAR-like sensor model and a human driver model, were performed for several highway maneuvers. The simulations indicated that the calculated <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> feedback force is a weighted mix of hazard-defining variables depending on the positions of the lead vehicles in front of the own vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Real-time, {{in-vehicle}} {{guidance on}} eco-driving {{is likely to}} produce substantial improvements in vehicle fuel economy. However, the benefits of such in-vehicle systems should be achieved without impairing driver safety. A simulator study evaluated both visual and haptic eco-driving feedback systems, which provided advice on <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> usage. Hill driving scenarios with variable traffic density were used to test drivers’ prioritization of safe and fuel-efficient driving. A visual, second-order display and a haptic force feedback <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> created the smallest errors in <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> usage and so maximized fuel efficiency. The visual display increased time spent looking away from the road, implying reduced driver safety. Participants were worse at eco-driving in more demanding, high traffic conditions. Drivers appeared to prioritize safety over eco-driving, however safety margins were shorter in the high density traffic condition, despite the degradation in eco-driving performance. The findings suggest which modality could be most appropriate for presenting in-vehicle eco-driving guidance, and hint that these systems should advise drivers based on the prevailing traffic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Enabling a {{humanoid}} robot {{to drive a}} car, requires {{the development of a}} set of basic primitive actions. These include: walking to the vehicle, manually controlling its commands (e. g., ignition, <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> and steering), and moving with the whole-body, to ingress/egress the car. In this paper, we present a sensor-based reactive framework for realizing {{the central part of the}} complete task, consisting in driving the car along unknown roads. The proposed framework provides three driving strategies by which a human supervisor can teleoperate the car, ask for assistive driving, or give the robot full control of the car. A visual servoing scheme uses features of the road image to provide the reference angle for the steering wheel to drive the car at the center of the road. Simultaneously, a Kalman filter merges optical flow and accelerometer measurements, to estimate the car linear velocity and correspondingly compute the <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> command for driving at a desired speed. The steering wheel and <b>gas</b> <b>pedal</b> reference are sent to the robot control to achieve the driving task with the hu-manoid.
