40|$|Virtual {{machines}} {{raise the}} abstraction {{level of the}} execution environment {{at the cost of}} restricting the set of supported languages. Moreover, the ability of a language implementation to integrate with other languages hosted on the same virtual machine typically constrains the features of the language. In this paper, we present a highly flexible yet efficient approach to hosting multiple programming languages on <b>an</b> objectoriented <b>virtual</b> machine. Our approach is based on extending the interface of each class with language-specific wrapper methods, offering each language a tailored view of a given class. This approach can be deployed both on <b>a</b> statically typed <b>virtual</b> machine, such as the JVM, and on <b>a</b> dynamic <b>virtual</b> machine, such as <b>a</b> Smalltalk <b>virtual</b> machine. We have implemented our approach to language interoperability on top of <b>a</b> prototype <b>virtual</b> machine for embedded systems based on the Smalltalk object model, which provides interoperability for embedded versions of the Smalltalk, Java, and BETA programming languages. ...|$|R
