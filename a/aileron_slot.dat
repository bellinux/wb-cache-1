40|$|This paper {{present results}} of an {{investigation}} of the lateral-control and hinge-moment characteristics of a 0. 67 semispan flap-type spoiler aileron on a semispan thin 60 degree delta wing at transonic speeds by the reflection-plane technique. The spoiler-aileron had a constant chord of 10. 29 percent mean aerodynamic chord and was hinged at the 81. 9 -percent-wing-root-chord station. Tests were made with the spoiler <b>aileron</b> <b>slot</b> open, partially closed, and closed. Incremental rolling-moment coefficients were obtained through a Mach number range of 0. 62 to 1. 08. Results indicated reasonably linear variations of rolling-moment and hinge-moment coefficients with spoiler projection except at spoiler projections of less than - 2 percent mean aerodynamic chord and angles of attack greater than 12 degrees with results generally independent of slot geometry...|$|E
5000|$|The Lastochka is {{designed}} {{for a wide range}} of utility work, such as fire and geological surveys, freight transport and passenger carrying. It is a low wing monoplane constructed largely of composites, with straight tapered wings tipped with winglets. Their trailing edges carry <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps. Two [...] Rotax 912 ULS air-cooled flat four engines are mounted in pusher configuration on pylons over the wings in short cowlings, positioned with their propeller discs as close as possible to the fuselage. [...] Rotax 914 engines are an alternative.|$|R
50|$|The Turbi {{is built}} using all-wood construction. The wing uses a two-spar design. It uses <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The RB-50 was {{of mixed}} construction. It {{had a high}} mounted, wooden structured, {{cantilever}} wing with a trapezoidal plan, built around a single spar and fabric covered. <b>Ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps filled the wing trailing edges. The flaps were mechanically operated, with a maximum deflection of 37°.|$|R
50|$|The wings have {{conventional}} Frise <b>ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps. The {{elevator and}} rudder are also conventional. Ailerons and elevator {{are controlled by}} dual centre-mounted sticks through push-pull tubes, while the rudder is controlled by cables. The rudder cables attach to the rudder by wrapping around the wide bottom diameter of the rudder itself. The pitot tube is mounted on the left-hand strut.|$|R
50|$|The Swift {{is mostly}} built from {{composite}} materials; flying surfaces and the fuselage are formed from composite sandwiches and the wing and tailplane have carbon fibre spars. It {{has a low}} wing of trapezoidal plan with slightly upturned tips, fitted with Frise <b>ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps. The rear surfaces are also trapezoidal. There is a trim tab in the elevator and a ground adjustable tab on the rudder.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was fitted with various devices to increase lift; slotted flaps and <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and, {{on the low}} wing sponsons, split flaps. The wings folded back, pivoted close to the fuselage, on hydraulic power.|$|R
50|$|The Handley Page H.P.20 was an {{experimental}} monoplane modification of a de Havilland DH.9A, built to study controllable <b>slots</b> and <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> as high lift devices. It {{was the first}} aircraft to fly with controllable slots.|$|R
50|$|Like the G-15 {{it had a}} {{completely}} plywood covered wing centre section which {{was an integral part}} of the fuselage. The outer wing panels were ply covered from the leading edge back to the rear spar, with the rest fabric covered. In plan the wings were strongly tapered, mostly on the trailing edges, and ended in long, elliptical tips. Its automatic leading edge slats were interconnected through the fuselage with a steel tube and its <b>ailerons</b> were <b>slotted.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} {{high wing}} of the IS-11 was mounted with a dihedral of 2.5°. It was built around a single spar with a plywood covered torsion box ahead of it around the leading edge. The rest of the wing was also ply covered. In plan the wing was symmetrically straight tapered. Its mass balanced <b>ailerons</b> were <b>slotted</b> and fabric over ply covered. The IS-11 had short span spoilers, opening both {{above and below the}} wing, mounted at mid-chord just inboard of the ailerons. The wing tips carried the small, streamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The Lie-Fang is wood framed, {{with some}} {{use of the}} local [...] "poton" [...] wood and {{with a mixture of}} plywood and fabric covering. It has a high mid mounted single spar wing with a plywood covered torsion box leading edge, Behind the spar the wing is fabric covered. In plan it is {{straight}} tapered with unswept leading edges, resulting in forward sweep of 2° at one quarter chord. There is 4° of dihedral and 2° of washout. Its <b>ailerons</b> are <b>slotted</b> and fabric covered and spoilers, mounted behind the spar at about one third span, open above and below the wing.|$|R
50|$|Of {{traditional}} high-wing layout, {{it carries}} 90 gallons of spray fluid {{in a tank}} beside the pilot, an extra seat being provided for a passenger. The Lycoming engine driving a McCauley v.p. propeller giving it ample power; with <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons,</b> balanced tail controls and oversize tyres providing good handling during operations in restricted spaces and rough surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Stressed for aerobatics, {{one example}} was {{purchased}} by Alan Cobham's National Aviation Day displays, and was flown under tow directly to London by Joan Meakin. During early flying with the Wolf it gained a reputation for dangerous spinning characteristics, {{which resulted in the}} Gö 1 being grounded in 1938, pending incorporation of modified, longer-chord, <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} {{high wing}} common to both models was {{built around a}} single spar with a plywood covered torsion box ahead of it around the leading edge. The rest of the wing was fabric covered. It had forward sweep, coming mostly through the strong sweep of the trailing edge as the leading edge was almost straight. Its mass balanced and fabric over ply covered <b>ailerons</b> were <b>slotted</b> and divided into two sections. There were short spoilers, opening both {{above and below the}} wing, mounted near mid-chord just inboard of the ailerons. The wing tips carried the small, streamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time.|$|R
50|$|He {{invented the}} Frise aileron, {{also known as}} the <b>slotted</b> <b>aileron,</b> in 1921, which is {{designed}} to counteract adverse yaw, which won him the Royal Aeronautical Society's Wakefield Gold Medal (for advances in aviation safety) awarded on 30 May 1933. The Frise aileron has an effect on parasitic drag so that the total drag on both wings is the same when an aircraft executes a roll.|$|R
500|$|The I-250 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} aircraft with a monocoque fuselage. Other {{than the}} VRDK the aircraft was largely conventional in layout, although the cockpit was set very {{far back in}} the fuselage, almost {{to the base of}} the vertical tail. The two-spar wings had a thickness of 10% to preserve aileron control and avoid tip stall. They were fitted with Frise <b>ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps. Fuel was contained in a [...] fuselage tank and a [...] tank in each wing. The conventional landing gear mainwheels had a levered suspension and retracted inwards. The tail wheel retracted aft into the very small ventral fin. The VK-107A engine initially drove a [...] VISh-105SV propeller.|$|R
5000|$|The almost {{all-metal}} A-11 was Antonov's first non-wood framed sailplane. [...] It is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane, {{with straight}} tapered wings mostly swept on the trailing edge and set with 1.5° of dihedral but no washout. A single spar with a metal-skinned leading edge forward {{of it and}} fabric covering aft forms most of the span but the curved tips are supported by twin spars. The fabric-covered <b>ailerons</b> are <b>slotted,</b> with set-back hinges and mass balances. They can be drooped together through 8° to act as flaps. Inboard, there are slotted flaps on the trailing edges and spoilers, mounted at mid-chord and quite close to the fuselage, of the gapless kind opening upwards only.|$|R

25|$|The Breguet 670's wing had a {{constant}} thickness centre section, with wing roots faired into the fuselage on its trailing edges, and two outer panels, tapering in both thickness {{and plan to}} semi-elliptical tips. It was a two spar structure, with sheet duralumin, I-section spars which had extruded webs, and was duralumin skinned. Narrow chord <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> occupied the outer two-thirds of the span and the rest fitted with similar flaps.|$|R
50|$|The G-27 was {{the only}} Gribovsky design {{with more than one}} engine. It was a wooden {{multi-purpose}} monoplane, intended to provide training in navigation and photo-reconnaissance for its crew of three as well as filling light transport and air ambulance rôles. In plan its wing had a rectangular centre section and straight tapered, two spar outer panels with rounded tips. The outer panels carried <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and the centre section pneumatically operated split flaps.|$|R
50|$|The Stal-3 was an {{enlarged}} {{development of the}} Stal-2, designed at the OOS (Otdel Opytnogo Samolyetostroeniya - section for experimental aircraft construction), with a simplified structure which reduced manufacturing man-hours and structural weight, whilst increasing the design load factor. The layout of the aircraft was {{very similar to the}} Stal-2, but featured larger dimensions, slotted flaps, a wide chord engine cowling, <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons,</b> and spatted wheels with brakes, or skis depending on season.|$|R
50|$|The Aleks-251 {{is mostly}} {{constructed}} of metal, only using composites in the nosecone, engine cowlings and fin tip. It has a parallel chord, square tipped wing with a full-span combination of <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and flaps. The parasol configuration allows the twin 127 kW (170 hp) LOM 332S inverted inline engines to be mounted forward of {{and under the}} wing, close together. The wing is braced to the fuselage {{with a pair of}} inverted V-struts to the engine mountings.|$|R
50|$|The Skyeton Swift is a {{conventionally}} {{laid out}} single-engine, high-wing light aircraft with side-by-side seating for two. The wings have constant chord, each braced {{with a single}} lift strut to the lower fuselage longeron. They use a single metal spar and have stressed skin metal upper surfaces and leading edges, combined with fabric covered lower surfaces aft of the spar. Fabric covered <b>ailerons</b> and inboard <b>slotted</b> flaps together occupy {{the whole of the}} wing trailing edges. The wings carry 2.17° dihedral.|$|R
2500|$|Günther Pöschel {{designed}} the Equator {{as a small}} executive transport which could operate from land or water. [...] It used the then quite novel glass-fibre composite material for the skin of its flying surfaces and fuselage {{in order to achieve}} a smooth and watertight finish. [...] The first version to fly, the P-300 Equator, was completed as a landplane with a fixed undercarriage and was intended to provide proof of principle. It had a high, cantilever wing of straight tapered plan and no dihedral, carrying a full span combination of <b>ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps. [...] These surfaces replaced the original full span flaps plus lateral control spoilers, which were found ineffective. Despite its landplane configuration, this first aircraft had the small outboard floats intended for production amphibians; these rotated to the wingtips in flight and remained rotated for land operation.|$|R
50|$|The XL-14 Maya (until 1995 {{the maya}} was the {{national}} bird of the Philippines) {{was the first of}} this series of prototypes. It was a single-engine, high-wing monoplane of standard layout except for its twin tail. The wing had constant chord and was built around two parallel, solid spars and wooden ribs. The leading edges were covered and reinforced with Wobex {{and the rest of the}} wing was fabric covered. The centre section was integral with the cabin top and the outer wings were braced on each side with V struts from the wing spars to the lower fuselage. <b>Ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps were fitted. It had a strut braced tailplane, set slightly above the fuselage top on a short pylon. The tailplane carried almost rectangular endplate fins and rudders. The tail structure was wooden with fabric covering.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{low wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane with an aerodynamically clean wooden structure and plywood skin. The single spar wings were tapered, carrying balanced <b>ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps inboard. The fuselage had an oval cross-section and was built on a keel with longitudinal members and transverse frames. The cabin, over the wing, was fully glazed and had a starboard side seat for one passenger alongside the pilot with a bench seat behind for two more. A third row could be included if a lower fuel load was carried. The back of the bench seat folded for access to a baggage compartment. The fin was integral with the fuselage and was quite tall, carrying the tailplane about halfway up. The tailplane was braced below to the fuselage. Both rudder and elevators were fabric covered and both mass and horn balanced.|$|R

50|$|The Kometa-Standard was {{the second}} glider {{designed}} by Pavlov and Panchovsky, a fully aerobatic Standard Class aircraft of almost entirely wooden construction, though with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings, straight tapered in plan and set at mid-wing position, were single spar structures with leading edge plywood covered D-boxes. They had 4° of dihedral. There were salmon type fairings, tapering, slender, streamlined bodies, at the tips. The Kometa-Standard had mass-balanced, <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and spoilers at 60% chord which opened {{above and below the}} wing.|$|R
2500|$|It was a {{low wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane with an aerodynamically clean wooden structure and plywood skin.

2500|$|The Jupiter was an {{executive}} transport with between four and seven seats, depending on engine power. [...] It {{was designed by}} André Moynet, {{a member of the}} National Assembly of France and a former government minister, while also a test-pilot, and built by S.S. Engins Matra (so it is sometimes referred to as the Matra Moynet Jupiter), the first prototype flying on 17 December 1963 with the designer and Lucien Tieles at the controls. [...] Its wing had a straight trailing edge, but the centre section had strong taper on the leading edge which continued more weakly outboard. [...] It was of two spar, stressed skin construction, carrying mass balanced <b>ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps. [...] The main undercarriage legs, placed {{at the end of the}} centre section each carried a single wheel and retracted inwards electrically. [...] A retractable nosewheel completed the landing gear.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} of the first flight on 24 October 1932 the H.M.46 was both {{overweight}} and too late to enter the M.1/30 trials. Nonetheless, the Air Ministry decided that the combination of devices for low speed flying were worth investigation and a test flight programme went ahead. This immediately revealed both minor structural and persistent control problems. The former were soon fixed by wing bracing changes but <b>aileron</b> and <b>slot</b> issues and the longitudinal instabilities and associated fore and aft trim problems persisted, even though a new tail unit fitted in the first half of 1934 improved things. Low speed control weaknesses remained to the last flight in May 1934. In November 1934 the Air Ministry agreed, reluctantly, to accept the sole H.P.46: it left Handley Page's Radlett works in April 1935 by road to Farnborough Airfield and did not fly again. It never carried arms.|$|R
50|$|Following earlier Gribovsky practice, {{the wing}} centre section was an {{integral}} part of the circular cross-section fuselage and, like it, was ply covered. The outer wing panels were ply covered from the leading edge back to the rear spar, with the rest fabric covered. In plan the wings were strongly tapered, mostly on the trailing edges, and ended in long, elliptical tips. Their trailing edges carried slotted flaps inboard; <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> filled the rest of the span. Fuel tanks were located between the spars, two in each wing.|$|R
50|$|The XL-15 Tagak was {{the second}} of these prototypes, {{developed}} {{in collaboration with the}} Philippine Air Force. It was a single-engine, high-wing monoplane with a twin-boom layout and tricycle undercarriage to enable easy access to the fuselage pod via rear doors. The inner wing sections, fitted with slotted flaps on the trailing edges had constant chord but further out the wings tapered, with <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons.</b> There was a single lift strut on each side between wing and lower fuselage, with an airfoil profile to add to the lift from the wings.|$|R
50|$|The wooden {{cantilever}} wing is sheathed in laminated wood and canvas. The wing is a right-angle trapezoid with rounded tips and has three structural sections: a central section and two removable outer sections joined {{to the central}} section by three pins. The dual-spar central section is unitized with the fuselage pod and tail booms. The removable monospar outer sections have an oblique auxiliary spar. The canvas-sheathed <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> are aerodynamically-compensated, differentially displaced 30° upward and 18° downward. The wing has a fixed slot {{at the edge of}} attack.|$|R
50|$|The Van Lith VI was a two/three seat light high-wing cabin {{monoplane}} {{of conventional}} wooden construction. The wing was a two-spar structure with plywood and fabric covering. The fuselage was of rectangular section with plywood cladding. The main undercarriage with fixed legs, wheels, brakes and tailwheel were adapted {{from those of}} the Stampe SV.4. The pilot and passengers were seated in tandem with an access door on each side hinging upward for entry and exit. The <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> could be drooped together to function as flaps. It was initially flown with a single fin, but this was replaced with twin fins.|$|R
50|$|Its wings had an all wood {{structure}} and were mounted with 2.5° of dihedral. They were significantly forward swept, by 7° at quarter chord, with a constant chord inner section and strongly tapered outer panels with unswept leading edges. The wings were {{built around a}} single spar with a forward, plywood skinned torsion box {{between it and the}} leading edge; behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. The tips carried the small sreamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time. The outer panels carried wooden <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> which were ply skinned but with an outer fabric covering.|$|R
