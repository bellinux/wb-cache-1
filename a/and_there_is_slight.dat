2500|$|The Shark, {{which was}} {{formally}} announced at AERO Friedrichshafen in April 2007, {{was designed to}} fit into both European UL and US LSA categories. Structurally it {{is a mixture of}} glass- and carbon-fibre composites (whilst fibreglass is utilised to a very limited extent), with PVC foam filled aramid honeycomb structures sandwiched between panels. The wing main spar is a dismountable two piece carbon fibre beam which joins under the front seat; an auxiliary spar carries the aileron and flap mountings. In plan the leading edge is elliptical <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>slight</b> taper on the outer trailing edge where the ailerons are mounted. Single slotted, electrically operated flaps occupy the rest of the trailing edge. Like the wings, the slightly swept tailplanes are easily detached for storage of transport. [...] There is an electrically operated trim tab in the elevator.|$|E
5000|$|The Grave Stele of Hegeso, {{most likely}} sculpted by Callimachus, is renowned {{as one of}} the finest Attic grave stelae {{surviving}} (mostly intact) today. Dated from ca. 410 - ca. 400 BCE, it is made entirely of Pentelic marble. It stands 1.49m high and [...]92m wide, {{in the form of a}} naiskos, with pilasters and a pediment featuring palmette acroteria. The relief, currently on display at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens (NAMA 3624) was found in 1870 in the Kerameikos in Athens, which now houses a replica of it. In its current condition, it is almost complete, but has been restored around its edges. The plinth has mostly broken off <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>slight</b> damage on the head of Hegeso.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 9.5-11.5 mm. The forewings are irrorated (speckled) fuscous, the costal base infused and irrorated dark fuscous {{and with}} blackish scales within the costa <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>slight</b> fuscous infusion carried along the costa {{to the second}} costal spot at the basal third, which spot has some raised black scales within the costa. Half way between the first two costal spots is a black spot well within the costa. The third costal spot is found just before the apical third of the wing and a blackish spot or tuft {{at the base of}} the fold. Black paired tufts are found at the basal fifth, just beyond the basal third and just before the apical third respectively, the first pair on either side of the fold, the lower of the second pair in the fold, the third pair confluent at the end of the cell, directly below the third costal spot and almost connected to it. There is also a faint very angulate narrow fascia from the beginning of the costa. The hindwings are slightly whiter, very lightly fuscous.|$|E

40|$|If galaxies form on shells, then {{clusters}} of galaxies should form at the vertices where three shells intersect. Weinberg, Ostriker, and Dekel (WOD, 1989) studied this picture quantitatively {{and found that}} an intersecting spherical shell model reproduces many of {{the properties of the}} observed distribution of galaxy clusters, but that too much superclustering is produced. In this paper, the WOD analysis is repeated with prolate spheroids that could be created by superconducting cosmic strings. It is found that most of the attractive features of the WOD model are maintained in the more general case <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>slight</b> improvement in some aspects, but that the overall problem of excessive superclustering is not really alleviated...|$|E

40|$|A man aged 29 {{was first}} {{seen at the}} age of 11, when he was found to have a {{congenital}} anomaly of the pulmonary veins which follow an abnormal course to the hilum. On the left side, two large veins descend peripherally before turning medially towards the left atrium; on the right, several smaller veins follow a similar circuitous route from the periphery, before uniting into two main veins which enter the left atrium. The proximal pulmonary arteries are normal in their pattern of branching and distribution but are dilated and tortous and taper abruptly: the left lower lobe artery is abnormally large almost down to the diaphragm. There is also a systemic arterio/pulmonary venous fistula. There is no haemodynamic disturbance, but gas transfer is slightly impaired, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>slight</b> arterial desaturation. The congenital anomaly is unique. Reported cases described as having pulmonary venous varices are a heterogeneous group, but one patient described as such shows resemblances to our case...|$|E
40|$|There {{are limited}} reports {{to date on}} the {{microstructure}} and superplasticity of the Mg-Gd alloys after processing by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP). Accordingly, the effects of ECAP temperature from 473 K to 723 K (200 °C to 450 °C) and number of passes (2, 4, and 8) on the microstructure and texture of an extruded Mg- 5 Gd- 0. 4 Zr (GW 50) alloy were investigated by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and electron backscattered diffraction. The results show that the optimum ECAP temperature is 623 K (350 °C). Higher temperatures give extensive grain growth and the material has insufficient formability at lower temperatures. The results show also that the alloy exhibits no further grain refinement after four ECAP passes <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>slight</b> grain growth at 8 ECAP passes. Samples were processed by four passes at 623 K (350 °C) and then subjected to shear punch testing. The results confirm the occurrence of superplastic behavior at 723 K (450 °C) with a maximum strain rate sensitivity index of ~ 0. 47 and an activation energy of ~ 110 kJ mol- 1. The results are consistent with the occurrence of flow by grain boundary sliding in the superplastic region...|$|E
40|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is a {{malignant}} lesion of the bile duct epithelium. Its incidence and prevalence are low. It appears from the sixth decade of life <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>slight</b> male predominance. It is most frequently {{found in the}} confluence of the hepatic ducts, where it is called hilar cholangiocarcinoma or Klatskin tumor. Its etiology is unknown but there are predisposing conditions and environmental risk factors such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, Caroli's disease, bile duct malformations, industrial toxins and parasitic infections. The classic presentation of cholangiocarcinoma includes jaundice, weight loss and right upper quadrant pain. These, in addition to laboratory exams, endoscopical and imaging procedures, lead to the diagnosis. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma must be distinguished from other malignant or benign causes of biliary obstruction. Cholangiocarcinoma of the distal common bile duct must be differentiated from other periampullary tumors and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can be confused with a hepatocellular carcinoma. Two classifications are used for clinical staging: TNM and Bismuth-Corlette. The best treatment is the complete surgical excision with negative histological margins, although the resectability index is low. The type and size of surgery depends on the location and extent of the tumor. Patients with unresectable tumors can be subjected to palliative procedures such as biliary-enteric bypass, endoscopic or pecutaneous stent placement. Chemotherapy is not effective. Recently, endoscopic phototherapy has emerged as a better alternative for palliative car...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide updated {{knowledge}} and detail on the structure of Malaysian audit market in the pre and post Audit Oversight Board (AOB) establishment. This study includes all Malaysian listed companies from 2008 to 2010. The examination of audit market structure was based on rate of audit fee per unit of size, audit market concentration and individual firm's market share. The results suggest Malaysia audit market can be described as tight oligopoly <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>slight</b> changes in the market during the period 2008 - 2010. The noted changes ore reduction of oudit supplies and the increment of audit fee. The result suggest evidence of economic of scale enjoyed by big size companies. It is interesting to note that, while Big Four are now reducing the number of audit clients, they instead are focusing on larger clients. Focusing on big size companies possibly indicates a strategic move to avoid risky clients. Ernst & Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers are the most influential among Big Four firms, meanwhile Four firms, is enlarging its market share. This study contributes to the audit market literature addressing the strategy adopted by audit firm in low litlgation risk environment. The study also examines the market power of non-Big Four firms in a developing country which is rarely investigated...|$|E
