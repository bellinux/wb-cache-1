40|$|Abstract. As {{the result}} of {{combustion}} reaction in Al-Al 2 O 3 -N 2 system, AlON phase can be synthesized {{in the range of}} initial nitrogen pressure, from 1 to 5 MPa. On the occasion of rm = 0. 3, the unreacted Al was detected in the case of 1 MPa of PN 2. Its intensity decreases with an increase of nitrogen pressure. Ultimately, no peak of Al was observed in the product at nitrogen pressure of 5 MPa. In addition, the peak intensity of AlON in the products increases proportionally with the nitrogen pressure, while the intensities of AlN and Al 2 O 3 decrease slightly with an increase of nitrogen pressure. The formation of AlON may be induced by successive two reactions.

It must be noted that in modern energy technologies pyrolysis occurs at high late of coal particle heating (= 10 K/s for different fluidized bed, or FB-technologies) or super-high-rate (> 10 ** 5 K/s for entrained-flow gasification), and in some of them at high pressure.

To achieve T 0 = 1000 [...] . 2000 K is possible using a high-enthalpy airflow generator (HAG) providing the fired air-heating and oxygen balance compensation.

For small HAG the relevant tasks are to organize effective workflow and ensure combustion stability, which can be solved directly at the developmental testing stage. The characteristic criterion of the workflow efficiency in HAG is the completed physicochemical combustion processes of the working fluid components. This is due to the fact that in the testing process a possible <b>after-burning</b> component of the working fluid in the flow path of the ramjet CC has a significant impact on the studied characteristics of the engine, thereby having a detrimental effect on the quality of the experiment. The examination of the workflow efficiency in HAG showed that the use of hydrogen as a fuel allows us to achieve a high degree of completing the physicochemical processes and reaching the specified conditions at the CC inlet to the ramjet under test. The use of hydrocarbon fuels reduces the completion degree of the workflow process in HAG and is accompanied by the development of pressure pulsations.

40|$|Complex thermo-fluid systems pose many {{difficult}} engineering {{problems in}} the area of automatic control system design. Typically, thermo-fluid systems exhibit nonlinear behavior, a high degree of process uncertainty, as well as transport lag and other time delay behaviors. The jet aircraft engine {{is a good example of}} one such system where the linearized dynamical behavior varies widely over the ranges of power code, altitude and flight Mach number. The customer demands high system performance levels, efficiencies, and safety margins with the aid of automatic control despite the high level of system complexity and uncertainty. The development of suitably powerful controller design techniques for this type of problem is therefore of considerable importance. ^ There exist many distinct controller design techniques capable of producing control laws that are robust in the sense that they are immune to variations in the linearized models used to characterize non-linear system dynamical behavior. Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is one such technique that seeks to break down multiple-input multiple-output system control problems into a series of single-input single-output (SISO) problems. QFT relies on a graphical synthesis approach to controller design, converting the performance and stability objectives into gain-phase bounds on the magnitudes of the individual SISO loop transmission functions. It is in this spirit that this work is undertaken, replacing much of this heuristic development in favor of a more thorough, mathematically rigorous approach, while retaining the powerful graphical design method. ^ This thesis contains a motivation for the use of robust control within the frame-work of turbo-mechanical systems, a review of the historical development of multivariable aircraft engine control, a concise mathematical description of the control problem, and a mathematically rigorous mechanism for carrying out the design of robust control laws. An application of the theory is then brought to bear on a particular multivariable engine control problem; that of the General Electric GE 16 <b>after-burning,</b> gas turbofan aircraft engine. ...|$|E
