5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} daughter. The {{loss of his}} wife had a {{profound}} effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect <b>a</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> logs for resale in Boston.|$|E
5|$|In the 1760s, the British Parliament's {{passage of}} the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, {{combined}} with other frustrations, increased political tension and anger against England in the colonies. Philadelphia residents joined boycotts of British goods. After the Tea Act in 1773, there were threats against anyone who would store tea and any ships that brought tea up the Delaware. After the Boston Tea Party, <b>a</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> tea had arrived in December, on the ship the Polly. A committee told the captain to depart without unloading his cargo.|$|E

The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth.

She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} <b>a</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E

Suddenly the ship found itself some 200 light years away from its previous location and a hundred years in the past, near Deep Space Station K7 and found the USS Enterprise in orbit.

Having uncovered the truth behind Ross's actions, Diamond pulls a gun on the officer and chases him through the cellars underneath the café. Wounding Ross with one of his bullets, Diamond eventually corners him, only to be shot dead by Johnny – an undercover detective who has successfully infiltrated the gang. Johnny informs Ross that the authorities are already aware of Miles' location and that he {{and the rest of the}} gang will soon be apprehended. Ross returns to his former life as an ordinary beat constable.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when <b>a</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E
5|$|The next {{incident}} {{proved to}} be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying <b>a</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{remarkable}} events of Tamar's reign was {{the foundation of}} the Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea coast in 1204. This state was established by Alexios I Megas Komnenos (r. 1204–1222) and his brother, David, in the northeastern Pontic provinces of the crumbling Byzantine Empire with the aid of Georgian troops. Alexios and David, Tamar's relatives, were fugitive Byzantine princes raised at the Georgian court. According to Tamar's historian, the aim of the Georgian expedition to Trebizond was to punish the Byzantine emperor Alexios IV Angelos (r. 1203–1204) for his confiscation of <b>a</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> money from the Georgian queen to the monasteries of Antioch and Mount Athos. However, Tamar's Pontic endeavor can better be explained by her desire {{to take advantage of the}} Western European Fourth Crusade against Constantinople to set up a friendly state in Georgia's immediate southwestern neighborhood, as well as by the dynastic solidarity to the dispossessed Komnenoi.|$|E
5|$|Delays in {{shipping}} Spitfires to Australia disrupted No.1 Wing's formation. In late June 1942 the British Government diverted all but six of {{the initial}} 48 aircraft to Egypt to reinforce the three RAF Spitfire squadrons there after the German victory in the Battle of Gazala; most of these aircraft were allocated to No. 92 Squadron RAF with the remainder forming a reserve to replace future losses. The Australian Government protested against this action, but reluctantly accepted it after Churchill refused to counteract the diversion. During the same period, {{the men of the}} three Spitfire squadrons sailed from Liverpool on board the MV Stirling Castle on 21June and disembarked at Melbourne with the six remaining Spitfires on 13August. <b>A</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> 43 Spitfires left England on 4 August and arrived in Australia in late October, and further deliveries continued to be made until June 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, California was in {{the midst}} of a gold rush; backed by this sudden demand for luxuries, New England {{companies}} made the first shipments, by ship to San Francisco and Sacramento, in California, including <b>a</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>of</b> refrigerated apples. The market was proved, but shipping ice in this way was expensive and demand outstripped supply. Ice began to be ordered instead from the then Russian-controlled Alaska in 1851 at $75 a ton (901kg). The American-Russian Commercial Company was subsequently formed in San Francisco in 1853 to work in partnership with the Russian-American Company of Alaska to supply ice to the west coast of America. The Russian company trained Aleutian teams to harvest ice in Alaska, built saw-mills to produce insulating saw-dust and shipped the ice south along with supplies of chilled fish. The costs of this operation remained high and M. Tallman founded the rival Nevada Ice Company, which harvested ice on Pilot Creek and transported to Sacramento, bringing the west coast price for ice down to seven cents ($2) a pound (0.5kg).|$|E

30|$|In April 2009, {{transgenic}} flaxseed {{was detected}} in two 5, 000 tonne <b>shipments</b> <b>of</b> flax during preprocessing in Europe (Flax Council <b>of</b> Canada 2009 <b>a).</b> <b>Shipments</b> <b>of</b> Canadian flax have also {{tested positive for}} transgenes in Japan and Brazil (Flax Council of Canada 2009 b). The EU and these countries have regulations regarding the detection of genetically modified (GM) flax in shipments and have zero tolerance for its presence. As a consequence, Canadian flax shipments to Europe fell dramatically from 2010 – 2012; Europe imported 80 % of Canadian flaxseed prior to 2009 but only 20 % in 2011 (personal communication, William Hill, President, Flax Council of Canada).|$|R
