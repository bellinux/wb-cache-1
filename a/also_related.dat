5|$|Oswald, of Danish parentage, {{was brought}} up by his uncle Oda, Archbishop of Canterbury, and was <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to Oskytel, later Archbishop of York.

He held the office of dean of Winchester, but he was sent by his uncle to France and entered the monastery of Fleury about 950, where he was ordained in 959. While at Fleury he met Osgar of Abingdon and Germanus of Winchester.

5|$|Alexander of Lincoln (died February 1148) was {{a medieval}} English Bishop of Lincoln, {{a member of}} an {{important}} administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of Roger of Salisbury, a Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England under King Henry I, and he was <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to Nigel, Bishop of Ely. Educated at Laon, Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an archdeacon in the early 1120s. Unlike his relatives, he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop of Lincoln in 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his elevation to the episcopate, often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire.|$|E

Day <b>also</b> <b>related</b> anecdotes, one concerning a {{trip on the}} Rhone where the boat overturned and he rescued both girls single-handedly as neither could swim. He described an incident in which he challenged a French Army officer to a duel, even producing a set of dueling pistols, simply as a manner of engaging or encouraging conversation with his young students; the officer apologised and explained he did not mean any offence, calming the situation.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of OUN terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose {{between the government and}} Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.|$|E

5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E

5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E

5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} weak nature of the storm, impact was generally minor. Rip currents in Alabama and Florida led to five fatalities. The sixth death from the storm was <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to rough seas and occurred {{near the mouth of}} the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Storm surge and high tides also caused coastal flooding in the state, especially in Cameron Parish. Relatively strong winds left more than 2,000without electricity and damaged trees and the roofs of mobile homes. Storm surge caused coastal flooding in eastern Texas, particularly in the Gilchrist area. At least 25homes sustained damage, while portions of a few major roads, such as Interstate 10, were closed. Minor inland flooding occurred due to heavy rainfall, with a portion of Texas State Highway 36 being temporarily shutdown. Strong winds in the region damaged hundreds of homes, downed trees, and left about 300,000people without electricity. Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Edouard totaled slightly more than $550,000 (2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is <b>also</b> <b>related</b> to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
