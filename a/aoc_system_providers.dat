40|$|In this chapter, we generalize {{autonomy}} oriented computation. We {{characterize the}} application-independent features of two main components of <b>AOC</b> <b>systems,</b> namely, entities and environment. We identify the self-organizating process of entities {{as the core}} of <b>AOC</b> <b>systems.</b> We also address the autonomy deployed in <b>AOC</b> <b>systems</b> and compare them with those in other work. Moreover, we use three typical examples, a natural system, a man-made system, and a computational system, to show how AOC is embodied and how AOC works in different cases...|$|R

50|$|Terroir is {{the basis}} of the French wine {{appellation}} dorigine contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system,</b> which is a model for wine appellation and regulation in France and around the world. The <b>AOC</b> <b>system</b> presumes that the land from which the grapes are grown imparts a unique quality that is specific to that growing site (the plants habitat). The extent of terroirs significance is debated in the wine industry.|$|R
5000|$|Renou {{argued that}} France's Appellation d'origine contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system</b> was {{hindering}} the country's competitiveness {{in the world}} wine market. He said that the <b>AOC</b> <b>system</b> was [...] "conceived for producers rather than consumers", {{that there are too}} many AOCs, they are not meaningful, that they confuse consumers, and that reform was essential. His proposals for reform met strong resistance and defense of the status quo.|$|R

50|$|While Spain's Denominación de Origen is very similar, the {{classification}} of Rioja in 1925 and Sherry in 1933 preceded the French <b>AOC</b> <b>system</b> by {{a few years and}} show that Spain's DdO system developed parallel to France's <b>AOC</b> <b>system</b> to some extent. Similarly, Germany's Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete is a wine classification system based on geographic region, but it differs from the AOC in important ways. Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete wines are commonly seen as less prestigious than Qualitätswein mit Prädikat, making it more similar to the Vin de Pays or Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure systems.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{these various}} classifications systems, Croatian wines don't have a DO or <b>AOC</b> <b>system</b> like Spain, Italy, or France, {{which can make}} it {{confusing}} to understand a wine's grade or origin.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the Great French Wine Blight, which led to much wine fraud to {{supplement}} diminishing supply, wine laws were created in France to combat fraud. The French wine legislation later evolved to the <b>AOC</b> <b>system,</b> and inspired common European Union regulations.|$|R

50|$|Languedoc {{has been}} known for centuries for {{producing}} simpler and cheaper wine, which has sometimes been passed off by wine merchants as more expensive wine from Bordeaux or Burgundy. The French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system</b> was created in the 1930s to prevent the practice of mislabeling or diluting expensive wines with cheaper ones.|$|R
50|$|Several {{entrepreneurs}} such as Robert Skalli and James Herrick drastically {{changed the}} face of the region, planting more commercially viable grape varieties and pushing for new AOC classifications. While the <b>AOC</b> <b>system</b> has origins in the 15th century, the Languedoc-Roussillon has some appellations like the Cabardès which have existed by law only since 1999 (Joseph 2005:190).|$|R
50|$|He {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in {{not only the}} history of Châteauneuf-du-Pape {{but also in the}} history of French wine. In 1935 he and Joseph Capus co-founded the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) and spearheaded the creation of the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system</b> that would become the basis of the French wine laws and continue to influence European wine laws into the twenty-first century.|$|R
50|$|Pierre Le Roy de Boiseaumarié (1890-1967), nicknamed Baron Le Roy, was a World War I {{fighter pilot}} {{credited}} with five aerial victories. He was the {{co-founder of the}} Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) and guided {{the creation of the}} Appellation d'origine contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system</b> which is the basis of not only French wine laws but has also been influential in the laws and appellation systems across the globe.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to regulations {{that apply to}} all EU members, each EU country has its own framework of laws which govern aspects of winemaking such {{as the percentage of}} a grape to be included in a wine labeled with that variety name. [...] For instance, in France wine professionals acribe to the Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée (<b>AOC)</b> <b>system,</b> which guarantees the origin of wine and other food products, such as cheese.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, Jules Lavalle {{developed}} an informal classification of vineyards of the Côte d'Or in his book History and Statistics of the Côte d'Or. In 1861, Lavalle's classification was formalized by the Beaune Committee of Agriculture. The designations of grand cru and premier cru were later developed and expanded on in the 1930s with the creation of the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (or <b>AOC)</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

30|$|Some {{regression}} models omitted the <b>system</b> <b>providers</b> from the data, {{and we find}} that international ownership in particular boosted subcontractors’ export rate. This is also a novel contribution, and the observed effect is probably {{a result of a}} decrease in subcontractors’ market dependency on regional <b>system</b> <b>providers</b> when they have international ownership. International ownership thus appears to boost the export rate for subcontractors in particular, most likely as a function of access to international distribution channels and branding effects through international ownership. Innovative subcontractors also tended to have an export orientation, but this effect was not found to be particularly strong for this group of firms (compared with <b>system</b> <b>providers).</b>|$|R
