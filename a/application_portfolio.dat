40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alignment model {{to analyze the}} specific IT-based challenges of divesting a strategic business unit (SBU). The model identifies the interdependences among SBU <b>application</b> <b>portfolios,</b> undocumented local system customization, and other intra-organization links that a carveout must identify and resolve. For large organizations that frequently buy and sell SBUs, four guidelines are proposed: 1) a SBU that will be sold- the so called carve-out object- should be autonomous, 2) the SBU IT <b>application</b> <b>portfolios</b> should be independent, 3) IT standards should be implemented in both the corporate IT platform and IT <b>application</b> <b>portfolios,</b> and 4) the intellectual property embedded in human resources needs to be replicated, and both retained in the vendor organization and divested to the buyer with the IT carve-out object. Complying with these guidelines is complex and difficult because they are frequently in conflict with vendor IT and line management goals. Carve-out management teams should consider and address these differences when structuring...|$|R
