40|$|Abstract — To obtain higher {{linearity}} in an <b>analog</b> photonic <b>link,</b> a novel coherent receiver {{design with}} feedback is proposed and demonstrated, where the linearity and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) tradeoff {{associated with a}} traditional phase demodulator can be eliminated. The local phase modulator in the feedback loop of the receiver tracks the phase change of the incoming signal and reduces the effective swing of the phase demodulator, leading to better linearity without reducing {{the strength of the}} transmitted signal. Thus, the SNR of the demodulated signal can be preserved while the linearity is improved. Up to 22. 8 dB increase in spur free dynamic range (SFDR) is demonstrated. This novel receiver design is all-optical in the sense that no electrical loop amplifier is necessary. In order to operate the link at carrier frequencies beyond the loop bandwidth, an optical sampling technique is employed to downconvert the signal to the baseband. With feedback in the receiver, 14. 1 dB of SFDR improvement is obtained experimentally in the sampled operation.

These devices are of great interest for local oscillator distribution or receiver signal remoting. Use of direct modulation is simpler and less expensive than external modulation. To get high power and high efficiency we focused in a {{first time on the}} reduction of internal losses in the cavity by decreasing the optical confinement in p-doped indium phosphide (InP). The main constraint was to maintain a sufficient overlap between the optical field and the quantum wells to have a low relative intensity noise (RIN) and a large modulation bandwidth. A compromise has been done on the optical confinement to get in the same time good static performances (power and efficiency) and dynamic performances (RIN and bandwidth). In a second step we tried to reduce the beam divergence and, above all, the ellipticity of the mode. Wafers were processed in dual channel shallow ridge DFB. 1 mm long cavities were cleaved and facets were anti-reflective (AR) / highly reflective (HR) coated. Lasers are mounted p-up on AlN submounts integrating coplanar lines for both DC and RF characterization. Maximum power was 135 mW at 600 mA bias current. The efficiency defined as (Power/(Current-Threshold current)) was up to 0. 3 W/A at a bias current as high as 500 mA. RIN measurement has showed a RIN level below - 155 dB/Hz on the 40 MHz to 20 GHz range at 450 mA bias current. The modulation bandwidth is up to 6. 5 GHz.
