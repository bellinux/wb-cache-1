40|$|The European Union' TACIS {{programme}} {{was established}} to support the New Independent States since 1991. One priority for TACIS funding is nuclear safety. For TACIS, the European Commission (EC) Directorate General External Relations {{is responsible for the}} Indicative Programmes whilst the EC-EuropeAid Co-operation Office is in charge of identifying and implementing all the assistance projects through the <b>Annual</b> <b>Programmes.</b> In these programmes, EC-Joint Research Center (JRC) is the Technical & Scientific adviser of above mentioned EC Directorates. During the years of Tacis assistance activities in nuclear safety quite a few programs were dedicated to the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) embrittlement issue. The ageing of the RPV was of special concern due to the faster than expected neutron irradiation embrittlement of the core region weld of the VVER 440 NPPs and some shortcomings of the RPV surveillance program in VVER 1000 NPPs. Most of the Tacis ageing projects were so far dedicated to studying the RPV embrittelement and integrity issue. In this paper highlights from some completed Tacis projects on the RPV embrittelment and integrity issue have been selected and briefly described.

40|$|Rescpecting the {{significance}} of sports for the health,social integration, international prestige and afirmation, national pride, feeling of belongness, morale and other values of general interest and wanting, not just to sustain but also to open new perspectives of development of Montenegrin sports {{it is necessary that}} state participate in creating of the conditions for the development of sports. All this because of reason that with good created system of setting out professional, organizational and managing tasks in local and state level, sports must become an important factor of the conscience of individuals about health, actually important factor of the prevention of health and sociopathological cases among youth. It is also important to stress that achievement of internationally recognized results contribute to interational promotion of the state, in other words high level sports success in developed world has special productive prize. That is why conditions that encourage bigger investments in sports are created. In that way the level of sports results is sustained and improved. That conditions increase of mass taking part in all ways of sports participation (supporting, sports activity etc), use of sports products, development of sports industry, trade, tourism and other activities which are related to sports. As consequence to that new job posts are created and there is better knowing in world about the state and its resources. According to constitutional and legal regime of the state of Montenegro, international conventions related to sports (European charter on sports, European convention against doping in sports, Codex of ethics in sports, Manifesto on sports of youth etc), recommendations of Council of Europe and needs of Montenegrin sports it was necessary to organize the area of sports in better and more constructive way. The orientation of state is to define public interest in sports and to organize sports in contemporary way as activity of public interest by Law on sports and National Programme of Sports in overall, long-term and dinamic way, stipulating and creating postulations and conditions for development. In process of implementation of public interest in sports it is defined the distribution of competencies between state and local self-governance while defining the way of implementation of public interest. As long-term interest of Montenegro, Government of Montenegro issues National Programme of Sports which confirmes sports developmental goals. By issuing of <b>annual</b> <b>programmes</b> of sports (in state and local level) and by their implementation, it will be define and co-finance performers of elective programmes in sports in transparent wa...|$|E
40|$|Background: An AIDS vaccine {{could play}} a very {{significant}} role in reversing the HIV pandemic, saving millions of lives. For a vaccine to have such an impact, it must be widely available and adopted and taken up rapidly in the countries most affected. A demand-forecasting model provides a valuable tool that can guide R&D spending decisions and identify policy actions to help achieve these goals. Objective: To identify the key determinants of vaccine demand, model global adoption and uptake dynamics, estimate potential demand and revenues associated with future preventive AIDS vaccines, and to conduct sensitivity analyses {{to assess the impact}} of each parameter on demand. Methods: A discrete, deterministic, linear, predictive mathematical model based on stratified population averages with a 30 -year time horizon was developed to assess scenarios of future demand. This forecasting model was used to explore the effects of vaccine characteristics and a variety of regulatory, political, financial and health service factors on future demand and revenues. The intervention modelled was a preventive AIDS vaccine (efficacy: 30 - 90 %; duration of protection: 3 - 5 years; in a two-dose prime-boost combination). The main outcome measure was the number of complete courses of vaccine administered. Results: The model suggests that demand for a preventive AIDS vaccine with a medium efficacy (50 %) and duration of protection (3 years) would average 68 million courses annually over a 30 -year period. Under different scenarios, demand would peak at 38 - 152 million courses annually. On the basis of tiered pricing across public and private markets ($US 2 - 100 per dose), these levels of peak demand would translate into $US 2. 5 - 5. 5 billion in peak annual sales revenues. Private markets and high-income countries account for small volumes but large shares of projected revenues, while low-income countries account for large volumes and more modest, but still significant, sales revenues. Vaccinations to `catch-up' those who are missed or not eligible for routine <b>annual</b> <b>programmes</b> (whether adolescent or high-risk populations) would account for 20 - 35 % of cumulative vaccination courses across all scenarios. Demand was found to be sensitive to vaccine efficacy, duration of protection and price. Efforts to expedite regulatory review processes, improve immunization infrastructure and reduce political constraints could increase demand for an AIDS vaccine by 40 million additional courses a year compared with the medium efficacy (baseline) vaccine forecast. Conclusions: Our model can provide vaccine developers with credible estimates of market potential for an AIDS vaccine, and with a tool that can be used to improve forecasts over time as AIDS vaccine science progresses. It can also help governments to identify and pursue those policies that could best strengthen demand and uptake of a safe and effective preventive AIDS vaccine.

40|$|Tijekom posljednjih godina Međunarodni centar za podvodnu arheologiju u Zadru obavljao je s Hrvatskim restauratorskim zavodom podvodna rekognosciranja podmorja istarskog poluotoka. Tijekom ovih istraživanja pregledani su neki stari položaji, ali su otkriveni i neki posve novi koji svjedoče o potopljenoj arhitekturi i tragovima brodoloma. Te lokacije nalaze se na zapadnoj, ali i na istočnoj obali Istre. Ovi tragovi su vrlo bitni za proučavanje pomorstva uz istarsku obalu. Kroz njih se iščitava način plovidbe kroz dugo razdoblje i različiti trgovački putovi. Treba doduše reći kako je kulturna podvodna baština Istre u velikoj mjeri uništena pljačkom koja je najintenzivnija bila oko sredine druge polovine 20. st. Tim više su pregledi podmorja i ucrtavanje ostataka presudni za budućnost podvodnih istraživanja. Constant {{underwater}} {{investigations are}} {{the only way of}} identifying new archaeological sites and of monitoring already known sites. The International Centre for Underwater Archaeology in Zadar (ICUA) and the Croatian Conservation Institute (CCI) have conducted around one hundred dives in recent years. The result is the identification of some twenty new sites, of which at least five are ancient shipwreck sites and two are sites of the modern era, unknown until now. Despite the fact that these sites have been plundered, archaeological science can still draw precious data from them. After the discovery, general dating and evaluation of the state of preservation, some of these sites can and should be the subject of systematic archaeological investigations. It will therefore be possible to preserve this part of our underwater cultural heritage {{and at the same time}} advances in the scientific branch of archaeology will be made. For these reasons, the mentioned underwater investigations have been conducted according to the regular <b>annual</b> <b>programmes</b> of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia for the protection of cultural heritage. Based on the results and reports submitted by archaeologists, the conservators of the Ministry of Culture can start the process of the protection of the sites by entering the sites in the Register of Cultural Goods of the Republic of Croatia. Moreover, all the new insights will be used to complete and correct the recently made digital database of the underwater cultural heritage, MACHU. HR, maintained by the International Centre for Underwater Archaeology in Zadar. Among the particularly valuable sites discovered or identified during the underwater investigations is an Early Antique shipwreck site at Uljeva A Cape and Seka Rock, and also Late Antique shipwreck sites at Uljeva B Cape and off the island of Sv. Ivan. Of particular importance are newly documented remains of architectural complexes in the Bay of Kolone and at Vilas Rubin. Both of these locations can be described as complexes of maritime buildings and production and storage facilities that were used by yet unknown coastal villae rusticae. A dry stone wall of large dimensions located at Mučje Sike is a curious find. Its dating is uncertain for now, as is the dating of the dock in the Bay of Vinjole. Both of these structures were certainly present in Antiquity, but it is possible that they are even older. These are all significant archaeological and historic traces that will have to be protected from potential devastation. Hopefully, underwater investigations will continue in the future...|$|E
