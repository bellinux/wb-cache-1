5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E
5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E

5|$|Being a quintessential part of vespers, evensong or matins, the Magnificat was, already {{for over}} <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> Bach's composition, the liturgical text {{that was most}} often set to music apart from the Mass ordinary. In Protestantism there was no Latin text more often set to music than the Magnificat. Also {{settings}} of the German text of the Magnificat were current from the early 17th century, without one form suppressing the other.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, about <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> the cantata got its BWV number, it was {{published}} as No. 7 in {{the first volume of}} the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe. In the New Bach Edition the cantata was included in Series I, Volume 29, Kantaten zum Johannisfest (Cantatas for St. John's Day). Calmus and Breitkopf & Härtel published performance scores. The Breitkopf score translates the cantata's title as Lord Christ of old to Jordan came.|$|E
5|$|In a low-scoring {{match against}} Queensland, New South Wales started {{the final day}} needing 142 to win. Morris scored 108 in only 80 balls, {{steering}} his team to victory before lunch. Previously, only Bradman had scored <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> lunch in a Shield match. The innings took only 82 minutes and Morris promptly returned to {{his work as a}} salesman. Morris rounded off his Shield campaign with 110 against South Australia. The Western Australian Cricket Association attempted to lure Morris to switch states, but he declined.|$|E

In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, almost half <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> {{the arrival of the}} Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E
5|$|While Galileo's {{application}} of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day, including dozens {{of examples of}} an inverse proportion square root method passed down from Fibonacci and Archimedes. The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the Eudoxian theory of proportion, as {{set forth in the}} fifth book of Euclid's Elements. This theory had become available only <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before,</b> thanks to accurate translations by Tartaglia and others; {{but by the end of}} Galileo's life, it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of Descartes.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{thought his}} soldiers' morale was too shaky for a retreat so he {{advanced}} on Coburg's army, seeking battle. In his haste, the French commander failed {{to call up}} Harville's corps or the Army of Holland as reinforcements. Earlier, François Joseph Drouot de Lamarche had been driven out of Tienen (Tirlemont), but on 16 March the French recaptured it after a vigorous combat. The French attacked Tienen with 10,000 troops while Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen defended the town with 6,000 soldiers, six guns and two mortars. French casualties numbered 500 while their opponents sustained losses of 800 killed, wounded and missing. Coburg pulled his army back behind the Little Gete River. Believing that he outnumbered his enemies, Dumouriez was very confident of success. <b>A</b> <b>century</b> <b>before,</b> the French had won the Battle of Landen on the same ground.|$|E

5|$|Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it {{is unclear}} why; {{according}} to a story that may be apocryphal, he fled the country as an outlaw soon after his revolver fired—by accident, so the story goes—and killed a man. Whatever the truth, he travelled to Mozambique, then a Portuguese territory, where {{he made his way}} upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a ghost town. Its last inhabitants had fled amid a native rising about half <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before,</b> and since then it had been deserted.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} runs scored, this {{performance}} was soon surpassed. In the Third Test, at Headingley, Bradman scored <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> lunch on 11 July, {{the first day}} of the Test match to equal the performances of Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney. In the afternoon, Bradman added another century between lunch and tea, before finishing the day on 309 not out. He remains the only Test player to pass 300 in one day's play. His eventual score of 334 was a world-record, exceeding the previous mark of 325 by Andy Sandham. Bradman dominated the Australian innings; the second-highest tally was 77 by Alan Kippax. Businessman Arthur Whitelaw later presented Bradman with a cheque for £1,000 in appreciation of his achievement. The match ended in anti-climax as poor weather prevented a result, as it also did in the Fourth Test.|$|E
25|$|After {{working in}} a series of {{temporary}} positions, in 1964 Young was hired by Northern Illinois University to a tenure track position in the field of American history. He would continue to teach there for <b>a</b> quarter <b>century</b> <b>before</b> his retirement in 1989.|$|R
50|$|Thereafter, almost <b>a</b> <b>century</b> elapses <b>before</b> {{there is}} a mention of John Ernle {{conveying}} the manor of Earnley to John Michelgrove and his wife, Joan, in 1427. In 1428, 1431 and 1432, however, William Ernele held the manor.|$|R
50|$|Taylor, who {{had never}} scored <b>a</b> {{first-class}} <b>century</b> <b>before,</b> and had played only three first-class matches, came in at No. 8 and slammed 105 in 158 minutes with 14 fours and three sixes and helped Bert Sutcliffe (151 not out) add 163 for the seventh wicket.|$|R
5|$|In {{the most}} celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg {{forgiveness}} before he is released. This seems to borrow {{the story of a}} different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain). This story takes place about <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.|$|E
5|$|Malta had {{organised}} the Consulato del Mare (Consulate of the Sea) for {{the first}} time on 1 September 1697 per initiative of Grandmaster Perellos. At the consulate it was decided that four merchants familiar enough with maritime procedures shall be appointed consuls to administer justice, on similar approach to Barcellona and Messina. Perellos had established foreign relations between Malta and Russia in 1698, {{for the first}} time, exactly <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> the Order's expulsion from Malta. During his grandmastership the coastal fortifications of Malta were strengthened by the construction of batteries, redoubts, and entrenchments. He also was the driving force behind the third rate squadron of the order which was eventually inaugurated in 1705. In 1707 he entrusted Romano Carapecchia with the reorganization of the drainage system in Valletta.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{also said}} that the town had {{formerly}} belonged to the Anatolian Theme but Leo VI incorporated it into Cappadocia.

25|$|The town grew {{slowly and}} {{was nothing but}} a village for many years. More than a quarter of <b>a</b> <b>century</b> passed <b>before</b> <b>an</b> act of {{incorporation}} was applied for. Finally, by act approved March 15, 1826, it was incorporated as a borough.|$|R

5|$|The Bruneian Empire was {{established}} in the coastal regions of Sarawak by the mid-15th century, and the Kuching area was known to Portuguese cartographers during the 16th century as Cerava, one of the five great seaports of Borneo. It was also during this time that witnessed the birth of the Sultanate of Sarawak, a local kingdom that lasted for almost half <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> being reunited with Brunei in 1641. By the early 19th century, the Bruneian Empire was in decline, retaining only a tenuous hold along the coastal regions of Sarawak which were otherwise controlled by semi-independent Malay leaders. Away from the coast, territorial wars were fought between the Iban and a Kenyah-Kayan alliance.|$|E
5|$|The Liao dynasty was {{destroyed}} by the Jurchen people of the Jin dynasty in 1125 with the capture of Emperor Tianzuo of Liao. However, the remnant Khitan, led by Yelü Dashi, established the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty), which ruled over parts of Central Asia for almost <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before</b> being conquered by the Mongols. Although cultural achievements associated with the Liao dynasty are considerable, {{and a number of}} various statuary and other artifacts exist in museums and other collections, major questions remain over the exact nature and extent of the influence of the Liao Khitan culture upon subsequent developments, such as the musical and theatrical arts.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the next}} years, Lafayette made his house, the Hôtel de La Fayette in Paris's rue de Bourbon, the {{headquarters}} of Americans there. Benjamin Franklin, John and Sarah Jay, and John and Abigail Adams met there every Monday, and dined in company with Lafayette's family and the liberal nobility, including Clermont-Tonnerre and Madame de Staël. Lafayette continued to work on lowering trade barriers in France to American goods, and on assisting Franklin and his successor as envoy, Jefferson, in seeking treaties of amity and commerce with European nations. He also sought to eliminate the injustices that Protestants in France had endured since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
