5|$|In the {{build up}} to the World Cup Charlton gave out first caps to Gary Kelly, Phil Babb and Jason McAteer; he had {{difficulty}} convincing McAteer to join Ireland as he first had to turn down an approach by the FA {{to play for the}} England under-21s. He scheduled difficult matches before the tournament and Ireland picked up positive results by beating both the Netherlands and Germany away from home. Ireland opened the group stage of the tournament by beating Italy 1–0 at the Giants Stadium, Ray Houghton scoring the winning goal on 11 minutes. They then fell to a 2–1 defeat to Mexico at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, during which Charlton had a pitch-side argument with an official who was preventing substitute John Aldridge (who went on to score the consolation goal) from taking the pitch minutes after his teammate Tommy Coyne had left the pitch <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench. For his arguing, Charlton was suspended by FIFA for the final group game against Norway, and had to watch from the commentary box as Ireland qualified with a 0–0 draw. They faced the Netherlands in the Round of 16; Dennis Bergkamp put the Dutch ahead on 11 minutes after Marc Overmars took advantage of a mistake by Terry Phelan, and Wim Jonk scored the second and final goal of the game from 30 yards after Packie Bonner fluffed an otherwise routine save. For his achievements Charlton was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1994 by Lord Mayor Tomás Mac Giolla, the first Englishman to be given the honour since 1854.|$|E
500|$|On June 1, 1995, Abu-Jamal's {{death warrant}} {{was signed by}} Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Its {{execution}} was suspended while Abu-Jamal pursued state post-conviction review. At the post-conviction review hearings, new witnesses were called. William [...] "Dales" [...] Singletary testified that he saw the shooting and that the gunman was the passenger in Cook's car. Singletary's account contained discrepancies which rendered it [...] "not credible" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the court. William Harmon, a convicted fraudster, testified that Faulkner's murderer fled in a car that pulled up to the crime scene, and could not have been Abu-Jamal. Robert Harkins testified that he had witnessed a man stand over Faulkner as the latter lay wounded on the ground, who shot him point-blank in the face and then [...] "walked <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> curb".|$|E
2500|$|P. G. Wodehouse {{refers to}} Ade's [...] "The Fable of the Author Who Was Sorry for What He Did to Willie" [...] in Love Among the Chickens (1909) ("The whole thing began like Mr. George Ade's fable of the author. An author — myself — {{was sitting at}} his desk trying to turn out {{something}} that could be converted into breakfast food, when a friend came in <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and told him to go right on and not mind him." [...] (Chapter XII) and [...] "I felt, like the man in the fable, as if some one had played a mean trick on me, and substituted for my brain a side order of cauliflower." [...] (Chapter XVI)) He uses the same sentence again in Mike (1909) (But that Adair should inform him, two minutes after Mr. Downing’s announcement of Psmith’s confession, that Psmith, too, was guiltless, and that the real criminal was Dunster — it was this that made him feel that somebody, in the words of an American author, had played a mean trick on him, and substituted for his brain a side-order of cauliflower. (Chapter LVIII)) ...|$|E
