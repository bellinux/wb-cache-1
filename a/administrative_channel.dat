40|$|Abstract Historically {{water has}} been and remains a key factor for our development. The State, through its Judicial Power, {{assuming}} the environment custody, has released several legal measures for its protection and repair. However, due to the overflowed system, the absence of public policies and the time consuming nature of the judicial process, such actions are ineffective or insufficient {{in the face of}} daily needs. It is imperative that the Judiciary adopt alternative work methods, aiming its relief and greater effectiveness in terms of emergency, preventive and reparatory guardianship. We encounter in National Water Resources Policy in Article 38, II, an agreement for Basins Committees to use arbitration in <b>administrative</b> <b>channels</b> on water conflicts. Thus, the creation of a Water Arbitration Tribunal, with extrajudicial action parallel with indicated judicial measures, would effectively contribute to the prevention/minimization of environmental damage and the consequent indiscriminate viable access to the natural resource...|$|R

In past decades cadres decided what would be produced, what production techniques were to be employed, and how output was to be distributed {{on the basis of}} annual plans. Indirect controls, such as prices and interest rates, became more important after 1980. Different combinations of the forces of self-sufficiency, profits, and state plans affected decision making for a given product in a given year. For example, in 1985 cotton farmers were told via state plans how much area to plant in cotton, whereas farmers received no state plans to sow fields with melons; rather, they planted melons in the hope of increasing profits.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with radio listening habits and their effects in the economic, cultural and political spheres in Northern Thailand. The three villages under study are situated in different geographical settings and achieved different levels of modernization. Radio influences all aspects of life. By diffusion of new ideas it prepares listeners for acceptance of innovations. Radio also helps villagers more directly with advice and special educational programmes to adopt new techniques at home and new agricultural methods. It makes education more generally available and this in turn affects traditional elites, who used to have the monopoly of education. To keep their position and remain the best informed, they must {{listen to the radio}} even more regularly than other villagers. Though people listen to radio more in the most traditional and isolated village, they find it difficult to make full use of the new ideas. The most modernized community nearest to the town has many other diversions and other means of gaining information, so that radio is less important there. The effect of radio is most significant in the middle community, still traditional, but with reasonable communications with the outside world. Not all the effects of radio listening are positive. Advertisements arouse desires for goods which the people cannot afford {{and in the absence of}} any consumer movement there is no impartial advice available on the quality of the goods advertised.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{argument}} {{about the nature of}} language teaching methodology, relating general educational principles to current theories of language acquisition and use. Chapter I discusses what constitutes appropriate knowledge about language teaching methodology. It argues for a Popperian epistemological model, providing that methodological innovation is seen as analogous to social policy-making. Chapter II outlines current views of the nature of language, its use and acquisition, and argues that the creation of meaning through interaction and negotiation with other language users is a central feature. Chapter III examines a number of possible polarisations of the process of language acquisition into strategies for acquiring the tokens of the language and strategies for turning them into a negotiable and value-laden system of use. Criticisms are offered of some of these, particularly Krashen's, and a pedagogically orientated distinction between accuracy and fluency is presented. • Chapter IV examines the methodological implications of making this distinction, and particularly the need to establish a 'natural' setting. Group work is seen as central to this. Chapter V explores the role of meaning in language teaching and briefly considers some curriculum design proposals. It is argued that the organisation of a syllabus is less important than the methodology used, and that a syllabus should have educational content. Chapter VI draws'on the argument so far to outline a model of teaching methodology which emphasises substantive as well as linguistic content, and depends upon interactive methods. The final chapter returns to the general model of methodological enquiry and argues that successful development of the practice of teaching depends heavily on a combination of <b>administrative</b> <b>channels</b> for effective innovation and feedback with a constant process of analysis of theoretical concepts in terms which have direct relevance to teachers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the building and design work of the church builder family Rijf in Österbotten during the Gustavian Period. The Rijfs were Finland- Swedes and entailed four mason-based master builders: Thomas Rijf (1726 - 1803), his sons Jacob (1753 - 1808) and Carl (1756 - 1801), and Jacob´s son Carl Jacobsson Rijf (1783 - 1808). The most famous {{member of the family}} was Jacob Rijf. He was the first Finnish master builder to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and was supervised by the leading architects of the Board of Public Works and Buildings, Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz (1716 - 1796) and Olof Tempelman (1745 - 1816). In 1794 Jacob Rijf was appointed as the provincial master builder of Swedish Västerbotten and soon thereafter he was raised to the position of leading church master builder for the entire province of Finnish Österbotten. As architect, Rijf was largely inspired by Ulrica Eleonora Church and Adolf Fredrik Church in Stockholm. As major proponents of the Swedish Neoclassical style, this family of master- builders was most active {{at the end of the}} 18 th century when they designed and built stone and timber-framed churches, as well as bell towers, in the Finnish prov- inces of Vaasa and Oulu. They also gained renown as wood-carvers of elaborate pulpits, altarpieces and hymn boards. This study, which belongs to the field of biographical research within art history, focuses on the internal division of labour within the family Rijf, their educational background, and the social networks and personal relationships at work be- hind their most important construction projects. In addition to mapping their oeuvre, this study analyzes the formal and stylistic backgrounds of the church buildings and looks into the conventions governing church founding projects, including formal <b>administrative</b> <b>channels,</b> the factors influencing the selection of master builders, and the process of drawing up construction plans...|$|R
40|$|The main {{ideas of}} the {{forthcoming}} economic reform are characterized by the author {{at the beginning of}} the. article. Problems of self-contained enterprises, of a wider employment of market and of trade relations are in the focus of attention. A transition to indirect economic system of management and planning results increases the importance of Civil Law in legal regulations of a socialist economy. Full responsibility of the enterprises for their own autonomous plan generates an authentic demand for numerous direct external ties with other economic subjects. A Civil Law contract is the instrument forming those ties.. Next, the author characterizes functions of the economic contracts which are to become the fundamental source of obligations, and essentially, the exclusive instrument organizing and re-organizing a commercial intercourse within nationalized industries. The planning functions of contracts are a matter of special importance in the economic reform. The contracts have to form grounds for the production planning and adopt the part of administrative indicators, directions and planning elements of the centralistic system of management. By virtue of the new Act of the State Enterprises (the Polish Law Gazette — Dz. U. nr 24 of 1981) a contract of Civil Law can be the instrument shaping new organizational structures i. e. joint ventures, semi-public enterprises and economic associations of various types. The article is concluded with a discussion of freedom of contracts in the economic reform. In the opinion of the author, the scope of freedom of contracts in the socialized intercourse have to be widely expanded. Nevertheless it would be fallacious to eliminate entirely the State's capacity to shape the market processes by means of <b>administrative</b> <b>channels,</b> the strong market power of producers, contractors and suppliers is the reason of it.

40|$|Mr. Michl {{posed the}} {{question}} of how the institutional framework that the former communist regime set up around art production contributed to the success of Czech applied arts. In his theoretical review of the question he discussed the reasons for the lack of success of socialist industrial design as opposed to what he terms pre-industrial arts (such as art glass), and also for the current lack of interest into art institutions of the past regime. His findings in the second, historical section of his work were based largely on interviews with artists and other insiders, as an initial attempt to use questionnaires was unsuccessful. His original assumption that the institutional framework was imposed on artists against their will in fact proved mistaken, as it turned out to have been proposed by the artists themselves. The basic blueprint for communist art institutions was the Memorandum document published on behalf of Czechoslovak visual artists in March 1947, i. e. before the communist coup of February 1948. Thus, while the communist state provided a beneficial institutional framework for artists' work, it was the artists themselves who designed this framework. Mr. Michl concludes that the text of the memorandum appealed to the general left-wing and anti-market sentiments of the immediate post-war period and by this and by later working through the <b>administrative</b> <b>channels</b> of the new state, the artists succeeded in gaining all of their demands over the next 15 years. The one exception was artistic freedom, although this they came to enjoy, if only by default and for a short time, during the ideological thaw of the 1960 s. Mr. Michl also examined the art-related legislative framework in detail and looked at the main features of key art institutions in the field, such as the Czech Fund for Visual Arts and the 1960 s art export enterprise Art Centrum, which opened the doors into foreign markets for artists...|$|R
40|$|In {{conversations about}} {{government}} assistance, rights language often {{emerges as a}} danger: when benefits become 2 ̆ 2 rights, 2 ̆ 2 policymakers lose flexibility, taxpayers suffer, and the poor lose their incentive to work. Absent from the discussion is an understanding of how, when, and why Americans {{began to talk about}} public benefits in rights terms. This Article addresses that lacuna by examining the rise of a vibrant language of rights within the federal social welfare bureaucracy during the 1930 s and 1940 s. This language is barely visible in judicial and legislative records, the traditional source base for legal-historical inquiry, but amply evidenced by previously unmined administrative records. Using these documents, this Article shows how concepts of 2 ̆ 2 welfare rights 2 ̆ 2 filtered through federal, state, and local <b>administrative</b> <b>channels</b> and into communities around the nation. This finding contradicts conventional wisdom, which dates the birth of 2 ̆ 2 welfare rights 2 ̆ 2 language to the 196 os. This Article reveals that as early as 1935, some Americans -government officials, no less -deliberately and persistently employed rights language in communications about welfare benefits. In addition to challenging dominant interpretations, this Article identifies an under-studied aspect of rights language. An abundant 2 ̆ 2 rights talk 2 ̆ 2 literature chronicles and critiques claimants 2 ̆ 7 use of rights language. This Article, by contrast, identifies rights language emanating from government and being used for government purposes. Specifically, this Article argues that federal administrators used rights language as an administrative tool, a way to solve tricky problems of federalism and administrative capacity at a time in which poor relief was shifting from a local to a state and federal responsibility. Thus, this Article not only enriches debates about the role of rights in contemporary social welfare reforms, but also brings fresh insights to scholarship on the techniques of administrators and the limits of federal powe...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{through the}} study of news {{coverage}} of a housing development and relocation scandal in Hunan province, explores the scope of freedom that media enjoy in the Mainland, focusing particularly on the phenomenon of “public opinion supervision. ” The case chosen involved 1100 households and 7, 000 {{people living in the}} small county of Jiahe. Though relocation projects are common in China, this project involved active and direct local government intervention, with officials bending the law and harassing the residents. Despite attempts by residents to solve the problems through <b>administrative</b> <b>channels</b> and legal means throughout the year of 2003, this was of no avail. As a last resort, the residents sought help from the media. In the short period between early May and early June of 2004, a media relay commenced. Through tacit co-ordination among local newspapers, Beijing news groups and the China Central Television (CCTV), the story was eventually covered. Public condemnation against local officials came pouring in and the fate of local residents was changed dramatically. Behind the glorious façade of victory, the pressure that journalists faced was enormous. To the journalists, the battle had not been won completely. In the process, law was manipulated to be used as an oppressive tool by the local officials. However, without legal intervention at the final stage, and intervention by higher officials, media coverage may not have its impact felt. To capture the above intricacies and dynamics, I interviewed the journalists, lawyers that were directly involved in the case, and sought the views of other journalists and academics in media studies. My argument, sadly, lies in the reality that freedom of the press is heavily dependant on the administrative rank of the media institutions, the rank of the target to be reported and the discretion of the Central Party. Press freedom is a highly volatile political game, a struggle inside and outside media institutions, with boundaries for each round set anew...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{organization}} for action of a power bloc of multinational and associated interests, their policy of disruption of the Brazilian regime which took place from 1961 to 1964, and their subsequent take-over of the State. The thesis does not attempt to present a historical reconstruction of the period. Rather, it aims to bring new evidence {{to bear on the}} little known activity of individuals and organizations which were crucial in shaping the period in question and its aftermath. Chapter I outlines the formation of the populist polity, since the fall of the oligarchic state in 1930. Chapter II describes the economic ascendancy gained by multinational and associated interests throughout the 1950 s under the political aegis of an industrial-oligarchic populist polity. Chapter III describes the corporate-political power structure of multinational and associated interests. The chapter examines the social and political agents who over a period of ten years shaped an incipient bloc of modernizing-conservative interests. The chapter also describes the different political means and <b>administrative</b> <b>channels</b> whereby the multinational and associated bloc was able to press its interests within the populist polity. Chapter IV describes the crisis of populism brought about by the political mobilization of the working classes and the militant action of the multinational and associated interests through their own political organizations. Chapter V examines the recruitment pattern, decision-making structure and organization for action of the organic elite of the multinational and associated interests, organized in IPES/IBAD. Chapter VI describes the ideological campaign of the organic elite against the regime and the working classes, and its attempts to indoctrinate the general public and in particular the dominant classes and the military. Chapter VII examines the political campaign of the organic elite among students, the female population, the middle classes, the peasantry, the industrial working classes, and the political parties.

Acces to anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs, as well as to medicines for treatment of opportunistic infections (TOI), is essential for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to enjoy their right to life and health. Although access to these essentail medicines forms part of the core content of the right to health, which states should be able to provide irrespective of their available resources, slightly {{more than half of the}} people in need in Uganda were accessing them in June 2005.

This is despite the fact that Uganda receives funds from various sources, among which Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GF) and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Although the cost of ARV treatment in Uganda has dramatically decreased since 1997, the price of treatment remains still unaffordable for most Ugandans. [...] . This study comprises five chapters. The present chapter exposes the problem, the objectives of the study and the research questions, reviews the literature available on the subject, outlines the study's structure, proposes a methodology and points out the study's limitations and relevance. Chapter two sets out the international legal framework of the study. It oulines the scope of the right of PLWHA to access to essential treatment under different international instruments of relevance for Uganda and its connection with other human rights. The chapter also assesses the implications of this right for state and non-state actors. Chapter three sets out the national legal, policy and judicial framework. It explores the action taken by the various branches of the government in addressing the international obligations with regard to access essential treatment. This chapter will also look at the role played by other relevant stakeholders in the realisation of this right in Uganda.

40|$|For {{at least}} twenty years the {{thinking}} of wildlife managers has been directed toward the importance of habitat in producing surplus game populations for hunting. The decline or disappearance of game populations - often over considerable areas - following changes in habitat brought about by agricultural, urban, or industrial developments demonstrates clearly {{the effects of the}} elimination of desirable habitat. Suitable habitat is basic to the survival of wildlife. Many field observations and experiences, as well as specific data from research, validate this conclusion. Where a harvestable surplus of game cannot be maintained because of changes made by man in the habitat, the obvious answer is: Restore the habitat. There are many practical and fundamental challenges to this objective. As this principle gained support, funds needed for habitat improvement were made available to the states with the enactment of the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration (Pittman-Robertson) Act of 1937 State Fish and Game Departments immediately began or expanded studies on the ecology and management of wildlife species, and projects designed to restore habitat soon were initiated. After a general curtailment of these programs during World War II, the states reactivated or initiated more extensive programs after 1945. By 1951 the majority had made habitat improvement a major feature of their programs. Much of the emphasis in habitat restoration has been placed on farm-game species. There are several reasons for this-both basic and superficial. When conditions are favorable to wildlife, fertile agricultural areas are highly productive of farm game. Species in this classification have a high reproductive potential and a relatively low mobility. As expressed in the annual hunter-kill reports of most states, farm game is more readily available to a larger number of hunters than other classes of wildlife. The existence of a land-use program through soil conservation districts creates convenient <b>administrative</b> <b>channels.</b> Although six years is a short time to show results in any program dealing with ecological changes, the present report outlines the conclusions reached in an attempt to evaluate current farm-game habitat development programs in fifteen states. Actually to these six years must be added the experiences accumulated from about 1933 through 1945, even though the earlier activities may have been more sporadic and piece-meal than since that time. The work was carried out between October 1, 1951 and June 30, 1952 and the following states were visited: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri...|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{will examine}} how one {{particular}} state institution, {{state attorneys general}} (SAGs), has operated within {{a unique set of}} institutional and political constraints to create state-based regulation with nationwide impact in policy areas including consumer protection, antitrust, environmental regulation, and securities regulation. This state-based regulation casts doubt on one of the principle rationales advanced in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s anticommandeering line of cases for limiting federal power; namely, that such a move enhances electoral accountability, a concept central to our democracy. If in the absence of federal regulation a series of narrowly accountable state-based actors can create nationwide regulation in a non-legislative fashion, accountability cannot continue to be a coherent justification for a revival of judicially-enforced federalism. While this critique of accountability is not an argument for untrammeled federal regulatory authority, it does call into question the empirical accuracy of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s assumptions about how state and federal institutions interact with each other to promote democratic and constitutional values. This Comment will proceed in five parts. Part I will briefly review the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism jurisprudence in the last fifteen years, focusing on the accountability rationale for limiting the power of the federal government. The next three parts will examine the political and institutional environment that permits SAGs to cooperate in regulatory litigation. Part II examines the state-based institutional constraints under which SAGs typically operate. While SAGs have much in common with each other, the variations in these structures between states will in part account for the actual way in which any given SAG regulatory scheme evolves. Part III draws on empirical work by political scientists to explore the ideas developed in Part II {{in the context of the}} tobacco litigation of the 19902 ̆ 7 s. Part III also begins the discussion of the incentives for SAGs to cooperate with each other. Part IV expands on the federal dimension of SAG cooperation. Finally, Part V argues that the use of regulation through litigation by SAGs undermines democratic accountability in at least two ways. First, regulation by a group of states that has nationwide effects denies the citizens of other states the opportunity to influence the regulatory process. This denial of political access undercuts the accountability rationale. Second, regulation accomplished through litigation is more difficult to overturn than regulation accomplished through legislative or <b>administrative</b> <b>channels,</b> making it less responsive to political changes. Thus, SAG regulation can be less politically accountable over time, as well as across states...|$|R

It is observed that, although the current water reforms in the country focus on the use of statutory legal systems to regulate the use of water resources, the country operates under a plural legal system. Apart from the statutory laws, diverse customary systems are relied upon in resolving water-related conflicts, and, neglect of these norms and laws may have negative consequences {{for the majority of the}} villagers who rely on them. The paper presents some of the water-related conflicts in the study areas and the views of government authorities and river basin managers regarding customary norms and laws for water resource management. Also, the paper describes how different types of conflicts over water resources are handled through customary, <b>administrative</b> and legal <b>channels...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the exercise of power and the politics related to it in the reform and change processes that have been carried out in a bureaucratic organization that belongs to the public administration. The study attempts to find out what happens when reforms deal with paradigrnatic models of activity that are related to bureaucratic procedures, and which factors activate resistance to change and in what conditions activity based on rational decision-making is maintained. This is a multiple-case study. The cases (4) dealt with the core functions and supportive functions of the Finnish Defense Forces. The basic material of the cases was formed out of notes the author had made on personal experiences; the notes have been supplemented with relevant document material. The cases took place between 1987 and 1999. Bureaucracy theory was used as the theoretical fl=ework, and on this basis the cases were analyzed from four different viewpoints: rational and incremental viewpoints and the viewpoints of power and interpretation. The cases showed that the better a reform can be justified {{with the help of the}} prevailing organization culture, the better the reform is accepted. Conceming the behavior of the actors, the study showed that officials, using various political and <b>administrative</b> <b>channels,</b> tend to try to break up decisions unfavorable to them. The institutional power exercised by the highest body of officials, allied with different interest groups, p-oved to be a strong opposing force to a minister exercising political power. The intertwining of rational strivings and bureaucratic politics meant that decisions in the change processes described by the cases began to tum into random outcomes of "various games". The organizations being studied acted strongly to interventions directed at their areas of operations. In all cases, an influential characteristic turned out to be interpretation and the incremental progression of changes. The cases can be seen to have shown that in refonns directed at the paradigrnatic models of activity in the defense administration a successful execution requires the ability and means to penetrate three paradigmatic walls that reject change. These walls are the wall of bureaucracy, the wall of military culture and the wall of professionalism. In the rational progression of the change process, a critical factor was found to be the top leadership's shared view of scenarios, visions and strategies as well as the principies of the management of change. The study showed that when reforins touch upon paradigrnatic models of activity related to bureaucratic procedures, the generation and management of a refortn project without the commitment of political decision-makers and the top body of officials brings with it phenomena and procedures related to bureaucratic politics. The cases also show that in change situations there is reason to pay attention not only to structures and organizations, but also to the attitudes of the individual and also that a change situation must also be approached from a psychological point of view. The development of change management in the defense administration requires the finding of the means and tools needed to break the prevailing paradigmatic walls and procedural reforms related to the execution of change. The study showed that when managing deepreaching changes that touch upon the entire field of administration, the behavior and activities of the minister become decisively important faetors. The minister can therefore be seen as a value leader and in this role he must become strongly involved in the game of bureaucratic politics played by officials. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{twenty years}} since 1989 have brought two major {{developments}} in worker activism. First, whereas workers {{were part of}} the mass uprising in the Tiananmen movement, albeit as subordinate partners to the students, labor activism since then has been almost entirely confined to the working class. While the ranks of aggrieved workers have proliferated (expanding from workers in the state-owned sector to include migrant workers) and the forms and incidents of labor activism have multiplied, there is hardly any sign of mobilization that transcends class or regional lines. Second, we observe that a long-term decline in worker power at the point of production – power that was previously institutionalized in skill hierarchies, union representation, democratic management, permanent or long-term employment, and other conditions of service constitutive of the socialist social contract - is going on even as workers gain more power (at least on paper) outside the workplace. New labor laws have broadened workers 2 ̆ 7 rights and expanded <b>administrative</b> and judicial <b>channels</b> for resolving labor conflicts. These legal and bureaucratic procedures have atomized and depoliticized labor activism even as they have engendered and intensified mobilization outside official limits...|$|R
40|$|The {{motion picture}} {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} a dynamic market environment, limited shelf space and product category management, and consequently, complex channel contracts specifying the split of box office revenue between distributors and exhibitors. Although such a contracting practice creates a considerable <b>administrative</b> effort and <b>channel</b> conflict, {{it is not clear whether}} such complexity is necessary for superior channel performance. This study investigates this question by analyzing the impact of movie contract structure on movie scheduling and channel member profitability. We develop and analyze a game-theoretic model using the genetic algorithm approach and a decision support system,, to capture strategic behaviors of channel members in a complex market environment. We find that simpler two-part tariff or 50 / 50 split contracts perform as well as the current contracts. Thus, the complexity of the market environment need not be reflected in the complexity of the channel contracts. Channel contract structure has significant impact on channel member profitability and the exhibitor's movie-scheduling behavior. In particular, our results indicate that the flat rate contract structure represents an attractive alternative to the current practice for distributors. channel contracts, movie industry, game theory...|$|R
40|$|The {{internationalisation}} {{of higher}} education is a global phenomenon. In China, both {{the government and the}} universities have been moving rapidly towards internationalisation. This thesis investigated the internationalisation of a university in northwestern China using a grounded theory approach. Research questions involved the perceptions of university faculty members on government policies and internationalisation initiatives as well as their understandings of internationalisation processes in the University. A Cyclical Change Model was devised upon Lewin’s (1947) Three Step Model of change. The combination of Cyclical Change Model and Knight’s (1994) six phase Cycle of Internationalisation was employed as the framework of this investigation. Participants from different schools and various positions in the University were selected for interview. National, provincial and university documents were collected and analysed for data triangulation. Findings of the research indicate that the University is still at the beginning of internationalisation. The government as the ultimate funding source and policy-maker directed the course of internationalisation. Different levels of the University demonstrated different understandings of internationalisation. Organisational changes were identified as key approaches to internationalisation. Nevertheless, the University lacks certain essential features of internationalisation, staff members with international experience and international students. Further, due to the administrative procedures and organisational weaknesses the University has not produced a comprehensive strategic plan for internationalisation. The competition from other universities for qualified and experienced staff with international qualifications and experience has led to a number of highly qualified staff moving to more attractive settings. Findings suggest that university internationalisation would be more effective if staff perspectives and priorities were considered in the development of focused internationalisation strategies. The importance of an effective <b>administrative</b> communication <b>channel</b> to keep different levels of the University aligned on internationalisation policies and initiatives is considered essential.
