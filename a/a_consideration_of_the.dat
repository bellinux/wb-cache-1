5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purpose of one's life and {{the relationship with the}} rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E

Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E

5|$|Varner then {{considers}} {{a range of}} proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; factory farming, for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all other}} {{cultures}} of Mesoamerica, the Maya used a 260-day calendar, usually {{referred to as}} tzolkin.

25|$|This pessimism {{has been}} {{tempered}} by research. Studies by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi of NASA's Ames Research Center in California {{have shown that}} a planet's atmosphere (assuming it included greenhouse gases CO2 and H2O) need only be 100 mbs, or 10% of Earth's atmosphere, for the star's heat to be effectively carried to the night side. This is well within the levels required for photosynthesis, though water would still remain frozen on the dark side in some of their models. Martin Heath of Greenwich Community College, has shown that seawater, too, could be effectively circulated without freezing solid if the ocean basins were deep enough to allow free flow beneath the night side's ice cap. Further research—including <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount of photosynthetically active radiation—suggested that tidally locked planets in red dwarf systems might at least be habitable for higher plants.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{itself is}} sited {{in an unusual}} {{location}} – the unevenness of the terrain, which was riddled with small streams and natural springs, would seem to render it unsuitable for such a large dwelling. It is thought, however, that these springs would have been harnessed into water features in stylised gardens, and that a cult of water nymphs may have been cultivated around this, although this is supposition. To cope with the difficult terrain, the building itself was constructed on four terraces, cut into the hillside and heavily buttressed, which are still evident on the gallery connecting the two main wings of the house. The architectural design of the villa differs greatly from similar dwellings from the same period, given that the main living quarters were in the large eastern wing, and a long gallery of little function connected this wing with the ‘leisure wing’ where the bath house and temple were located. This layout reflects {{the evolution of the}} house over time—the bath house wing was a later expansion—and <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spatial restrictions of the site.|$|E
25|$|Oldenberg (1894) {{surmised that}} the concept of Ṛta {{originally}} arose in the Indo-Aryan period from <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural order of the world and of the occurrences taking place within it as doing so with a kind of causal necessity. Both Vedic Ṛta and Avestan aša were conceived of as having a tripartite function which manifested itself in the physical, ethical and ritual domains. In the context of Vedic religion, those features of nature which either remain constant or which occur on a regular basis were seen to be a manifestation of the power of Ṛta in the physical cosmos. In the human sphere, Ṛta was understood to manifest itself as the imperative force behind both the moral order of society as well as the correct performance of Vedic rituals. The notion of a universal principle of natural order is by no means unique to the Vedas, and Ṛta has been compared to similar ideas in other cultures, such as Ma'at in Ancient Egyptian religion, Moira and the Logos in Greek paganism, and the Tao.|$|E

500|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) {{and the relationship between}} the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Sentient animals, Cochrane argues, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed. Whether these prima facie rights translate into concrete rights depends on the situation in question. Cochrane explores the consequences of the account in his Animal Rights Without Liberation, arguing that, with very few exceptions, nonhuman animals have a concrete rights not to be killed or made to suffer in animal testing, animal agriculture, in entertainment, for environmental purposes and in cultural practices. Despite this, because Cochrane does not posit a right against use for nonhuman animals, his account is highly permissive when contrasted with other animal rights accounts. In a 2016 article, Cochrane extended his interest-based rights approach to include labour rights for nonhuman animals, on the basis that working animals are members of our society and workers. These rights include a right to representation in a union, a right to [...] "just and favourable remuneration", a right to safe and healthy conditions of work, and a right to time off from work.|$|E
500|$|According to Volk, books two {{and three}} {{primarily}} deal with the finer details of the zodiac. Book two opens with a preface in which Manilius presents {{a brief history of}} hexameter poetry, singling out Homer and Hesiod. His purpose, he argues, is not to insert himself into this poetic tradition, but to emphasize the uniqueness of his poem in comparison to others. According to Manilius, [...] "Every path that leads to Helicon has been trodden" [...] (omnis ad accessus Heliconos semita trita est; all other topics have been covered) and he must find [...] "untouched meadows and water" [...] (integra ... prata ... undamque) for his poetry: astrology. Manilius ends the book's preface with the assertion [...] "that the divine cosmos is voluntarily revealing itself both to mankind as a whole and to the poet in particular" [...] and, because his poetic mission has been sanctioned by fate, he is set apart from the crowd. The poet then begins his explanation of the first astrologically significant circle: the zodiac itself. He first considers the signs of the zodiac (viz. Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces), before moving on to the aspects and relationships between the signs and other objects. In this section, the poet briefly discusses the correspondences between the zodiac signs and the Olympian gods, as well as the relationship between zodiac signs and parts of the body. The Astronomica then considers dodecatemoria before a digression about the didactic method. The book concludes with <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second astrologically significant circle, that of the fixed circle of the observer. The last few lines are dedicated to an overview of the dodecatropos.|$|E
500|$|The {{doctrine}} of wrongful delegation is sometimes {{said to be}} a reflection of the Latin maxim delegatus non potest delegare (a delegate cannot appoint another), which means that a body to which or person to whom power was delegated by Parliament cannot further delegate the power to another. Academics have submitted that the maxim does not state a rule of law, but is [...] "at most a rule of construction" [...] and in applying it to a statute [...] "there, of course must be <b>a</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language of the whole enactment and of its purposes and objects". Thus, in reality, there is no such principle as delegatus non potest delegare; the maxim plays no real part in the decision of cases but is sometimes used as a convenient label. Consequently, in most cases the courts have adopted such a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern governmental agencies. For statutory powers, the important question is whether it is intended that a power conferred upon A may be exercised on A's authority by B. The maxim is merely the pencil with which the court is able to draw the line between authorized and unauthorized sub-delegation, and the courts must then ask whether statutory discretion remains {{in the hands of the}} proper authority, or whether some other person purports to exercise it. Thus where an Act said that an inspector of nuisances [...] "may procure any sample" [...] of goods for analysis, it was held that the inspector might validly send his assistant to buy a sample of coffee, as he had in no way authorized his assistant to exercise the discretion legally reposed in himself. Ultimately, the courts must decide the issue based on what Parliament has authorized according to what may be summarized as the language, scope and objects of the empowering statute.|$|E
