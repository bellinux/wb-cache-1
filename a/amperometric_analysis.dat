For amperometric analaysis, the reduction current of 3, 5, 3 ’, 5 ’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was measured at the potential of - 50 mV and the correlation between the reduction current and the OD value was estimated to be 28 nA/OD and the limit of detection was calculated to be 0. 07 in OD unit. In this work, an immunoassay was prepared by immobilizing anti-HRP antibodies to E. coli cells with autodisplayed Z-domains and the <b>amperometric</b> <b>analysis</b> was demonstrated the quantification of bound HRP.

40|$|An enzyme-based flow-injection <b>amperometric</b> <b>analysis</b> system (FIA) for {{monitoring}} of uric acid and glucose is described, The oxidase and peroxidase enzymes are physically co-immobilised in a sandwich-type reactor and ferrocene {{serves as a}} mediator.

The high selectivity (ascorbic acid did not interfere) is coupled to high sensitivity (a detection limit of 30 and 60 nmol/l for uric acid and glucose, respectively; signal/noise = 3) and good stability (the enzymes remained active for more than 6 weeks at 30 degrees C), The usefulness of the assay in clinical chemistry is illustrated by the measurement of human serum uric acid and glucose concentration.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} nucleation {{and growth}} of Co onto (111) textured Cu film on monocrystalline Si was studied. Nucleation experiments were carried out depositing Co from pH 6 sulfamate solutions by standard electrochemical methods. AFM and SEM were used to characterize nuclei distribution and morphology. The nucleation mechanism was qualitatively probed by comparing experimental current transients to theoretical transients according to the Sharifker et Hills model. The type of nucleation mechanism is apparently related to the Co concentration and the overpotential. Increase of either cathodic potential or Co concentration causes a shift from instantaneous to progressive nucleation. The results of the <b>amperometric</b> <b>analysis</b> were not confirmed unequivocally by morphological examination of Co deposits. The mechanism of Co nucleation from simple sulfamate solution on Si/Cu(111) substrate is instantaneous in nature. Highly (00. 1) textured Co deposits can be obtained in these conditions, though not necessarily with preservation of the fine columnar microstructure...|$|E

Annotation of oxidized species in HPAEC-generated chromatograms was based on published elution patterns of C 1 /C 4 -oxidized cello-oligosaccharides (Bennati-Granier et al. 2015; Isaksen et al. 2014; Westereng et al. 2017). Chromatogram patterns did not detect any peaks corresponding to aldono-lactone products (C 1 oxidation). Enzyme reactions without ascorbic acid did not show formation of oxidized or native cello-oligomers (data not shown).|$|R

The waste cinder {{was found to}} be a composite of calcium and iron silicates similar to glass matrix by Xray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) study. The hybrid PB formations were confirmed by both FT-IR and electrochemical methods.

The self-assembled PB hybrid on the cinder-modified screen-printed electrodes (designated as PBCFe*-SPE) improved linear detection range and sensitivity for H 2 O 2 mediated oxidation than those obtained at a classical PB-SPE in 0. 1 M, pH 2 KCl/HCl base electrolyte at 0. 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) by <b>amperometric</b> batch <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{combined}} in vitro <b>amperometric,</b> optical <b>analysis</b> of fluorescent false neurotransmitters and microdialysis techniques to unveil that cocaine and methylphenidate induced a marked {{depression of the}} synaptic release of dopamine (DA) in mouse striatum. In contrast to the classical dopamine transporter (DAT) -dependent enhancement of the dopaminergic signal observed at concentrations of cocaine lower than 3 μM, the inhibitory effect of cocaine was found at concentrations higher than 3 μM. The paradoxical inhibitory effect of cocaine and methylphenidate {{was associated with a}} decrease in synapsin phosphorylation. Interestingly, a cocaine-induced depression of DA release was only present in cocaine-insensitive animals (DAT-CI). Similar effects of cocaine were produced by methylphenidate in both wild-type and DAT-CI mice. On the other hand, nomifensine only enhanced the dopaminergic signal either in wild-type or in DAT-CI mice. Overall, these results indicate that cocaine and methylphenidate can increase or decrease DA neurotransmission by blocking reuptake and reducing the exocytotic release, respectively. The biphasic reshaping of DA neurotransmission could contribute to different behavioral effects of psychostimulants, including the calming ones, in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder...|$|R

Under UV irradiation, {{the rates of}} the oxidative polymerization of EDOT monomer along with the reduction of Pt 4 + ions were accelerated. In addition, the morphology of PtNPs was also greatly influenced by the UV irradiation; the size of PtNPs was reduced under UV irradiation, which {{can be attributed to}} the faster nucleation rate. The immobilized PtNPs showed excellent electrocatalytic activities towards the electroreduction of hydrogen peroxide. The resultant amperometric sensor showed enhanced sensitivity for the detection of H 2 O 2 as compared to that without PtNPs, i.e., only with a layer of PEDOT. Amperometric determination of H 2 O 2 at − 0.55 V gave a limit of detection of 1.6 μM (S / N[*]=[*] 3) and a sensitivity of 19.29 mA cm− 2 M− 1 up to 6 mM, with a response time (steady state, t 95) of 30 to 40 s.

40|$|Membrane fusion is {{a process}} that intimately {{involves}} both proteins and lipids. Although the SNARE proteins, which ultimately overcome the energy barrier for fusion, have been extensively studied, regulation of the energy barrier itself, determined by specific membrane lipids, has been largely overlooked. Our findings reveal a novel function for SNARE proteins in reducing the energy barrier for fusion, by directly binding and sequestering fusogenic lipids to sites of fusion. We demonstrate a specific interaction between Syntaxin 1 A and the fusogenic lipid phosphatidic acid, in addition to multiple polyphosphoinositide lipids, and define a polybasic juxtamembrane region within Syntaxin 1 A as its lipid-binding domain. In PC- 12 cells, Syntaxin 1 A mutations that progressively reduced lipid binding resulted in a progressive reduction in evoked secretion. Moreover, <b>amperometric</b> <b>analysis</b> of fusion events driven by a lipid-binding–deficient Syntaxin 1 A mutant (5 RK/A) demonstrated alterations in fusion pore dynamics, suggestive of an energetic defect in secretion. Overexpression of the phosphatidic acid–generating enzyme, phospholipase D 1, completely rescued the secretory defect seen with the 5 RK/A mutant. Moreover, knockdown of phospholipase D 1 activity drastically reduced control secretion, while leaving 5 RK/A-mediated secretion relatively unaffected. Altogether, these data suggest that Syntaxin 1 A–lipid interactions are a critical determinant of the energetics of SNARE-catalyzed fusion events...|$|E

This discovery impacts on the design of implantable biosensors where electrodeposited polymers, such as PPD, are commonly used as the permselective barrier to block electroactive interference by reducing agents present in the target medium. The undesirable “edge effect” was particularly marked for small disk electrodes which have a high edge density (ratio of PPD-insulation edge length to electrode area), but was essentially absent for cylinder electrodes with a length of > 0. 2 mm.

40|$|Many {{bacterial}} species produce capsular polysaccharides {{that contribute}} to pathogenesis through evasion of the host innate immune system. The gram-positive pathogen Enterococcus faecalis was previously reported to produce one of four capsule serotypes (A, B, C, or D). Previous studies describing the four capsule serotypes of E. faecalis were based on immunodetection methods; however, the underlying genetics of capsule production did not fully support these findings. Previously, it was shown that capsule production for serotype C (Maekawa type 2) was dependent {{on the presence of}} nine open reading frames (cpsC to cpsK). Using a novel genetic system, we demonstrated that seven of the nine genes in the cps operon are essential for capsule production, indicating that serotypes A and B do not make a capsular polysaccharide. In support of this observation, we showed that serotype C and D capsule polysaccharides mask lipoteichoic acid from detection by agglutinating antibodies. Furthermore, we determined that the genetic basis for the difference in antigenicity between serotypes C and D is the presence of cpsF in serotype C strains. High-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed <b>amperometric</b> detection <b>analysis</b> of serotype C and D capsules indicated that cpsF is responsible for glucosylation of serotype C capsular polysaccharide in E. faecalis...|$|R

These factors include the extent of functionalization of acid-treated CNT (fCNT), the fCNT content, and the acid type used to prepare the films. The CV results revealed that the fCNT in the fCNT/CS-cast film exhibited electrocatalytic activity to redox reactions of Fe(CN) 6 3 -/ 4 -used as a probe. The fCNT (having a COOH content 2. 51 mmol/ 100 g sample) exhibited a higher electrocatalytic activity than the untreated CNT and the fCNT 1 (having a COOH content 158. 50 mmol/ 100 g sample). Among the four acids, citric acid exhibited the most uniform fCNT dispersion in the CS film, {{which resulted in the}} highest electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, HCl resulted in a brittle fCNT/CS film and a negligible electrocatalytic activity. The fCNT/CS 2 / 10 film exhibited a higher electrocatalytic activity than the fCNT/CS 1 / 10 and 3 / 10 films.

Oxox has been isolated from a number of sources, however there is significant variation in the information available. Prior to the purification of Oxox, the properties of commercially available Sigma Aldrich Ltd. Oxox were researched. An optimum enzymatic assay, substrate specificity, optimum buffer and optimum pH for Sigma Oxox were investigated prior to its purification. The purification of the enzyme led to the finding that Sigma Oxox was unstable in a number of salt buffers, and insoluble. To determine the ability of this enzyme to detect oxalate, <b>amperometric</b> <b>analysis</b> was undertaken, which demonstrated the Sigma Oxox based sensors’ reusability and reproducibility. Oxox from barley roots was successfully purified using a five step purification protocol, the findings obtained were in accordance with those published. The barley root extracts, after each purification procedure, were analysed amperometrically and highlighted the requirement for purification to optimise the analytical signal. Over 140 sources were screened from a number of plant families, to detect the presence of Oxox activity. Three possible sources of Oxox were identified by level of Oxox activity and chosen for further purification: cabbage, carrot and mint leaves. The presence of Oxox in different varieties of these sources varied, illustrating the dissimilarities in Oxox, confirming the diversity of the data available on Oxox. Oxox from cabbage, carrot and mint leaves were purified using the standardised protocol employed during the purification of Sigma and barley root Oxox.

The selective binding of charge dense metal ions is a relatively mature area of research that relies upon matching the donor atom, coordination number and geometric preferences of the cation with {{the structure of the}} ligand. For 'onium ions, such as R-NH 3 +, NMe 4 + and the guanidinium cation, (NH 2) 3 C+, the positive charge is delocalised over several atoms, giving a charge diffuse species. With the tetramethylammonium ion, for example, an approximate MNDO calculation indicates that 72 % of the positive charge is distributed over the 12 peripheral hydrogen atoms. In seeking to bind such charge diffuse cations, therefore, particular attention must be paid to size complementarity and binding interactions to a synthetic receptor must involve multiple hydrogen bonding. Most of the published work relating to the complexation of tetraalkylammonium ions has tended to focus upon anionic cavitands in which electrostatic attraction probably dominates the binding (1, 2, 3). With the exception of certain n-electron rich macrocyclic ligands (4, 5), most of the neutral ionophores that have been developed to bind ammonium ions only complex primary ammonium ions. Chiral crown ethers, for example, bind certain arylammonium ions enantioselectively (6, 7, 8), but the chemoselectivity is modest (severe interference from Na+ or K+) and N-alkylation compromises the N-H [...] . 0 hydrogen bonding...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{miniaturized}} {{amperometric analyzer}} with enhanced performance {{was developed to}} meet the need of field-portable, wide adaptable, user friendly, and cost effective electrochemical detection in various application fields. Based on the new MSP 430 FG 479 microcontroller, the embedded system was designed to either operate as a stand-alone unit with an on-board fool-proof user interface, or run on the user's PC for advanced data <b>analysis.</b> <b>Amperometric</b> detection is a powerful experimental approach for the study of electro-active compounds with clinical, industrial, environmental and agricultural importance. Inside the amperometric analyzer, a mini-potentiostat is designed to interface with a wide spectrum of electrochemical sensors. Implemented with grounded-auxillary electrode configuration, the mini-potentiostat controls oxidationreduction reactions of target analytes at the working electrode surface by accurately maintaining a preset potential between the working (WE) and the reference electrode (RE), while measuring the redox current response at the auxillary electrode (AE) using a low-side resistive sensing mechanism. In an unstirred solution, at steady state, the rate of electron transfer is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant. Therefore, the steady state current is used as an accurate measure of the analyte concentration in the sample. Constructed using off-the-shelf IC chips and powered by a single 3 V lithium coin cell battery, the potentiostat circuitry inside the amperometric analyzer is designed to meet potential control and current detection requirements for most existing electrochemical sensors. Featured with sub-picoampere sensitive, wide span and high accuracy current sensing, the specially designed current sensing block not only covers general application requirements, but it can also serve as a powerful tool in research efforts toward the next generation of ultra-sensitive detection systems in biomolecular sensing. In addition to the superior electrochemical related specifications, various lowpower design techniques have been applied to ensure a prolonged battery life, therefore making the system an ideal platform for amperometric monitoring in field appropriate applications. Confirmed with a systematic evaluation of the device prototype, the system features a 4 -month battery life with a single 3 V lithium battery (220 mAh), accurate bidirectional redox potential control from - 1. 2 V to + 1. 2 V, high resolution current detection from ± 5 pA to ± 1 mA covered by 4 software selectable detection levels, improved stability unaffected by electrochemical sensor impedance, and high EMI immunity without external shielding. Finally, electrochemical analyses were also conducted using the device prototype. For a constant potential amperometric experiment, the experimental results of the system were compared with a standard bench top electrochemical workstation (the BAS Epsilon). Excellent agreement was attained over the whole detection range, which demonstrates the excellent potential control and current sensing abilities of the amperometric analyzer...|$|R
