40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} k-anonymity has been {{proposed}} as {{an effective way to}} anonymise microdata, where every record in the <b>anonymised</b> <b>microdata</b> must be related to at least k other records or individuals. However, it is possible to infer sensitive information from microdata that satisfies k-anonymity in situations where the values of the sensitive attributes are not diverse. In this paper, we discuss this limitation of k-anonymity and propose an anonymisation approach to overcome this limitation by combining k-anonymisation with association rule hiding. The proposed anonymisation approach not only ensures that we cannot infer sensitive data when there is lack of diversity in sensitive values, but it also provides the additional advantage of enhanced privacy, by hiding sensitive association rules...|$|E
40|$|If you are {{thinking}} about undertaking research {{on the lives of}} children and their families, why not consider using data that has been collected in Growing Up in Ireland? What are the key elements of Growing Up in Ireland? •	Growing Up in Ireland includes TWO COHORTS, and infant cohort (beginning at nine months) and a child cohort (beginning at nine years) •	Growing Up in Ireland includes TWO WAVES OF DATA COLLECTION of the infant cohort (at nine months and three years) and of the child cohort (at nine and 13 years) •	Growing Up in Ireland collects data from MULTIPLE INFORMANTS including parents (both resident and non-resident), teachers, principals and childcare providers. •	Growing Up in Ireland includes both QUANTITATIVE and QUALITATIVE studies. •	Growing Up in Ireland provides access to data to support applied and academic research. What data can be accessed? Data from the FIRST WAVES OF DATA COLLECTED from the infant cohort and child cohort are now available. There are approximately 11, 100 children in the infant cohort for the quantitative study and 120 children in the infant cohort for the qualitative study. There are approximately 8, 500 children in the child cohort for the quantitative study and 120 children in the child cohort for the qualitative study. How can the QUANTITATIVE DATA be accessed? Two types of Growing up in Ireland quantitative data files can be accessed: <b>Anonymised</b> <b>Microdata</b> Files and Researcher Microdata Files. The <b>Anonymised</b> <b>Microdata</b> File (AMF) is a publicly available anonymised dataset. Researchers wishing to access the AMF should apply to the Irish Social Science Data Archive (ISSDA) at www. ucd. ie/issda The Researcher Microdata File (RMF) is a more detailed dataset. Access to the RMF is subject to appointment of the researcher as an Officer of Statistics by the Central Statistics Office, meaning that the reseracher is subject to the full rigour and penalties of the Statistics Act, 1993. Researchers wishing to access the RMF should apply to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs at www. dcya. ie How can the QUALITATIVE DATA be accessed? The Growing Up in Ireland qualitative data file is also a publicly available anonymised dataset. Researchers wishing to access the qualitative data file should apply to the Irish Qualitative Data Archive (IQDA) at www. iqda. i...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the {{the development of}} a customised computer software package for easing the analysis of the 1991 Sample of Anonymised Records. The resulting USAR package is designed to be portable within the unix environment. It offers a number of features such as interactive table design, intelligent data interpretation and fuzzy query. Finally, an example of SAR analysis is provided. 1 Background A major UK census milestone was reached in 1993 with the release of Britain's first ever, official, sample of <b>anonymised</b> census <b>microdata.</b> In fact this amounts to a 3 % sample of the 1991 census being released in anonymous form, without any names and addresses and only coded to large geographical areas. This followed almost a decade of discussion and debate about the content, need and confidentiality aspects of possible microdata from the census. The key needs case is contained in Marsh et al (1991) and a broad description of the SAR itself is provided in Marsh and Teague (1992), Mars [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The author {{presents}} {{evidence of}} a relationship between household employment structure and relative rates of mobility. She draws on Census of Population data for 1981 and 1991 from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study and cross-sectional Sample of <b>Anonymised</b> Records <b>microdata</b> for 1991. These data are used to demonstrate the shifts in household employment composition, by region, for a subpopulation of 'nuclear family' households. The results indicate that households {{with more than one}} earner demonstrate a lower propensity to be spatially mobile than do 'traditional' male-breadwinner households. The implication is that differential opportunities and constraints, which are conferred by residential location and all forms of mobility [...] residential, occupational, and sociospatial [...] operate, at least in part, as a function of household employment structure and the evolution of household structure across both time (the life course) and space (home and work locations). The author opens up the analysis of Census of Population data to issues both of intrahousehold and of interhousehold mobility as a means of sensitising migration research to issues which call for further in-depth qualitative investigation. ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the second}} of two reports on the {{structure}} of families in Ireland based primarily on a detailed analysis of census data. Both reports uncover new findings on evolving family structures and aim to shed light on the various driving forces behind that evolution. The first report (Lunn, Fahey and Hannan, 2009) was mainly based on an analysis of individual records within Census 2006. The present report offers a more complete household?level analysis which permits issues to be examined that were previously beyond quantitative investigation. The basis ofthe analysisis a transformation ofthe 4. 4 million individual records from Census 2006 into a set of just over one million recordsthat contain details on family structure for each enumerated family. Access to the <b>anonymised</b> 2006 Census <b>microdata</b> was granted by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) under a formal agreement, on location and under controlled conditions. Although the findings obviously relate to 2006, many of the results give insightsinto longer?term changesin family structuresthat have evolved over decades and will remain relevant for years after the survey was conducted. In this sense, they help to establish a context in which some of the findings of Census 2011, especially those relating to family structures and fertility,might be considered. The report concentrates on four research topics made more accessible by this manipulation of the census microdata: (1) The extentto which partners have similar backgrounds, versus the extent to which couples cross social boundaries; (2) The rapid growth in and consequentrole of cohabitation; (3) The family circumstances of children; and (4) Patterns of fertility. Unless otherwise indicated, all findings below relate to 2006...|$|R
40|$|With {{the data}} of the de facto {{anonymised}} Income Tax Statistics 1998 (FAST 98), the German official statistics are {{for the first time}} publishing microdata from the field of fiscal statistics. The scientific community can use these data to analyse politically-relevant questions on the fiscal and transfer system at their own workplace, subject to the premises of article 16 subsection 6 of the Law on Statistics for Federal Purposes, on the basis of "real" assessment data. Passing on individual data to the scientific community is only possible in a de facto anonymised form. This form may impair possibilities for scientific analysis possibilities. So that anonymised data can nevertheless be used by the scientific community, anonymisation must meet two equal challenges: It must firstly guarantee adequate protection of the individual items of data, and secondly it must optimally conserve the possibilities for analysis of the anonymised data. In order to achieve the right balance between these two goals, the Statistical Offices have involved potential scientific users in the anonymisation work in a research project. In the article entitled "De facto <b>anonymised</b> <b>microdata</b> file on income tax statistics 1998 ", in addition to the anonymisation concept the framework conditions of the project are explained and the analysis possibilities of income tax statistics demonstrated. ...|$|E
