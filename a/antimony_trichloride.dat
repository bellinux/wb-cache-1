50|$|Four allotropes of {{antimony}} are known: {{a stable}} metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Elemental antimony is a brittle, silver-white shiny metalloid. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a trigonal cell, isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of <b>antimony</b> <b>trichloride.</b> When scratched {{with a sharp}} implement, an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor. It has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100 °C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of stibine (SbH3) at −90 °C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.|$|E

40|$|RECENT {{work has}} shown that the fat-soluble, growth-promoting factors {{measured}} as vitamin A, of plant and animal source are not identical chemical compounds. Consequently, any chemical test cannot be applicable to the growth-promoting substance from both sources. How ever the <b>antimony</b> <b>trichloride</b> test suggested by Carr and Price (1) may be used under certain conditions for the determination of vitamin A in animal oils such as cod liver oil. In previous papers of this series (2) it has been pointed out that both the colorimetrie and biological assays of vitamin A must be carefully stand ardized in order to obtain consistent and comparable results. As the color produced by the action of <b>antimony</b> <b>trichloride</b> reagent on a cod liver oil is not a linear function of the amount of oil used in the test, comparison of the colors produced by two different oils at any given concentration or between the color produced directly by an oil, and the feeding experiments on the same oil, cannot be compared. Comparison can only be made where the color may be considered as a linear function of the amount of the oil taken for the test. It has been previously shown that the tangent to the dilution curve at the origin may be considered as representing the intensity of color that would be produced if there were no interfering substances present and the color produced were a linear function. In this paper com parison is made with the values calculated from the tangents to the dilu tion curves. In making the comparison of the two methods of assay for vitamin A, the biological assay used was based upon that described in U. S. P. X., in corporating such precautions as have been brought out by recent work and are mentioned in the following discussion of the procedure.

40|$|A new {{analogue}} {{of vitamin}} A, viz., retinoic acid anhydride was prepared, {{for the first}} time, {{by the action of}} thionyl chloride on retinoic acid in benzene containing pyridine. The amhydride was charcterised by its chromatographic properties, elemental analysis, ultraviolet absorption, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral characteristics. The compound could be readily hydrolysed to retinoic acid both by acid and alkali treatments and reduced by lithium aluminium hydride to vitamin A alcohol (retinol). The spectral changes with <b>antimony</b> <b>trichloride</b> reagent were similar to those observed for retinoic acid. The metabolism of retinoic acid anhydride was found to be similar to that of retinoic acic. When administered either orally or intraperitoneally, the compound promotes growth in vitamin A-deficient rats. Time-course experiments revealed that retinoic acid anhydride is converted into retinoic acid by non-enzymatic hydrolysis and thereby exerts its biological activity.
