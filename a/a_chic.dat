25|$|In some {{countries}} such anglicisation {{is seen as}} relatively benign, {{and the use of}} English words may even take on <b>a</b> <b>chic</b> aspect. In Japan, marketing products for the domestic market often involves using English or pseudo-English brand names and slogans. In other countries, anglicisation is seen much more negatively, and there are efforts by public-interest groups and governments to reverse the trend; for example, the Académie française in France insists on the use of French neologisms to describe technological inventions in place of imported English terms.|$|E

[...] The film was never re-released, has never been released in any home video format and is rarely shown on television. Modern critical response has therefore been light, although Tom Milne of Time Out New York dubbed the film a [...] "Delightful screwball parody of the detective thriller...Whale's use of elisions, non-sequiturs and unexpected stresses creates what is virtually a blueprint for the style developed by Robert Altman in and after MASH." [...] The Los Angeles Times, reviewing the film for a 1999 retrospective of Whale's work, found it to be [...] "an amusing trifle, tossed off with considerable wit and skill by Whale" [...] and [...] "pretty good fun if you’re in the mood for <b>a</b> <b>chic,</b> brittle period piece".|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century smoking {{was common}} {{as a symbol}} of simple pleasures; the pipe smoking [...] "noble savage", solemn contemplation by Classical Roman ruins, scenes of an artists {{becoming}} one with nature while slowly toking a pipe. The newly empowered middle class also found a new dimension of smoking as a harmless pleasure enjoyed in smoking saloons and libraries. Smoking a cigarette or a cigar would also become associated with the bohemian, someone who shunned the conservative middle class values and displayed his contempt for conservatism. But this was a pleasure that was to be confined to a male world; women smokers were associated with prostitution and smoking was not considered an activity fit for proper ladies. It was not until the start of the 20th century that smoking women would appear in paintings and photos, giving <b>a</b> <b>chic</b> and charming impression. Impressionists like Vincent van Gogh, who was a pipe smoker himself, would also begin to associate smoking with gloom and fin-du-siècle fatalism.|$|E

After reading the script, she immediately realized this was a part she wanted to do and, during her first meeting with Caron and producer Jay Daniel, remarked that it was reminiscent of a “Hawksian” comedy. [...] The two had no idea what she was talking about, so she suggested they screen Twentieth Century, Bringing Up Baby, and His Girl Friday, three of her favorites, to see how the overlapping dialogue was handled.
