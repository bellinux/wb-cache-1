40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to improve the}} measurement of small team performance within the Army. <b>A</b> <b>provisional</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of team-level performance functions was field-validated; criteria and measures of the functions were developed; and their reliability was examined. The provisional taxonomy, used for observing Army field training exercises, was used to observe three types of Army teams: mortar squads, infantry squads, and assault ribbon bridge platoons. The taxonomy was then revised to include five functions: orientation; resource distribution (load balancing); timing (activity pacing); response coordination; and motivational functions. The first four of these functions were observed in a small-scale laboratory settincy in which briefly trained subjects rated 15 videotaped segments of team activity. The ratings were generally reliable, although there was some acquiescence bias leading raters to rate functions as pref,en...|$|E

These competencies may be leveraged as key input to selecting content for an institutionalized business ethics training program. The focus {{in this paper}} is on the management problem of 'What competencies are important for job performance of business ethics practitioners'. Phase I consisted of developing <b>a</b> <b>provisional</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of business ethics competencies and Phase II involved academic and industry practitioners implicated in business ethics to validate the conceptually developed provisional taxonomy of business ethics competencies to eventually make recommendations regarding the selection of business ethics training content. The contribution to the business ethics competency-based management knowledge that is {{presented in this paper}} is a proposed business ethics competency model and the implications of this model for Canadian practitioners are discussed. ...|$|E

It is a fast changing and maturing field driven by proactive CSPs and industry providers of Revenue Assurance technology and services. Two practice guideline bodies, the TeleManagement Forum and the Global Revenue Assurance Professions Association (GRAPA), have issued various practice guidelines, maturity assessment models, and the first attempts to certify practitioners in this discipline. The discipline, however, lacks a working set of definitions. Industry writing is of commercial value with little contribution from an academic perspective. This study provides <b>a</b> <b>provisional</b> <b>taxonomy</b> as basis for introducing a working' set of definitions to support academic enquiry into the discipline of Revenue Assurance. The study employed Grounded Theory and document analysis techniques to code and analyse data available in the public domain. The result {{is a set of}} grounded concepts, re-conceptualised into a taxonomy, which provides structure to academia as primary users. It is hoped that the proposed taxonomy will provide a common base of understanding, which will guide future dialogue and expansion of the field, with contributions from both industry and academia...|$|E

40|$|The {{vehicle for}} this {{doctoral}} research is Ark, an architectural practice that, having {{passed through the}} AADRL in London, has been returned to New Zealand and the particular lineage of modernist tectonics from which it stems. The research responds to problems that emerged through encounters with two different modes of architectural education: one at the University of Auckland, and the other at the Architectural Association in London. Priority in the design studio at the University of Auckland between 1990 and 1994 was given {{to a kind of}} architectural composition that consisted of parts set in relation to other parts, an approach seen here as typical of work in the field of &lsquo;modernist tectonics&rsquo;. There was little discussion in the studio of the design process that brought parts and relations into being, nor was there discussion of the importance of practices of making, despite the attention given to beautifully made drawings and models. On the other hand, at the Architectural Association&rsquo;s Design Research Laboratory (AADRL) between 2001 and 2003 focus fell on the design process. It foregrounded making with a range of media at different scales in the development of &lsquo;geometric/material systems&rsquo;. These systems were deployed in ways that underlined their capacity for constant adaptation. Design outcomes were just particular configurations of a system at a moment in a continual design process. In the time since, work of this nature has been deemed to belong to the field of &lsquo;parametricism&rsquo;. This research questions and explores whether these two emphases &ndash; respectively, the composition of tectonic parts and the ongoing process of formation &ndash; can be reconciled within the one approach to architectural design. The enquiry progresses through the deployment of a compositional taxonomy that reflects on five of Ark&rsquo;s design projects. It sets out to identify compositional characteristics inherent in the projects through which a dialogue between the tectonic and parametric might be established. The dissertation articulates a story of the work, the research and the practice through two volumes. Ark: <b>A</b> <b>Provisional</b> Compositional <b>Taxonomy</b> presents generalised diagrams about Ark&rsquo;s compositional taxonomy followed by documentation of each project on the terms it establishes. Ark: Pursuing Qualities of Relation is a discussion of design process that reflects on the five projects and the compositional taxonomy itself. The dissertation is accompanied by a video recording titled Ark: pursuing qualities of relation through <b>a</b> <b>provisional</b> compositional <b>taxonomy.</b> It records an exhibition of Ark&rsquo;s work and its presentation to show how each field is informing the other at this stage {{in the life of the}} practice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe human oral {{microbiome}} {{is known}} to {{play a significant role}} in human health and disease. While less well studied, the feline oral microbiome is thought to play a similarly important role. To determine roles oral bacteria play in health and disease, one first has to be able to accurately identify bacterial species present. 16 S rRNA gene sequence information is widely used for molecular identification of bacteria and is also useful for establishing the taxonomy of novel species. The objective of this research was to obtain full 16 S rRNA gene reference sequences for feline oral bacteria, place the sequences in species-level phylotypes, and create a curated 16 S rRNA based taxonomy for common feline oral bacteria. Clone libraries were produced using “universal” and phylum-selective PCR primers and DNA from pooled subgingival plaque from healthy and periodontally diseased cats. Bacteria in subgingival samples were also cultivated to obtain isolates. Full-length 16 S rDNA sequences were determined for clones and isolates that represent 171 feline oral taxa. <b>A</b> <b>provisional</b> curated <b>taxonomy</b> was developed based on the position of each taxon in 16 S rRNA phylogenetic trees. The feline oral microbiome curated taxonomy and 16 S rRNA gene reference set will allow investigators to refer to precisely defined bacterial taxa. <b>A</b> <b>provisional</b> name such as “Propionibacterium sp. feline oral taxon FOT- 327 ” is an anchor to which clone, strain or GenBank names or accession numbers can point. Future next-generation-sequencing studies of feline oral bacteria will be able to map reads to taxonomically curated full-length 16 S rRNA gene sequences...|$|R
40|$|Many people {{recognize}} that governments can play salutary roles {{in relation to}} markets by (a) “overseeing” market behavior from “above,” or (b) supplying foundational “rules of the game” from “below. ” It is probably no accident that these widely recognized roles also sit comfortably with traditional conceptions of government and market, pursuant to which people tend categorically to distinguish between “public” and “private” spheres of activity. There is a third form of government action that receives less attention than forms (a) and (b), however, possibly owing in part to its straddling the traditional public/private divide. We call it the “government as market actor” form, whereby government instrumentalities pursue traditionally “public” ends through traditionally “private” means. Inattention to this pervasive form of government action might signal a theoretical blind spot attending the public/private distinction itself. At least as importantly, however, this inattention also denies us a practical opportunity: it prevents our more fully exploiting the government role in question. This Article, {{part of a larger}} project, aims to encourage fuller theoretical appreciation and wider practical use of the role we identify. It first offers <b>a</b> <b>provisional</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of recurrent forms that the government market actor role appears to take, affording a wealth of illustrative case studies in so doing. It then envisions additional good that governments might do, simply by extending their market acting roles to spheres in which they have yet to be fully utilized. The Article concludes by suggesting next steps in both theorizing and employing the government market actor role...|$|E
40|$|And the Word Was Made Flesh: Anthropomorphism in {{the poetry}} of WH Auden {{examines}} {{the reasons for the}} neglect of Auden’s prolific deployment of anthropomorphism by examining the poetry’s critical reception with a view to understanding what larger purpose, what ‘strategy of discourse’ (Ricoeur 2003, The Rule of Metaphor: 5 - 9), Auden may have had in mind when he revived a trope traditionally regarded as retrograde. Anxious not to be mistaken for a Modern, yet unable to find a social rhetoric to suit his purposes, Auden elected upon a new style of poetry which questioned the very foundations of language by placing anthropomorphism, the ascription of agency and sentience to voiceless entities, at its centre. The study explores anthropomorphism from historical and theoretical perspectives in an attempt to explain the reasons for its demise, at least, within the academy. This study emphasises the importance Auden placed on the everyday activity of reading, the principal focus for the poet’s ‘cultural theory’ (Boly 1991 and 2004 : 138). Auden, 'eager to create a tradition of its own' (Emig 2000 : 1), abjuring propaganda, hoped to educate the reader to resist the different ideologies which were vying for ascendency during the 1930 s. This study will demonstrate that anthropomorphism, with its capacity to suggest alternative words to ‘re-describe reality’ (Ricoeur 2003 : 5), played a pivotal role in Auden’s project for cultural renewal. This study demonstrates that the lasting benefit of Auden’s use of anthropomorphism is to have recognised with prescience what critics now recognise as a 'revolutionary and potently counter-cultural tactic of cultural appropriation' (Paxson 1994 : 173), a trope that 'engenders within its semiotic structure a hidden critique of Western culture' (Paxson: 50). Evidence from recent linguistic theory is marshalled in support of the trope’s rehabilitation. This study examines a selection of Auden’s four hundred published poems, and it also offers <b>a</b> <b>provisional</b> <b>taxonomy</b> to initiate the complex process of classifying instances of personification and its co-ordinate tropes in poetry.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} proposed framework of knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) of a practitioner who is competent in business ethics, compliance, or integrity should possess. These competencies may be leveraged as key input to selecting content for an institutionalized business ethics (BE) training program. The research problem for this dissertation was: What competencies {{are important for}} job performance of business ethics practitioners in industry and how do their perceptions compare with those of academics? Triangulation of research methods and data sources—including industry (public service and private sector) and academics, were used to investigate this problem. Phase I consisted of developing <b>a</b> <b>provisional</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of business ethics competencies {{through the use of}} the secondary methodology to help design a survey questionnaire. Phase II involved a survey of academic and industry practitioners implicated in business ethics to empirically validate the conceptually developed provisional taxonomy of business ethics competencies and help identify potentially under or over-emphasized competencies to help make recommendations regarding the selection of business ethics training content by choosing relevant course materials based on competencies and key risks and issues. Several theoretical and pragmatic contributions to the business ethics training, competency-based management, and risk management bodies of knowledge are made that include: Institutionalized BE Program (IBEP) parent theory and body of knowledge A model for content selection for BE instruction is developed to help guide future selection and tailoring of training content based on baseline competencies and organizational context. Competency-Based Management (CBM) parent theory and body of knowledge A conceptually and empirically developed and content validated proposed business ethics competency model that may serve to guide future research in this neglected area is provided. Risk Management (RM) parent theory and body of knowledge Given the rapid pace of technological, social, economic, and other constant changes faced by organizations, future competency identification is made possible by the proposed enhancement of traditional environmental scanning methods to include new dimensions to the risk identification process through the creation of an extended environmental scanning model (STEEP LEDGES). Also, the traditional risk assessment framework is enhanced by adding prevalence, a third dimension to augment likelihood and impact that should help assess current and new risks and issues using the extended risk assessment model (LIP). ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigation into}} the spirituality of pilgrims arises from the intense mobility that characterizes contemporary society and from the new emphasis that is now being placed on pilgrimage. In {{the face of these}} trends the Holy See 2 ̆ 7 s Pontifical Council for Migrants and Itinerant People has called for appropriate pastoral responses based on 2 ̆ 2 a clear theological foundation and praxis 2 ̆ 2 whereby pilgrimage can be 2 ̆ 2 transformed into an experience of deep and mature faith. 2 ̆ 2 The specific contribution that this thesis makes to developing the many-layered pastoral response to contemporary pilgrimage for which the Pontifical Council calls, has been to document, codify and analyse the particular stories of mobility recounted by a sample of twenty-three Australian Catholic pilgrims who had walked the Camino de Santiago de Compostela. All twenty-three had been interviewed after completing the Camino pilgrimage, while three of these had also been interviewed before commencing, and again in real-time while walking the Camino itself. The objective of this research, therefore, was to discover what is expressed 2 ̆ 2 first hand 2 ̆ 2, as it were, through the pilgrims 2 ̆ 7 experiences and responses, and to bring this to expression. An iterative engagement with the literature of pilgrimage was central to this task, as was locating the discussion within a broader range of theological, psychological and cultural reference. The first outcome was the development of a foundational framework showing the constitutive elements of the human person in her/his journey through life. This framework, which corresponds to the Church 2 ̆ 7 s insight that 2 ̆ 2 pilgrimages symbolise the experience of the homo viator who sets out, as soon as he leaves the maternal womb, on his journey through the time and space of his existence, 2 ̆ 2 provides an overarching structure within which this research into the spirituality of Australian pilgrims on the Camino could be conducted. A comprehensive mapping exercise was then undertaken, focussing on the pilgrims 2 ̆ 7 actual experiences of the Camino. Language was selected and codified, leading to the presentation of a second framework, <b>a</b> <b>provisional</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of pilgrimage, by which the pilgrims 2 ̆ 7 experience could be assessed, and then employed to formulate pastoral solutions for the future. Finally, concepts drawn from structural, evolutionary psychological theories generated new insights into how the pilgrims changed - during and after the Camino. This led to the construction of a third framework which, taking the form of a staged, holistic, re-generative model, can also serve {{in the development of a}} suitable pastoral response, helping people to embrace the opportunities that pilgrimage offers to break out of their 2 ̆ 2 embeddedness 2 ̆ 2 in constraining patterns and to move into new ways of living...|$|E
