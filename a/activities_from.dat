In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations.|$|E
5|$|On the {{practical}} side, microbes {{have been used}} in <b>activities</b> <b>from</b> biological warfare to fermentation in food processing; bread, beer and wine have been produced by yeasts from the dawn of civilisation, such as in ancient Egypt. Microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses are important as pathogens, causing disease to humans, crop plants, and domestic animals. Fermentation is an important source of chemicals, as industrial chemists discover how to manufacture a widening variety of organic chemicals including enzymes and bioactive molecules such as hormones and competitive inhibitors for use as medicines. Fermentation is used, too, to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in forms such as ethanol and methane; fuels may also be produced by algae. Anaerobic microorganisms are important in sewage treatment. In scientific research, yeasts serve as model organisms especially in genetics and related fields.|$|E
40|$|Nick BeylerAbstract: Physical <b>activity</b> {{measurements}} derived <b>from</b> self-report surveys or questionnaires {{are prone}} to significant measurement errors and biases. Monitoring devices like accelerometers offer more objective measurements of physical activity, but they are often impractical for use in largescale surveys. A valid model capable of predicting objective measurements of physical <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> self-reports would offer a practical alternative to obtaining measurements directly from monitoring devices. Using concurrent measurements of accelerometer-based and self-reported physical <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> NHANES 2003 – 2006, we developed and validated a set of models for predicting objective moderate to vigorous physical <b>activity</b> (MVPA) <b>from</b> self-report variables and other demographic characteristics. The prediction intervals produced by the models were extremely large, suggesting {{that the ability to}} predict objective physical <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> self-reports is limited...|$|R

5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{as far north}} as the Russian Far East as officials anticipated the remnants of the typhoon to cause significant disruption in the region. Residents were advised to avoid outdoor <b>activities</b> <b>from</b> August28 to 29 as the storm moved through. In the Sea of Japan, more than 100 ships sought refuge in bays across the Primorsky Krai. Ferry service to all islands in the region was also suspended. All military personnel in the region were placed at an elevated state of readiness for the storm. On August28, crisis centers were opened in 12 cities and 22 districts across Primorsky Krai. Although the storm was expected to cause significant disruptions in the region, Russian Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov stated that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Vladivostok would continue as planned.|$|E
5|$|The 160 hidden panels do {{not form}} a {{continuous}} story, but each panel provides one complete illustration {{of cause and}} effect. There are depictions of blameworthy <b>activities,</b> <b>from</b> gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was dissembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these photographs that are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only {{the southeast corner of}} the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War era, {{radar and}} antenna related {{applications}} remained a prominent research activity in EES' {{contracts with the}} Defense Department. Millimeter wave radar research, in particular, was prominent in EES' defense <b>activities</b> <b>from</b> the late 1950s, when the first military-designation millimeter wave radar was built at Georgia Tech, to the 1980s, when GTRI developed {{what was then the}} world's highest frequency microwave radar. EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy, meteorology and climate studies, which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions. Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development of an air defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command, resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory, GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his <b>activities</b> <b>from</b> then until early 545, by which time he was the {{garrison}} commander of Rome. Along with the general Conon {{he was responsible for}} the city's defence during the siege by Totila in 546. During the siege he restricted himself to passive defence, refusing to sally forth from the walls even when Belisarius, who had returned from the east and landed with reinforcements at the nearby Portus Romanus, ordered him to do so. As a result, Belisarius' attempts to succour the beleaguered city failed. Procopius heavily criticizes Bessas for his conduct during the siege. He neglected of the civilian population of the city and enriched himself by selling the starving populace the grain he had hoarded at exorbitant prices. The civilians were so exhausted by famine that when he finally allowed those who wanted to leave the city to do so, many simply died on the wayside, while others were killed by the Goths. Finally, he proved negligent in the conduct of the defence, and allowed security measures to grow lax: guards slept at their posts, and patrols were discontinued. This allowed four Isaurian soldiers to contact Totila, and on 17 December 546, the city was betrayed to the Goths. Bessas managed to escape with the greater part of the garrison, but the treasure that he had amassed was left behind for the Goths to enjoy. Following his dismal performance in Italy, Bessas was apparently recalled to Constantinople.|$|E

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of free L-proline in leaves {{as a response}} to water deficit is well documented. Accumulation is caused by stress enhanced-de novo proline synthesis from glutamic acid. Three enzymes, gamma-glutamyl kinase (GK, EC 2. 7. 2. 11), gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase (GPR, EC 1. 2. 1. 41), and pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate reductase (PCR, EC 1. 5. 1. 2) catalyze the pathway in other organisms;A continuous assay for GK was developed. A crude preparation from etiolated shoots of Vigna radiata L. was capable of synthesizing pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate (P 5 C) from glutamic acid. Attempts to purify GPR activity yielded P 5 C dehydrogenase activity that was not phosphate-dependent. PCR was the only enzyme whose activity could be measured;Protoplasts were made from leaves of Pisum sativum L., lysed, and fractionated on a Percoll gradient. PCR activity was found in chloroplasts. PCR <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> pea chloroplasts and etiolated pea shoots was compared. PCR <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> both extracts is stimulated at least twofold by 100 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl[subscript] 2. The pH profiles of PCR <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> both extracts reveal two separate pH optima at 6. 5 and 7. 5. PCR <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> etiolated pea shoots was 100 -fold greater than that from pea chloroplasts. Three nonionic detergents (NP- 40, CHAPS, and CHAPSO) doubled the yield of PCR <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> pea chloroplasts;PCR was partially purified from pea leaf chloroplasts and from etiolated pea shoots. PCR <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> chloroplasts exhibited a preference for NADPH. PCR <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> etiolated shoots had a higher K[subscript] m for NADH than for NADPH. The V[subscript] max was also greater with NADH than with NADPH. PCR <b>activity</b> <b>from</b> etiolated shoots was inhibited by 50 mM proline, 2 mM azetidine- 2 -carboxylate, and 2 mM thiazolidine- 4 -carboxylate. The molecular mass of native PCR was greater than 100 kd. The pI of native PCR was 7. 8. Participation of PCR in the regulation of metabolism during stress is indicated...|$|R
