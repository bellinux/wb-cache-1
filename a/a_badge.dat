5|$|Initially, the Order of Karađorđe's Star was {{categorized}} {{as a senior}} state award, and organized into four classes. The Grand Cross of Karađorđe's Star, the highest class, consisted of <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> of the Order on a sash and breast star; a Grand Officer of Karađorđe's Star was decorated with <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> necklet and a slightly smaller breast star; a Commander of Karađorđe's Star was only awarded <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> necklet; and {{the recipient of the}} Order's fourth class, the Officer of Karađorđe's Star, would receive a small triangular chest ribbon. The Order was usually awarded for services to the Karađorđević dynasty, the Serbian state or the Serb people, while Karađorđević princes received a Grand Cross at baptism. Recipients included both soldiers and civilians, though until 1906 only Serbian citizens were permitted to receive the award.|$|E

5000|$|Prisoners {{were divided}} into categories. At first, they were {{classified}} {{by the nature of}} the crime for which they were accused, but eventually were classified by the specific authority-type under whose command a person was sent to camp. Political prisoners who had been arrested by the Gestapo wore <b>a</b> red <b>badge,</b> [...] "professional" [...] criminals sent by the Criminal Courts wore <b>a</b> green <b>badge,</b> Cri-Po prisoners arrested by the criminal police wore <b>a</b> brown <b>badge,</b> [...] "work-shy and asocial" [...] people sent by the welfare authorities or the Gestapo wore <b>a</b> black <b>badge,</b> Jehovah’s Witnesses arrested by the Gestapo wore <b>a</b> violet <b>badge,</b> homosexuals sent by the criminal courts wore <b>a</b> pink <b>badge,</b> emigrants arrested by the Gestapo wore <b>a</b> blue <b>badge,</b> [...] "race polluters" [...] arrested by the criminal court or Gestapo wore <b>badges</b> with <b>a</b> black outline, second-termers arrested by the Gestapo wore a bar matching the color of their badge, [...] "idiots" [...] wore a white armband with the label Blöd (Stupid), and Jews, whose incarceration in the Dachau concentration camp dramatically increased after Kristallnacht, wore <b>a</b> yellow <b>badge,</b> combined with another color.|$|R

5|$|The {{founder of}} the Scouting movement, Robert Baden-Powell, wore six beads, as did Sir Percy Everett, then Deputy Chief Scout and the Chief's right hand. Baden-Powell's beads are on display at Baden-Powell House in London. Everett endowed his six beads to be worn by the Camp Chief of Gilwell as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> of office.

5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E

5|$|Clan badge: There {{have been}} two clan badges (or plant badges) {{attributed}} to Clan MacAulay: cranberry and scots pine. Both clans MacAulay and MacFarlane have been attributed with <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> of cranberry. Clan MacFarlane, also a west-Dumbartonshire clan, claims a descent from Alwyn II, Earl of Lennox. The badge of scots pine {{has been attributed to}} all seven clans of Siol Alpin: Clan Grant, Clan Gregor, Clan MacAulay, Clan Macfie, Clan Mackinnon, Clan Macnab, and Clan MacQuarrie.|$|E
5|$|In the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, {{the most}} senior non-commissioned ranks wear the 1957 version of the coat of arms as <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> of rank, {{representing}} {{the fact that they}} have received the Queen's warrant (as opposed |to the Queen's commission for officers).

The Senate was granted a similar badge on 15 April 2008, using its own mace. Parliament as a whole has been granted the right to use the escutcheon of the Arms of Canada, superimposed over the maces of the Commons and Senate in saltire.|$|E

5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E
5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of South Africa was the United Kingdom's Union Jack as South Africa {{was part of the}} British Empire. The South Africa Red Ensign was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Hull City's first shirt badge {{mirrored}} the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston-upon-Hull, which was {{displayed on the}} sky blue shirts worn in the 1935–36 season. Following that season, the team went without wearing <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This was worn up until 1957, when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This was worn for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, a logo with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, The Tigers.|$|E

5|$|The club {{eventually}} {{chose the}} colours {{of the local}} Parramatta council, which were royal blue and gold, which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or hoops. The crest used these colours and was {{like many of the}} other crests of the 1908 season, <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> with a letter 'C', to represent the first letter of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in hoops around the jersey. These hoops of blue and gold were mixed with a white collar and black or grey shorts.|$|E
5|$|The fee for {{the grant}} of arms is due when the {{memorial}} is submitted, the amount being {{laid out in the}} Earl Marshal's Warrant. As of 1 January 2016 the fees for a personal grant of arms, including a crest is £5,875, a grant to a non-profit body is £12,375 and to a commercial company is £18,350. This grant however does not include a grant of <b>a</b> <b>badge,</b> supporters or a standard, their inclusion into the grant requires extra fees. The fees mainly go towards commissioning the artwork and calligraphy on the vellum Letters Patent, which must be done by hand and in a sense a work of art in itself, plus other administrative costs borne by the heralds and for the upkeep of the College.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via <b>a</b> <b>badge</b> system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E
