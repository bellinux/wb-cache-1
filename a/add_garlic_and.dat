40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} effects of {{combinations}} of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), <b>garlic</b> (Allium sativum), <b>and</b> black pepper (Piper nigrum) powder supplementation on production traits of broiler chickens. Materials and Methods: A total of 288 commercial broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 1 - 9 groups with 4 replicates each. An experiment was conducted in broilers with different feed formulations; control feed, with no <b>added</b> fenugreek, <b>garlic,</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder; and 8 treatment groups receiving feed supplemented with different combinations of fenugreek, <b>garlic,</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder. The individual broilers’ body weight and feed consumption were recorded and calculate the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Results: Broiler’s weight gain and FCR were significantly higher in groups receiving feed supplemented with <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder combinations (p< 0. 01). Cumulative feed consumption was significantly higher in groups receiving feed supplemented with <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder combinations (p< 0. 01).

5000|$|Chile or chile sauce: A sauce {{made from}} {{red or green}} chiles {{by a variety of}} recipes, and served hot over many (perhaps any) New Mexican dish. Chile does not use vinegar, unlike most salsas, picantes and other hot sauces. Green chile is made with chopped roasted chiles, while red chile is made with chiles dried and ground to a powder. Thickeners like flour, and various spices are often <b>added,</b> {{especially}} <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> salt. Chile {{is one of the most}} definitive differences between New Mexican and other Mexican and Mexican-American cuisines (which often make a different green chile sauce from tomatillos). Mexican and Californian tend to use various specialized sauces for different dishes, while Tex-Mex leans toward the use of salsa picante and chili con carne (and even Cajun-style Louisiana hot sauce). New Mexican cuisine uses chile sauce as taco sauce, enchilada sauce, burrito sauce, etc. (though any given meal may use both red and green varieties for different dishes). A thicker version of green chile, with larger pieces of the plant, plus onions and other additions, is called green chile stew and is popular in Albuquerque-style New Mexican food; it is used the same way as green chile sauce, as a topping for virtually anything, including American dishes. The term [...] "Christmas" [...] is commonly used in New Mexico when both red and green chiles are used for one dish. The green chile sauce is usually hotter than its red counterpart.|$|R

40|$|Addition of 0. 5 % onion was {{effective}} in reducing lipid oxidation in irradiated cooked ground beef after 7 d storage. Addition of garlic or onion greatly increased the amounts of sulfur volatiles from cooked ground beef. Irradiation and storage both changed the amounts and compositions of sulfur compounds in both garlic- and onion-added cooked ground beef significantly. Although, addition of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> onion produced large amounts of sulfur compounds, the intensity of irradiation odor and irradiation flavor in irradiated cooked ground beef {{was similar to that}} of the nonirradiated control. Addition of garlic (0. 1 %) or onion (0. 5 %) to ground beef produced garlic/onion aroma and flavor after cooking, and the intensity was stronger with 0. 1 % garlic than 0. 5 % onion treatment.

Generally, all sample types showed decreased moisture content and pH and increased protein and fat contents over the course of the refrigerated storage period. While TBA values and APCs increased during the experimental period for all sample types, the increases were lower in the samples with <b>garlic</b> <b>added</b> due to the antioxidant effect of garlic.

Four mixtures of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger were also formulated. Control diet did not contain any test ingredient. The results showed that <b>garlic,</b> ginger <b>and</b> mixtures contained 7. 41, 5. 85 and 6. 62 % crude protein respectively. Dietary treatment significantly influenced the final liveweights (FLW) of broiler chicks (P< 0. 001) and chickens (P< 0. 01). The mixtures of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger significantly (P< 0. 001) improved FLW and weight gain th of the 28 day old chicks than those of control birds. Garlic at 1. 5 and 2 % ginger significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased the FLW of the chickens relative to the control. Dietary treatment significantly (P< 0. 001) affected the carcass parts and organs development of broiler chickens. However, dietary <b>garlic,</b> ginger <b>and</b> mixtures {{did not affect the}} red blood cells and haemoglobin concentration of the chickens. The mixtures of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger exhibited better antilipidemic influence on the serum cholesterol, triacylglycerol and abdominal fat pad of the chickens than sole <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger. In conclusion, <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger could be used as antilipidemic agents in broiler diets to lower abdominal fat pad, serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol of broiler chickens with consequential reduced growth.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate effects of plant extracts on methanogenesis and rumen microbial diversity in in vitro. Plant extracts (Artemisia princeps var. Orientalis; Wormwood, Allium sativum for. Pekinense; Garlic, Allium cepa; Onion, Zingiber officinale; Ginger, Citrus unshiu; Mandarin orange, Lonicera japonica; Honeysuckle) were obtained from the Plant Extract Bank at Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology. The rumen fluid was collected before morning feeding from a fistulated Holstein cow fed timothy and commercial concentrate (TDN; 73. 5 %, crude protein; 19 %, crude fat; 3 %, crude fiber; 12 %, crude ash; 10 %, Ca; 0. 8 %, P; 1. 2 %) in the ratio of 3 to 2. The 30 ml of mixture, comprising McDougall buffer and rumen liquor in the ratio of 4 to 1, was dispensed anaerobically into serum bottles containing 0. 3 g of timothy substrate and plant extracts (1 % of total volume, respectively) filled with O 2 -free N 2 gas and capped with a rubber stopper. The serum bottles were held in a shaking incubator at 39 °C for 24 h. Total gas production in all plant extracts was higher (p< 0. 05) than that of the control, and total gas production of ginger extract was highest (p< 0. 05). The methane emission was highest (p< 0. 05) at control, but lowest (p< 0. 05) at garlic extract which was reduced to about 20 % of methane emission (40. 2 vs 32. 5 ml/g DM). Other plant extracts also resulted in a decrease in methane emissions (wormwood; 8 %, onion; 16 %, ginger; 16. 7 %, mandarin orange; 12 %, honeysuckle; 12. 2 %). Total VFAs concentration and pH were not influenced by the addition of plant extracts. Acetate to propionate ratios from <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> ginger extracts addition samples were lower (p< 0. 05, 3. 36 and 3. 38 vs 3. 53) than that of the control. Real-time PCR indicted that the ciliate-associated methanogen population in all added plant extracts decreased more than that of the control, while the fibrolytic bacteria population increased. In particular, the F. succinogens community in <b>added</b> wormwood, <b>garlic,</b> mandarin orange <b>and</b> honeysuckle extracts increased more than that of the others. The addition of onion extract increased R. albus diversity, while other extracts did not influence the R. albus community. The R. flavefaciens population in <b>added</b> wormwood <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> extracts decreased, while other extracts increased its abundance compared to the control.

Methods: Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) results of 108 patients with clinical suspicion of food allergy who were specifically screened for <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> onion specific IgE antibodies along with other food allergens were analyzed retrospectively at King Khalid University Hosptial between January 2008 and April 2009.

Estimation of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> onion specific IgE antibodies was performed by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) using Pharmacia ImmunoCAP 250 analyzer.
