2500|$|<b>Agrammatism</b> (inability {{to speak}} in a grammatically correct fashion) ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Agrammatism</b> is a {{characteristic}} of non-fluent aphasia. Individuals with <b>agrammatism</b> present with speech that is characterized by containing mainly content words, with a lacking of function words. For example, when asked to describe a picture of children playing in the park, the client responds with, [...] "trees..children..run." [...] People with <b>agrammatism</b> may have telegraphic speech, a unique speech pattern with simplified formation of sentences (in which many or all function words are omitted), akin to that found in telegraph messages. Deficits in agrammaticism are often language-specific, however - in other words, [...] "agrammaticism" [...] in speakers of one language may present differently from in speakers of another.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agrammatism</b> {{is seen in}} many brain disease syndromes, {{including}} {{expressive aphasia}} and traumatic brain injury.|$|E

50|$|The early {{accounts}} of <b>agrammatism</b> involved cases of German and French participants. The greater {{sophistication of the}} German school of aphasiology {{at the turn of}} the 20th century and also the fact that both German and French are highly inflected languages, might have been triggers for that situation (Code, 1991). Nowadays, the image has slightly changed: grammatical impairment has been found to be selective rather than complete, and a cross-linguistic perspective under the framework of Universal Grammar (UG) together with a shift from morphosyntax to morphosemantics is à la page. Now the focus of study in <b>agrammatism</b> embraces all natural languages and the idiosyncrasies scholars think a specific language has are put in relation to other languages so as to better understand <b>agrammatism,</b> help its treatment, and review and advance in the field of theoretical linguistics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agrammatism</b> {{was first}} coined by Adolf Kussmaul in 1887 {{to explain the}} {{inability}} to form words grammatically and to syntactically order them into a sentence. Later on, Harold Goodglass defined the term as the omission of connective words, auxiliaries and inflectional morphemes, all of these generating a speech production with extremely rudimentary grammar. <b>Agrammatism,</b> today seen as {{a symptom of the}} Broca's syndrome (Tesak & Code, 2008), has been also referred as 'motor aphasia' (Goldstein, 1948), 'syntactic aphasia' (Wepman & Jones, 1964), 'efferent motor aphasia' (Luria, 1970), and 'non-fluent aphasia' (Goodglass et al., 1964).|$|E
50|$|From a cross-linguistic {{perspective}} {{under the}} framework of Universal Grammar (UG), grammatical impairment in <b>agrammatism</b> {{has been found to}} be selective rather than complete. Under this line of thought, the impairment in tense production for agrammatic speakers is currently being approached in different natural languages by means of the study of verb inflection for tense in contrast to agreement (a morphosyntactic approach) and also, more recently, by means of the study of time reference (which, in a sense, should be seen closer to morphosemantics). The type of studies this paper should be related with are those dealing with tense impairment under {{the framework of}} time reference. Prior to explaining that, to help understand the goals of such research, it is good to give a taste of the shift from morphosyntax to morphosemantics the study of <b>agrammatism</b> is undergoing.|$|E
50|$|There {{is little}} written about <b>agrammatism</b> in Catalan. The {{beginnings}} of the field should be encountered {{in the work of}} Peña-Casanova & Bagunyà-Durich (1998), and Junque et al. (1989). These papers do not describe case reports, they are rather dealing with more general topics such as lesion localization or rehabilitation of agrammatic patients. The most updated studies could be found in the work of Martínez-Ferreiro (2009). The work of Martínez-Ferreiro is under the so-called Tree Pruning Hypothesis (TPH) of Friedmann & Grodzinksy (2007). Such a hypothesis is somewhat lagging behind after the findings in Bastiaanse (2008) have been proved by means of a re-analysis of data from Nanousi et al. (2006) and Lee et al. (2008), and the work of Yarbay Duman & Bastiaanse (2009). Other rather updated work for <b>agrammatism</b> in Catalan should be found in Martínez-Ferreiro et Gavarró (2007), in Gavarró (2008, 2003a, 2003b, 2002), Balaguer et al. (2004), in Peña-Casanova et al. (2001), and in Sánchez-Casas (2001).|$|E
5000|$|More specifically, reduced syntax {{therapy has}} helped {{patients}} overcome their non-fluent speech and <b>agrammatism</b> that often occurs {{as a result}} of TMoA. Because <b>agrammatism</b> inhibits the patient's ability to form grammatically correct sentences, this type of treatment involves reducing these agrammatic deficits and teaching the patient to use linguistic structures that simplify the message that want to convey. Reduced syntax therapy helps the patient's language production to be more productive and efficient. [...] From a neuroscience perspective, research has found that a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, has provided positive outcomes during intervention for non-fluent types of aphasia, such as TMoA or adynamic aphasia. Studies have found that bromocriptine increased neural networks to assist with the initiation of speech in individuals who possess non-fluent characteristics of speech. With regard to intensity and duration of treatment, studies reported maximum recovery when intense weekly therapy (approximately 8 hours per week) was delivered over a 2-3 month period.|$|E
5000|$|Errors made in <b>agrammatism</b> {{depend on}} the {{severity}} of aphasia. In severe forms language production is severely telegraphic and in more mild to moderate cases necessary elements for sentence construction are missing. Common errors include errors in tense, number, and gender. Patients also find {{it very hard to}} produce sentences involving [...] "movement" [...] of elements, such as passive sentences, wh-questions or complex sentences.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{show there}} is a {{correlation}} between brain lesion and language, speech, and category-specific disorders. Wernicke's aphasia is associated with anomia, unknowingly making up words (neologisms), and problems with comprehension. The symptoms of Wernicke’s aphasia are caused by damage to the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus. Damage to the Broca’s area typically produces symptoms like omitting functional words (<b>agrammatism),</b> sound production changes, dyslexia, dysgraphia, and problems with comprehension and production. Broca’s aphasia is indicative of damage to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Goodglass {{developed}} {{a special interest}} in aphasia early in his career, and with the research support of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), he published research articles on disorders of naming in aphasia, on category specific disorders of lexical comprehension and production, on the comprehension of syntax, and on the syndrome of <b>agrammatism.</b> He also carried out a program of studies on cerebral dominance. Among his collaborators were Fred Quadfasel, Jean Berko Gleason, Edith Kaplan, Martin Albert, Nancy Helm-Estabrooks, Marlene Oscar Berman, Sheila Blumstein, Nelson Butters, Norman Geschwind, Howard Gardner, Edgar Zurif, Joan Borod, Arthur Wingfield, and Kim Lindfield.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to difficulty expressing oneself, sufferers of expressive aphasia are also noted to commonly {{have trouble with}} comprehension in certain linguistic areas. This <b>agrammatism</b> overlaps with receptive aphasia, but {{can be seen in}} patients of expressive aphasia without being diagnosed as having receptive aphasia too. The most well-noted of these are object-relative clauses, object Wh- questions, and topicalized structures (placing the topic {{at the beginning of the}} sentence). These three concepts all share phrasal movement, which can cause words to lose their thematic roles when they change order in the sentence. This is often not an issue for people without agrammatic aphasias, but many aphasics rely very heavily on word order to understand roles that words play within the sentence.|$|E
50|$|Verb {{inflection}} for tense {{has been}} found to be problematic in several languages. Different scholars have come up with different theories to explain it: Friedman & Grodzinksy (1997) introduced the so-called Tree Pruning Hypothesis (TPH) from the study of Hebrew, Arabic, and English; the same hypothesis has been proved by Gavarró & Martínez-Ferreiro (2007) for what they called Ibero-Romance (that is, Catalan, Galician, and Castilian); Wenzlaff & Clahsen (2004; 2005) introduced the Tense Underespecification Hypothesis (TUH) for German, and by the same time Bruchert et al. (2005) introduced the Tense and Agreement Underespecification Hypothesis (TAUH) for the same language; and Lee et al. (2008), and Faroqi-Shah & Dickey (2009) introduced a morphosemantic hypothesis, arguing that the diacritic tense features are affected in English <b>agrammatism.</b>|$|E
50|$|First {{described}} by the French neurologist Paul Broca in the nineteenth century, expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits. It {{is characterized by a}} halting speech consisting mainly of content words, i.e. nouns and verbs, and, at least in English, distinctly lacking small grammatical function words such as articles and prepositions. This observation gave rise to the terms telegraphic speech and, more recently, <b>agrammatism.</b> The extent to which expressive aphasics retain knowledge of grammar is a matter of considerable controversy. Nonetheless, because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved, and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across, the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary {{studies with}} AGL have {{attempted}} to identify which structures {{are involved in the}} acquisition of grammar and implicit learning. Agrammatic aphasic patients (see <b>Agrammatism)</b> were tested with the AGL paradigm. The results show that breakdown of language in agrammatic aphasia is associated with an impairment in artificial grammar learning, indicating damage to domain-general neural mechanisms sub serving both language and sequential learning.De Vries, Barth, Maiworm, Knecht, Zwitserlood & Flöel found that electrical stimulation of Broca's area enhances implicit learning of an artificial grammar. Direct current stimulation may facilitate acquisition of grammatical knowledge, a finding of potential interest for rehabilitation of aphasia.Petersson, Vasiliki & Hagoort, examine the neurobiological correlates of syntax, the processing of structured sequences, by comparing fMRI results on artificial and natural language syntax. They argue that the [...] "Chomsky hierarchy" [...] is not directly relevant for neurobiological systems through AGL testing.|$|E
5000|$|Cerebellar {{cognitive}} affective syndrome (CCAS), {{also called}} [...] "Schmahmann's syndrome" [...] {{is a condition}} that follows from lesions (damage) to the cerebellum of the brain. This syndrome, described by Dr. Jeremy Schmahmann and his colleagues refers to a constellation of deficits in the cognitive domains of executive function, spatial cognition, language, and affect resulting from damage to the cerebellum. [...] Impairments of executive function include problems with planning, set-shifting, abstract reasoning, verbal fluency, and working memory, and there is often perseveration, distractibility and inattention. Language problems include dysprosodia, <b>agrammatism</b> and mild anomia. Deficits in spatial cognition produce visual-spatial disorganization and impaired visual-spatial memory. Personality changes manifest as blunting of affect or disinhibited and inappropriate behavior. These cognitive impairments result in an overall lowering of intellectual function. [...] CCAS challenges the traditional view of the cerebellum being responsible solely for regulation of motor functions. It is now thought that the cerebellum is responsible for monitoring both motor and nonmotor functions. The nonmotor deficits described in CCAS {{are believed to be}} caused by dysfunction in cerebellar connections to the cerebral cortex and limbic system.|$|E
5000|$|Kraepelin meticulously {{classified}} {{his collection}} of dreams according {{to the nature of}} the deviances from correct normal speech in wakefulness. Three-fifths of his specimens were grouped as disorders of word selection, including large numbers of neologisms (non-existing words, typically formed by combinations of existing words or their components); just over one-fifth as disorders of discourse (actaphasia, usually involving the incorrect choice of language dependency relations; and <b>agrammatism,</b> the faulty construction of complex sentences); and just under one fifth as disorders of thought. Although it was well known at the time that the speech of normal people in wakefulness is often fraught with errors, Kraepelin prized his corpus of deviant dream speech for the profound nature of many of the errors they contained, different from the common slips of the tongue made by mentally healthy people in everyday life. He likened various specimens of his dream speech corpus to the speech in waking life of patients with dementia precox (schizophrenia), speech confusion, and aphasia. Kraeplin saw his dream experiences as affording him (a normal person) first-hand insight into these pathological processes. He further speculated on neurological concomitants involving the activities and interaction of areas of the brain—the cerebral cortex, Wernicke's coil, Broca's coil—which are different from in normal wakefulness. Although several of Kraepelin's dream speech specimens are amenable to interpretation for their latent sexual significance, [...] he had no interest in the psychoanalytic approach and made no reference to his contemporary Freud in any of his writings.|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Frank <b>agrammatism,</b> {{defined as}} the {{omission}} and/or substitution of grammatical morphemes with associated grammatical errors, is variably reported in patients with nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfPPA). This study addressed whether frank <b>agrammatism</b> is typical in agrammatic nfPPA patients when this feature is not required for diagnosis. Method: We assessed grammatical production in 9 patients who satisfied current diagnostic criteria. Although the focus was <b>agrammatism,</b> motor speech skills were also evaluated to determine whether dysfluency arose primarily from apraxia of speech (AOS), instead of, or in addition to, <b>agrammatism.</b> Volumetric MRI analyses provided impartial imaging-supported diagnosis. Results: The majority of cases exhibited neither frank <b>agrammatism</b> nor AOS. Conclusion: There are nfPPA patients with imaging-supported diagnosis and preserved motor speech skills who do not exhibit frank <b>agrammatism,</b> and this may persist beyond the earliest stages of the illness. Because absence of frank <b>agrammatism</b> is a subsidiary diagnostic feature in the logopenic variant of PPA, this result has implications for differentiation of the nonfluent and logopenic variants, and indicates that PPA patients with nonfluent speech {{in the absence of}} frank <b>agrammatism</b> or AOS do not necessarily have the logopenic variant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-At {{the turn}} of the century, the study of <b>agrammatism</b> started in German {{aphasiology}} with the introduction of syntax as an object of research in linguistics and the psychology of language. The disorder descriptively known as <b>agrammatism</b> was originally thought to arise from multiple origins, at the level of syntactic word order, of function word insertion, of gramrnaticalization by means of morphology, or as an impairment of processing. In modern aphasiology, there have been several attempts to reduce <b>agrammatism</b> to a single cause, such as the loss of specific syntactic operations or a deficit in morpholexical access. This article summarizes the results of morpholexical and morpho-syntactic experiments with two German and two Italian agramrnatic patients. The cross-language data reveal far more inflectional abilities than is usually assumed for <b>agrammatism.</b> Furthermore, they strongly support characterizations of the disorder as a syntactic rather than a morpholexical deficit...|$|E

40|$|In recent {{research}} on aphasia, {{a considerable number}} of studies have examined deficits in patients with <b>agrammatism</b> in the domain of verb-finiteness marking in different languages.

The present study reports new evidence from sentence-completion and grammaticality-judgment experiments with 9 English-speaking aphasic patients (and 9 matched control subjects) examining tense, agreement, and (subjunctive) mood marking. We found that the patients were more impaired in tense than in (subjunctive) mood or agreement marking. Tense impairments were seen in the sentence-completion and the grammaticalityjudgment tasks, for both present and past tense, and for different morphological types.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{asks whether}} Spanish-English bilinguals with <b>agrammatism</b> perform better than {{comparable}} monolingual Spanish speakers {{on a test}} of copular verb production. We chose the Spanish dual-copula system, because its two copula verbs: ser and estar (meaning ‘be’ in English), differ semantically (depending on {{the context of the}} sentence), as well as in overall frequency and form-regularity. We asked: Do bilingual Spanish-English speakers with <b>agrammatism</b> perform differently from their monolingual Spanish counterparts on a test comparing the effects of TMA Frequency, VF Regularity and CGC on verb production? Methodology: Participants were asked to complete 130 written sentences orally with the correct verb-form. 			 E. g., “¿Donde ______ la pelota?” (está) - “Where is the ball?” Six sentence types were employed to compare among the three factors: 1) High TMA Frequency/Low VF Regularity (ser in present tense) 2) High TMA Frequency/High VF Regularity (estar in present tense) 3) Low TMA Frequency/Low VF Regularity (ser in imperfect past tense) 4) Low TMA Frequency/High VF Regularity (estar in imperfect past tense) 5) High TMA Frequency/High CGC (sentences requiring either ser or estar in the present tense and result in a semantic change) 6) High TMA Frequency/Low CGC (sentences allowing a choice of either ser or estar in the present tense and do not result in a semantic change) Participants: Six Spanish-speaking participants with <b>agrammatism</b> were tested. Three had been highly proficient bilingual Spanish-English speakers, while the other three were relatively monolingual Spanish speakers. All had suffered left-frontal strokes at least 6 months prior to this study (X= 3. 4 years) and were judged agrammatic (in both languages, for bilinguals) based on the effortfulness of their spontaneous speech, short phrase-length, high substantive-word use, omission of functors, and relatively good comprehension. Twelve non-aphasic Spanish-English speakers served as controls, and were matched for language history, age, educational attainment, and relative socio-economic status. Results and Conclusions: In general, participants with <b>agrammatism</b> made markedly more errors on this task (X= 40 %) than control participants (X= 4 %), thus reinforcing our finding that despite high frequency in daily usage, ser and estar are not resistant to <b>agrammatism</b> (O’Connor Wells, 2011; O’Connor, Obler & Goral, 2007). A mixed-effects logistic regression analysis of the bilingual vs. monolingual data, revealed a trend (p = 0. 07) for the mean performance of the bilinguals with <b>agrammatism</b> (65 %) to be greater than that of the monolinguals (54 %). Although the direction of their performance was the same, the bilinguals with <b>agrammatism</b> outperformed the monolingual ones on all three of our verb factors. These data are consistent with the possibility that bilingualism facilitates language performance among bilinguals in their first language...|$|E
40|$|<b>Agrammatism</b> is {{characterized}} by morphosyntactic deficits in production of sentences. Studies dealing with the treatment of these deficits are scarce and their results controversial. The present study describes the rehabilitation of a case diagnosed as chronic Broca's aphasia, with <b>agrammatism,</b> using a method directed to sentence structural deficits. The method aims to expand the grammatical repertoire by training production of sentences with support from contexts that stimulate actions and dialogues. The patient showed positive results on all types of sentences trained and generalized the gains to spontaneous speech. However, these benefits were not sustained in the long term...|$|E
40|$|Broca’s agrammatic aphasia {{entails a}} {{syntactic}} deficit both in sentence comprehension and in sentence production. This chapter describes the intriguing pattern of deficits in speech production, and {{shows that this}} type of inquiry interacts with linguistic theory as well as with knowledge about brain-language relations. The syntactic tree, a syntactic construct that has originally been suggested based on purely linguistic grounds, is shown to be a useful tool to describe the deficit in production in <b>agrammatism,</b> {{and the role of the}} impaired brain area in syntactic production. The general idea is that the selective pattern of impairment in Broca’s agrammatic aphasia and the dissociations witnessed within and between languages follow from the inaccessibility of high nodes of the syntactic tree to agrammatic speakers. This causes syntactic structures that relate to high nodes of the tree to be impaired in <b>agrammatism,</b> whereas lower structures are unimpaired. The relative order of various syntactic abilities on the tree can also serve to explain degrees of agrammatic severity, as well as the path of spontaneous recovery from <b>agrammatism...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} agrammatic comprehension of object-subject-verb (OSV) and object-verb-subject (OVS) structures in Hebrew. These structures are syntactically {{identical to the}} basic order subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence except for {{the movement of the}} object {{to the beginning of the}} sentence, and thus enable empirical examination of syntactic movement in agrammatic comprehension. Seven individuals with <b>agrammatism,</b> 7 individuals with conduction aphasia, and 7 individuals without language impairment, all native speakers of Hebrew, performed a sentence–picture matching task. The task compared OSV and OVS sentences to SVO sentences and to subject and object relatives. Individuals with <b>agrammatism</b> performed more poorly than those in either of the other groups. Their comprehension of SVO sentences was significantly above chance, but comprehension of OSV and OVS sentences was at chance and was poorer than comprehension of SVO sentences. These results show that agrammatic comprehension of structures that involve movement of a noun phrase is impaired even when the structure is a simple active sentence, in line with the Trace Deletion Hypothesis (TDH; Y. Grodzinsky, 1990, 1995 a, 2000). A modification is suggested to accommodate the TDH with the VP Internal Subject Hypothesis, according to which individuals with <b>agrammatism</b> use an “Avoid Movement” strategy in comprehension. KEY WORDS: <b>agrammatism,</b> comprehension, Hebrew, syntax, conduction aphasia Individuals with agrammatic aphasia suffer from a deficit with regard to sentence comprehension that has been found to be selective.

Although mainstream research has done much to characterise {{the nature of the}} underlying disorder in <b>agrammatism,</b> most studies have analysed elicited, task-based data by applying the theoretical concepts of a standard grammar. As a result, {{little is known about the}} grammar that people with <b>agrammatism</b> use in everyday interaction with habitual conversational partners. There is evidence in the CA literature to suggest that conversational grammar may not mirror the grammar of elicited language samples (Heeschen & Schegloff, 2003). This presentation will investigate the notion that conversation and task-based data do not necessarily reveal the same grammatical phenomena, and will explore the implications for rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Effortful, agrammatic {{speech and}} {{relatively}} intact comprehension often appear to coexist in Broca’s aphasia. The present study focusses on this discrepancy, and tests {{the claim that}} the agrammatic patient has more information about syntactic structure than is indicated in his speech. Agrammatic aphasics and non-neurological patients sorted words from a variety of sentences on the basis of how closely related they felt the words to be in each of those sen-tences. These word groupings served as input matrices for a hierarchical clustering analysis. The resultant subjective phrase structure trees show that while normal subjects are often con-strained by surface syntactic properties, agrammatic patients operate on a hierarchical scheme that excludes anything nonessential to the intrinsic meaning of a sentence. These findings suggest hat expressive <b>agrammatism</b> is only one aspect of an impairment involving all language modalities. THE TERM <b>agrammatism</b> aptly characterizes a form of speech generally considered to result from lesions of the frontal speech zone and thus most often associated with Broca’s or motor aphasia. Chiefly typified by the omission of articles, prepositions, and inflectional forms, <b>agrammatism</b> may persist even though the patient begins to recover a considerabl...|$|E
40|$|<b>Agrammatism</b> {{is one of}} the hall-marks of Broca’s aphasia, and an {{important}} contributor to the lack of fluency in these patients. Goodglass and colleagues [1] describe agrammatic speech as “a speech pattern that is defective because it lacks inflectional markers, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, copulas—often articles and verbs as well ” (p. 8). Until recently, decisions about which of these omissions were required and how frequently they should occur to warrant a diagnosis of <b>agrammatism</b> were largely left to clinical judgement. Furthermore, non-fluent speech results from other deficits, including articulation difficulties, prosodic disruptions, problems with word-finding or phonological encoding, and slowed conceptual processing. To render the diagnosis of <b>agrammatism</b> more systematic and objective, Saffran, Berndt and colleagues developed the Quantitative Production Analysis (QPA), a protocol for transcribing and analyzing connected speech samples [2, 3]. This protocol has been used primarily to specify the grammatical deficits in non-fluent aphasia [3, 4], or to contrast non-fluent patterns with the grammatical performance of a small number of fluent aphasics [5 - 7]. The current study aims to extend these results by analyzing the grammaticality of spontaneous speech samples collected from an unselected group of aphasic subjects, and using a different method of elicitation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} „tree pruning hypothesis“(TPH; Friedmann & Grodzinsky, 1997) in a bilingual {{individual}} with Broca’s aphasia. In Broca’s aphasia, {{one of the}} main symptoms is <b>agrammatism.</b> The TPH suggests that syntactic deficits are highly selective: tense inflection is impaired while agreement inflection is preserved. To explain this obvious performance dissociation, the TPH uses the “phrase marker split inflection tree” (Pollock, 1989). In this phrase marker, the functional category agreement (AgrP) is located below tense (TP). According to the TPH, in persons with moderate <b>agrammatism,</b> the “phrase marker split inflection tree” is pruned between the two categories AgrP and TP, which causes an impairment of TP and all categories above it while AgrP and all nodes below it stay intact...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies on}} {{spontaneous}} speech {{of individuals with}} <b>agrammatism</b> have focused almost exclusively on monolingual individuals. There is hardly any previous research on bilinguals, especially of structurally different languages; and none on characterization of <b>agrammatism</b> in Swahili. The current study identifies the features of Swahili agrammatic narrative and spontaneous speech, and compares the use of verb inflections for tense and time reference in English and Swahili in six bilingual agrammatic speakers and 12 non-brain-damaged speakers matched on age, native language and education level to the agrammatic speakers. The results show a remarkable similarity between the agrammatic phenomena in both languages on the typical agrammatic features: utterance length and speech rate are reduced {{and the proportion of}} grammatical sentences and complex sentences is lower than normal. Analysis of verb inflection demonstrates that there are no qualitative differences between the Swahili and English samples: in both languages reference to the past is more impaired than reference to the present. However, the use of verb inflection in general is better preserved in Swahili than English. English verb inflections are frequently omitted, whereas Swahili verb inflections are substituted. The implications of these findings for theories on <b>agrammatism</b> are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
