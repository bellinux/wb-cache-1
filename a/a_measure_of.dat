5|$|A {{cast-iron}} clock {{tower was}} erected in South Norwood {{at the junction}} of Station Road and the High Street in 1907 to mark the golden wedding anniversary of William and Eliza Stanley, as <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> the esteem {{in which they were}} held in the locality.|$|E

5000|$|HEPI {{is useful}} as <b>an</b> overall <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> {{inflation}} affecting {{the higher education}} sector, just as consumers everywhere use the national Consumer Price Index (CPI) as <b>a</b> general <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> family purchasing power.|$|R
40|$|The R-square of {{the market}} model is <b>a</b> very popular <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> stock price efficiency. However, its {{interpretation}} {{is far from being}} unambiguous. Some scholars argue that the R-square is <b>a</b> direct <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> efficiency, others argue that the R-square is <b>an</b> indirect <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> efficiency. This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, we model the relationship between the market model R-square and the delay in the price discovery process and, second, we find that the correlation between R-square and delay is consistently negative. We conclude that the R-square is <b>a</b> direct <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> price efficiency...|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{owing to the}} {{deficiency}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> noncompactness in the space C(R_+,R^d), the technique <b>of</b> <b>a</b> family <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> noncompactness {{in conjunction with the}} Schauder-Tychonoff’s fixed point theorem was applied by Olszowy [11, 18].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{have found}} that the nearest {{neighbor}} (NN) test is <b>an</b> insufficient <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> the cluster hypothesis. The NN test is <b>a</b> local <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> the cluster hypothesis. Designers of new document-to-document similarity measures may incorrectly report effective clustering of relevant documents if they use the NN test alone. Utilizing <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> from network analysis, we present <b>a</b> new, global <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> the cluster hypothesis: normalized mean reciprocal distance. When used together with <b>a</b> local <b>measure,</b> such as the NN test, this new global measure allows researchers to better measure the cluster hypothesis...|$|R
5|$|It {{can also}} be {{expressed}} as a sum of the angles between the normal vectors at consecutive pairs of inflection points. It is 2 for convex curves and larger for non-convex curves, serving as <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> non-convexity of a curve.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bees are}} aposematically coloured, {{typically}} orange and black, warning {{of their ability}} to defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies, all of which gain <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk modulus}} of a {{material}} is <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk modulus is 50± 5GPa, {{which is similar}} to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70GPa).|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} <b>a</b> theory-based <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> employee performance (Role Based Performance Scale, RBPS) that {{is supported}} with {{results from a}} validation study using 10 data sets from six companies. In contrast to traditional, job-related <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> employee performance, we propose <b>an</b> alternative <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> performance based on role theory and identity theory. Because our results support {{the validity of the}} scale, we think that the instrument can be used for future research that requires <b>a</b> generalizable <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> performance. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers...|$|R
5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{can be quantified}} in an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 61. ACE is, broadly speaking, <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> {{the power of the}} hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed; therefore, storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACE ratings.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> William's {{success in}} taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E

30|$|Construct {{validity}} {{concerns the}} ability <b>of</b> the <b>measured</b> data {{to represent the}} construct of interest. In the theory development section, we argued why the data we chose represent the concepts of interest. Specifically, we argued above that graduation from the incubator is <b>a</b> good <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> project success, that project committer status is <b>a</b> good <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> core or peripheral status and that email use is <b>a</b> good <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> project communication. We further argued that use of inclusive pronouns reflects commitment of members to the project.|$|R
5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, {{territorial}} disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by VijayadityaII(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of BhimaI (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> independence. After the death of BhimaI, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was once}} again {{expected}} to be Italy's star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> infamy at Euro 2004 after he spat at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy's opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004. He was subsequently banned until the semi-finals, but never {{made it back to}} action and finished the competition scoreless due to Italy's elimination in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution.
