Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut.

Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E

25|$|Elizabeth {{became the}} {{catalyst}} in the uneasy – and ultimate breakup of – the Savage–Hogan relationship, particularly due to Hogan's overfriendly, overprotective attitude toward Elizabeth. At his behest, Elizabeth accompanied Hogan to ringside for several matches {{during the fall}} of 1988, including matches against King Haku, Akeem, and Bad News Brown that aired on Saturday Night's Main Event. In the match against Akeem, Elizabeth's safety was endangered by Akeem and his allies, Slick and Akeem's tag-team partner, The Big Boss Man (who wrestled together as The Twin Towers) when they began stalking Elizabeth. During a climatic point in the match where Hogan was being brutally beaten by Akeem, Big Boss Man grabbed Elizabeth and placed her in handcuffs, stopped only when Savage ran out to make the save; although he checked on Elizabeth's well-being, Savage appeared to be unconcerned about Hogan. At the 1988 Survivor Series, Hogan's obviously friendly behavior toward Elizabeth angered Savage, something pro-heel commentator Jesse Ventura played up during a post-match interview with Savage. Savage emphatically denied any animosity between himself and Hogan, but Savage would become increasingly jealous and wary of Hogan <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> went by.|$|E

500|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> passed, Heywood calmly {{occupied}} {{himself by}} resuming his {{studies of the}} Tahitian language. Meanwhile the family—Nessy in particular—busied itself on his behalf, and another plea was made to the Earl of Chatham, in heart-rending terms. Shortly afterwards came the first indication that a royal pardon was in the offing, and on 26 October, on Hector's quarterdeck, this was formally read to Heywood and Morrison by Captain Montagu. Heywood responded with a short statement that ended: [...] "I receive with gratitude my Sovereign's mercy, for which my future life will be faithfully devoted to his service."

Despite the loss of Warrick, Florida State eked out a 3121 victory over the Hurricanes after being tied, 2121, at halftime.|$|E
500|$|Supplies {{were now}} running low. Hurley and Macklin were {{sent back to}} Ocean Camp to recover food {{that had been left}} there to lighten the {{sledging}} teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916 Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat. Food shortages became acute <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> passed, and seal meat, which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on Shackleton’s orders, because the dogs' requirements for seal meat were excessive. The final two teams were shot on 2 April, by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations. Meanwhile, the rate of drift became erratic; after being held at around 67° for several weeks, at the end of January there was a series of rapid north-eastward movements which, by 17 March, brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island, but [...] to its east. [...] "It might have been six hundred for all the chance we had of reaching it across the broken sea-ice", Shackleton recorded.|$|E

500|$|On 14 September 1718, Rogers {{received}} word that Vane was at Green Turtle Cay near Abaco, about [...] north of Nassau. Some of the pardoned pirates on New Providence took boats to join Vane, and Rogers {{decided to send}} two ex-pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and John Cockram, with a crew to gather intelligence, and, if possible, to bring Vane to battle. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> passed, and hopes of their return dimmed, Rogers declared martial law and set all inhabitants to work on rebuilding the island's fortifications. Finally, the former pirates returned. They had failed to find an opportunity to kill Vane or bring him to battle, but had captured one ship {{and a number of}} pirate captives. Captain Hornigold was then sent to recapture the ships and crews who had gone pirate en route to Havana. He returned with ten prisoners, including captain John Auger, and three corpses. [...] On 9 December 1718, Rogers brought the ten men captured by Hornigold to trial. Nine were convicted, and Rogers had eight hanged three days later, reprieving the ninth on hearing he was of good family. One of the condemned, Thomas Morris, quipped as he climbed the gallows, [...] "We have a good governor, but a harsh one." [...] The executions so cowed the populace that when, shortly after Christmas, several residents plotted to overthrow Rogers and restore the island to piracy, the conspirators attracted little support. Rogers had them flogged, then released as harmless.|$|E
500|$|One of Nick's {{most notable}} {{returns to the}} series {{occurred}} in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim {{that he was a}} born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: [...] "For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet." [...] With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting– a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the [...] "one time we saw a glimmer of Nick’s good side", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.|$|E

[...] Trenchard began work on 18 January and during his first month at the Air Ministry, he clashed with Rothermere over several issues. [...] First, Rothermere's tendency to disregard his professional advisors in favour of outside experts irritated Trenchard. Secondly, Rothermere insisted that Trenchard claim as many men for the RAF as possible even if they might be better employed in the other services. [...] Finally and most significantly, they disagreed over proper future use of air power which Trenchard judged as being vital in preventing {{a repeat of the}} strategic stalemate which had occurred along the Western Front. [...] Also during this time Trenchard resisted pressure from several press barons to support an [...] "air warfare scheme" [...] which would have seen the British armies withdrawn from France and the defeat of Germany entrusted to the RAF. [...] Despite the arguments and his differences with Rothermere, Trenchard was able to put in place planning for the merger of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. [...] However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> went on, Trenchard and Rothermere became increasingly estranged and a low point was reached in mid-March when Trenchard discovered that Rothermere had promised the Navy 4000 aircraft for anti-submarine duties. [...] He accorded the highest priority to air operations on the Western Front: there were fewer than 400 spare aircraft in Great Britain. [...] On 18 March, Trenchard and Rothermere exchanged letters, Trenchard expressing his dissatisfaction and Rothermere curtly replying. [...] The following day Trenchard sent Rothermere a letter of resignation and although Rothermere called for Trenchard and asked him to remain, Trenchard only agreed to defer the date until after 1 April when the Royal Air Force would officially come into being.|$|E
