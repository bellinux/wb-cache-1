5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine (1694–1749) oversaw a remodelling {{of the north}} of the house, that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the {{pediment}} of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room <b>and</b> <b>breakfast</b> parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor.|$|E

Along this section of the trunkline, Shoreline Trail departs to the south and follows the water's edge before returning to M-185 at the city's water filtration plant.|$|E
5|$|To {{increase}} their incomes, many farmers have diversified; {{the average income}} from non-farming business activities on farms in Wales in 2013/2014 was £4,900.

Indoor and outdoor leisure and recreational facilities are provided by some farmers including paint-balling, laser-combat games, pony trekking, mountain biking and many other activities.
