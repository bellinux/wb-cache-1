5|$|The verbal prefix {{contains}} information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> {{and number}} of the subject, sometimes also the person {{and number of}} the object, as well as obligatory information about the tense of the clause. Furthermore, a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect. While {{only a small number}} of tense and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in the verbal prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, a free {{mobile app}} {{entitled}} The Everyday Heroes of Postman’s Park was launched. The app provides detailed accounts {{of each of}} the fifty-four incidents recorded on the Memorial and reveals the lives of the sixty-two people commemorated. The app employs image recognition technology and the built-in camera on the device to scan each tablet and then deliver the relevant information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person.</b> The app is the result of collaboration between Prossimo Ventures Ltd and Dr John Price of the University of Roehampton, supported by Creativeworks London, a Knowledge Exchange Hub for the Creative Economy funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). The app can be used on a range of devices including iPhone, iPad and Android devices.|$|E

25|$|The term 'icon' {{comes from}} the Greek word eikon, which simply means image. The Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary were painted by Luke the Evangelist. Icons are filled with {{symbolism}} designed to convey information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> or event depicted. For this reason, icons tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular person should be depicted, including hair style, body position, clothing, and background details.|$|E
25|$|Voter lists or electoral rolls are {{compiled}} {{before each}} {{vote by the}} Central Electoral Commission. The electoral rolls should include every person eligible to vote, and include information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> necessary to establish eligibility, such as name, surname, personal number, date of birth, passport or other ID number, as well as place of residence. The electoral roll of the Republic of Lithuania then forms the basis for electoral rolls of single-member constituencies and polling districts, that contain information necessary for individuals to vote. Electoral rolls are not public but voters may access information related to themselves in the electoral roll.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} {{confidentiality}} {{and this is}} an important principle in many nursing ethical codes. This is where information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared to comply with a higher duty such as preserving life. Related to information giving is the debate relating to truth telling in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but sometimes people will ask not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications. Finally, the role of empirical ethics has become prominent in recent years.|$|E

500|$|The Court {{held that}} despite not {{mentioning}} the words [...] "straw buyers", the federal gun law that regulates transactions with “persons” or “transferees” considers the “persons” or “transferees” {{to be the}} ones getting the gun {{at the end of the}} day, not the straw persons completing the transaction on their behalf. Failure to interpret the law in such way, the Court held, would undermine the purpose of the law, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. [...] "Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by." [...] The majority found Abramski's theory, that the federal law only cares <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> that is buying the gun and not the final buyer not to be true. The Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Kagan, held that if you interpret the terms “person” and “transferee,” to mean “the man at the counter”, you would undermine the purpose of the statutes, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Court therefore preferred to interpret the terms “person,” and “transferee,” to mean “the man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm”.|$|E

500|$|The Eternal World {{is a place}} {{similar to}} the afterlife where a person's [...] "other self" [...] awaits. Anyone can access it, though it is only {{accessible}} once one has lost his or her grounding in the real world. It {{may be necessary to}} form a pledge with someone in the real world as a guide to the Eternal World, but one's memories surrounding the pledge become vague. A grace period can be granted between when the pledge is made and when someone goes to the Eternal World. Once the process has started, nothing can prevent someone from going to the Eternal World, and returning to the real world is difficult. Someone about to leave to the Eternal World starts to be forgotten approximately one week before going, and the amount of time before someone forgets differs based on how much someone thinks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> leaving. However, he or she is remembered the moment that person returns. If a strong emotional bond is established in the real world before leaving, a person in the Eternal World can be returned after approximately one year.|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} at the English court, Lehzen {{attracted}} attention outside of the royal household for her close relationship with Victoria. She was criticised for her influence with the queen, particularly from those who disliked German influences at court. Pamphlets, many released by the Tory party, complained of the [...] "stranger harboured in our country" [...] and the [...] "evil counsellors" [...] surrounding Victoria. One in particular, published as the Warning Letter to Baroness Lehzen, declared that a [...] "certain foreign lady pulled the wires of a diabolical conspiracy of which Lady Flora {{was to be the}} first victim," [...] a reference to the Flora Hastings affair. More positive, The Times once described her as having simply [...] "held a highly and strictly confidential situation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> of the Sovereign." [...] As a sign of the perceived political influence she possessed, in 1838 false rumours suggested that Lehzen had been [...] "converted" [...] to the Whig party, and that she had been offered [...] "an urgent proposal of marriage" [...] by Whig prime minister Viscount Melbourne. Despite all of this criticism, historian Gillian Gill describes how Lehzen was honest and frugal; even after Victoria ascended the throne, she seems to have made no demands for money or rank, preferring instead to simply be in the queen's company. Historian K.D. Reynolds adds that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character and moral development, in particular giving the queen the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship. Not all of her influence was positive however; Reynolds also speculates that the 1839 Bedchamber crisis stemmed partly from Victoria's unwillingness to lose Lehzen.|$|E
500|$|Abramski's first {{defense was}} that the {{misrepresentation}} was not material since his uncle was legally capable of making the purchase himself, and {{that the answer to}} the question of whether he was purchasing the gun for himself was not required to be kept on the firearms dealer's record. When reaching the Supreme Court, Abramski modified his defense and claimed that the law only cares <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> buying the gun from the dealer, not the final receiver of the gun. The Court did not agree with this interpretation and held that the law cared about the final receiver, which is properly considered the person buying the gun. Such straw arrangement, the Court held, are different from allowed transfers where a person buys a gun for himself and later decides to sell it. The court therefore found that the misrepresentation was material and also that the answer was required to be kept on the dealer's record. The Court thus held that the purchase violated 18 U.S.C. §922(a)(6), which makes it unlawful to falsify facts [...] "material to the lawfulness of the sale,” and 18 U.S.C. §924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits misrepresentation with respect to information which a is required to maintain on record. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the declaration about the ultimate recipient of the gun was not material to the sale, and that it is not included in the information that the dealer is required to keep on the records. After the ruling, proponents of gun control stated that the Court's decision will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, while opponents of gun control stated that the ruling is a [...] "horrible injustice".|$|E
