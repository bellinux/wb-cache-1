25|$|Presented as the Beamish Branch Office of the Northern Daily Mail and the Sunderland Daily Echo, the two storey replica {{building}} {{was built in}} the mid-1980s and represents the trade practices of the era. Downstairs, on the right, is the branch office, where newspapers would be sold directly and distributed to local newsagents and street vendors, and where orders for <b>advertising</b> <b>copy</b> would be taken. Supplementing it is a stationer's shop on the left hand side, with both display items and a small number of gift items on public sale. Upstairs is a jobbing printers workshop, which would not produce the newspapers, but would instead print leaflets, posters and office stationary. Split into a composing area and a print shop, the shop itself has a number of presses - a Columbian built in 1837 by Clymer and Dixon, an Albion dating back to 1863, an Arab Platen of c. 1900, and a Wharfedale flat bed press, built by Dawson & Son in around 1870. Much of the machinery was sourced from the print works of Jack Ascough's of Barnard Castle. Many of the posters seen around the museum are printed in the works, with the operation of the machinery being part of the display.|$|E

500|$|Posters and {{publicity}} photos were often tantalizing. Women appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed {{in the films}} themselves. In some cases actresses with small parts in films (or {{in the case of}} Dolores Murray in her publicity still for The Common Law, no part at all) appeared scantily clad. Hays became outraged at the steamy pictures circulating in newspapers around the country. The original Hays Code contained an often-ignored note about advertising imagery, but he wrote an entirely new advertising screed {{in the style of the}} Ten Commandments that contained a set of twelve prohibitions. The first seven addressed imagery. They prohibited women in undergarments, women raising their skirts, suggestive poses, kissing, necking, and other suggestive material.

He appeared at the Albery Theatre in 1936 at the age of 22, playing the role of Osric in John Gielgud's successful production of Hamlet. Also in 1936, Guinness signed on with the Old Vic, where he was cast in a series of classic roles. In 1939, he took over for Michael Redgrave as Charleston in a road-show production of Robert Ardrey's Thunder Rock.|$|E
40|$|How is {{language}} change effected and {{how does}} it proceed? In this article the central concepts of Rudi Keller's much-quoted work "Sprachwandel: von der unsichtbaren Hand in der Sprache" ("On Language Change. The Invisible Hand in Language") are introduced and the main criticism presented. Following this first part, Keller's theory of language change is related to the concrete example of linguistic changes in job advertisements. The main interest here is in the enhancement of job titles ("Gebrauch von aufwertenden Berufs- und Personenbezeichnungen"). 26, 000 job advertisements from 1950 to 1999 are analysed in the empirical part. The <b>advertising</b> <b>copies</b> show, for example, a clear increase in the use of "Mitarbeiter" resp. "Mitarbeiterin" ("employee") instead of "kaufm. Angestellte" ("clerk"), "Fabrikarbeiter" ("factory worker"), "Magazingehilfe" ("storeman") or the like. The second part of this article shows how this aspect of language change can be understood through Keller's Invisible-Hand model...|$|R

50|$|Madame Storace {{was known}} for {{interpreting}} works by both Mozart and Salieri, {{as well as by}} her brother. Ofelia was a role that she was to sing in an opera by Salieri, La grotta di Trofonio, scheduled to premiere in June 1785, during the period she was unable to sing, and so the performance was postponed. Her recovery took three months. The cantata, composed in early Autumn, refers to Ofelia anticipating her performance. It is believed that Da Ponte and the composers wrote the cantata within a week, as Mme. Storace returned to the stage on September 19 in Giovanni Paisiello's opera Il Re Teodoro in Venezia - a performance the cantata clearly refers to in stanza 27 - and exactly a week later the cantata was announced in the local newspapers Das Wienerblättchen and Wiener Realzeitung, which <b>advertised</b> <b>copies</b> for sale by Viennese publisher Artaria & Co. The premiere of Salieri's new opera finally took place on October 12.|$|R
2500|$|Cuppy {{supported}} {{himself in}} New York by writing <b>advertising</b> <b>copy</b> while he {{tried unsuccessfully to}} write a play. [...] He served briefly stateside in World War I as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Motor Transport Corps. [...] Later he began contributing book reviews to the New York Tribune, where his college friend Burton Rascoe (1892–1957) was literary editor. According to Rascoe, it was his assistant Isabel Paterson who [...] "coaxed and coddled" [...] Cuppy into writing reviews and making a success of {{his career as a}} writer. [...] In 1926, Cuppy began writing a weekly [...] "Light Reading" [...] column, later renamed [...] "Mystery and Adventure", for the Tribune's successor, the New York Herald Tribune. He continued writing the column until his death 23 years later, reviewing a career total of more than 4,000 titles of crime and detective fiction.|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} to target sponsors whose <b>advertising</b> <b>copy</b> rankled him, and those barbs didn't always {{sit well with}} his new sponsors, either.

[...] When Eversharp sponsored his show to promote both Eversharp pens and Schick injector razor blades, Morgan threw this in during a show satirizing American schools: [...] "They're educational. Try one. That'll teach you." [...] He also altered the company's Schick injector blade slogan [...] "Push-pull, click-click" [...] to [...] "Push-pull, nick-nick." [...] Eversharp finally dropped him in December 1947, as radio historian John Dunning related in On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, citing what they called [...] "flabby material," [...] to which Morgan—picked up promptly by Rayve Shampoo—replied, on the air, [...] "It's not my show, it's their razor." ...|$|E

Soon, studios found their way around the restrictions and published more racy imagery. Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside Cardinal Thomas Dougherty's home. Severely offended, Dougherty helped launch the motion picture boycott that later facilitated the enforcement of the code. A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the code itself, was the notion that film was a medium that greatly appealed to the masses and thus needed to be regulated.|$|E

50|$|Career: Initially {{starting}} in the mailing-room at Polydor Records, Bowien started off writing <b>advertising</b> <b>copies</b> for records and advertising promotions for the music industry. In 1959 the CEO of Polydor recognized his talents in writing music and a great vision for discovering talents and offered him to work in their recording studios. During {{his time in the}} studios and working on multiple projects he was offered to produce his own records. He {{became one of the first}} record producers in Europe, even though the title “Record Producer” was not official credited at that time. Bowien explored multiple genres in the music industry and discovered such artists as The Monks, the group that is referred to as the loudest band in the world and the ground-breaker for Heavy Metal music. In the early 60’s he produced Tony Sheridan who is best known for playing music with the The Beatles (aka The Beat Brothers) early on. Later in his career he produced music for Olivia Newton-John and over the years Bowien built up a diverse repertoire of artists, actors and musicians.|$|R

50|$|Subsequently, the Saracen Foundry {{made to a}} set of {{standard}} designs, a series of decorative iron works, from railings, drinking fountains, bandstands, street lamps, pre-fabricated buildings and architectural features. To achieve the design edge they required, the firm employed the best Glasgow architects, including John Burnet, James A Ewing, James Sellars, and Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. James Boucher was commissioned to design the show rooms of the Possilpark foundry as a gigantic showcase for the products, complete with a glass and iron dome and elaborate decorative castings on its Gothic gateway. The works were exported all over the British Empire, and can still be found in abundance in many parts of North Glasgow.Macfarlane's most celebrated work is the Saracen Fountain in Alexandra Park, Glasgow, which they gave to the city after exhibiting it in the grounds of the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition. Designed by D W Stevenson, and using casts of the figures around his earlier 1878 statue of John Platt in Oldham, the fountain featured in the firm's <b>advertising.</b> <b>Copies</b> were later commissioned and erected in: Town Hall Park, Warrington (destroyed for the war effort, 1942; a model version in silver is in the collection of Warrington Borough Council); and the Sammy Marks fountain in the National Zoological Gardens, Pretoria, South Africa.|$|R

5000|$|Ramsay's {{importance}} in literary history is twofold. As a pastoral writer ("in some respects {{the best in}} the world," [...] according to James Henry Leigh Hunt) he contributed, at an early stage, to the naturalistic reaction of the 18th century. His Gentle Shepherd, by its directness of impression and its appreciation of country life, anticipates the attitude of the school which broke with neo-classical tradition. It has the [...] "mixed" [...] faults which make the greater poem of his Scots successor, Thomson, a [...] "transitional" [...] document, but these give it an historical, if not an individual, interest. His chief place is, however, as an editor. He is the connecting-link between the greater [...] "Makars" [...] of the 15th and 16th centuries, and Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns. Ramsay also knew the Scottish bookseller Andrew Millar since the latter’s arrival in Edinburgh in 1720 as the thirteen-year-old apprentice of Ramsay’s friend James McEuen. From 1713 Ramsay ran a wigmaker’s and printseller’s shop in Niddrie’s Wynd, close to McEuen’s High Street premises. He joined the bookselling trade in 1720, and in 1722 relocated to {{the east side of the}} Luckenbooths, next to McEuen and facing the Market Cross.
