40|$|We use panel data on Florida {{high school}} {{students}} to examine race, poverty, and gender disparities in advanced course-taking. While white {{students are more likely to}} take <b>advanced</b> <b>courses</b> than black and Hispanic students, these disparities are eliminated when we condition on observable pre-high school characteristics. In fact, black and Hispanic students are more likely than observably similar white students to take <b>advanced</b> <b>courses.</b> Controlling for students' pre-high school characteristics substantially reduces poverty gaps, modestly reduces Asian-white gaps, and makes little dent in female-male gaps. Black and Hispanic students attend high schools that increase their likelihood of taking <b>advanced</b> <b>courses</b> relative to observably similar white students; this advantage is largely driven by minorities disproportionately attending magnet schools. Finally, recent federal and state efforts aimed at increasing access to <b>advanced</b> <b>courses</b> to poor and minority students appear to have succeeded in raising the share of students who take <b>advanced</b> <b>courses</b> from 2003 to 2006. However, secular trends (or spillovers of the policies to non-poor, non-minority students) have spurred faster growth for other students, contributing to widening demographic gaps in these years. © 2009 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R
