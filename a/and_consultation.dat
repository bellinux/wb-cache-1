5|$|Ridley Scott's Director's Cut (1991, 116 minutes) {{was made}} {{available}} on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997.

Scott provided extensive notes <b>and</b> <b>consultation</b> to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the Director's Cut. Scott's The Final Cut (2007, 117 minutes) was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc in December 2007. This is the only version over which Scott had complete artistic and editorial control.|$|E

5|$|Stelmach's {{government}} also responded with legislation entitled the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Bill 46), which would split the EUB into two parts: the Alberta Utilities Commission (responsible for regulating utilities) and the Energy Resources Conservation Board (responsible for regulating oil and gas). The legislation was controversial, as {{elements of the}} EUB's governing legislation that provided for public notice <b>and</b> <b>consultation</b> {{in the event of}} energy construction projects were left out. Opposition parties and advocacy groups charged that this was an assault on both landowners' rights and the environment. The legislation ultimately passed, and took effect at the beginning of 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the city's {{waterfront}} park and public boat launch in 2005 spurred interest in redevelopment of downtown Marysville. The closure of the final waterfront sawmill in 2005, followed by its acquisition and demolition by the city in 2008, led city planners to propose a downtown master plan. The 20-year plan, released and adopted by the City Council in 2009, proposed the redevelopment of the Marysville Towne Center Mall into a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented area with a restored street grid. The waterfront area would include trails, residential buildings, and retail spaces, along with a new city hall and civic center. In 2015, the city of Marysville was also the recipient of grants <b>and</b> <b>consultation</b> from the Environmental Protection Agency's smart growth program, identifying strategies for infill development in downtown.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting <b>and</b> <b>consultation</b> stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E
