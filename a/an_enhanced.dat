30|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{initiate}} research and dialogue {{into the role of}} stress beliefs in the way we perceive stressful situations; a question of importance given the recent evidence by Crum et al. (2013) that beliefs about stress are related to the way we respond to stressful situations. If beliefs about stress relate to the way we perceive stressful situations, then it may be that beliefs about stress influence the way we respond to stressful situations by altering the way we perceive the situation. This study tested the hypothesis that participants who held predominantly positive beliefs about stress (i.e., <b>an</b> <b>enhancing</b> stress mindset) would perceive the stressor as more challenging and less threatening than those who held predominantly negative beliefs about stress (i.e., a debilitating stress mindset). There was some support for this hypothesis, with participants who held <b>an</b> <b>enhancing</b> stress mindset reporting greater perceptions of challenge than those with a debilitating stress mindset. However, {{there was no evidence that}} participants who held <b>an</b> <b>enhancing</b> stress mindset reported lower perceptions of threat than those with a debilitating stress mindset.|$|R
