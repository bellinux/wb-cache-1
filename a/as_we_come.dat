25|$|We believe <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{to accept}} and act upon these values, we will be {{prepared}} to strengthen home and family, make and keep sacred covenants, receive the ordinances of the temple, and enjoy the blessings of exaltation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'None the worse. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{down the}} hill, {{we shall be}} {{continually}} meeting people going up.' But Owen had felt that Springrove was a little the worse nevertheless.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{we shall}} {{pick them up}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back," [...] he said [...] "and that will be in about two weeks." [...] And with this the busy man departed.|$|E
60|$|There was a cab passing <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out, and Holmes hailed it.|$|R
60|$|Such ill roads <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> over to-day, I {{never thought}} to see in England.|$|R
60|$|Holmes and I {{followed}} {{them down the}} lane, and my friend plucked at my sleeve <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out.|$|R
6000|$|Our gloves are {{stiff with}} the frozen blood, [...] Our furs with the drifted snow, <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{in with the}} seal--the seal! [...] In {{from the edge of}} the floe.|$|E
6000|$|... "But my dear Lady Ware, {{who keeps}} you waiting? There is your stall, and {{why on earth}} should you stand here and call us all over <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> in, like naughty schoolboys?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "People come to {{the prison}} gates and sell it <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back from work. You can buy {{anything}} except vodka, and you can buy that, though not openly; it gets smuggled in." ...|$|E
60|$|As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{within sight}} of it, we hove the ship to and held a council of war.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. What {{about that}} woman he was mixed up with? I saw some one uncommonly like her outside <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in.|$|R
6000|$|... “I suppose,” Will said, “your {{intention}} was to blow the ship and yourselves and us into the air <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> on board.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two stretchers, Major. Dominique and I {{have been}} making them {{for the last two}} hours. We can leave them here, sir, {{by the side of the}} path, and pick them up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> along back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have every}} {{hope that the}} company may {{accommodate}} you. I will let {{you know about it}} as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to any conclusion. And now I beg that you will go. For God's sake leave me to myself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Reuben said, [...] "they {{would only}} shoot us down <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> out. They must guess {{that some of}} us are up at this window, or they would try to carry the horses off, instead of {{destroying}} them.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Rooth, still prowling, {{stopped in}} the middle of the room at this, while her {{daughter}} echoed: [...] "He offered you money--just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{suppose it}} is the duty of each one of the mess by turn,” Will said quietly; “we learnt that much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> down the coast.” ...|$|R
60|$|We {{heard the}} wheels of the dog-cart {{crashing}} on the gravel of the drive <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> into the hall. Sir Percival had started on his journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, Mike, {{and we will}} take the main road. They will not be mounted, and I don't think they would stand before a charge of seven men; but they may shoot some of us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> down upon them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{write for}} them as soon as I find that there is {{something}} for them to do. You are not thinking of running away as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back I hope, Cyril? You said, when you last wrote, that you were fit for sea again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose there}} is, Bill; {{at any rate}} we {{have no time to}} spare to look for one. There's a pump in the yard, so we can have a drink of water <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back. Well, the work doesn't seem very hard, Bill," [...] George said as they ate their bread.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Richard," [...] said he, {{slipping}} his {{arm through}} mine <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out into Parliament Street, [...] "I promised you some sport. Have you enjoyed it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cheer up, my boy!" [...] cried Marvel. [...] "Did I not {{say there}} are new adventures before us? <b>We</b> may not <b>come</b> through them so easily <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> through the others." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{attended}} {{to making the}} boat secure and joined her. Thus we landed on Endeavour Island, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to it, land-sick from long custom of the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{get into}} my gondola, and come along at once," [...] Polani said. [...] "I deeply regret {{the death of the}} captain and sailors. You shall tell me all about it <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> along. We must not delay a moment in {{carrying}} this great news ashore. Have you got the despatches?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{was afraid}} {{we would get}} mixed up in it ourselves. And we was just {{starting}} down the river a-hunting for all the week besides; but as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back we found out they'd been searching for the body, so then we went and told Brace Dunlap all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back, Bessie. Till then, you are our banker, and the pocketbook is yours," [...] cried Mrs. Knifton, gayly, at the door. Her husband lifted {{her into the}} saddle, mounted himself, and away they both galloped over the moor as wild and happy as a couple of children.|$|E
6000|$|CANDIDA (bustling him goodnaturedly). Oh, come! You great baby, you! You {{are worse}} than usual this morning. Why were you so melancholy <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> along in the cab? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean,' {{she added}} in an undeceiving tone, 'because I saw Mrs. Goodman enter the tent again just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out here; so I have no further responsibility.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The tide is out," [...] {{called a}} gypsy-looking woman to her mates, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{up a long}} row of bins into which the pickers were {{stripping}} the hops.|$|R
6000|$|... "I s'pose she's grown a good deal. But I am tired," [...] the boy said, {{stretching}} himself out. [...] "Me 'n' Benny run {{all the way}} as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> {{in sight}} of the crick, and him 'n' Mis' Hingston wanted me to stay all night, but I wouldn't. I {{wanted to see you}} so much, mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we must chance that, Hawkins. If {{one does}} come you must {{pick us up}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> along. I agree with you; it does look as if {{we should have a}} squall. It may not be {{anything}} very serious, but anyhow, if it comes it will take her along a great deal faster than we can row.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come along," [...] {{said the}} mate, leading the way, with the {{satisfaction}} of an habitué. [...] "Best berth in the room, and about the last they reach in the morning. You see, they got to take us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come,</b> when they call us, and the last feller in at night's the first feller out in the morning, because his bed's the nearest the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a {{lady in the}} house," [...] he observed. [...] "I {{caught a}} glimpse of her in the passage <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in. Did you see her, Edward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Reputation--character--violence--consider,' said Newman, {{clinging}} round {{him with}} both arms, and hurrying him away. 'Let them open the door. We'll go, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came,</b> directly it's shut. Come. This way. Here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{greatest}} danger," [...] Roger said, [...] "would be {{of their}} passing us, unseen; and then lying-to {{near the entrance}} of the port, and overhauling us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in." ...|$|R
