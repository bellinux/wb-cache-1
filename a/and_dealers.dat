5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders <b>and</b> <b>dealers</b> like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; <b>and</b> <b>dealers</b> who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.|$|E

5|$|By December, {{the bottom}} {{had dropped out}} of the {{commemorative}} coin market, <b>and</b> <b>dealers</b> who had purchased quantities found themselves unable to dispose of them at a profit. By 1940 the coin sets were selling for $15 per set. They thereafter recovered, and by the early 1960s had reached $100 a set, and by 1975 $550 per set of three. At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $2,250 a set. R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2015, lists the sets at between $875 and $2,700 depending on condition. Individual coins are cataloged at {{about a third of the}} set prices.|$|E

5|$|Giovanni Villani {{recorded}} many statistics {{associated with}} the city of Florence. This included—but certainly wasn't limited to—figures such as 80 banks located in the city, 146 bakeries, 80 members in an association of city judges with 600 notaries, 60 some physicians and surgical doctors, and 100 some shops <b>and</b> <b>dealers</b> of spices. Each week the city consumed 13,200 bushels of grain while the city annually consumed 4,000 oxen and calves, 60,000 mutton and sheep, 20,000 goats, and 30,000 pigs. He wrote that annually, in the month of July, some 4,000 melons were imported through Porta San Friano.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago {{was created}} {{as the result}} of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics, {{collectors}} <b>and</b> <b>dealers</b> at the home of critic Doris Lane Butler to bring the long-discussed idea of a museum of contemporary art to complement the city's Art Institute of Chicago, according to a grand opening story in Time. It opened in fall 1967 in a small space at 237 East Ontario Street that had for a time served as the corporate offices of Playboy Enterprises. Its first director was Jan van der Marck. In 1970 he invited Wolf Vostell to make the Concrete Traffic sculpture in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|All 12,400 Chevrolet Volts {{produced}} until December 2011, {{including all}} Amperas in stock at European dealerships, {{were scheduled to}} receive the safety enhancements. Since production was halted during the holidays, the enhancements were in place when production resumed in early 2012. Sales continued, <b>and</b> <b>dealers</b> modified the Volts they had in stock. General Motors {{sent a letter to}} Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012. General Motors also decided to replace the 120-volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10,000 Volts sold since late 2010. The new cords were enhanced to add durability, and some of the chargers built after February 5 have the new cords.|$|E

5|$|The Consultative Committee (similar to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} <b>and</b> <b>dealers</b> {{in the coal}} and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between foreign exchange market quality and both trading activity <b>and</b> <b>dealer</b> concentration by considering two currency pairs with significant differences along both dimensions - the Euro-US dollar and Canadian dollar-US dollar.

A GARCH model shows that over-reaction declines as trading activity <b>and</b> <b>dealer</b> concentration increase, with the results being stronger for the Euro. Our results confirm that trading activity is an important determinant of market quality, but also point to a significant role for dealer concentration.
