40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relation between microvascular and venous oxygen pressures during haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation in the pig intestine. To this end microvascular PO 2 (μPO 2) was measured by quenching of Pd-porphyrin phosphorescence by oxygen and validated for the intestines. In addition, mesenteric venous blood gasses, blood flow, ilial CO 2 production and global haemodynamics were also measured. In one group (n= 11), moderate shock was induced by withdrawal of 40 % of the circulating blood volume. Seven of these animals were resuscitated with a crystalloid solution and four with the <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood.</b> In a second group of three animals, a more severe shock was induced by withdrawal of 50 % of the circulating blood volume; these animals were not resuscitated. Baseline mesenteric venous PO 2 and μPO 2 values were similar (60 ± 9 and 60 ± 11 mmHg, respectively). During moderate shock, μPO 2 dropped significantly below mesenteric venous PO 2 (26 ± 10 versus 35 ± 8 mmHg). After resuscitation with crystalloid solution, μPO 2 and mesenteric venous PO 2 rose to 44 ± 9 and 44 ± 6 mmHg, respectively. In the group that received the <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood,</b> values were 41 ± 9 and 53 ± 12 mmHg, respectively. Severe shock resulted in a drop in the mesenteric venous PO 2 (n= 3) to a value similar to that seen in the moderate shock group, but the gut μPO 2 dropped to a much lower value than that of the moderate shock group (15 ± 5 versus 26 ± 10 mmHg).

40|$|Stress stimuli, {{including}} diseases, disturb homeostasis of {{the body}} and enhance secretion of various hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal gland hormones. One of the main hypothalamic hormones secreted in stress conditions is arginine vasopressin (AVP). Vasopressin concentration in the blood reflects the severity of disease and disorders of blood volume. Measurement of vasopressin is difficult and subjected to considerable laboratory error because of the short half-life in serum and its instability in <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood</b> samples. This hormone and copeptin are peptides produced during the cleavage of a larger precursor polypeptide: pre-provasopressin. Both peptides are formed in equimolar amounts. Copeptin is a more stable peptide, measurement of which can be performed with higher accuracy.

Afterwards, 50 % of the <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood</b> was re-infused with equal volumes of 6 % deferoxamine- conjugated hydroxyethyl-starch (D-HES). Hemodilution in HD group was achieved by withdrawing blood at 8 ml/kg accompanied by concomitant infusion of equal volumes of D-HES. Animals were subjected to 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Cardiac output (CO) (thermodilution method), plasma malondialdehyde and nitric oxide content were measured at baseline and until 120 (R 120) min of reperfusion. At R 120, CO in group-C was significantly lower than its baseline value, accompanied by {{a significant reduction in}} nitric oxide production and increase in malondialdehyde concentration; CO in group-SIP and group-HD maintained at baseline levels throughout reperfusion. At R 120, CO in group-SIP, but not in group-HD, was significantly higher than that in group-C. It is concluded that transient SIP followed by hemodilution with D-HES facilitates early functional recovery of the ischemic-reperfused rabbit hearts. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Where indicated after 30 min of ischemia, the <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood</b> was reinfused to restore arterial pressure to normal. Mitochondria isolated from the ipsilateral hemisphere after 30 min of ischemia showed significantly lower respiratory rates than the organelles isolated from the contralateral side. Oxidation of NAD+-linked substrates was more sensitive to inhibition in ischemia (30 %) than was of ferrocytochromec (12 %), succinate oxidation being intermediate. The activities of membrane-bound dehydrogenases (both NADH and succinate-linked) were also significantly lowered. Ischemia {{did not affect the}} cytochrome content of mitochondria. Respiratory activity (NAD+-linked) of mitochondria isolated from the ipsilateral hemisphere was twice as sensitive to inhibition by fatty acid as was of preparations from the contralateral side. Mitochondria isolated from cerebral cortex after 90 min of post-ischemic reperfusion showed no significant improvement in the rate of substrate oxidation. Adenine nucleotide translocase activity and energy-dependent Ca 2 + uptake, both of which decreased significantly in mitochondria isolated from the ischemic brain, showed little recovery, on reperfusion. These observations suggested the strong possibility that the deleterious effects of ischemia on mitochondrial respiratory function might be mediated by free fatty acids that are known to accumulate in large amounts in ischemic tissues.

Normoglycemia and hyperglycemic rats were treated with three different doses of the aqueous extracts, tolbutamide (positive control) and normal saline (negative control). The glucose level of the <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood</b> samples was determined by 0 -toluidine spectrophotometric method.

The aqueous extract produced a dose— dependent reduction (P< 0. 05) in blood sugar levels of normoglycemic and hyperglycemic rats. In normoglycemic rats, the aqueous extract of MO (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) exhibited 23. 14, 27. 05 and 33. 18 % reduction respectively of the blood glucose levels within 6 hours of administration, while tolbutamide (200 mg/kg) showed 33. 29 % (P< 0. 05) reduction.

Whether this occurs during hemorrhagic shock, however, is unknown. We therefore investigated both macro- and microcirculatory variables in the heart as a vital organ and the gut as a nonvital organ. We hypothesized that the microcirculation in the gut would follow the macrocirculation in the acute phase of hemorrhagic shock and isovolemic autologous whole blood resuscitation, but that the microcirculation in the heart would be preserved even under conditions of macrocirculatory depression. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven pigs (23 +/- 4 kg) were anesthetized and subjected to a controlled hemorrhagic shock (30 and 45 % reduction of total blood volume) and isovolemic resuscitation with autologous blood. Quantitative measurement of microvascular oxygen pressures (mu pO 2) was performed by phosphorimetry on the gut and heart simultaneously. Measurements of systemic hemodynamic and regional oxygen-derived variables as well as mu pO 2 were performed at baseline, after the first and second phases of hemorrhage, and after resuscitation.

40|$|Background. Previous {{studies have}} shown that 10 - 30 % {{haemodilution}} with crystalloid may induce a hypercoagulable state demonstrable by using the Thrombelastograph® (TEG). While most are in vitro studies, the few in vivo studies are limited by confounding surgical or 'environmental' factors. We conducted this randomized controlled study to evaluate the coagulation changes associated with in vivo haemodilution. Methods. Twenty patients undergoing major hepatobiliary surgery were randomly allocated to one of two study groups. Group H (n= 10) had 30 % <b>blood</b> volume <b>withdrawn</b> over 30 min and replaced with saline. Group C (n= 10) did not have any <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> <b>Blood</b> samples were taken in both groups at 10, 20 and 30 min. Native TEG, complete blood count, coagulation profile, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, protein C and thrombin-antithrombin complex concentrations were measured. Results. Compared with Group C, Group H patients had significantly greater shortening of r-time at 30 min (- 30 % vs + 36 %), greater shortening of k-time at all time points (- 36 % vs + 17 % at 10 min; - 37 % vs + 44 % at 20 min; - 45 % vs + 49 % at 30 min), and greater widening of α at 30 min (+ 71 % vs + 4 %). The decrease in antithrombin III and other natural procoagulants and anti-coagulants closely followed that of haematocrit, with the exception of thrombin-antithrombin complex. Conclusion. In vivo haemodilution of up to 30 % with saline can induce a hypercoagulable state. The mechanism remains unclear as disproportionate dilution of natural anticoagulants was not detected. Thrombin-antithrombin complex concentration remained stable despite haemodilution in Group H, which may suggest increased thrombin generation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Hemorrhagic shock is a {{clinical}} syndrome involving widespread cellular dysfunction and resulting in injury to many organs. Resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock {{is similar to}} reperfusion after ischemia, but differs in that some blood flow persists during shock. Ischemia-reperfusion produces oxygen radicals in many organs, including the liver of the rat and the human. The hypothesis of this project was that oxygen radicals are produced and cause hepatic injury during resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. The production of oxygen radicals within the liver should cause lipid peroxidation and tissue injury. Manipulation of defenses against oxygen radicals should decrease the hepatic injury caused by hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. The blood pressure of Sprague-Dawley rats was reduced to 35 - 40 mm Hg by blood withdrawal for two hours, followed by reinfusion of <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood.</b> Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels rose and injury to hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells was found on transmission electron microscopy. The presence of lipid peroxidation was determined by quantitation of ethane exhalation and hepatic content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Ethane exhalation was elevated during the hypotensive phase and after resuscitation. Hepatic TBARS levels were elevated after resuscitation only. The same hemorrhagic shock protocol {{was used to determine}} the effect of antioxidant manipulation on hepatic injury. The antioxidants superoxide dismutase, catalase, or deferoxamine produced no reduction in hepatic injury. The administration of phorone reduced hepatic non-protein sulfhydryl content and increased plasma ALT levels nine fold at 24 hours after resuscitation. The development of lipid peroxidation and the exacerbation of liver injury by the administration of phorone suggest that oxygen radicals are produced in the liver during hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. However, the administration of antioxidants provided no protection. Therefore, it seems unlikely the oxygen radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of liver injury in this model. It is possible that the lipid peroxidation occurs after the cell is irreversible injured...|$|R

Unfortunately, at present no direct detection method of ABT is available. In the last years, after the implementation of the Athlete's Biological Passport, scientists have searched novel parameters, combined biomarkers using mathematical approaches and tested new techniques as 'omics' technologies to detect ABT. The present study was performed to determine whether miRNA associated to erythroid phenotype, fetal haemoglobin production and regulation of gamma-globin genes are modulated following ABT. From 6 healthy subjects 500 ml of <b>blood</b> was <b>withdrawn</b> (T 2) and then infused after 35 days (T 5). Blood samples for microarray analysis of miRNAs were taken 5 days before (T 1) and 10 days after blood withdrawal (T 3), at day of infusion (T 5), and at 3 days (T 6) and 15 days (T 8) after infusion. For three subjects the <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood</b> was stored at - 80 °C, for three at + 4 °C before infusion. The global microRNAs profiling was performed for a total of 39 RNA samples (extracted from plasma), using the Agilent Human microRNA microarray v. 21. 0 (#G 4872 A). This chip represents 2549 microRNAs, sourced from the Sanger miRBase database (Release 21). Microarray results were analyzed using the GeneSpring GX 13 software (Agilent Technologies). Differentially expressed miRNAs were selected following determination of the fold-change analysis, taking T 1 as reference sample. Both up-regulated and down-regulated miRNAs were considered. The first set of microRNAs analyzed was constituted by miRNAs related to erythroid differentiation, HbF production and transcriptional regulation of gamma-globin genes. The results obtained allows to conclude that (a) a person-to-person variability is present when the different ABT subjects were analyzed; (b) miRNAs whose expression was found modified following ABT were miR- 766 - 3 p (upregulated), miR- 191 - 3 p (upregulated) ad miR- 16 - 5 p (down-regulated). These results support the concept that miRNA analysis might be considered for detection of ABT when serum samples in analytical test finalized to detection of doping. Acknowledgements.

Methods Ten anaesthetized pigs were instrumented and mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 ml kg(- 1), a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH(2) O and an inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1 : 2. Then, they were submitted in a random order to different ventilatory settings (tidal volume 16 ml kg(- 1), positive end-expiratory pressure 15 cmH(2) O or inspiratory to expiratory time ratio 2 : 1). Functional and static haemodynamic parameters (central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, right ventricular end-diastolic volume and pulse pressure variation) were evaluated at baseline, during hypovolaemia (withdrawal of 20 % of estimated blood volume) and after an infusion of <b>withdrawn</b> <b>blood</b> (posttransfusion). Results During baseline, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 15 cmH(2) O significantly increased pulmonary artery occlusion pressure from 14. 6 +/- 1. 6 mmHg to 17. 4 +/- 1. 7 mmHg (P< 0. 001) and pulse pressure variation from 15. 8 +/- 8. 5 % to 25. 3 +/- 9. 5 % (P< 0. 001). High tidal volume increased pulse pressure variation from 15. 8 8. 5 % to 31. 6 +/- 10. 4 % (P< 0. 001), and an inspiratory to expiratory time ratio of 2 : 1 significantly increased only central venous pressure. During hypovolaemia, high positive end-expiratory pressure influenced all studied variables, and high tidal volume strongly increased pulse pressure variation (40. 5 +/- 12. 4 % pre vs. 84. 2 +/- 19. 1 % post, P< 0. 001). The inversion of the inspiratory to expiratory time ratio only slightly increased filling pressures during hypovolaemia, without without affecting pulse pressure variation or right ventricle end-diastolic volume. Conclusion We concluded that pulse pressure variation measurement is influenced by cyclic variations in intrathoracic pressure, such as those caused by augmentations in tidal volume. The increase in mean airway pressure caused by positive end-expiratory pressure affects cardiac filling pressures and also pulse pressure variation, although to a lesser extent. Inversion of the inspiratory to expiratory time ratio does not induce significant changes in static and functional haemodynamic parameters.

Once the tip of the needle and cannula are introduced into the vein via venipuncture, the cannula is advanced inside the vein over the trocar to the appropriate position and secured, the trocar is then <b>withdrawn</b> and discarded. <b>Blood</b> samples may be drawn directly after the initial IV cannula insertion.|$|R
30|$|During each [11 C]phenytoin scan, {{arterial}} blood samples of 0.1 mL were taken at 20 and 40 s and at 1, 2, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min after [11 C]phenytoin injection. For animals that underwent three scans, {{the amount of}} <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawn</b> was reduced by replacing the two samples at 15 and 30 min with a single 20 -min sample. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 4, 000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and activity in both plasma and whole blood was measured in an automated 1282 Compugamma CS Universal Gamma Counter (LKB Wallac, Turku, Finland), cross-calibrated against the PET scanner. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) {{as a function of}} time were derived by normalizing measured radioactivity concentrations against injected dose and body weight.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the vascular dopamine receptor subtype responsible for specific dopamine-mediated coronary vasodilation. The left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) of pentobarbital anesthetized, open chest dogs was isolated and perfused under either constant flow or constant pressure con-ditions with <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from a cannulated left femoral artery. In animals subjected to constant flow LCX perfusion, after beta adrenoceptor blockade with nadolol (4 mg/kg), alpha-i adrenoceptor blockade with prazosin (0. 5 mg/kg) and alpha- 2 adrenoceptor blockade with idazoxan (1. 0 mg/kg), intracoronary (i. c.) injection of dopamine (0. 01 - 1 0 pg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in LCX perfusion pressure which was un-altered by administration of the dopamine- 2 receptor antagonist dompendone (1 0 ag/kg) but which was blocked completely b...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic drug {{delivery}} is a promising method to target {{a drug to}} a diseased area while reducing negative side effects caused by systemic administration of drugs. In magnetic {{drug delivery}} a therapeutic agent is coupled to a magnetic nanoparticle. The particles are injected and at the target location <b>withdrawn</b> from <b>blood</b> flow by a magnetic field. In this study a FePd nanowire is developed with optimised properties for magnetic targeting. The nanowires have a high magnetic moment to reduce the field gradient needed to capture them with a magnet. The dimensions and the materials of the nanowire and coating are such that they are dispersable in aqueous media, non-cytotoxic, easily phagocytosed and not complement activating. This is established in several in-vitro tests with macrophage and endothelial cell lines. Along with the nanowires a magnet is designed, optimised for capture of the nanowires from the blood flow in the hind leg of a rat. The system is used in a pilot scale in-vivo experiment. No negative side effects from injection of the nanowires were found within the limited time span of the experiment. In this first pilot experiment no nanowires {{were found to be}} targeted by the magnet, or in the liver, kidneys or spleen, most likely the particles were removed during the fixation procedure...|$|R
40|$|Blood {{sampling}} {{can be done}} using {{a syringe}} and needle or a vacutainer kit. Blood collection is usually done from the jugular vein, but the cephalic vein may also be used. Blood sampling from the jugular {{can be done with}} the animal in a sitting position with its head twisted up to one side. The vein is raised by pressure, the needle is inserted into the vein and <b>blood</b> is <b>withdrawn.</b> When enough <b>blood</b> has been collected the pressure on the vein is released and the needle is withdrawn. Afterwards, pressure is applied to the punctured site. REFERENCE: : Lane, DR & Cooper, B 2003 ‘Veterinary nursing’, 3 rd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, pp. 336.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effects of an acute {{treatment}} with a Centella asiatica (CA) extract on the biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical Na 99 m TcO 4 and on the fixation of technetium- 99 m on blood constituents. Wistar rats were treated with CA extract and, 1 hour after, Na 99 m TcO 4 was administered; organs/tissues were withdrawn and weighted. The radioactivity was counted to calculate the percentage of activity per gram (%ATI/g). Also, <b>blood</b> samples were <b>withdrawn,</b> plasma (P), <b>blood</b> cells (BC), insoluble fraction (IF) and soluble fractions of P and BC were isolated and the radioactivity was counted to calculate the percentage of activity (%ATI).

40|$|IT {{has been}} {{established}} that in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis following different loads the level of inorganic phosphate in the plasma as {{compared to that of}} controls shows an increase. This excess of inorganic phosphate in the plasma is formed {{at the expense of the}} organic phosphate esters of the red blood cells (Huszak and Szechenyi, 1959, 1963). The following experiments were performed to determine whether the enhanced dephosphorylation observed under in vivo conditions in the blood of multiple sclerotics can also be demonstrated under in vitro conditions. METHODS <b>Blood</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from multiple sclerotics and control patients (3 volumes of 3 - 8 per cent sodium citrate + 7 volumes of blood) was incubated at 37 °C. in an Erlenmeyer flask and gently shaken without foaming, for 1 to 2 hours.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between plasma renin activity (PRA) at rest and physical fitness was studied in 40 normal young subjects on a liberal sodium intake. Plasma renin activity {{was measured in}} arterial <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawn</b> {{at the end of}} a 30 -min period of rest in recumbency, while physical fitness was expressed by the highest oxygen uptake achieved during an uninterrupted graded exercise test performed in the sitting position on an electromagnetically braked ergometer bicycle (peak VO 2). Log PRA correlated significantly and inversely with peak VO 2 adjusted for body weight (r = - 0. 34; P less than 0. 05) in single regression analysis. Using multiple regression and adjusted peak VO 2, age, urinary sodium excretion and mean intra-arterial pressure as independent variables, no combination of two or more independent variables yielded significant partial correlation coefficients with log PRA. This correlation suggests that PRA at rest is inversely related to the subject's physical fitness. status: publishe...|$|R
