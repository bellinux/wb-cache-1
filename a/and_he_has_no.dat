5|$|The Government runs {{under the}} {{framework}} {{established by the}} Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947. It is a unitary state, containing forty-seven administrative divisions, with the Emperor as its head of state. His role is ceremonial <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> powers related to Government. Instead, it is the Cabinet, composing of the Ministers of State and the Prime Minister, that directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet {{is the source of}} power of the Executive branch, and is formed by the Prime Minister, who is the head of government. He or she is designated by the National Diet and appointed to office by the Emperor.|$|E

25|$|Carl {{arrives at}} Bianca Butcher's (Patsy Palmer) house, after she {{telephones}} him thinking his number {{belonged to her}} father David Wicks (Michael French). Bianca assumes Carl is the plumber, but when the real plumber arrives, Carl says he is the friend of Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) that Bianca called. He learns that Derek is dead, and claims to know his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks), so Bianca gives him her address. He visits Alice, who gives him the box that contained the phone number, which Alice says was found by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Bianca's friend Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) realises that Carl lied about knowing Alice and warns Alice and Bianca {{to be wary of}} him. Carl visits Ian, who denies knowing Derek. Carl realises Ian took £10,000 from the box that Derek owed him, and Ian is terrified of Carl. The next day, Carl sees his ex-girlfriend, Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), who says she is now married and pregnant, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> reason to stay. At the restaurant, Carl makes Ian confess to taking his money, and tells Ian to pay him £500 a week for the foreseeable future. He then tells Kirsty he is not leaving. Ian soon realises the situation between Carl and Kirsty, so he threatens to tell Kirsty about Carl's blackmail. Carl responds by burning Ian's hand.|$|E
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E

25|$|Ronnie {{learns that}} Vincent is seeking revenge on Phil because Phil's father Eric killed Vincent's father Henry. The {{tensions}} between the Mitchells and the Hubbards increase when Phil snatches Vincent's infant daughter, Pearl Fox-Hubbard. Ronnie helps negotiate what she thinks is a truce between the two men, but Fatboy informs her that Vincent is still planning to kill Phil. She organises for men to take Vincent, lock him in the boot {{of his car and}} have it crushed. She is distracted when Jack returns to spend Christmas with Amy. When Ronnie sees Vincent <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> knowledge of the car, she realises the men put someone else in the car boot, but finds it has already been taken to be crushed. After Ronnie tells Vincent what she had planned, he goes to the scrapyard and finds Fatboy is dead. He decides not to tell Ronnie this, and lies that the boot was empty. Ronnie then rekindles her relationship with Jack. She learns from Mick of Dean's attempted rape of Roxy, and Roxy plans to move to Portugal. Glenda returns and tells Ronnie to stop Roxy from leaving but they are unsuccessful when Roxy says Ronnie has controlled her and she needs to be alone. Ronnie re-evaluates her life and, believing that this is the reason why she and Jack are no longer together, asks Jack to leave with Amy as she too needs to be alone. Glenda tells Ronnie that Eric could not have killed Henry and that Vincent's mother, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), must be lying to him. Ronnie tells Claudette to remain civil towards the Mitchells or she will tell Vincent what she knows.|$|E

Watts helps Black trace Dr. Miller (Željko Ivanek) to a hotel, where he informs them that Black was seeking a cure for his [...] "gift"; a seemingly-psychic ability to understand others' psyches. [...] Miller had been helping Black join a clinical trial for a drug called Proloft which would treat temporal lobe abnormalities; however, Black refutes {{that he would be}} interested in such a thing. Visiting a clinic, Black's ability reveals to him that he has been there before, during the nightmarish drug trial he cannot remember. From there, he is able to use the Millennium Group to persuade the drug company to release records which allow him to trace other participants. He finds that one participant died after gouging his own eyes out; the body of the supervising nurse is later found in a dumpster.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, {{eighteen}} years after Hubbard's death, the Church claimed eight million followers worldwide. According to religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, {{this is an}} overestimate, counting as Scientologists people who had merely bought a book. The City University of New York's American Religious Identification Survey found that by 2009 only 25,000 Americans identified as Scientologists. Hubbard's presence still pervades Scientology. Every Church of Scientology maintains an office reserved for Hubbard, with a desk, chair and writing equipment, ready to be used. Lonnie D. Kliever notes that Hubbard was [...] "the only source of the religion, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> successor". Hubbard is referred to simply as [...] "Source" [...] within Scientology and the theological acceptability of any Scientology-related activity is determined by how closely it adheres to Hubbard's doctrines. Hubbard's name and signature are official trademarks of the Religious Technology Center, established in 1982 to control and oversee the use of Hubbard's works and Scientology's trademarks and copyrights. The RTC is the central organization within Scientology's complex corporate hierarchy and has put much effort into re-checking the accuracy of all Scientology publications to [...] "ensur {{the availability of the}} pure unadulterated writings of Mr. Hubbard to the coming generations".|$|E
500|$|This is {{the first}} and only {{fragment}} to be encountered by the player, at the end of Halos sixth level, [...] "343 Guilty Spark," [...] after the Flood breach containment. He enlists the help of the Master Chief, whom he calls a [...] "Reclaimer," [...] to activate Halo's defenses, neglecting to tell the Master Chief that Halo's [...] "defenses" [...] would cause the destruction of all sentient life in the galaxy. He attempts to stop the Master Chief and Cortana from destroying the Pillar of Autumn, and thereby destroying Halo, but is ultimately thwarted when the ship explodes and destabilizes his ring, causing it to break up. Discovered in the system by the Covenant, Spark, known as an [...] "Oracle" [...] to the Prophets, eventually informs the Covenant Hierarchs of how to activate Installation 05 in Halo 2. In Halo 3, Spark allies with the humans and Elites; since his installation has been destroyed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> more orders, Spark decides to help the Master Chief. Leading the Chief across the Ark, Guilty Spark discovers a new, uncompleted Halo, which is being built to replace Installation 04. Guilty Spark is ecstatic, but when Sergeant Johnson prepares to fire the new Halo to stop the Flood—a process that would destroy the incomplete ring and damage the Ark—Spark goes berserk, refusing to let the Reclaimers destroy [...] "his" [...] ring. He is subsequently destroyed by the Master Chief with a Spartan Laser, but Sergeant Johnson is fatally wounded in the fight.|$|E

500|$|... "If Paris {{were worth}} a mass to Henry IV, Boston {{was worth a}} conversion, in the Puritan sense, to William Phips." [...] The turmoil in England and William's {{accession}} to the throne had prompted New France's Governor {{to take advantage of}} the political turmoil in New England, launching a series of Indian raids across the northern frontier in 1689 and early 1690. [...] When a frontier town in Maine was overrun in early March 1690, the French were perceived as instigators and the provisional government of Massachusetts, began casting about for a major general to lead an expedition against the French in Acadia. Phips had not demonstrated military interests as a young man. During King Philip's War, when many took up arms, Phips built ships and cut lumber. John Knepp's journal testifies to Phips constitutional disinterest in military discipline. [...] Yet Phips control of the naval gunship, and his subsequent actions, seem to have suggested he was a good candidate to lead a large military expedition. Sewall writes: Saturday, March 22. Sir William Phips offers himself to go in person, the Governor [...] sends for me, and tells me of it, I tell the [...] Court; they send for Sir William who accepts to go, and is appointed to command the forces. Major Townsend relinquishes with thanks. Sir William had been sent to at first; but some feared he would not go; others thought his Lady would not consent. Court makes Sir William free and swear him Major General, and several others. Adjourn to Boston, Wednesday,14 night one o'clock.This is Sewall's entire entry <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> entry for the next day. It shows that Phips, though knighted, and one of the richest men in the colony, and highly active on the colony's behalf, was not yet able to vote or serve under the provisional government, as they were following the old charter wherein only church members were free. The court, not the church, made Phips free on this Saturday, according to Sewall. Sewall was religiously devout and active in his church congregation and would not likely have misspoken or deliberately withheld information on this point. Sewall's diary is generally considered trustworthy and is widely referenced by historians.|$|E
