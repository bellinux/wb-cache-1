40|$|Objective: To know {{effect of}} hematoma and perihematomal edema volume on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> {{admission}} {{in patients with}} spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia hemorrhage. Methods: this cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} Neurosurgery department, BSMMU to observe effect of hematoma and perihematomal edema volume on GCS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission in patients with spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia hemorrhage. The duration of study period was from November 2005 to April 2007. Results: a total 48 patients were included in the study and the variables that were analyzed included site of hematoma, volume of hematoma, perihematomal edema and the initial GCS score.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the circadian rhythm of circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) is evident <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in six pregnant women and cross-sectional study in 65 women <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery. SUBJECTS: Six pregnant women sampled {{over a period of}} 24 hours, 23 women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> elective caesarean section, and 42 women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> vaginal delivery. RESULTS: In the women sampled serially over a 24 hour period there was an obvious circadian rhythm of IGFBP- 1 with a peak between 01. 00 and 09. 00 hours. In <b>the</b> women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery there was no evidence for any relationship between <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery and maternal or fetal levels of IGFBP- 1. CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythm of IGFBP- 1 is not observed in women in labour. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day is not an important confounding variable in studies on IGFBP- 1 levels <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> normal delivery...|$|R
