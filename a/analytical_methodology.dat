2500|$|Hemispherical photography, {{also known}} as fisheye or canopy photography, is a {{technique}} to estimate solar radiation and characterize plant canopy geometry using photographs taken looking upward through an extreme wide-angle lens (Rich 1990). [...] Typically, the viewing angle approaches or equals 180-degrees, such that all sky directions are simultaneously visible. [...] The resulting photographs record the geometry of visible sky, or conversely the geometry of sky obstruction by plant canopies or other near-ground features. [...] This geometry can be measured precisely and used to calculate solar radiation transmitted through (or intercepted by) plant canopies, {{as well as to}} estimate aspects of canopy structure such as leaf area index.

50|$|A {{concern as}} of late 2010 relates to the {{adoption}} of a new <b>analytical</b> <b>methodology,</b> and a possible impact this may have in clinical medicine. Most clinical laboratories now align their creatinine measurements against a new standardized isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method to measure serum creatinine. IDMS appears to give lower values than older methods when the serum creatinine values are relatively low, for example 0.7 mg/dL. The IDMS method would result in a comparative overestimation of the corresponding calculated GFR in some patients with normal renal function. A few medicines are dosed even in normal renal function on that derived GFR. The dose, unless further modified, could now be higher than desired, potentially causing increased drug-related toxicity. To counter the effect of changing to IDMS, new FDA guidelines have suggested limiting doses to specified maxima with carboplatin, a chemotherapy drug.|$|E

Another theoretical description focused on <b>analytical</b> <b>methodology</b> has examined periodic nonlinear waves known as breathers. These structures provide a means of investigating modulation instability and are solitonic in nature. The Peregrine soliton, a specific breather solution, has attracted attention as a possible type of rogue wave that may have significance in optics and hydrodynamics, and this solution has been observed experimentally in both contexts. Yet, the stochastic nature of rogue waves in optics and hydrodynamics is one of their defining features, but remains an open question for these solutions as well as other postulated analytic forms.|$|E
