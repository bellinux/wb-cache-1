In Ethiopia, the contribution of graduates of <b>agricultural</b> <b>graduate</b> programs to the attempt to transform smallholder agriculture has become a matter of urgency {{in the face of the}} increasing challenge of food insecurity. However, the performance of graduates of those {{programs in}} making concrete contributions to the urgent needs of agricultural development has been patchy at best. There might be no single best solution as to how to make <b>agricultural</b> <b>graduate</b> programs and/or their graduates responsive to the needs of agricultural development.

This article seeks to share the experience of implementing the AgShare project model to develop and use an open education resource (OER) module, and in so doing, furthering our understanding of the possibilities of enhancing the quality of teaching and learning toward its intended purpose [1]. Among the key findings from this experience is that a multimedia OER module developed against clearly defined educational needs, with authentic content designed according to sound educational principles, can lead to direct and immediate improvements in the quality of teaching and learning, which enables learners to acquire knowledge and skills that fit an ultimate purpose in a real-life context...|$|E

An enhanced understanding of attitudes is imperative before effective intervention strategies to moderate attitudes for enhancing acceptance and implementation of VC technology. Including transfer of agricultural innovations, VC can be encouraged in services like training, distance education, extension management, communication, administration, health, education and knowledge sharing.
