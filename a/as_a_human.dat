5|$|In {{the life}} cycle of Plasmodium, a female Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the definitive host) transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E

5|$|The {{exposure}} levels to free crystalline silica in the ash {{are commonly used}} to characterise the risk of silicosis in occupational studies (for {{people who work in}} mining, construction and other industries,) because it is classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
