5|$|The vitriolic {{campaign}} of Richard Wagner against Meyerbeer {{was to a}} great extent responsible for the decline of Meyerbeer's popularity after his death in 1864. This campaign was as much <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> spite as of racism – Wagner had learnt a great deal from Meyerbeer and indeed Wagner's early opera Rienzi (1842) was facetiously called by Hans von Bülow 'Meyerbeer's best opera'. Meyerbeer supported the young Wagner, both financially and in helping to obtain the premiere productions of both Rienzi and The Flying Dutchman at Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge, though this is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> preference.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, {{in a few cases}} completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E

For him, gender included not only one's status as {{a man or a}} woman, but was also <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> recognition, social assignment, or legal determination; not only on the basis of one's genitalia but also on the basis of somatic and behavioral criteria that go beyond genital differences.|$|E
25|$|Toilet paper {{when used}} with a toilet roll holder with a {{horizontal}} axle {{parallel to the floor}} and also parallel to the wall has two possible orientations: the toilet paper may hang over (in front of) or under (behind) the roll; if perpendicular to the wall, the two orientations are right-left or near-away.

5000|$|Military {{strategy}} in the 19th century was still viewed {{as one of a}} trivium of [...] "arts" [...] or [...] "sciences" [...] that govern the conduct of warfare; the others being tactics, the execution of plans and maneuvering of forces in battle, and logistics, the maintenance of an army. The view had prevailed since the Roman times, and the borderline between strategy and tactics at this time was blurred, and sometimes categorization of a decision is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> almost <b>personal</b> opinion. Carnot, during the French Revolutionary Wars thought it simply involved concentration of troops.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} {{of the concept of}} microaggressions in the legal literature. These are statements made by members of a dominant group that serve to denigrate, delegitimate or insult minority members of the community. Often they are unintended and unnoticed by members of the dominant group. This article analyzes such statements in order to show 1) that they are not <b>a</b> simple <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> insult but that they work strategically to disempower minority members; 2) that their dual nature [...] invisibility to one group and offence to the other [...] serves to destabilize and polarize the community itself...|$|R
25|$|Maimonides wrote a responsum {{lifting the}} decree of Ezra, {{based on an}} opinion in the Talmud stating that it had failed to be {{observed}} {{by a majority of}} the community and the Jewish people found themselves unable to sustain it. However, Maimonides continued to follow the Keri restrictions as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> observance. Since then, observance of the rules of Keri and hence regular mikveh use by men fell into disuse in many communities. Hasidic Judaism, however, revived the practice of regular mikveh use, advocating regular daily mikveh use as a way of achieving spiritual purity. The growth of Hasidic Judaism resulted in a revival of mikveh use by men. In addition, some Sephardic and Mizrahi communities continued to observe the rules of keri throughout.|$|E
25|$|The {{conceptions of}} {{homosexuality}} found in classical Islamic texts resemble {{the traditions of}} classical Greece and those of ancient Rome, rather than modern Western notions of sexual orientation. It was expected that many or most mature men would be sexually attracted to both women and adolescent boys (with different views about the appropriate age range for the latter), and men were expected to wish to play only {{an active role in}} homosexual intercourse once they reached adulthood. Preference for homosexual over heterosexual relations was regarded as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> taste rather than a marker of homosexual identity in a modern sense. While playing an active role in homosexual relations carried no social stigma beyond that of licentious behavior, seeking to play a passive role was considered both unnatural and shameful for a mature man. Following Greek precedents, the Islamic medical tradition regarded as pathological only this latter case, and showed no concern for other forms of homosexual behavior.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to final}} assembly, the {{manufacturers}} usually apply a thin coating of clear or colored acrylic lacquer or silver plate over the brass. The lacquer or plating serves {{to protect the}} brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years. It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold, {{and a number of}} gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of lacquer or plating or absence thereof may enhance an instrument's tone quality. The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what constitutes a pleasing tone is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> preference.|$|E

Many extended-range bassists play the bass part in bands, but many also perform their instrument in a solo setting, often using advanced techniques such as two-handed tapping or chording.

500|$|AL President Ban Johnson asked Speaker and Detroit manager Cobb {{to resign}} their posts after a scandal broke in [...] Pitcher Dutch Leonard claimed that Speaker and Cobb fixed {{at least one}} game between Cleveland and Detroit. In a {{newspaper}} column published shortly before the hearings were to begin, Billy Evans characterized the accusations as [...] "purely <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> revenge" [...] for Leonard. The pitcher {{was said to be}} upset with Cobb and Speaker after a trade ended with Leonard in the minor leagues. When Leonard refused to appear at the January 5, 1927, hearings to discuss his accusations, Commissioner Landis cleared both Speaker and Cobb of any wrongdoing. Both were reinstated to their original teams, but each team declared its manager free to sign elsewhere. Speaker did not return to big league managing and he finished his MLB managerial career with a 617–520 record.|$|E
50|$|Centres are {{required}} to cover much of the ice in all three zones. Where the centre tends {{to play in the}} offensive zone is usually <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> coaching and <b>personal</b> preference. Centres are responsible for keeping the flow of the game moving, and generally handle, and pass the puck more than any other position player. Because of this, most good centres tend to score assists rather than goals because the play goes through them as they try to find open teammates.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{distinguishes between}} {{synchronic}} responsibility (SR) and diachronic responsibility (DR). SR concerns an agent's responsibility for an act {{at the time}} of the action, while DR concerns an agent's responsibility for an act at some later time. While most theorists implicitly assume that DR is <b>a</b> straightforward <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> identity, I argue instead that it is grounded in psychological connectedness. I discuss the implications this distinction has for the concepts of apology, forgiveness, and punishment as well as the way in which this distinction can be used to defend quality of will accounts of responsibility against objections involving psychological manipulation. I argue that the intuition that a manipulated agent is not responsible can be explained by appeal to the conditions of DR and, as such, does not unproblematically shed light on the conditions of SR...|$|R
2500|$|The {{accusations and}} {{presumption}} that all idols and images are devoid of symbolism, or that icons of one's own religion are [...] "true, healthy, uplifting, beautiful symbolism, mark of devotion, divine", while of other person's religion are [...] "false, an illness, superstitious, grotesque madness, evil addiction, satanic and {{cause of all}} incivility" [...] is more <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> subjective <b>personal</b> interpretation, rather than objective impersonal truth. Allegations that idols only represent false gods, followed by violence and iconoclastic destruction, state Regina Schwartz and other scholars, {{is little more than}} religious intolerance. The philosopher David Hume in his Dialogue on Religion, wrote that pagan idolatry is premised on pluralism, tolerance and acceptance of diverse representations of the divine, while monotheism has been intolerant, attempted to destroy freedom of expression and has violently forced others to accept and worship their singular view of the divine.|$|R
