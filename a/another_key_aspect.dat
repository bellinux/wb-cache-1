5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>key</b> <b>aspect</b> of SIM Lite's {{mission was}} {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E

In an international context, this view would be known as federalism and paleocons often look to John C. Calhoun for inspiration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>key</b> <b>aspects</b> of ORC {{modeling}} is the computation of {{the organic}} fluid thermodynamic properties. Simple equation of states (EOS) such as Peng-Robinson should be avoided since their accuracy is low.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} a compelling space derived from empirical research which uses an auto/biographical methodology to explore the learning of post-registration nurses. A compelling space is one that invites meaningful learning, where people feel able to take the risk of acknowledging that they do not know and become proactive in developing enquiry. When people are not distanced from one another, physically or psychologically, they can begin to discern where they might learn from as well as with one <b>another.</b> <b>Key</b> <b>aspects</b> of a compelling space are offered and explained and from which I tentatively draw some suggestions for developing nurses’ learning. Definitions of learning as used here draw upon notions of learning as something that may take many forms both formal and non-formal, not least when considered in life- wide as well as lifelong terms (West, Alheit, Siig Andersen and Merrill, 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} {{in the field of}} visual cryptography by extending the Knight's Tour Problem. Designed methodology enhances image encryption but without the need of cover images. It accepts numerical values as key and there is no constraint on the length of <b>key.</b> <b>Another</b> important <b>aspect</b> of the designed methodology is that only a single image has to be transmitted and the actual image can be retrieved hence this approach eliminates the need of transmitting multiple shares...|$|R
25|$|A {{contributing}} {{property is}} any building, structure, object or site {{within the boundaries}} of the district which reflects the significance of the district as a whole, either because of historic associations, historic architectural qualities or archaeological features. <b>Another</b> <b>key</b> <b>aspect</b> of the contributing property is historic integrity. Significant alterations to a property can damage its physical connections with the past, lowering its historic integrity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>key</b> <b>aspect</b> of Reform {{doctrine}} is the personal autonomy of each adherent, who may formulate his own understanding and expression of his religiosity. Reform is unique among all Jewish denominations in placing {{the individual as}} the authorized interpreter of Judaism. This position was originally influenced by Kantian philosophy and the great weight it lent to personal judgement and free will. This highly individualistic stance also proved one of the movement's great challenges, for it impeded the creation of clear guidelines and standards for positive participation in religious life and definition of what was expected from members.|$|E
25|$|Armies {{during the}} Revolution became noticeably larger than their Holy Roman counterparts, and {{combined}} with the new enthusiasm of the troops, the tactical and strategic opportunities became profound. By 1797 the French had defeated the First Coalition, occupied the Low Countries, {{the west bank of}} the Rhine, and Northern Italy, objectives which had defied the Valois and Bourbon dynasties for centuries. Unsatisfied with the results, many European powers formed a Second Coalition, but by 1801 this too had been decisively beaten. <b>Another</b> <b>key</b> <b>aspect</b> of French success was the changes wrought in the officer classes. Traditionally, European armies left major command positions to those who could be trusted, namely, the aristocracy. The hectic nature of the French Revolution, however, tore apart France's old army, meaning new men were required to become officers and commanders.|$|E
40|$|This {{working paper}} {{is part of}} ongoing {{research}} on international comparison between European and Brazilian public policies for cross-sector and multi-actor social responsibility based on a concept of stakeholders’ social responsibility as proposed by Ashley (2010). One of the propositions presented {{here is that the}} process and content of public policy-making and business strategies for CSR can be seen in a co-evolution process, which is co-shaped by social, economic, environmental, political and institutional aspects through interactions between markets, civil society and the State, either at local, regional and national level, {{as well as at the}} global level. This proposition can serve as lenses for comprehension on the variety of perspectives for public policies on CSR in an international context. The paper presents, in a first section, an analysis and discussion on a literature review concerning European public polices for corporate social responsibility. In a second section, it presents a discussion on some recent contributions for research on social responsibility at the organizational and inter-institutional levels. One contribution is the ISO 26000 revised final draft, which migrates from the concept of corporate social responsibility to organizational social responsibility. Another one is a model for an inter-institutional framework for multi-level and multi-actor governance of stakeholders’ social responsibility (Ashley, 2010), to be further developed as part of a research agenda from a perspective of critical social studies. It is here assumed that the choice of theories, methods and goals for a research agenda is also a political decision, affecting the role definition of higher education institutions as relevant contributors for policy making on development cooperation. Thus, one <b>key</b> <b>aspect</b> for future research is on the choice of scope of content – from narrow to broad concepts – and on the time-frame – short, medium or long term time-frames - adopted by researchers for the concept of social responsibility. <b>Another</b> <b>key</b> political <b>aspect</b> for a research agenda on social responsibility is considered on the embedded quality of political interaction between the State, markets and civil-society concerning the mutual contribution for an inter-institutional learning framework in the research agenda and design...|$|R

25|$|Contributing {{properties}} are defined through historic district or historic preservation zoning laws, usually {{at the local}} level. Zoning ordinances pertaining to historic districts are designed to maintain a district's historic character by controlling demolition and alteration to existing properties. In historic preservation law, a contributing property is any building, structure, object or site {{within the boundaries of}} the district that contributes to its historic associations, historic architectural qualities or archaeological qualities of a historic district. It can be any property, structure or object that adds to the historic integrity or architectural qualities that make the historic district, either local or federal, significant. Definitions vary but, in general, they maintain the same characteristics. <b>Another</b> <b>key</b> <b>aspect</b> of a contributing property is historic integrity. Significant alterations to a property can sever its physical connections with the past, lowering its historic integrity. Contributing {{properties are}} integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district. A property listed as a contributing member of a historic district meets National Register criteria and qualifies for all benefits afforded a property or site listed individually on the National Register.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>key</b> <b>aspect</b> of the Mars Express {{mission is}} the Mars Express AI Tool (MEXAR2).

[...] The new AI tool saves operator time, optimizes bandwidth use on the DSN, prevents data loss, and allows better use of the DSN for other space operations as well. [...] The AI decides how to manage the spacecraft's 12 gigabits of storage memory, when the DSN will be available and not be in use by another mission, how to make the best use of the DSN bandwidth allocated to it, and when the spacecraft will be oriented properly to transmit back to Earth.|$|E
