5|$|Fragmentation of {{woodland}} {{can lead}} to local losses of breeding birds, but the species' range is still expanding. It has <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population</b> and huge breeding area, and is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population</b> implies a large market. Though {{underdeveloped}} countries have <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population,</b> their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E
5|$|Richmond Park {{supports}} <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population</b> of {{what are}} believed to be ring-necked (or rose-ringed) parakeets. These bred from birds that escaped or were freed from captivity.|$|E
50|$|Bangladesh and South Korea {{are larger}} and more densely {{populated}} (hence have <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>population),</b> and only Taiwan is smaller and has <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>population</b> (hence <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>population</b> density). There are 21 more countries (12 independent ones and 9 dependent territories) with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>population</b> density, but they all have a smaller population (hence a smaller area). If the water area is not counted then Taiwan is larger, and there are 16 more countries (9 independent ones and 7 dependent territories) with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>population</b> density.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>population</b> spreads {{across the}} Hawaiian Islands every winter, {{ranging from the}} island of Hawaii {{in the south to}} Kure Atoll in the north. These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first {{observed}} in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|In {{late summer}} large shoals of roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) fry congregate around the margins and weed beds, which are predated by the brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha fario) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).

5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care for the needs of such <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population.</b> The priests were expected to be educators, doctors and counsellors, as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the land on which the museum now stands.|$|E
5|$|Jean Keene (October 20, 1923 – January 13, 2009), {{also known}} as the Eagle Lady, was a former rodeo trick rider who became the subject of {{national}} attention due to her feeding of wild bald eagles on the Homer Spit in Homer, Alaska. Although she had many supporters for the feedings, she was also criticized for drawing <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population</b> of eagles to the area. After her death, the city of Homer passed a law prohibiting the feeding of predatory birds.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the major}} {{subspecies}} is under threat, but exsul, as noted above, is probably extinct. There is a slow population increase of common chiffchaff in the Czech Republic.

50|$|Writing in 1949, Sauvy {{described}} potential overpopulation as a 'false problem' {{and argued}} against attempts at global population control. He suggested examining countries {{on a case-by-case}} basis to determine whether they lack the raw materials and natural resources that can support <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>population.</b> Otherwise, he thought that we run the risk of underpopulating a country that could support <b>a</b> much <b>larger</b> <b>population.</b>|$|R
5|$|The American robin has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population</b> of about 320million individuals. The species is not believed {{to approach the}} thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At one point, the bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.|$|E

5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} has <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population</b> ranging {{over much of}} Sub-Saharan Africa.

5|$|There {{are three}} basic {{strategies}} for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is {{introduced in the}} hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>population</b> of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.|$|E
