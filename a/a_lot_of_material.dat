5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> had to be reshot.|$|E

He sent copies of those tapes to people he felt {{would be interested in}} the recordings, asking them to spread the word. Delerium originally intended to release all of that material in a double debut album, but Wilson decided to just pick the songs he considered the best ones. These songs were mastered to make Porcupine Tree's first studio album, On the Sunday of Life... (1991); all of the leftover tracks would be later released on a compilation album called Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape (1994).|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, {{the band}} {{said they had}} {{composed}} 12 songs for their second album. Around this time, the group demoed a handful of songs for Paul Leavitt. The band began recording on April 17, 2007, with producers Matt Squire and Leavitt at SOMD Studios in Beltsville, Maryland. The group previously worked with Leavitt on The Party Scene (2005) and the Put Up or Shut Up EP. According to a studio update posted on April 20, guitarist Jack Barakat revealed the band was in pre-production. The group listened to the demos they had recorded previously, picking and choosing which songs they would work on further, as well as parts of other songs they wanted to retain. Gaskarth said the band went into the studio with around 15 songs, before that number was whittled down to three. They subsequently wrote <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> in the studio.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} Czech musicologist, Zdeněk Nejedlý, a great {{admirer of}} Smetana {{and later a}} communist Minister of Culture, condemned Janáček as an author who could accumulate <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>material,</b> {{but was unable to}} do anything with it. He called Janáček's style [...] "unanimated", and his operatic duets [...] "only speech melodies", without polyphonic strength. Nejedlý considered Janáček rather an amateurish composer, whose music did not conform to the style of Smetana. According to Charles Mackerras, he tried to professionally destroy Janáček. Josef Bartoš, the Czech aesthetician and music critic, called Janáček a [...] "musical eccentric" [...] who clung tenaciously to an imperfect, improvising style, but Bartoš appreciated some elements of Janáček's works and judged him more positively than Nejedlý.|$|E

[...] "After they got rid of us, they brought on Chris Columbus", Murphy stated. [...] "Then I heard they did tests of apes skiing, which didn't make much sense." [...] Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs. Columbus brought Sam Hamm, his co-writer on an unproduced Fantastic Four script, to write the screenplay. [...] "We tried to do a story that was simultaneously a homage to the elements we liked from the five films, and would also incorporate <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> [...] that had been jettisoned from the earlier production," [...] Hamm continued.

500|$|The album {{begins with}} a number of up-tempo songs before {{expanding}} to a variety of tempos for its second half. Vedder attributed the faster and more aggressive songs to the band writing <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> that kept getting pared down, with the band leaving behind mid-tempo songs, while Ament suggested that {{it was because of the}} band balancing recording and touring which resulted in [...] "physicality... from being out on the road." [...] The band attempted to create an environment in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play much as they do live. Ament said that there was [...] "a lot of honing of the guitars and vocals in the middle and toward the end," [...] which resulted in the album sounding [...] "more polished."

500|$|Both the {{character}} and her role as narrator were generally well received by critics throughout the series, and for which Strong received nominations for multiple accolades. In his review of the pilot, Tom Shales of The Washington Post complimented Mary Alice character's narrations, writing: [...] "Even though narration {{has become the most}} overused technique in prime-time television (needed, perhaps, to help move the narrative along quickly now that hour-length shows have shrunk to as little as 41 minutes plus commercials), the producers of Desperate Housewives use it well, and Strong's uncomplaining perkiness adds yet another layer of irony to the enterprise." [...] Peter Schorn of IGN commended Strong's narrations as well as the mystery surrounding Mary Alice's suicide, calling {{the character}}'s [...] "dark secret" [...] the [...] "McGuffin that powers this first season". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe described Mary Alice's suicide scene as [...] "mysterious and somber but mostly funny", pointing out that the soundtrack music remains [...] "light and happy" [...] throughout and likened the character's narration to that of Glenn Close in Reversal of Fortune (1990). Celia Wren, also writing for The Washington Post, confirmed that the [...] "idyllic small-town" [...] setting of Desperate Housewives as well as Mary Alice's narration style as a deceased and omniscient narrator were influenced by Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology (1915), for which she complimented the series, writing: [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> to work with: Masters's poetic portrait gallery from 1915 gets its oomph from blowtorching the concept of idyllic small-town America. Its largely embittered personalities speak from beyond the grave of murders, seductions, suicides, hypocrisies, political corruption—enough scandalous behavior to make Desperate Housewives look like Little Women." ...|$|E

500|$|Production {{was delayed}} for several years; the {{original}} plan was to begin filming after Cruise's [...] was finished. However, that film ran over schedule, which also allowed Spielberg time to bring in screenwriter Scott Frank to rework Cohen's screenplay. John August did an uncredited draft to polish the script, and Frank Darabont was also invited to rewrite, but was by then busy with The Majestic. The film closely follows Frank's final script (written May 16, 2001), and contains much of Cohen's third draft (May 24, 1997). Frank removed the character of Senator Malcolm from Cohen's screenplay, and inserted Burgess, who became the [...] "bad guy". He also rewrote Witwer from a villain to a [...] "good guy", {{as he was in}} the short story. In contrast to Spielberg's next science fiction picture, War of the Worlds, which he called [...] "100 percent character" [...] driven, Spielberg said the story for Minority Report became [...] "fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot." [...] According to film scholar Warren Buckland, [...] "It appears that...Cohen and...Frank did not see" [...] the [...] "Goldman and Schusett screenplay; instead; they worked on their own adaptation." [...] Goldman and Schusett however claimed the pair used <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> from their script, so the issue went through the Writer's Guild arbitration process. They won a partial victory; they were not given writing credits, but were listed as executive producers. The film was delayed again so Spielberg could finish A.I. {{after the death of his}} friend Stanley Kubrick. When Spielberg originally signed on to direct, he planned to have an entirely different supporting cast. He offered the role of Witwer to Matt Damon, Iris Hineman to Meryl Streep, Burgess to Ian McKellen, Agatha to Cate Blanchett, and Lara to Jenna Elfman. However, Streep declined the role, Damon opted out, and the other roles were recast due to the delays. [...] Spielberg also offered the role of Witwer to Javier Bardem, who turned it down.|$|E

2500|$|Talk was {{released}} in March 1994 and is the band's fourteenth studio release. Its cover was designed by pop artist Peter Max. The record was largely composed and performed by Rabin, with the other band members following Rabin's tracks for their respective instrumentation. It was digitally recorded and produced in its entirety by Rabin, using 3.4 GB of hard disk storage split among four networked Apple Macintosh computers running Digital Performer, the first album ever recorded with such software. The album blended elements of radio-friendly rock with a more structurally ambitious approach taken from the band's progressive blueprint, with the fifteen-minute track [...] "Endless Dream". The album reached number 20 in the UK and number 33 in the US. The track [...] "The Calling" [...] reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and [...] "Walls", which Rabin had written with former Supertramp songwriter and co-founder Roger Hodgson, peaked at number 24.

2500|$|Paparizou {{made the}} first {{announcement}} of the new album {{in an interview with}} Down Town Magazine in October 2009; at that time three of the tracks on the album had been completed. She stated that she and her team had gathered <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> and that she was [...] "very pleased" [...] with the outcome thus far, announcing two of the collaborators: singer-songwriter Giorgos Sabanis and lyricist Giannis Doxas, who is also Paparizou's A; both musicians were on the previous album. Doxas thus far has been confirmed as the lyricist of the tracks [...] "Girna Me Sto Htes" [...] (Bring me back to yesterday) and [...] "Thalassa" [...] (Sea), while Sabanis is thus far the composer of all four confirmed tracks. Like the previous album, it was recorded partially in Sweden, where she spent her winter holidays, and also at her professional home studio in Glyfada, Athens. As she had first done on Vrisko To Logo Na Zo, Paparizou contributed musically to the album, having reportedly written the music to one of the songs. Paparizou's fiancé and manager Toni Mavridis composed tracks for the album, as he has done for all of her solo albums, while Dimitris Kontopoulos' inclusion was described as a [...] "surprise," [...] being the first time he has worked with Paparizou since her debut album. Lyricists on the album include Niki Papatheohari who wrote the lyrics to the lead single [...] "An Isouna Agapi", Eleanna Vrahali who had written the lyrics to [...] "Porta Gia Ton Ourano" [...] on the previous album, and Valia Kalantzi. Although Paparizou previously recorded [...] "Papeles Mojados" [...] (wet papers) with Spanish flamenco-electronic group Chambao for her fourth album, that track was re-recorded with vocals from Paparizou rather than an actual collaboration between the two artists, making [...] "Thalassa" [...] her first collaboration to be featured on an album during her solo career and second collaboration overall after [...] "I Zileia Monaxia", a cover of [...] "L'envie d'aimer" [...] with TV presenter Nikos Aliagas, released on his album project Rendez-Vous (2007).
