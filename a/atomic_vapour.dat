These developments have been targeted at addressing {{some of the issues}} associated with loading atomic vapours in confined waveguiding geometries such as increased dephasing and physio-chemical wall absorptions. <b>Atomic</b> <b>vapour</b> loaded HC-PCF and PMC’s have applications in laser metrology, coherent optics and magneto optical spectroscopy. State of the art HC-PCF have been fabricated for loading with <b>atomic</b> <b>vapour</b> including both photonic bandgap (PBG) guiding and inhibited coupling (IC) hypocycloidal core shape Kagome HC-PCF. Record loss of 70 dB/km has been achieved in IC hypocycloid core shape Kagome HC-PCF in the spectral region centred at 800 nm. This fibre retains excellent single mode propagation combined with large core and increased optical bandwidth in comparison with specialist PBG HC-PCF optimised for operation around 800 nm. Aluminosilicate sol-gel coatings have been developed and successfully applied to the inner core wall of HC-PCF’s to reduce the <b>atomic</b> <b>vapour</b> surface interaction.

40|$|Multiple {{scattering}} is {{a process}} in which a particle is repeatedly deflected by other particles. In an overwhelming majority of cases, the ensuing random walk can successfully be described through Gaussian, or normal, statistics. However, like a (growing) number of other apparently inofensive systems, diffusion of light in dilute <b>atomic</b> <b>vapours</b> eludes this familiar interpretation, exhibiting a superdiffusive behavior. As opposed to normal diffusion, whereby the particle executes steps in random directions but with lengths slightly varying around an average value (like a drunkard whose next move is unpredictable but certain to within a few tens of centimeters), superdiffusion is characterized by sudden abnormally long steps (Lévy flights) interrupting sequences of apparently regular jumps which, although very rare, determine the whole dynamics of the system. The formal statistics tools to describe superdiffusion already exist and rely on stable, well understood distributions. As scientists become aware of, and more familiar with, this non-orthodox possibility of interpretation of random phenomena, new systems are discovered or re-interpreted as following Lévy statistics. Propagation of light in resonant <b>atomic</b> <b>vapours</b> is one of these systems that have been studied for decades and have only recently been shown to be the scene of Lévy flights.
