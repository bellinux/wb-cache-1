Grumman's Wildcat production ceased in early 1943 {{to make way}} for the newer F6F Hellcat, but General Motors continued producing Wildcats for both U.S. Navy and Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>use.</b> Late in the war, the Wildcat was obsolescent as a front line fighter compared to the faster (380 mph/610 km/h) F6F Hellcat or much faster (446 mph/718 km/h) F4U Corsair. However, they were adequate for small escort carriers against submarine and shore threats. These relatively modest ships carried only two types of aircraft (along with the GM-built TBM Avengers). The Wildcat's lower landing speed and ability to take off without a catapult made it more suitable for shorter flight decks. At first, GM produced the FM-1, identical to the F4F-4, but reduced the number of guns to four, and added wing racks for two 250 lb (110 kg) bombs or six rockets.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effect of arm motor {{impairment}} on actual <b>arm</b> <b>use</b> in the early post-stroke period and explore its association with self-care dependency. Subjects: Thirty-one patients recruited within the 30 first days after stroke. Methods: Motor impairment of the upper extremity was measured with Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA) and <b>arm</b> <b>use</b> was measured with accelerometry. Arm movement ratio (AMR), the ratio of <b>arm</b> <b>use</b> duration between the more and less affected arm, was calculated. Self-care dependency was defined as needing personal assistance in primary self-care activities. Results: FMA of the more affected arm was strongly associ-ated with AMR (Spearman’s correlation coefficient – 0. 851, p> 0. 001), although some patients deviated considerably from the regression line. Covariates {{did not have any}} influence on this relation. Both arm motor function and actual <b>arm</b> <b>use</b> re-lated to self-care dependency, but were no longer significant when we controlled for lower extremity motor function. Conclusion: FMA and AMR correlated highly in the early post-stroke period. These measures relate to different di-mensions of the International Classification of Functioning and Health, and could be supplementary measures to reveal non-use of the affected arm. <b>Arm</b> <b>use</b> and arm impairment were not significantly associated with self-care dependency in our sample...|$|E
40|$|Motor {{training}} with the upper limb affected by stroke partially reverses {{the loss of}} cortical representation after lesion and has been proposed to increase spontaneous <b>arm</b> <b>use.</b> Moreover, repeated attempts to use the affected hand in daily activities create a form of practice that can potentially lead to further improvement in motor performance. We thus hypothesized that if motor retraining after stroke increases spontaneous <b>arm</b> <b>use</b> sufficiently, then the patient will enter a virtuous circle in which spontaneous <b>arm</b> <b>use</b> and motor performance reinforce each other. In contrast, if the dose of therapy {{is not sufficient to}} bring spontaneous use above threshold, then performance will not increase and the patient will further develop compensatory strategies with the less affected hand. To refine this hypothesis, we developed a computational model of bilateral hand use in arm reaching to study the interactions between adaptive decision making and motor relearning after motor cortex lesion. The model contains a left and a right motor cortex, each controlling the opposite arm, and a single action choice module. The action choice module learns, via reinforcement learning, the value of using each arm for reaching in specific directions. Each motor cortex uses a neural population code to specify the initial direction along which the contralateral hand moves towards a target. The motor cortex learns to minimize directional errors and to maximize neuronal activity for each movement. The derived learning rule accounts for the reversal of the loss of cortical representation after rehabilitation and the increase of this loss after stroke with insufficient rehabilitation.

In Paper II, we found that CIMT initiated within 28 days after stroke occurrence was safe and feasible but did not improve long-term motor function.
