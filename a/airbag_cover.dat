50|$|Inside, the S5 {{receives}} {{some new}} features. Dials {{in the center}} console get the chrome treatment along with {{the edges of the}} buttons for the windows, 4 Audi MMI control buttons and Audi's 3G+ MMI which has a slightly refreshed interface and now features Google Earth maps. Audi has brought the shift knob from the RS5 to the S5. There is a shift from having four buttons down each side of the console, to just two {{with the addition of a}} Menu and Car buttons below the MMI control dial (Audi has removed the skip forward / backward buttons that previously occupied the space on either side of the back button). Lastly, a flat-bottom steering wheel style will have a new circular <b>airbag</b> <b>cover</b> as well as piano black trim.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} presents six simultaneous innovative occupant {{near side}} lateral impact protection concepts including a dynamic door, high-volume side airbag, a large external <b>airbag</b> that <b>covers</b> doors, sill and B-pillar of the struck vehicle and other concepts {{for increasing the}} distance between the occupant and the door panel (active armrest, inflatable door beam and moving seat). All systems are based on pre crash detection of the impact and are activated as soon as 80 ms before the impact. This paper details the task of integrating these systems into a vehicle using FE models, sled tests, and full scale crash tests. Sled test dummy responses were compared with and without the countermeasures. Postprint (published version...|$|R

50|$|The hood of most {{vehicles}} {{is usually}} fabricated from sheet metal, {{which is a}} compliant energy absorbing structure and thus poses a comparatively small threat. Most serious head injuries occur when there is insufficient clearance between the hood and the stiff underlying engine components. A gap of approximately 10 cm is usually enough to allow the pedestrian’s head to have a controlled deceleration and a significantly reduced risk of death. Creating room under the hood {{is not always easy}} because usually there are other design constraints, such as aerodynamics and styling. In some regions of the hood it can be impossible. These include along the edges on which the hood is mounted and the cowl, where the hood meets the windshield. Engineers have attempted to overcome this problem by using deformable mounts, and by developing more ambitious solutions such as airbags that are activated during the crash and cover the stiff regions of the hood. Some models, like the Citroën C6 and Jaguar XK feature a novel pop-up bonnet design, which adds 6.5 cm (2.5", C6) extra clearance over the engine block if the bumper senses a hit. In 2012 and 2015, the Volvo V40 and the Land Rover Discovery Sport have an under-the hood airbag which operates if the hood senses a hit. The <b>airbag</b> also <b>covers</b> the windshield pillars to provide better protection in all areas struck by the pedestrian's head.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Advanced Restraint System has lead to an innovative {{way in which we}} evaluate the systems effect on the occupant. This paper presents some initial investigation into the driver airbag system that consists of an inflator, cushion fold, tear seam pattern, and offset of the <b>airbag</b> <b>cover</b> to steering wheel rim plane. An initial DOE is reviewed to establish significant parameters and to identify equations for further investigation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relevance}} of certain parameters for virtual testing of the driver's side OOP problem and attempts {{to answer the following}} questions: Which level of detail is needed in the airbag models to assess occupants' injury values for OOP scenarios? What is the influence of the <b>airbag</b> <b>cover</b> on the occupant response for OOP situations and how to accurately model the <b>airbag</b> <b>cover?</b> Are current dummy models suitable to assess the localized human injuries and/or is it beneficial to include human models for injury assessment? The combined multibody-FE code MADYMO was used. A virtual set-up of a folded driver airbag including cover, steering wheel and a simple seat forms the base model. Occupants were positioned according to the two OOP driver positions defined in FMVSS 208, i. e. chin on module to maximize neck injury risk and chest on module to maximize chest injury risk. The 5 th percentile Hybrid III. dummy model as well as the 5 th percentile human model were used and different airbag inflation and cover modeling techniques were investigated. Attention was focussed on analyses of the injury values obtained from the simulations of the different situations (with / without cover, use of gasflow, human / dummy model). From this study, it is concluded {{that it is important to}} take into account the geometrical effects of the <b>airbag</b> <b>cover</b> on airbag deployment and hence injury generation in OOP simulations. Adding a gasflow description to the airbag deployment simulation resulted in differences in the early deployment phase. If the dummy's injuries are determined in this phase (dependent of scenario), gasflow contributes to improved airbag modeling at the cost of higher CPU times. From the human model simulations, it is concluded that for this specific scenario, using dummy models could lead to underestimation of human injuries in the chest region, in contrast to overestimation of the head acceleration and the neck loads in the rebound phase. Therefore, human models could provide additional value compared to dummy models. Copyright © 2004 TNO-Automotive...|$|E
5000|$|This model {{launched}} in the United States for the 1993 model year as the Mirage, with all variants now sourced from Japan (instead of Japan or Illinois as previously). The same body shapes were also sold as the Dodge and Plymouth Colt in both the United States and Canada. The six-window greenhouse sedan was sold in these countries as the Eagle Summit alongside a coupé of the same name. For the Mitsubishi branded versions sold only in the United States, the coupé and four-window sedan were offered in base, S, ES and LS trim levels. Five-speed manual transmission was standard, although an automatic was optional on all Mirages except the S coupé. Mitsubishi kept the preceding generation's base 1.5-liter 4G15 engine with , but fitted the ES and LS sedans with the new 1.8-liter 4G93 engine rated at [...] For the 1994 model year, Mitsubishi introduced a driver's airbag, the LS sedan lost its optional anti-lock brakes, and the LS coupé gained the 1.8-liter engine previously exclusive to sedans. The 1994 model year was {{the last year of}} retail sales for Mirage sedans (which became limited to fleets) and for the Dodge and Plymouth Colts altogether, although the Eagle Summit sedan and coupé remained on sale alongside the Mirage coupé through to 1996. As a consequence, only S and LS Mirage coupés returned for model year 1995, and both benefitted from a new passenger's side <b>airbag</b> and <b>covered</b> center console (and therefore the deletion of the motorized front seatbelts). The 1995 Mirage LS coupé gained uprated 14-inch wheels, but deleted access to power windows, power door locks, and cruise control.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signals from}} the various sensors are fed into the Airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various {{additional}} restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and [...] "curtain" [...] <b>airbags</b> which <b>cover</b> the side glass). Each restraint device is typically activated {{with one or more}} pyrotechnic devices, commonly called an initiator or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between 1 and 3 amperes in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a seat belt pre-tensioner, this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the airbag inflator. The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds. An airbag must inflate quickly in order to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60-80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.|$|R
30|$|Extensive {{studies have}} shown that the airbag {{deployment}} in load cases consists of two occupant loading phases: a punch-out effect where the airbag bursts out of its container with the airbag and <b>airbag</b> module <b>cover</b> accelerating towards the occupant and a second loading phase during which the airbag is taking on its deployed shape and volume (membrane-loading effect). Bankdak et al. (2002) developed an experimental airbag test system to study airbag-occupant interactions during close proximity deployment. The results provided insight for simulating the effect of inflation energy and mass flow on target response. Bedard et al. (2002) found that while left-side (driver-side) impacts accounted for only 13.5 % of all crashes, the fatality rate among these crashes was 68.3 % in comparison to front impact (48.3 %), right-side impact (31.3 %), and rear impact (38.4 %). These studies underscore the importance of occupant safety during side-impact collisions. In the last years, the current market requested to reduce the time and cost airbag development. In order to achieve this result, virtual simulations play an important role since they allow to minimize the number of experimental tests (Pei et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2014). Several simulation models of airbag were established (Wang et al. 2007). It is feasible to optimize the parameters of airbag deployment using simulation technology. Experimental and numerical studies have quantified injury risks to close-proximity occupants from deploying side airbags. These studies have focused on the prevention of the most adverse effects of airbag deployment (Duma et al. 2003). Other studies have proposed airbag characteristics to minimize particular biomechanical responses (Haland and Pipkorn 1996). In a more recent study, Marklund and Nilsson (2003) compared deformation patterns with experimental data as well as the computational costs associated with three different airbag deployment simulation methods; they concluded that the SPH method is relatively inexpensive and produces incremental deformation patterns that compare most closely to the experimental results. The process of inflation of an airbag is one of the determining factors in saving lives. The duration from the initial impact of the crash to the full inflation of an airbag is about 40  ms, and during this time, the airbag goes from being in a folded state to a fully inflated state, with a high internal pressure. After achieving this state, the airbag begins to deflate, thus providing a nice cushion for the body impacting it. Ideally, the person in the crash should come into contact with the airbag at this time. In the present study, a large volume passenger side airbag model is developed to handle different collision scenarios. The main aim is evaluate the performance of deploying of passenger side airbag using finite element methods (FEM).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the effectiveness of a passenger airbag can be increased by making the passenger airbag adaptive to crash conditions, such as severity and type of impact, belt use, and passenger size. Such an adaptive passenger <b>airbag</b> will better <b>cover</b> a wider range of crash situations than a conventional airbag system. In this study, mathematical modeling was performed for the optimization of an existing passenger airbag restraint system. The final solution can be used as reference for the design of an adaptive airbag system. The present study was divided into four steps: (1) a FEM airbag model was developed by using the MADYMO 3 D program based on an existing prototype of a passenger airbag; (2) the airbag model was validated against airbag static deployment tests, airbag drop tests, and sled tests; (3) the performance of passenger airbag systems of different volumes was evaluated in terms of injury criteria for front seat occupants of different sizes; (4) a parameter study with different impact conditions and varying levels of variables was carried out to find an optimized design of an adaptive passenger airbag restraint system. Three variables selected for passenger airbag optimization are the airbag volume, the bag pressure, and the size of the ventilation hole. Four input factors that varied in different crash conditions are the dummy size, belted/unbelted, impact speed, and rigid/deformable barrier. The HIC, chest acceleration, chest deflection, neck moment, and axial femur force were calculated in each simulation. The effectiveness of the passenger airbag models was evaluated in terms of the injury criteria of FMVSS 208 and other relevant injury parameters. The influence of the airbag variables on the dummy response was analyzed and discussed. The size of the ventilation hole was found to have the dominating influence on the performance of the airbag. The best effect of the passenger airbag system could be obtained either by using a small airbag with high initial pressure or by using a big airbag with low initial pressure. The findings in the present study indicate that a midsize volume (120 -liter) airbag with variable venthole can give front seat occupants of different sizes better protection over a range of crash severities than a conventional big (150 -liter) airbag with only one size of venthole. The results from this study can be used for the development of a future adaptive passenger airbag system...|$|R
40|$|When {{implementing}} a managed healthcare intervention among a working population, evidence-based healthcare is critical. In the current study, {{the change of}} work posture of sewing-machine operators from seated to stand-up (the intervention) was managed within a physiotherapy and ergonomics programme (programme) in Johnson Controls Automotive S. A. (Pty) Ltd (company) without local evidence to guide the postural transition. The management of the intervention, implemented {{over a period of}} 4. 5 years, presented the opportunity for a retrospective longitudinal study. The study determined the impact of the change in work posture on the incidence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) from June 2004 to January 2009 (period). The role of the physiotherapist in the programme was to deliver manual therapy to all sewing-machine operators with WRMSDs, and to provide a clinical - ergonomics service, {{as a member of a}} multidisciplinary team, to the company. The population of sewing-machine operators (n= 123) was described in terms of personal factors (e. g. age, medical history, musculoskeletal history, and body mass index (BMI)), ergonomic risk factors (e. g. work posture, force and duration) and overall incidence of WRMSDs. The associations of risk factors (personal and ergonomic) with WRMSDs, and work posture with WRMSDs among sewing-machine operators were statistically determined. The majority of the population (97. 6 %) was female, with mean age 42. 3 ± 8 years. At baseline, 17. 9 % were hypertensive, 3. 3 % had arthritis, 6. 5 % were diabetic, and the mean BMI was 29. 7 kg/m² (22 % of BMIs was normal). The largest proportion of the sewing-machine operators were sewing cloth and leather (79. 7 %) (compared to sewing cloth and vinyl), and the remainder performed forceful precision stitching (20. 3 %), including headrest <b>covers,</b> <b>airbags</b> and top stitching on the final product. Job rotation took place between forceful precision stitching and straight stitching (for 36. 6 % of the sewing-machine operators). p> The intervention was implemented within the study period. At baseline 100 % of sewing machine operators were sewing in the seated work posture. Early in the study, 17. 9 % of them changed their work posture from seated to stand-up, 30. 1 % changed to the stand-up work posture in January 2007, and 34. 9 % a year later. The last 17. 1 % remained seated till the last year of the study period. From July 2008, 100 % of the sewing-machine operators were sewing in the stand-up work posture. The results indicated two strong associations of risk factors and a change in work posture with WRMSDs. Obesity (specifically morbid obesity) was a personal risk factor for upper limb disorders and working in the stand-up work posture was protective for spinal disorders, compared to working in the seated work posture. Furthermore, the results indicated a high incidence of disorders (specifically of the spinal area and upper limb) during the first three months of the programme, as well as an increased incidence of lower leg disorders for the first and consecutive month of the change in work posture from seated to standing up. Lower limb disorders were specifically associated with obesity. The increase of lower limb disorders during the postural adaptation phase was temporary, and was addressed within the programme with proper shoe wear, silicone innersoles, supportive stockings and exercises. The combination proved to be effective in preventing and/or managing lower limb disorders. The outcome of the current study provided evidence on the incidence of WRMSDs, and associations between risk factors and work posture, and WRMSDs among sewing machine operators managed within the programme.
