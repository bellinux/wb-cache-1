5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses. Although the donkey’s {{gastrointestinal}} tract has no marked differences in structure {{to that of}} the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food <b>and</b> <b>thrive</b> on less forage than a similar sized pony. They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is thought that they may have a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid <b>and</b> <b>thrive</b> best {{in small}} groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be kept in every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how trust, connectivity <b>and</b> <b>thriving</b> drive employees’ innovative {{behaviors in the}} workplace. Using a sample of one hundred and sev-enty two employees {{across a variety of}} jobs and industries, we investigated the relationship between trust, connectivity (both measured at Time 1), <b>thriving</b> <b>and</b> innovative work behaviors (both measured at Time 2). Trust and connectivity were hypothesized to create a nurturing environment that enables people to <b>thrive</b> <b>and</b> be innovative in their work. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) indicate a sequential mediation model in which connectivity mediates the relationship between trust <b>and</b> <b>thriving,</b> <b>and</b> <b>thriving</b> mediates the relationship between connectivity and innovative behaviors. The theoretical and practical implications for employee <b>thriving</b> <b>and</b> innovative behaviors at work are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Somewhere between 29 and 67 {{species are}} {{recognised}} in the genus, with estimates {{of as many as}} 100. Incomplete herbarium collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species, or groups of similar species. Attalea species {{have a long history of}} human use, and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre. Many species are fire tolerant <b>and</b> <b>thrive</b> in disturbed habitats. Their seeds are animal dispersed, including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, <b>and</b> <b>thrive</b> in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E
5|$|The area roughly {{located between}} the Danube, Tisza and Dniester rivers – {{approximately}} coinciding with modern-day Romania – became {{home to a}} varied group of Thracian peoples including Getae and Dacians sometime around the 7th to 6th centuries BC. The Getae and Dacians are related, but, distinct peoples that are sometimes treated as a single group {{under the name of}} Geto-Dacians. The Getae and Dacian peoples held many cultural and linguistic similarities. The Getae living in the lower Danube basin were able to establish regular trading commerce with the Greek cities along the coast of the Black Sea. The Dacians were located in the Carpatho-Danubian basin along the southern border of the Carpathian Mountains. This geographic isolation allowed the Dacians to survive catastrophic struggles – often with the Getae – <b>and</b> <b>thrive</b> to become the dominant tribe by the 1st century BC.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the first}} billion years of Earth's history, life {{appeared}} in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve <b>and</b> <b>thrive.</b> In {{the history of the}} Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over 7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has about 200 sovereign states.|$|E
5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow <b>and</b> <b>thrive</b> on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|E
