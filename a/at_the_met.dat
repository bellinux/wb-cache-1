5|$|For its 1908–09 {{season the}} Metropolitan {{management}} {{brought in the}} Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini to share duties with Mahler, who made only 19appearances in the entire season. One of these was a much-praised performance of Smetana's The Bartered Bride on 19 February 1909. In {{the early part of}} the season Mahler conducted three concerts with the New York Symphony Orchestra. This renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired him to resign his position with the opera house and accept the conductorship of the re-formed New York Philharmonic. He continued to make occasional guest appearances <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met,</b> his last performance being Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades on 5 March 1910.|$|E
5|$|The Costume Institute Gala {{is a major}} {{fundraising}} {{benefit that}} serves as an opening celebration for the Institute's annual fashion exhibit. Following the event, the exhibition runs for several months. The 2014 exhibition was scheduled to run from May 8 until August 10, 2014. The Gala {{is widely regarded as}} one of the most exclusive social events in New York and one of the biggest fundraising nights in the city with $9 million raised in 2013 and a record of $12 million the following year. It is one of the most notable sources of funding for the Institute. The affair, attended by personalities from the arts, fashion, high-society, film and music, has been held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> since 1948 and is considered to be the fashion industry's premier annual red carpet event. Its red carpet fashions are widely photographed, reviewed, critiqued and emulated. The museum is closed to the general public on the first Monday of May due to the gala occurring.|$|E
5|$|When Karajan {{was in a}} {{position}} to do so he added Falstaff to the repertoire of his opera company at Aachen in 1941, and he remained a proponent of the work for the rest of his career, presenting it frequently in Vienna, Salzburg and elsewhere, and making audio and video recordings of it. Solti also became closely associated with Falstaff, as did Carlo Maria Giulini; they both conducted many performances of the work in mainland Europe, Britain and the US and made several recordings. Leonard Bernstein conducted the work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and the Vienna State Opera, and on record. The advocacy of these and later conductors has given the work an assured place in the modern repertoire.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of plutonium {{was found to}} resemble uranium {{after a few months}} of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. On December 2, 1942, on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.|$|E
25|$|By {{the year}} of her marriage, Bampton was feeling highly {{frustrated}} with her lack of good roles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b> She therefore decided to establish herself in the soprano repertoire, beginning with a portrayal of Leonora in Il Trovatore <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> on May 7, 1937 with Arthur Carron as Manrico. Her Met career <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> flourished after this point with her roles at the house over the next thirteen years including Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Elisabeth in Tannhäuser, Elsa in Lohengrin, Kundry, and the title roles in Gluck's Alceste and Verdi's Aida among others. Her most frequent role at the house was Sieglinde in Die Walküre alongside Lauritz Melchior. In January 1940 she showed an incredible level of musical versatility when she sang performances of both Aida and Amneris {{within a week of}} each other <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b> Her last and 112th performance at the house was as Elsa on April 17, 1950 with Set Svanholm in the title role and Fritz Stiedry conducting.|$|E
25|$|Scott began archaeological {{field work}} with the Egypt Exploration Society at Armant (1929-30), {{following}} which she took {{a job with the}} Metropolitan Museum of New York's Department of Egyptian Art.

She later expanded into organizing exhibitions and contributed over a dozen articles to the Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She also took part in a 1933 Danish expedition at Hama in Syria. By 1968, she had risen to be chief curator of Egyptian art <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met</b> and was the editor of several museum monographs.

25|$|The National Football League (NFL) {{was also}} {{interested}} in placing a team <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Met.</b> Conversations were had with Violet Bidwill Wolfner, owner of the Chicago Cardinals, about moving her team to the stadium.
