5|$|Eusebius characterizes Urbanus {{as a man}} {{who enjoyed}} some variety in his punishments. One day, shortly after Easter 307, he ordered the virgin Theodosia from Tyre (Ṣūr, Lebanon) thrown to the sea for conversing with Christians {{attending}} trial and refusing sacrifice; the Christians in court, meanwhile, he sent to Phaeno. On a single day, November 2, 307, Urbanus sentenced a man named Domninus to be burned alive, three youths to fight as gladiators, and <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> to be exposed to a beast. On the same day, he ordered some young men to be castrated, sent three virgins to brothels, and imprisoned a number of others, including Pamphilus of Caesarea, <b>a</b> <b>priest,</b> scholar, and defender of the theologian Origen. Soon after, and for unknown reasons, Urbanus was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, tried, and executed, all in one day of expedited proceedings. His replacement, Firmilianus, was a veteran soldier and one of Maximinus's trusted confidants.|$|E

5|$|Hoffman's second role of {{the year}} came {{opposite}} Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in John Patrick Shanley's Doubt, where he played Father Brendan Flynn– <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> accused of sexually abusing a 12-year-old African American student in the 1960s. Hoffman was already familiar with the play and appreciated the opportunity {{to bring it to}} the screen; in preparing for the role, he talked extensively to <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> who lived through the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian suspicious of it as Oscar bait, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.|$|E

5|$|In 1766 John Egerton, Bishop of Bangor, {{appointed}} {{an elderly}} English priest, Dr Thomas Bowles, to the parish of St Beuno, Trefdraeth and its chapelry of St Cwyfan, Llangwyfan. Between them the parish and chapelry had about 500 parishioners, of whom all but five spoke only Welsh, whereas Bowles spoke only English. The parishioners and churchwardens of Trefdraeth petitioned against Bowles's appointment, {{arguing that the}} appointment of <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> who did not speak Welsh breached the Articles of Religion, the Act for the Translation of the Scriptures into Welsh 1563 and the Act of Uniformity 1662. In 1773 the Court of Arches ruled that only clergy who could speak Welsh should be appointed to Welsh-speaking parishes, and Bowles {{should not have been}} appointed, but he now held the ecclesiastical freehold of the benefice and the case to deprive him of it had not been proved. The court therefore let Bowles stay in post, which he did until he died in November of that year. Bowles was then replaced in the parish and chapelry with Richard Griffith, <b>a</b> <b>priest</b> who spoke Welsh.|$|E
