50|$|The {{modernisation}} of {{the fleet}} was continued with the delivery from 1957 to 1963 of large carriages from Waggonfabrik Rastatt, including the OEG’s first <b>articulated</b> <b>train</b> sets in 1960.

5000|$|Like {{the earlier}} <b>articulated</b> <b>trains,</b> {{this meant that}} train lengths would be {{difficult}} to change. Their solution to this problem was to modify the power cars (engines) to allow the trains to be coupled end-to-end. Since <b>articulated</b> <b>trains</b> required [...] "special" [...] cars at either end anyway (to fill in the otherwise missing bogie), the C&O was double-ended, with a power car at each end. The power cars were organized with their two diesel engines {{on either side of the}} train, and the operators cabin in a [...] "pod" [...] on top. This left enough room for a passageway to run between the engines and under the pod to the nose of the car, where a coupling and doors were hidden behind a pair of movable clamshell covers. That way the train could be attached front-to-end with another, providing some of the flexibility in train lengths that coupled cars offered, while still being as lightweight as a normal articulated design.|$|R

The first replacements of the older Sprague trains began with experimental <b>articulated</b> <b>trains</b> and then with mainstream rubber-tyred metro MP55 and MP59, some of the latter still in service (line 11).

50|$|Beginning in the 1970s, a {{consortium}} of several companies started to study Bombardier Transportation's LRC, which was a more conventional approach to high-speed rail, in having separate cars and locomotives, rather than being an <b>articulated</b> <b>train.</b> Pulled by heavy conventional-technology diesel-electric locomotives designed for 201 km/h normal operating speed, inspired by the British InterCity 125, it entered full-scale service in 1981 for Via Rail, linking cities in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor, but at speeds never exceeding the 170 km/h limit mandated by line signalling. It was the world's first active tilting train in commercial service.|$|E
50|$|In 1945, a Spanish engineer, Alejandro Goicoechea, {{developed}} a streamlined <b>articulated</b> <b>train</b> {{able to run}} on existing tracks at higher speeds than contemporary passenger trains. This was achieved by providing the locomotive and cars with a unique axle system that used one axle set per car end, connected by a Y-bar coupler. Amongst other advantages, the centre of mass was only half as high as usual. This system became famous {{under the name of}} Talgo (Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol), and for half a century was the main Spanish provider of high-speed trains.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a qualitative {{comparison of the}} key characteristics and subsequent impact performance for <b>articulated</b> and non-articulated <b>train</b> types. The fundamental purpose of the article is through a review of <b>articulated</b> and non-articulated <b>trains</b> in terms of impact stability to identify and compare the areas referred to as ‘impact worthiness’ design. The major differences between <b>articulated</b> and non-articulated <b>trains</b> are highlighted first. Then, the mechanical reasons leading to the differences and their consequences to impact performance are analysed fromthree viewpoints: coupling stiffness and freedom, support and coupling patterns, and carbody structural features. The analysis shows that the differences in bogie support positions on the carbody and the effects on coupling devices lead to differences in several structural and compositional characteristics, including height of gravity of the carbody, length of the vehicle, {{the composition of the}} end panel, stiffness of coupling device, number of support points to vehicle, and support height of the secondary suspension. These characteristics result in different impact responses for the two types of train and are directly related to subsequent behaviour. <b>Articulated</b> <b>trains</b> show stiff connection and integral performance in collisions but with less capability for absorbing impact energy between vehicles, whereas non-articulated trains show flexible connection with more random behaviour in collisions but with greater options for energy absorber installation between vehicles...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the strong}} interdependencies of vehicle and {{infrastructure}} parameters in high-speed rail technology, the G7 program first focused on the compatibility with other components like track, catenary, signalling, and train control. [...] Sub-projects dealt with bridge design, improved pantograph design, and catenary in tunnels. [...] Technologies used in high-speed line construction, including rails and catenary in tunnels, were adapted for use in conventional line upgrades, to enable the operation of KTX trains on such lines. [...] The program also dealt with problems discovered during the operation of KTX-I trains, including a snaking movement of the <b>articulated</b> <b>train</b> around a speed of 150 km/h in winter, which was addressed by increasing wheel conicity.|$|E
50|$|The Deep tube {{programme}} (DTP) originally {{covered the}} replacement of the trains and signalling on the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, and had been expanded to cover rolling stock requirements arising from the planned Northern line extension to Battersea, the eventual replacement of Central line trains and proposed increased service frequency on the Northern and Jubilee lines. The EVO tube concept design, a lighter <b>articulated</b> <b>train</b> with walk-through cars, was introduced early in 2011. Siemens presented a response in 2011, a design with the weight reduced by 30 t and energy consumption reduced by 17 per cent, thus generating less heat to be dispersed in the tunnels. The trains would have a lower floor and 11 per cent higher passenger capacity than the current tube trains. Siemens presented a mock up of its Inspiro design at The Crystal between October 2013 and January 2014.|$|E

In early 2014 the Bakerloo, Piccadilly, Central and Waterloo & City line rolling stock replacement project was renamed New Tube for London (NTfL) and moved from its feasibility stage to the design and specification stage. The proposal introduces fully automated trains and signalling to increase capacity first on the Piccadilly line in 2025, followed the Central, Waterloo & City, and Bakerloo lines by 2033. The fully automated trains may not have drivers, however the ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this, saying it would be unsafe.|$|E

The Bakerloo line {{will be part of the}} New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled <b>articulated</b> <b>trains</b> and a new signalling system to allow Automatic Train Operation.

50|$|The ride {{makes use}} of GCI's Millennium Flyer <b>articulated</b> <b>trains</b> for a smooth and {{comfortable}} ride. During the ride's first two years in operation, the park played recordings for the winning train, which sometimes included local celebrity voices. While fans of the ride may have a particular side (Thunder/Green, or Lightning/Red) they enjoy more, both sides travel through the same elements, although at different times. Speed is affected not only by weight on the train, but also by weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc.), maintenance, the lifts' speeds, and placement of riders on train. Both sides contain an on-ride camera, located in the tunnel midway through the ride.|$|R

5000|$|One type {{of vehicle}} used for this line were two 4-unit <b>articulated</b> <b>train</b> sets called [...] "Liberty Liners", which were {{originally}} the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad's Electroliners. These shovel-nosed high-speed trains featured a bar car and were capable of speeds exceeding 100 mph. They were built by the St. Louis Car Co. in 1941. The Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company bought both of these trains in 1963. PST removed their trolley poles and replaced their original gravity-type over-running third rail shoes with paddle-type shoes. They were repainted into Red Arrow's color scheme and run in rush hour service with the bar serving continental breakfast {{in the morning and}} serving snacks and spirits in the afternoon. They were retired in 1977 due to excessive power consumption plus their excessive weight was just too much for the old 75 lb. jointed rail. As of 2006 they were in museums: one, restored to its original Electroliner appearance, at the Illinois Railway Museum, and the other in her Red Arrow colors at the Rockhill Trolley Museum.|$|E

5000|$|Many train {{cars are}} made with {{articulated}} connections, sharing a common truck between two cars. This reduces costs, weight, vibration and noise; and also enables higher speed running. One of the first examples of articulated railway carriages were used by London and North Eastern Railways in Great Britain on their London Suburban Trains in the mid-1920s these trains (rolling stock) were designed by Sir Nigel Gresley and built at the LNER's Doncaster Works. The four set [...] "Quad-arts" [...] {{were one of the}} very earliest <b>articulated</b> <b>trains,</b> this innovation was to save space. Although not the same as modern high speed trains where all the carriages share common bogies, they are an early form of the now more common design.|$|R
50|$|The fleet {{consists}} of 20 fully automated two-car <b>articulated</b> <b>trains,</b> {{for a total}} of 40 cars. The capacity of the trains is estimated at 334 people per pair of cars (comfortably) or 400 people at crush load. The trains have a top speed of 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph) in normal operation and 90 km/h in catch-up mode. Each married pair of gangway-connected cars is 41 metres long and 3 metres wide, similar in dimensions to Ottawa's O-Train, and longer and wider than the Bombardier ART fleet used on the Expo and Millennium lines. Each train has LED electronic displays on the exterior to indicate the terminus station and on the interior to display the next station and the terminus station, a useful feature considering the line has two branches.|$|R
