5|$|DAB {{technically}} provides low {{audio quality}} in the UK due to 98% of stereo stations using a bit rate level of 128 kbit/s. with the MP2 <b>audio</b> <b>codec,</b> which provides poorer sound quality than FM-quality (assuming good reception on both DAB and FM). In addition, DAB+ stations broadcast in the UK use a bitrate between 24 and 48kbit/s. A bit rate of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. Also, a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono. Indeed, the bit rates used by the radio stations on other digital platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite are usually higher than on DAB, so the audio quality is also higher. For example, all of the BBC stations use higher bit rates on the digital TV platforms than on DAB apart from the BBC World Service on Freeview. On the other hand, an Ofcom survey, which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor DAB quality, found that 94% of DAB listeners thought DAB was at least as good as FM.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} decisions regarding the design of a digital radio system is the choice of which <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> to use, because the efficiency of the <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> determines how many radio stations can be carried on a multiplex at a given level of audio quality. The capacity of a DAB multiplex is fixed, so the more efficient the <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> is, the more stations can be carried, and vice versa. Similarly, for a fixed bit-rate level, the more efficient the <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> is the higher the audio quality will be.|$|E

25|$|Digital {{sampling}} is used {{to convert}} an audio wave to a sequence of binary numbers that {{can be stored in}} a digital format, such as MP3. Common features of all MP3 players are a memory storage device, such as flash memory or a miniature hard disk drive, an embedded processor, and an <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> microchip to convert the compressed file into an analogue sound signal. During playback, audio files are read from storage into a RAM based memory buffer, and then streamed through an <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> to produce decoded PCM audio. Typically audio formats decode at double to more than 20 times real speed on portable electronic processors, requiring that the codec output be stored for a time until the DAC can play it. To save power, portable devices may spend much or nearly all of their time in a low power idle state while waiting for the DAC to deplete the output PCM buffer before briefly powering up to decode additional audio.|$|E

40|$|Audio {{communications}} in IP based networks have been revolutionized by {{the introduction of}} VoIP applications. High cost-efficiency has made VoIP to be the communication means in today’s world; and this trend is anticipated to be continued on an ongoing basis. The performance of VoIP significantly depends on the efficiency of the <b>audio</b> <b>codecs</b> used in any communication scenario which make the study on the performance issues of <b>audio</b> <b>codecs</b> in VoIP applications worth investigating. IPv 6 is the new version of IP, which will gradually replace the current IPv 4 as the transition from IPv 4 to IPv 6 is already in place. This demands the scrutiny of the <b>audio</b> <b>codecs</b> being used in IPv 4 to be tested for their compatibility in IPv 6 in terms of desired performance. This paper presents the study on the performance of selected <b>audio</b> <b>codecs</b> that are widely used in VoIPv 4.

25|$|A {{choice of}} <b>audio</b> <b>codec,</b> {{modulation}} and error-correction coding schemes and first trial broadcasts {{were made in}} 1990. Public demonstrations were made in 1993 in the United Kingdom. The protocol specification was finalized in 1993 and adopted by the ITU-R standardization body in 1994, the European community in 1995 and by ETSI in 1997. Pilot broadcasts were launched in several countries in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The new DAB+ {{standard}} {{has adopted}} the HE-AAC version 2 <b>audio</b> <b>codec,</b> {{commonly known as}} 'AAC+' or 'aacPlus'. AAC+ is approximately three-times more efficient than MP2, which means that broadcasters using DAB+ are able to provide far higher audio quality or far more stations than they can on DAB, {{or a combination of}} both higher audio quality and more stations.|$|E
25|$|This {{efficiency}} originates {{from the}} ability a DAB network has in broadcasting more channels per network. One network can broadcast 6–10 channels (with MPEG <b>audio</b> <b>codec)</b> or 10–16 channels (with HE AAC codec). Hence, {{it is thought}} that the replacement of FM-radios and FM-transmitters with new DAB-radios and DAB-transmitters will not cost any more as opposed to newer FM facilities.|$|E

25|$|From an OSI model {{protocol}} stack viewpoint, the technologies used on DAB inhabit the following layers: the <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> inhabits the presentation layer. Below {{that is the}} data link layer, in charge of statistical time division multiplexing and frame synchronization.

25|$|WorldDAB, the {{organisation}} {{in charge of}} the DAB standards, announced DAB+, a major upgrade to the DAB standard in 2006, when the HE-AAC v2 <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> (also known as eAAC+) was adopted.

25|$|The first {{generation}} DAB uses the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> which has less efficient compression than newer codecs. The typical bitrate for DAB programs is only 128 kbit/s {{and as a}} result most radio stations on DAB have a lower sound quality than FM, prompting a number of complaints among the audiophile community. As with DAB+ or T-DMB in Europe, FM HD Radio uses a codec based upon the MPEG-4 HE-AAC standard.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{objectives of}} converting to digital transmission were to enable higher fidelity, more stations and more resistance to noise, co-channel interference and multipath than in analogue FM radio. However, the leading countries in implementing DAB on stereo radio stations use compression {{to such a}} degree that it produces lower sound quality than that received from non-mobile FM broadcasts. This is because of the bit rate levels being too low for the MPEG Layer 2 <b>audio</b> <b>codec</b> to provide high fidelity audio quality.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{characterize}} the perceptual effects introduced by low bit rate spatial <b>audio</b> <b>codecs.</b> The existing methodologies used to evaluate spatial <b>audio</b> <b>codecs</b> were reviewed {{and the most important}} studies conducted to assess the perceived quality of spatial audio coding systems were compared. It was found that spatial <b>audio</b> <b>codecs</b> have been evaluated according to ITU-R standards BS. 1116 and BS. 1534. These tests evaluate the performance of <b>audio</b> <b>codecs</b> using one perceptual attribute - basic audio quality (BAQ). This approach, although effective in terms of the assessment of the overall performance of codecs, does not quantify the contribution of typical codec distortions to the perceived BAQ of the codecs or allow for the identification of independent perceptual attributes that describe the artefacts introduced by spatial audio coding systems. A series of experiments was carried out aiming to characterize the perceptual effects introduced by low bit rate spatial <b>audio</b> <b>codecs.</b> Two initial studies were conducted with the intention of investigating the contribution of selected attributes to the BAQ of low bit rate spatial codecs. Furthermore, another two experiments were performed in order to identify the perceptually salient dimensions or the independent perceptual attributes related to the artefacts introduced by low bit rate spatial audio coding systems. It was found that impairments related to timbral features of the sound are the ones that affect the most the perceived basic audio quality of the codecs. Additionally, two perceptually salient dimensions were identified and labelled as timbral and spatial. Moreover, four independent perceptual attributes (coding and high frequency noise, spatial image clarity, scene width and tone colour) were uncovered providing a description of the perceptual effects introduced by low bit rate spatial <b>audio</b> <b>codecs...</b>|$|R
