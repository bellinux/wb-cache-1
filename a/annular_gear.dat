2500|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term <b>annular</b> <b>gear</b> is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains. [...] The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the <b>annular</b> <b>gear</b> of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of an <b>annular</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train can be assembled so the planet gear rolls {{on the inside}} of the pitch circle of a fixed, outer gear ring, or ring gear, sometimes called an <b>annular</b> <b>gear.</b> In this case, the curve traced by a point on the pitch circle of the planet is a hypocycloid.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the geometric {{calculation of the}} planetary gear train with intermediate rollers, where the number of intermediate rollers is greater or {{less than that of}} the teeth in the <b>annular</b> <b>gear</b> by one, the profile surface of the <b>annular</b> <b>gear</b> teeth being the same. The gear ratio is changed by both a value and a sign...|$|E

40|$|Planetary gears nowadays, {{finding more}} and more {{applications}} as it is useful for transmitting power with large speed reductions or multiplications. Hence, Research in planetary gears has become necessity. The rim thickness of the <b>annular</b> <b>gear</b> {{is one of the}} important parameter of planetary gearbox to meet design objectives. An optimum rim thickness is required to meet the strength criterion {{at the same time to}} reduce mass of the gearbox and to save on material cost. Repetitive run-ups, time varying loading and speed conditions are very common in many applications of planetary gearboxes. Hence, in this paper major attention is given to the dynamic conditions. Experiments are performed to find out the strain using strain gauges on <b>annular</b> <b>gear</b> of planetary gearbox. On the other hand, a finite element model of an <b>annular</b> <b>gear</b> is developed on a commercial FEA software. The results obtained in the FEA software are validated against experimental results. The validated FE model then can be used to make the conclusions on how much the rim thickness must be kept...|$|E
40|$|With {{the general}} trend towards the {{miniaturization}} of production appliances, {{the demand for}} integratable compact design systems is increasing. A possible approach to realizing such systems results from the application of microtechnology. This article describes two miniaturized visualization systems for process monitoring in production appliances developed {{within the framework of}} the project "Mikrostell" sponsored by the BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research). Furthermore, a micro <b>annular</b> <b>gear</b> pump, which was developed for the delivery of small amounts within the scope of the project, will be introduced...|$|E
40|$|A {{planetary}} gear system includes a sun gear coupled to an <b>annular</b> ring <b>gear</b> through a plurality of twist-planet gears, a speeder gear, and a ground structure having an internal ring gear. Each planet gear includes a solid gear having a first half portion {{in the form of}} a spur gear which includes vertical gear teeth and a second half portion {{in the form of a}} spur gear which includes helical gear teeth that are offset from the vertical gear teeth and which contact helical gear teeth on the speeder gear and helical gear teeth on the outer ring gear. One half of the twist planet gears are preloaded downward, while the other half are preloaded upwards, each one alternating with the other so that each one twists in a motion opposite to its neighbor when rotated until each planet gear seats against the sun gear, the outer ring gear, the speeder gear, and the inner ring gear. The resulting configuration is an improved stiff anti-backlash gear system...|$|R
