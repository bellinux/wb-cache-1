5|$|Following al-Adil's {{death in}} 1218 {{and the death}} of Haditha a few years later, the imarat al-ʿarab was divided by Sultan al-Kamil (r. 1218–1238) between Haditha's sons Mani <b>and</b> <b>Ali,</b> who founded the {{independent}} Al Ali branch of Al Fadl, and their kinsman, Ghannam ibn Abi Tahir of the Al Faraj clan. As Mani's position was bolstered by his cooperation with the Ayyubids in their military campaigns and keeping the Bedouin in check, al-Kamil dismissed Ghannam <b>and</b> <b>Ali,</b> leaving Mani as the sole amir al-ʿarab. When Mani died in 1232/33, he was succeeded by his son Muhanna I after an agreement between the Ayyubid emirs of Homs and Damascus, al-Mujahid Shirkuh II and al-Ashraf Musa, respectively, without input from the sultan of Egypt. From this period until 1260, only scant information is available about the imarat al-ʿarab. However, it is known that in 1240, Muhanna I was replaced by Tahir ibn Ghannam by the Ayyubid regent of Aleppo, Dayfa Khatun, for Tahir's support against her dynastic opponents. Some years later, the title was bestowed on Ali or his son Abu Bakr.|$|E
5|$|In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri {{plan their}} next heist. As Dixit's {{analysis}} has named Rio {{the location of}} Mr. A's next heist, Jai <b>and</b> <b>Ali</b> travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, <b>and</b> <b>Ali</b> immediately falls for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. Aryan forces Sunehri {{to play a game}} of Russian roulette. Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted shots from the gun, neither is injured, because Aryan has not loaded the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. Sunehri indicates that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai <b>and</b> <b>Ali</b> to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up {{on the top of a}} waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) <b>and</b> <b>Ali</b> Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang {{up across the}} country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of the}} civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid <b>and</b> <b>Ali</b> Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.|$|E
5|$|Despite Husayn's {{rebellion}} and execution, the Hamdanid family continued to prosper: his brothers were soon released from captivity, and Abdallah rose to prominence by aligning himself with Mu'nis al-Khadim and {{sharing in the}} ups and downs of the court politics in Baghdad. It was Abdallah's two sons, however, al-Hasan <b>and</b> <b>Ali,</b> better known by their honorific titles Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla, who established the family as the ruling dynasty in the semi-independent emirates of Mosul (until 978) and Aleppo (until 1002) respectively.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{felt that}} Hindu-Muslim {{co-operation}} {{was necessary for}} political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India <b>and</b> <b>Ali</b> brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.|$|E

At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, political, and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, although it does not extend these values to groups who have relations with Israel.|$|E
5|$|In November 1901 the fedayi {{clashed with}} the Ottoman troops in what later {{became known as the}} Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery. One of the best-known episodes of Andranik's revolutionary activities, it was an attempt by the Ottoman {{government}} to suppress his activities. Since Andranik had gained more influence over the region, more than 5,000 Turkish soldiers were sent after him and his band. The Turks chased and eventually circled him and his men, numbering around 50, at the Arakelots (Holy Apostles) Monastery in early November. A regiment under the command of Ferikh Pasha <b>and</b> <b>Ali</b> Pasha besieged the fort-like monastery. The Turkish generals leading the army of twelve hundred men asked the fedayi to negotiate their surrender.|$|E

Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam <b>and</b> <b>Ali</b> because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E
