On 1 May, Visscher was accosted by Captain Rudolph Carel von Glan, a unit leader, asking why Visscher had done nothing {{to deal with the}} uprising. Visscher heatedly replied that it was not Glan's business. The following day, after being questioned by prosecutor Jeronimus Tonnemans Jr., Yonko, and Anko, Visscher became increasingly angry, breaking a table in half and yelling at his Chinese advisers. When Yanko disappeared after the meeting, Anko told Visscher that he had joined the rebelling Chinese. This caused Visscher, who had heavily invested in Yonko and had left a large amount of money with him, to take out his carriage <b>and</b> <b>scream</b> to the residents of Semarang to escape while it was still possible. This continued until he crashed into the city walls. The residents ran away from Semarang in a panic, leaving eight loaded cannons outside the city walls.|$|E

25|$|Scream 2 {{received}} equally positive critical response {{with some}} critics {{arguing that the}} film surpassed the original in scares and humor. Both Gene Siskel and the New York Times Janet Maslin gave the sequel positive reviews despite their negative response to Scream.

25|$|Interactionism is {{the view}} that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally {{interact}} with physical states. This is a position which is very appealing to common-sense intuitions, notwithstanding {{the fact that it}} is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of logical argumentation or empirical proof. It seems to appeal to common-sense because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child's touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes him to feel pain (mental event) and then yell <b>and</b> <b>scream</b> (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.|$|E

You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant <b>and</b> <b>scream</b> in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to.

25|$|The series {{continued}} with Scream 3, which received its premiere on February 3, 2000 at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood, California and was generally released on February 4, 2000. Like previous entries, {{the film was}} directed by Craven, but Williamson was unable to formulate a complete script due to {{his commitment to the}} short-lived television series Wasteland and his original film Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999), being replaced by Ehren Kruger who finalized a script based on several ideas supplied by Williamson. The film focuses on Sidney Prescott who faces a new Ghostface killer and the truth about her mother that led {{to the start of the}} Ghostface killings. The film, like its predecessors, featured characters who were self-aware of horror conventions, in this case the rules and structure of the final entry in a movie trilogy. Scream 3 was considerably less successful than the previous two installments, suffering both financially and critically, commentators noting that the film had become akin to the horror films it originally parodied in Scream <b>and</b> <b>Scream</b> 2. Others were critical of the change in tone, focusing more on humor instead of horror and violence. However, critics who reacted positively were supportive of this change in tone and praised the film for successfully completing the film trilogy.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{successful}} screening with a test audience and Miramax executives, both Williamson and Craven were offered a two-picture contract for sequels to Scream, Williamson already having {{been offered a}} three-picture deal by Miramax for unrelated films. Bob Weinstein ordered that the film be released on December 20, 1996, a date others were critical of {{as it was the}} Christmas season where seasonal and family films were more prevalent. Weinstein argued this fact was in the film's favor, as it meant that horror fans and teenagers had nothing interesting to watch. When Screams first weekend takings amounted to only $6 million, it was considered that this release date gamble had failed, but the following week the takings did not drop but increased and continued the following week, leading to a total U.S. gross of over $100 million. As Screams box-office takings grew, a lawsuit would be filed against Dimension Films by Sony Pictures who claimed that the title Scream was too similar to that of Sony's own film Screamers (1995). The case was settled out of court with the details remaining secret but producer Marianne Maddalena would confirm that the production were able to use the current and potential future titles of Scream 2 <b>and</b> <b>Scream</b> 3.|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry <b>and</b> <b>scream.</b> Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went back to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off the mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E
