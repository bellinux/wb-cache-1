5|$|The TNA World Heavyweight and TNA X Division Feast or Fired Title {{shots were}} fought {{over in the}} match between Scott Steiner and Petey Williams. Its {{duration}} was nine minutes and twenty-four seconds. Williams gained a near-fall during the bout by using a schoolboy pin.

5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over the moat. Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Valdés' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While the sleeves of musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the rampart, Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over the moat and began to climb the rampart, starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the rampart, crossed the moat and also started to come inside Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barricaded streets.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, {{in which the}} winner {{received}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a front-flip onto Abyss, who {{was standing in the}} doorway of the cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss slammed the door twice into Styles, while the second door slam the second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as a weapon to help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a sunset flip powerbomb and slammed Abyss into the tacks back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.|$|E

25|$|The Masjid, or mosque, {{had been}} built in the city of Ayodhya, {{considered}} holy by Hindus, following the Mughal conquest of the region in 1528.

In the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Sangh Parivar affiliates began an agitation to build a temple to Rama at the site, with the Bharatiya Janata Party lending political support to the movement. In 1990, the government of India led by V. P. Singh decided to implement some of the recommendations of the Mandal commission, and announced that twenty-seven percent of government jobs would be reserved for people from lower-caste backgrounds. This announcement threatened the electoral constituency of the BJP, which decided to use the Ayodhya dispute to unite the Hindu vote by mobilizing anti-Muslim sentiments.|$|E

Another possible natural explanation for Home's famous levitation was proposed by the psychical researcher Guy William Lambert who suggested he had attached a rope to the chimneys {{on the roof of the}} building, and hung the rope down unseen to the third floor. During the alleged levitation Home [...] "swung out and in" [...] the room by using a double rope maneuver. Lambert's rope hypothesis was supported by the magician John Booth.|$|E

500|$|Travelers on the Suspension Bridge {{witnessed}} several death-defying stunts performed {{across the}} Niagara Gorge. [...] On June 30, 1859, they saw Charles Blondin's feat {{of becoming the}} first man to cross the chasm on a tightrope. [...] In mid-crossing Blondin sat down on the rope and lowered a line to retrieve a drink from the deck of the Maid of the Mist below. [...] In his later tightrope acts at the same spot, the acrobat would perform a different stunt on each occasion. [...] One time he cooked and ate an omelette in mid-crossing; another time he carried his manager Harry Colcord on his back. [...] While giving Colcord a piggyback ride, Blondin stopped five times on the tightrope to rest and recover his strength; each time Colcord gingerly got off Blondin's back <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tightrope, climbing back on after the acrobat had enough rest. [...] Blondin's success inspired other acrobats, such as William Leonard Hunt ("The Great Farini"), Samuel Dixon, Clifford Calverly, and Signorina Maria Spelterini, to emulate and try to surpass his acts at the same spot. [...] The Signorina, the only woman to walk across the Niagara on a tightrope, once crossed while blindfolded and another time with her hands and legs in manacles.|$|E
500|$|Ditton Manor {{included}} a mansion named Ditton Court or Ditton Place {{that was built}} in the 16th century, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> present site of Troutbeck House. At the beginning of King James I's reign it was the residence of the Brewer family, many of whom lie buried in the churchyard, and remained with them until the beginning of the 18th century when, by mortgage or purchase, it came into the possession of the sheriff, [...] Thomas Golding of Leyborne, in 1703. He bequeathed it to his nephew, Thomas Golding of Ryarsh, who sold it to John Brewer, counsellor at law. Brewer's niece, Mrs. Carney of West Farleigh, re-conveyed it back to Thomas Golding again in about 1735 and from whom his son, John Golding, inherited it. There is reference in Organa Brittanica to an organ built by renowned organ builder John Avery which was moved in the late 18th century from West Malling Parish Church to a recess in the hall of Ditton Court, described as the manor house of the area and owned by the Golding family. Ditton Place was destroyed by fire in 1987.

Gill later said, [...] "I wish I could say that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] A statue of E.

2500|$|Arab {{geographer}} al-Muqaddasi writes Hama {{became a}} part of Jund Qinnasrin during Abbasid rule. Although the city's history is obscure at this time period, it is known that Hama was a walled market town with a ring of outlying cities. It came {{under the control of the}} Hamdanid rulers of Aleppo in the 10th century and was consequently drawn into the orbit of that city where it remained until the 12th century. These were considered the [...] "dark years" [...] of Hama as the local rulers of northern and southern Syria struggled for dominance in the region. The Byzantines under emperor Nicephorus Phocas raided the town in 968 and burned the Great Mosque. By the 11th century, the Fatimids gained suzerainty over northern Syria and during this period, the Mirdasids sacked Hama.

2500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{match was}} between The Undertaker and Triple H. For his entrance, Triple H had British heavy metal band Motörhead perform his theme song, [...] "The Game", live. The match {{started with the}} two fighting outside of the ring with Triple H quickly being put through the replacement Spanish announcers' table. Later on, referee Mike Chioda accidentally had Triple H catapulted into him and was then attacked by Undertaker due to his dissatisfaction over a two-count. With Chioda knocked out, the two brawled outside the ring, through the crowd, and into the technical area. On top of scaffolding, Triple H used a steel chair to attack Undertaker's legs, but Undertaker retaliated with a chokeslam off the scaffolding, followed by an diving elbow drop. Back in the ring, Undertaker hit Triple H with a Tombstone piledriver and went for the pin but Chioda was still unconscious. Later in the match, Triple H tried to pin Undertaker after hitting {{him in the head}} with a sledgehammer while in the Last Ride position but only gained a two-count. Triple H sent Undertaker into the corner <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second rope to hit him with more punches, but Undertaker countered with a Last Ride, allowing him to pin Triple H and increase his WrestleMania winning streak to 9–0.|$|E
