25|$|In 1964 the {{government}} of François Duvalier created CAMEP, the Centrale <b>Autonome</b> Métropolitaine d'Eau Potable, responsible for the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. Subsequently, in 1977 {{the government}} of his son Jean-Claude Duvalier created SNEP (Service National d'Eau Potable) {{to be in charge}} of water supply in the rest of the country. Shortly afterwards a rural water and hygiene unit called POCHEP after its French acronym was created in the Ministry of Health, since SNEP was focusing on secondary towns and did not have the ability to serve rural areas. All three entities struggled to increase coverage at the desired pace and to provide adequate levels of service quality. Nevertheless, the 1980s witnessed a certain increase of coverage as part of the International Water and Sanitation Decade, supported by numerous donors including the World Bank and the IDB as well as by numerous NGOs.|$|E

500|$|The {{immediate}} internal {{problems faced}} by South Kasai were large number of unsettled Luba refugees and internal dissent from non-Luba minorities. The state was able to direct money from diamond exporting and foreign support to fund public services which allowed Luba refugees to be settled in employment. Social services were [...] "relatively well-run". On the 12 July 1961, the state adopted a constitution turning itself into the Federated State of South Kasai (État fédéré du Sud-Kasaï), declaring the state itself both [...] "sovereign and democratic" [...] but also part of a hypothetical [...] "Federal Republic of the Congo". The constitution also provided for a bicameral legislature, with a lower chamber composed of all national deputies, senators, and provincial assemblymen elected in constituencies within South Kasai's territory, and an upper chamber filled by traditional chiefs. The state had its own flag, published its own official journal, the Moniteur de l'État <b>Autonome</b> du Sud-Kasaï, and even produced its own postage stamps.|$|E
