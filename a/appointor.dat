50|$|The {{power of}} {{appointment}} of the trustee of a discretionary trust is held by the <b>Appointor.</b> In some trust deeds, the person holding the {{power of appointment}} of the trustee is called the Custodian or the Principal of the trust. The <b>Appointor</b> is usually a natural person but {{can also be a}} company. Generally, upon the death of the <b>Appointor,</b> {{in the absence of an}} alternate appointment in the trust deed, the personal legal representative (executor) of the <b>Appointor</b> becomes the <b>Appointor.</b> The real power in relation to the control of the trust rests with the <b>Appointor</b> because of the ability to terminate the appointment of the trustee and appoint a different trustee. This must be kept in mind when considering succession and estate planning involving assets held in a discretionary trust.|$|E

It merely means that the power has been exercised for a purpose, or with an intention, beyond the scope of or not justified by the instrument creating the power." ...|$|E
40|$|The term nominee {{director}} provides convenient shorthand for a director who is {{appointed to the}} board of a company on an understanding, whether formal or informal, that he represents the interests of some person other than the company, usually the person(s) who nominated or, by some means, appointed him. Two recent decisions of the High Court of Singapore touch on the duties owed by {{nominee director}}s. These cases, both decided by Lai Siu Chiu J., provides everyone the opportunity to reflect on the law of directors 2 ̆ 7 duties in Singapore, and its application in particular to nominee directors. The main issue before the court was whether the defendant had breached the duties that he owed to the plaintiff. The orthodox position is and remains that nominees, being directors of the company to whose board they have been appointed, owe fiduciary and other duties to the company, and not to the <b>appointor...</b>|$|E

40|$|A popular {{perception}} is that administrative receivers and their <b>appointors</b> hold 'too much' power in relation to troubled companies. Consideration of this issue is timely, because insolvency law is currently under review. We argue although the law's formal structure is imbalanced, this can nevertheless generate savings for parties by allowing a concentrated creditor who has invested in information-gathering about the debtor to conduct a private insolvency procedure. We suggest that this procedure {{is likely to be}} more efficient than one conducted by a state official, and that it facilitates debt-based governance, a matter of particular importance for small and medium-sized businesses.

40|$|The law of {{contractual}} receivership {{has evolved}} quietly {{over a period}} of one hundred and fifty years or so. The institution of receivership started out as a mortgagee's remedy, but has proved remarkably adaptable to the commercial needs of large financial organisations, so much so that it has enjoyed ascendancy as a method of debt enforcement for {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century. This thesis attempts to chart the developmental process of receivership law, and to evaluate both judicial and legislative responses to the particular issues of policy it raises. In particular, it investigates the impact of receivership, both in legal and practical terms, on the various parties interested, in their various capacities, in the corporate entity. The main body of the thesis addresses this question from a number of perspectives. Corporate insolvency affects a wide variety of constituents. Receivership, as an insolvency regime, is frequently criticised as overly biased in favour of powerful financial institutions at the expense of both the corporation itself and its other stakeholders. By affording a contractually appointed receiver dominion over the entirety of the company's property, and by sanctioning the proposition that his decisions be informed exclusively by his <b>appointor's</b> interests, this censure of the law might appear justified. Alternatively, proponents of receivership have promoted the institution as a 'rescue' mechanism, a means by which viable companies, or viable sectors of their businesses, may be nurtured back to productivity and profitability. These two conflicting views will be examined in the final Chapter, in the light of recent reform initiatives which appear to envisage at least some minor modification to the existing 'balance of power'...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} “bundle of rights” theory as it meets {{at the intersection}} of trust and family property law. Drawing on conceptions of property, the principles and purposes of the Property (Relationships) Act and contrasted with trust law, a theory is adopted to explain why family property law has presumptive power over trust principles. Orthodox trust principles are discussed to explain why trust assets are protected from third party claims, the importance of the laws of powers and fiduciary obligations, the problems created by settlor or <b>appointor</b> control and the reason a “controller” is a beneficial owner of trust assets. The dispositions of relationship property to trusts and the limits on compensatory payments are discussed alongside the significance of the abolition of gift duty, other statutory remedies and judicial responses. Case authorities are explored, similarities with Australian alter ego trusts are drawn upon, and the application of the “bundle of rights” theory is discussed with reference to the valuation of debts and occupation orders. The dissertation concludes that the “bundle of rights” theory draws on an expansive meaning of property, it is a principled approach but confined to the Act...|$|E
