30|$|The {{first of}} these intra-systemic {{relations}} occurs in Figure  7 where the starting arrow marks the option ‘category’ in the system of mp, marking the if condition (% →); the second pair part, marking the then clause (→%) on the option ‘distant’. So according to Figure  7 choosing the option ‘category’ in mp system pre-empts other choices than that of ‘distant’ from the system of quality, the first member system of the simultaneous set deriving from social distance (sd) which refers {{to a kind of}} social relation that arises from the interactant’s interactive biography. In effect, by using this diacritic what the sys-net has indicated is that if the speaker is interacting with a ‘category’ of <b>addressees</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> personally to the speaker, then their social relation arising from their interactive biography can only be ‘distant’. However entering into that system of quality in social distance entails also choosing from the m-system of degree; the choice from here will depend {{on the nature of the}} options permitted by ‘category’. If the category is ‘imaginary’ – i.e., the speaker has not personally encountered any specimens of that category – then the degree of personal relation is likely to be ‘extremely’ (‘distant’); but if ‘category’ is more delicately described as ‘actual’ – meaning that the speaker has actually met some specimens of that category, e.g., the lecturer in relation to the first year class – then the degree of personal relation might vary accordingly: what cannot be changed now is the choice ‘distant’r. This follows from the fact that a realisational statement once made cannot be abrogated (for more detail, see section Realisation: the renewal of connection with experience below). In this same system of quality there is another signal for a pre-emptive choice relation; it is attached to the option ‘close’ and also to ‘extremely’; the arrow diacritic that signals it, appears as @→ whose second pair part is attached to the option ‘neutralised’ in the system of status (c.f., social relations[*]=[*]sr). Here there is a complex ‘if clause’ – if ‘close’ and if ‘extremely’, then in the system of status, all choices are pre-empted; only one option, i.e., ‘neutralised’ is allowed.|$|E

30|$|Instructing the <b>addressee</b> <b>not</b> {{to process}} some {{information}} thoroughly {{although it is}} actually unknown to him can have a further function beside allowing him some effort economy: namely, {{to prevent him from}} fully understanding that information. When certain content is doubtful or even false, the <b>addressee</b> will <b>not</b> accept it if he pays due attention to it. But he may accept it if he remains partially unaware of its most questionable parts, which typically happens if he pays less attention. The fact that some information is doubtful will be evident when it is stated, but may remain unperceived if it is presented so as to be processed more vaguely and less attentively.|$|R
50|$|Not {{a single}} {{commission}} managed to provide exhaustive answers {{to all the}} questions. The letters to the Commissions in Dzerzhynsky and Kharkivsky districts were returned with the stamp “the <b>addressee</b> <b>not</b> found”, or “no addressee at this address”. It {{can be explained by}} the fact that the former head of the commission was dismissed and replaced by a new person, while the letter was still addressed to him. But we also included the names provided at Kharkiv SPSU Department site. Interestingly, only the heads of three commissions out of nine remained the same. Anyway, as opposed to Dzerzhynsky and Kharkivsky districts’ commissions, other OC managed to respond, even, though “the <b>addressee</b> was <b>not</b> found at this address”.|$|R
40|$|The {{letters of}} Paul speak more {{frequently}} of the resurrected and exalted Jesus {{than they do}} of the earthly Jesus. Nonetheless, {{this does not mean}} that the apostle and his <b>addressees</b> did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the teachings and main events of Jesus’ life. Their insistence as to the heavenly identity of Jesus is as likely to have been motivated by contextual factors which guided the development of the primitive Christological confessions which Paul received in the years after his conversion. This article will focus on two of these factors: the configuration of the Christian communities of the Diaspora as foreign cults in a context of religious plurality and the new revelatory experiences which triggered the formation of a binitarian faith. Determining the relationship between Jesus and Paul is one of the fundamental tasks of those who, like Prof. Andries van Aarde, study the origins of Christianity and the beginnings of Christian theology. The basic question in this regard, at least as it has been formulated recently by David Wenham (1995), is whether Paul was a follower of Jesus or the founder of Christianity (see also Wedderburn [1989] and Barbaglio [2006]). In this brief article, I would like to consider one aspect of this general topic and to offer a few suggestions that might contribute to a better understanding of the peculiar vision of Jesus that we find in the letters of Paul. In them, in fact, the apostle moves from the incarnation to the death and resurrection, leaving in the shadows the activity and teaching of Jesus to which the gospels subsequently give so much importance. This contrast raises some questions concerning the knowledge which Paul had of the Jesus tradition and the value he accorded to it: What did he know about Jesus? Did he know the traditions which the evangelists later collected? Why does he not refer to them in his letters more frequently? By contrast, why does he give so much importance to the death and resurrection of Jesus and to Jesus’ divine condition?How to cite this article: Guijarro, S., 2011, ‘The Jesus of Paul: A contribution from the social sciences’, HTS Teologiese Studies/Theological Studies 67 (1), Art. # 862, 6 pages.

5000|$|As {{a rhetorical}} device, it can serve various purposes, often {{dependent}} {{on the relationship of}} the speaker to the addressee and the extent of their shared knowledge. Apophasis is rarely literal; instead, it conveys meaning through implications that may depend on this context. As an example of how meaning shifts, the English phrase [...] "needless to say" [...] invokes shared understanding, but its actual meaning depends on whether that understanding was really shared. The speaker is alleging that {{it is not necessary to}} say something because the addressee already knows it, but is it so? If it is, it may merely emphasize a pertinent fact. If the knowledge is weighted with history, it may be an indirect way of levying an accusation ("needless to say, because you are responsible"). If the <b>addressee</b> does <b>not</b> actually already possess the knowledge, it may be a way to condescend: the speaker suspected as much but wanted to call attention to the addressee's ignorance.
