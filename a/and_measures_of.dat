5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen bond retention.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
5|$|Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' Joseph Walsh on March 23, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures,</b> <b>of</b> which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on the}} coinage proposal that would become the Alabama Centennial half dollar, which was the first order of business. Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} two subclasses <b>of</b> convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk, {{referred to}} as entropy coherent <b>and</b> entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk. Entropy coherent <b>and</b> entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk are special cases <b>of</b> φ-coherent <b>and</b> φ-convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk. Contrary to the classical use <b>of</b> coherent <b>and</b> convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk, which for a given probabilistic model entails evaluating a financial position by considering its expected loss, φ-coherent <b>and</b> φ-convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk evaluate a financial position under a given probabilistic model by considering its normalized expected φ-loss. We prove that (i) entropy coherent <b>and</b> entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk are obtained by requiring φ-coherent <b>and</b> φ-convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk to be translation invariant; (ii) convex, entropy convex, <b>and</b> entropy coherent <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk emerge as certainty equivalents under variational, homothetic, and multiple priors preferences upon requiring the certainty equivalents to be translation invariant; <b>and</b> (iii) φ-convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk are certainty equivalents under variational and homothetic preferences {{if and only if}} they are convex <b>and</b> entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk. In addition, we study the properties of entropy coherent <b>and</b> entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk, derive their dual conjugate function, and characterize entropy coherent <b>and</b> entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk in terms of properties of the corresponding acceptance sets...|$|R

25|$|Liver biopsies involve {{taking a}} sample of tissue from the liver, using a thin needle. The amount of iron in the sample is then {{quantified}} and compared to normal, and evidence of liver damage, especially cirrhosis, measured microscopically.

Risks of biopsy include bruising, bleeding and infection. Now, when a history <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> transferrin or ferritin point to haemochromatosis, it is debatable whether a liver biopsy is still necessary to quantify the amount of accumulated iron.|$|E

25|$|Personal {{prevention}} of yellow fever includes vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites {{in areas where}} yellow fever is endemic. Institutional measures for {{prevention of}} yellow fever include vaccination programmes <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> controlling mosquitoes. Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes are providing reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever. Use of EPA-registered insect repellent is recommended when outdoors. Exposure for even a short time is enough for a potential mosquito bite. Long-sleeved clothing, long pants, and socks are useful for prevention. The awareness of peak mosquito exposure is from dusk to dawn. The application of larvicides to water-storage containers can help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites. Adult mosquitos can be killed through insecticide spray usage, which decreases the transmission of yellow fever.|$|E
25|$|Ruler: Rulers {{made from}} ivory were in {{use by the}} Indus Valley Civilization in what today is Pakistan and some parts of Western India prior to 1500 BCE. Excavations at Lothal (2400 BCE) have yielded one such ruler {{calibrated}} to about 1/16 of an inch—less than 2 millimeters. Ian Whitelaw (2007) holds that 'The Mohenjo-Daro ruler is divided into units corresponding to 1.32inches (33.5mm) and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy—to within 0.005 of an inch. Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.' Shigeo Iwata (2008) further writes 'The minimum division of graduation found in the segment of an ivory-made linear measure excavated in Lothal was 1.79mm (that corresponds to 1/940 of a fathom), while that of the fragment of a shell-made one from Mohenjo-daro was 6.72mm (1/250 of a fathom), and that of bronze-made one from Harapa was 9.33mm (1/180 of a fathom).' The weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> the Indus civilization also reached Persia and Central Asia, where they were further modified.|$|E
