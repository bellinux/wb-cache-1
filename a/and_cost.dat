40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the process <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> {{associated}} with biopharmaceutical firms undertaking an initial public offering.

Private biopharmaceutical firms need to be aware of the process <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> of going public in order to determine if these costs are acceptable, compare these <b>costs</b> (<b>and</b> benefits) with those of other sources of funding, and better manage the IPO process...|$|R
5|$|In August 2007, {{the stadium}} was {{planned to be}} built in three stages, with a {{combined}} budget of NOK156.6 million.

After construction started, BG changed two specifications, moving public rest rooms from the basement to the ground floor, and changing the angle of roof. Both of these gave increased construction costs and alteration of the architectural design plans.|$|E

40|$|On any {{plausible}} {{account of}} the basis for health care resource prioritization, the benefits <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> of different alternative resource uses are relevant considerations in the prioritization process. Consequentialists hold that the maximization of benefits with available resources is the only relevant consideration.

Discussion and commentary on the key findings and recommendations is also included. The paper includes information on base load plant performance <b>and</b> <b>costs,</b> but part load performance <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> of operation at low annual capacity factors are also presented because operation at lower load factors may be necessary, particularly in future electricity systems that include high amounts of other low-CO 2 generation plants...|$|R

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{importance}} of nominal rigidities using a new weekly scanner data set. We find that nominal rigidities are important but do not {{take the form of}} sticky prices. Instead, they take the form of inertia in reference prices <b>and</b> <b>costs,</b> defined as the most common prices <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> within a given quarter. Reference prices are particularly inertial and have an average duration of roughly one year, even though weekly prices change roughly every two weeks. We document the relation between prices <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> find sharp evidence of state dependence in the probability of reference price changes and in the magnitude of these changes. We use a simple model to argue that reference prices <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> are useful statistics for macroeconomic analysis. ...|$|R
