5|$|Kraków {{is divided}} into 18 {{administrative}} districts (dzielnica) or boroughs, each {{with a degree of}} autonomy within its own municipal government. Prior to March 1991, the city had been divided into four quarters which still give a sense of identity to Kraków – the towns of Podgórze, Nowa Huta, and Krowodrza which were amalgamated into the city of Kraków as it expanded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> town centre of Kraków itself.|$|E

5|$|With trade tariffs with England now abolished, trade blossomed, {{especially}} with Colonial America. The clippers {{belonging to the}} Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Until the American War of Independence in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade.

5|$|Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed {{autonomy}} and {{was attached to}} the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a Roman colonia during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the Byzantines and later empires. Its destruction by the Timurids in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under French Mandatory rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of Tadmur, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> site became available for excavations.|$|E
5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E

5|$|Ocepeia {{lived at}} a time when {{northwest}} Africa was at the intersection of the Atlantic Ocean <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Tethys Ocean, and much of the area was flooded by shallow, warm inland seas. Ocepeia fossils are associated with diverse sharks, birds, and marine reptiles, and a small number of early mammals, including other condylarths and early proboscideans. The early appearance and specialized features of Ocepeia suggest afrotherians originated and diversified within Africa, contrary to theories suggesting a more northern origin.|$|E
5|$|Teresa Cristina did not lack {{intellectual}} interests, and she {{had developed}} passions for the arts, music and—in particular—archaeology. The Empress began assembling a collection of archaeological artifacts from her earliest days in Brazil, and she exchanged hundreds of others with her brother, King Don FerdinandoII (FerdinandII). She also sponsored archaeological studies in Italy {{and many of the}} artifacts—dated from the Etruscan civilization <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> Roman period—found were brought to Brazil. The Empress also aided in recruiting Italian physicians, engineers, professors, pharmacists, nurses, artists, artisans and qualified workers with the goal of improving public education and public health in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Roman Empire was in {{language}} and civilization a Greek society. Linguistically, Byzantine or medieval Greek is situated between the Hellenistic (Koine) and modern phases of the language. Since {{as early as the}} Hellenistic era, Greek had been the lingua franca of the educated elites of the Eastern Mediterranean, spoken natively in the southern Balkans, the Greek islands, Asia Minor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> and Hellenistic Greek colonies of Southern Italy, the Black Sea, Western Asia and North Africa. At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium, the koine (Greek: κοινή) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings, while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators.|$|E

5|$|The {{convenient}} {{location of}} these caves near Mumbai, the Western curiosity for the historic Indian culture, {{and the difficulty}} in reaching sites in infrastructure poor Indian subcontinent, made Elephanta Caves a subject of numerous guide books and significant scholarly interest in the 20th century. The early speculations and misconceptions about these caves led to many interpretations and scholarly disagreements but also increased the support for their preservation. The publication of their condition, sketches and interpretation by James Burgess in 1871 brought wider attention. The earliest efforts to preserve the Elephanta Caves were taken by British India officials in 1909, when the site was placed under the Indian Archaeological Department <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> Monuments Preservation Act included it within its scope. This helped isolate the island and preserve the ruins.|$|E
5|$|This dubious {{arrangement}} {{eventually became}} a challenge to Constantine in the West, climaxing in the great civil war of 324. Licinius, aided by Goth mercenaries, represented the past <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> pagan faiths. Constantine and his Franks marched under the standard of the labarum, and both sides saw the battle in religious terms. Outnumbered, but fired by their zeal, Constantine's army emerged victorious in the Battle of Adrianople. Licinius fled across the Bosphorus and appointed Martius Martinianus, the commander of his bodyguard, as Caesar, but Constantine next won the Battle of the Hellespont, and finally the Battle of Chrysopolis on 18 September 324.|$|E

5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the watertight doors could not close, and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} four sites in Slovenia inscribed on the list and five sites on the {{tentative}} list. The first site in Slovenia {{to be added to}} the list was the Škocjan Caves, inscribed at the 10th UNESCO session in 1986. In the 2010s, three more sites were inscribed, all of them transnational entries: pile dwellings at Ig, part of the Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps transnational site, in 2011, Idrija, as part of the transnational site Heritage of Mercury. Almadén and Idrija, in 2012, and two forest reserves, Krokar and Snežnik – Ždrocle Virgin Forests in 2017, as a part of the extension to the site of Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> Beech Forests of Germany. Of these four sites, Škocjan Caves and the Primeval Beech Forests are natural sites while the other two are cultural sites, as determined by the organization's selection criteria.|$|E
5|$|Kaecilius {{uses the}} stolen pages {{to contact the}} {{powerful}} Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off {{with the help of}} the Cloak of Levitation until Mordo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> One arrive. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E

5|$|Loring Danforth, a {{professor}} of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{note the}} similarities between the táltos of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans, but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including boszorkány ("witch"), elbűvöl ("to charm"), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Hungarian word for holy (igy or egy), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: búcsú (indulgence), bűn (sin), gyón (confess), isten (god), and ördög (devil). According to Gyula László, a Hungarian children's verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves the memory of a pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. The refrain of another children's verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief in the existence of an afterlife world where everything is upside-down.|$|E
5|$|Various esoteric {{organizations}} {{that emerged in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Theosophical Society <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, repeated the beliefs that had originated with Sethos: that Egyptians underwent initiation within the pyramids and that Greek philosophers were initiates who learned Egypt's secret wisdom. Esoteric writers influenced by Theosophy, such as Reuben Swinburne Clymer in his 1909 book The Mystery of Osiris and Manly Palmer Hall in Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians in 1937, also wrote of an age-old Egyptian mystery tradition. An elaborate example of these beliefs is the 1954 book Stolen Legacy by George James, which claims that Greek philosophy was built on knowledge stolen from the Egyptian school of initiates. James imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents, so that the purported system of Egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over the world.|$|E
