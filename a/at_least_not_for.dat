500|$|Despite {{the legends}} {{that have grown}} up about the Liberty Bell, it did not ring on July 4, 1776 (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> any reason {{connected}} with independence), as no public announcement {{was made of the}} Declaration of Independence. When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang. However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing. According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the National Park Service, [...] "We do not know whether or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2017, Vincent D'Onofrio, who portrays Wilson Fisk in Daredevil, said he [...] "would love {{to switch}} over to the movies, but I think it's pretty much been said it's not going to happen. Or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> a very, very long time." [...] D'Onofrio cited Feige's {{previous}} reasoning {{as well as the}} fact that the films already had difficulty [...] "bringing big characters in that they have to service in the writing" [...] and adding characters from the television series would be [...] "just too many characters" [...] since the films were [...] "trying to figure out already how to individualize more {{and at the same time}} keep The Avengers going." [...] In March 2017, Anthony Mackie, who portrays Sam Wilson / Falcon in the films, felt a crossover between the films and television series [...] "wouldn't work at all" [...] given they are [...] "different universes, different worlds, different companies, different designs" [...] and that [...] "Kevin Feige is very specific about how he wants the Marvel Universe to be seen in the film world." [...] That May, Feige noted that a character appearing in a television series would not necessarily exclude them from appearing in a film, adding that [...] "at some point, there's going to be a crossover. Crossover, repetition, or something." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Nocioni {{started for}} Argentina at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. In {{a game against}} Venezuela, Nocioni landed on an opponent's foot, and it looked he injured his ankle, though he was cleared to play in Argentina's next game against Nigeria. In Argentina's game against Nigeria, Nocioni led the team in scoring, with 23 points, playing 18minutes, while not missing a single shot. Nocioni was 9–9 from the field, {{including}} 5–5 from the 3-point line. [...] "I don't think I've ever played a game where I didn't miss a shot - <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the national team."

2500|$|Drag queens are {{sometimes}} called transvestites, although that term also has many other connotations than the term [...] "drag queen" [...] {{and is not}} much favored by many drag queens themselves. This {{is because of the}} distinctions between drag queens and transvestic fetishists. [...] "Drag queen" [...] usually connotes cross-dressing for the purposes of entertainment and self-expression. It is not an accurate way to describe people who cross-dress for the fulfillment of transvestic fetishes alone, i.e., people whose cross-dressing is primarily part of a private sexual activity or identity. Those whose motivation for transvestism is not primarily sexual, and who may go about their daily lives cross-dressed, often do not adopt the over-the-top drag queen look, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> daily wear; these individuals may or may not self-identify as drag queens.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the relief}} of {{completing}} the [...] "mountains-to-the sea" [...] railroad, both his physician and mentor John D. Rockefeller had expressed continuing concerns about Henry Rogers' health and urged him to slow down. He {{was known as a}} man who just couldn't seem to [...] "take it easy," [...] <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> very long. The following month, in May 1909, he took a pleasant weekend getaway trip to his hometown of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Afterward, he returned to New York City and his work. Three days later, on May 19, 1909, he awoke feeling very ill, and had numbness in his arm. By the time the doctor arrived in less than 30 minutes, he could not be saved. After his funeral in New York City, with Virginian Railway officials and his close friend Mark Twain serving as pallbearers, the old widowers' body was transported by train to Fairhaven, to be interred in Riverside Cemetery beside his childhood sweetheart, Abbie Gifford Rogers (1841–1894).|$|E

Still, by dint of borrowing and the mortgage of some property which I had acquired, I kept my head above water for about eighteen months. Very soon, however, my financial distress became known, with the result that I was no longer so cordially received as I had been either in Dunchester or in London.

6000|$|In {{after years}} {{he was fond of}} recalling how the Liverpool with which he had been most {{familiar}} (1810-20), though the second commercial town in the kingdom, did not exceed 100,000 of population, and how the silver cloud of smoke that floated above her resembled that which might now appear over any secondary borough or village of the country. 'I have seen wild roses growing upon the very ground that is now the centre of the borough of Bootle. All that land is now partly covered with residences and partly with places of business and industry; but in my time but one single house stood upon the space between Primrose brook and the town of Liverpool.' Among his early recollections was 'the extraordinarily beautiful spectacle of a dock delivery on the Mersey after a long prevalence of westerly winds followed by a change.
