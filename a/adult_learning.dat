40|$|Since 1997, the {{identity}} of the research field of <b>adults</b> <b>learning</b> mathematics has been debated; the research field has grown in quantity and quality; and the research forum <b>Adults</b> <b>Learning</b> Mathematics (ALM) has established an international journal. In practice, the researchers answer the question about identity and quality of research papers in committees, in editorial teams or as referees in journals. The {{purpose of this article is}} to create a starting point for a debate, based on quality criteria in the field of mathematics education research, on specific criteria to locate quality of research papers on practice-related educational research in the field of <b>adults</b> <b>learning</b> mathematics. Following general criteria in mathematics education any research paper has to explain and present its own problematique explicitly i. e. define the problem field and the theoretical/methodological/philosophical approach of the study reported. Additional criteria specific to the field of <b>adults</b> <b>learning</b> mathematics are suggested, namely, the author should position themselves by answering the following three questions: (1) What is adult mathematical knowledge (or adult numeracy) ? (2) How do <b>adults</b> <b>learn</b> mathematics? (3) Why teach mathematics to adults...|$|R

White Calf Collegiate in Lebret, Saskatchewan, {{was run by}} the Star Blanket Cree Nation from 1973 until its closure in 1998, after being run by the Oblates from 1884 to 1969.

From 1929 to 1971 the building housed Old Sun residential school, first run by the Anglicans and taken over by the federal government in 1969. It was converted to <b>adult</b> <b>learning</b> and stood as a campus of Mount Royal College from 1971 to 1978, at which point the Siksika Nation took over operations. In 1988, the Old Sun College Act was passed in the Alberta Legislature recognizing Old Sun Community College as a First Nations College.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} <b>adults</b> <b>learning</b> {{mathematics}} in two distinct sections; <b>adults</b> <b>learning</b> mathematics {{in the workplace}} and community; and adults engaged in further studies (e. g. university or vocational studies) including bridging mathematics. In this review, research available on adults in basic numeracy education through to those gaining access to or supported at university study involving mathematics in a variety of forms is investigated. Consideration is also given to relevant definitions of adult, mathematics and numeracy, and to the relationship between research into learning and research into teaching practices or curriculum design. It is concluded that the area of <b>adults</b> <b>learning</b> mathematics is still under-theorised and under- researched at a time when 21 st century needs demand a population with increasing numeracy-based skills and knowledge...|$|R

The key concept is numeracy and the problem field is related to adults, mathematics and lifelong education.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} ways in which {{participating}} in the arts – through creating, attending or organizing – helps <b>adults</b> <b>learn</b> about multicultural diversity. Learning methods, environments, and key experiences are discussed. Purpose of the Study The purpose of this phenomenological case study was to explore if, and in what ways, participating in small to mid-sized arts programs helps <b>adults</b> <b>learn</b> to understand and/or value multicultural diversity. This was done in order to understand how arts participation might help adults better appreciate and communicate with the multiculturally diverse people with whom they must interact in their private and public lives. By doing so, this study sheds light on if, how, and in what ways participation in the arts might be an additional tool for helping <b>adults</b> <b>learn</b> to understand and/or value multicultural diversity. Key Terms Arts participation is defined by the activities that are involved in the participation, rather than along aesthetic and philosophical lines (McCarthy & Jinnett, 2001). For the purposes of this study, “art ” includes all visual, performing, literary, media, and multi-disciplinary art forms...|$|R
40|$|How {{and why do}} <b>adults</b> <b>learn?</b> This topic {{has been}} the focus of {{increased}} attention recently in the literature, and, as is true with many complex and important questions, it is difficult to come up with neat and concise answers. One way <b>adults</b> <b>learn</b> is through mentoring. Lester (1981) points out that mentoring is a basic form of education for human development because it provides a wholistic, yet individualized, approach to <b>learning.</b> <b>Adults</b> who work with mentors grow in their own sense of intellectual competence, as well as in their sense of purpose, their feelings of autonomy, and their personal integrity. Mentoring is also a good example of experiential learning, that is, learning resulting from or associated with ex-perience. The concept of mentoring is an ancient one. The idea o...|$|R
