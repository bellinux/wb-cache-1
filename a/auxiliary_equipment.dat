However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir, Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development is an expensive move that often doesn't pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones.|$|E

Available technologies are numerous, with laser forming being progressively emerging because of limited springback, lack of molds and sophisticated <b>auxiliary</b> <b>equipments.</b> However, laser forming finds limited applications, especially when forming of tridimensional (3 d) complex shapes is required. In this case, cost savings are often counterbalanced by the need for troublesome forming strategies.

In the present work, 3 d laser forming of stainless steel sheets by high power diode laser is investigated.
