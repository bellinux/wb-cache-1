50|$|Swinley is {{an urban}} suburb of Wigan, Greater Manchester. The area was mainly {{developed}} during the late Victorian and Edwardian period from around 1885 up {{until the end of}} the interwar period upon a green corridor centered on the section of the Chester to Lancaster Roman Road named Wigan Lane which leads northwards from the original 1246 Royal Charter boundary of the Borough of Wigan towards the parish of Standish between neighbouring industrial areas of mills, mines and ironworks. It originally featured a hodgepodge development of villa's, flats and large town houses on what was then open fields, later stages of development during the interwar period infilled with terraces. The area to the east of Wigan Lane <b>abuting</b> Douglas Valley retains this exclusive character with properties selling from £500,000 to over a million.|$|E
40|$|The gene extramacrochaetae (emc) encodes a {{non-basic}} Helix-loop-helix (HLH) {{protein that}} interacts and antagonises other basic-HLH proteins. The expression pattern of emc, and the phenotype of lethal emc alleles {{indicate that this}} gene is operative in several developmental processes. Here we study the requirements for emc during cell proliferation and vein differentiation in the wing. Mosaic analysis of hypomorphic conditions of emc reveals the tendency of mutant cells to proliferate along the veins as long stripes. Large clones <b>abuting</b> two adjacent veins obliterate the corresponding inter-vein, affecting {{the size and shape}} of the whole wing. Thus, the emc gene participates in the control of cell proliferation within inter-vein regions in the wing. Similar effects were found in the haltere and in the leg. The behavior of emc cells in genetic mosaics indicate that (1) proliferation is locally controlled within inter-vein sectors, (2) cells proliferate according to their genetic activity along preferential positions in the wing morphogenetic landscape and (3) cell proliferation in the wing is integrated by ‘accommodation’ between mutant and wild type cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT Asumanu is {{a village}} located in Raihat District, Belu Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province. Historically, Asumanu Village {{is one of}} villages in a {{district}} with the biggest potency of sandalwood particularly in Belu Regency. New research mention that Asumanu has land compatibility grade “appropriate I” for sandalwood cultivation. All the land in the village belongs to the community of Asumanu. These are potential values to gain the biggest benefit from sandalwood management for the community of Asumanu. Asumanu Village <b>abuted</b> on Republik Demokratik Timor Leste (RDTL). As a boundary area, Asumanu Village becomes Indonesia’s front gallery to the international world, {{with the result that}} Asumanu Village has to put in order every aspect continuously. Natural resources management (include sandalwood) is one aspect that has to be paid serious attention. The while, globally, the sandalwood (Santalum album Linn) population was classified as vulnarable species by IUCN in 1997. This research was conducted to study sandalwood management in Asumanu Village. This was a descriptive qualitative research using survey method, interview method, and literature study. Based on the result of the research, the sandalwood management in Asumanu Village was still not sustainable yet. Community of Asumanu Village resuscitation on the special characteristic and the high value of sandalwood need to be done immediately. As soon as the community of Asumanu Village aware of the potency that belongs to the village, intensive guidance on sandalwood cultivation need to be done immediately.

40|$|Oppression {{of forest}} {{plantation}} on cutting areas is observed {{first of all}} {{at the expense of}} a intensive growth of undesirable wood and shrub vegetation. Chemical care in forest plantation can be carried ou t before their planting, prior to the beginning of vegetation period, during vegetation period. The more safer in relation to treated forest cultures is ma-chining before their planting. In this case it is better to use soil herbicides with the long term of action, such as Terrsan in a dose of 100 – 200 g/hectares, th e Grader in a dose of 1 l/hectare. Machining Glifos in a dose of 4 – 8 l/hectares also is effective, however the best effect render tank mixtures of these herbicides. Optimum time of machining is the middle of summer till the cultural operations moment and on tilled soil (to drills, strips) till the end of October. We carried out treatment of plantation of a Lárix decídua, Betula pendula, Pícea ábies, Tília cordáta. Machining prior to the beginning of vegetation period is a little effective, as in negligible extent acts on wood and shrub plants. In vegetation period it is possible to use direct machining of strips <b>abuting</b> to rows by hand sprayers with screen with herbicides of Terrsan, the Grader, Glifos and them tank mixtures. In the end of vegetation period the most effective is machining of crops of a spruce by tank mixture of herbicide of Terrsan in a dose of 100 g/hectares and Glifos in a dose of 4 l/hectares in September. At augmentation of a dose of Terrsan to 200 g/hectares or Glifos to 6 – 8 l/hectares increases risk of damage of plantation of spruce crops...|$|E

50|$|Gundulf's first {{undertaking}} in {{the construction}} of the new cathedral seems to have been the construction of the tower which today bears his name. In about 1080 he began construction of a new cathedral to replace Justus' church. He was a talented architect who probably played a major part in the design or the works he commissioned. The original cathedral had a presbytery of six bays with aisles of the same length. The four easternmost bays stood over an undercroft which forms part of the present crypt. To the east was a small projection, probably for the silver shrine of Paulinus which was translated there from the old cathedral. The transepts were 120 feet long, but only 14 feet wide. With such narrow transepts it is thought that the eastern arches of the nave <b>abuted</b> the quire arch. To the south another tower (of which nothing visible remains) was built. There was no crossing tower. The nave was not completed at first. Apparently designed to be nine bays long, most of the south side but only five bays to the north were completed by Gundulf. The quire was required by the priory and the south wall formed part of its buildings. It has been speculated that Gundulf simply left the citizens to complete the parochial part of the building. Gundulf did not stop with the fabric, he also replaced the secular chaplains with Benedictine monks, obtained several royal grants of land and proved a great benefactor to his cathedral city.|$|R
