50|$|The CEBUS {{standard}} {{includes a}} large number of control and operation tables, called the CAL contexts. These tables identify a variety of control and monitoring commands that are used by remote devices (elsewhere in a home, or with the Internet, even elsewhere in the world) to communicate with CEBus certified products. The tables include commands for very simple actions, such as power on, power off, change channel, etc. Also included are the possibility for very sophisticated feature and functionality discovery and enumeration. For example, two products can communicate with each other, completely automatically, to discover what capabilities exist in Product A, such that Product B can then display that info, or simply use it to select services available, a sampling being: a list of channels/inputs/outputs available, special capabilities available (like <b>Away</b> <b>Mode,</b> Movie Mode, security parameters, etc.), or data tables within a residential electrical power meter.|$|E

This intensity modulation is shown {{to be caused by}} beating between the fundamental lasing mode and radiation modes in the taper. This results in a periodic modulation in the net gain spectrum, which causes wavelength jumps between adjacent net gain maxima, and a drive current dependent spectral width that is expected to affect system performance. The amplitude of this spectral modulation is reduced significantly by either using an angled rear-facet which reflects the beating radiation <b>modes</b> <b>away</b> from the laser axis, or by using a nonlinear, adiabatic taper...|$|R

40|$|New Materialisms rethinks the {{relevance}} of materialist philosophy {{in the midst of}} a world shaped by forces such as digital and biotechnologies, global warming, global capital, and population flows. Moving <b>away</b> from <b>modes</b> of inquiry that have prioritized the study of consciousness and subjectivity over matter, the essays in this collection show that any account of experience, agency, and political action demands renewed attention to the urgent issues of our own material existence and our environment. The editors propose “new materialisms” as a way to take matter seriously without falling into the conceptual dualism that posits an opposition between matter and thought, materialism and idealism, and body and mind. They locate new materialisms within post-humanist discourses, explaining that new materialist philosophies do not privilege human bodies, but rather view human bodies as one of many bodies, or agential materialities, in the world. By revealing how emerging accounts of matter, materiality, and corporeality are combining with developments in science and technology to demand radically new conceptions of nature, agency, and social and political relationships, New Materialisms makes a significant contribution to the recent resurgence of interest in phenomenology and materialist philosophy in the humanities...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} on {{electron}} scales {{a patch of}} the localized magnetic reconnection spreads bi-directionally in a wave like fashion when an external guide-magnetic field {{in the direction of}} the electron current is present. The spreading is caused by the propagation of the flow induced and whistler wave <b>modes</b> <b>away</b> from the localized patch. For small guide fields, the spreading is asymmetric being faster {{in the direction of the}} electron flow. On increasing the guide field, the spreading becomes increasingly symmetric due to the dominance of the whistler group speed in determining the speed of the spreading. The wave-like spreading of reconnection causes the alternate formation of X- and O-points in the reconnection planes separated by half the wavelength of the reconnection wave.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} a Bose-Einstein condensate with two internal states, coupled through a coherent drive. We focus on a specific quench protocol, in which {{the sign of the}} coupling field is suddenly changed. At a mean-field level, the system is transferred from a minimum to a maximum of the coupling energy and can remain dynamically stable, in spite of the development of negative- frequency modes. In the presence of a non-zero detuning between the two states, the "charge" and "spin" modes couple, giving rise to an unstable avoided crossing. This phenomenon is generic to systems with two dispersing <b>modes</b> <b>away</b> from equilibrium and constitutes an example of class-$I_o$ non-equilibrium pattern formation in quantum systems.

By tracking the in-phase particle-hole symmetric oscillations of the order parameter, we provide {{an answer to the}} long-standing question about the fate of the pure amplitude Higgs <b>mode</b> <b>away</b> from the integer-density critical point. Furthermore, we point out that out-of-phase oscillations are responsible for a full suppression of the condensate density oscillations of the gapless Goldstone mode.

40|$|Refined {{theories}} are employed to study nonlinear vibrations of elastic rings in the mth flexural <b>mode</b> <b>away</b> from autoparametric resonances involving other flexural modes. A top-down modeling approach is followed {{to describe the}} rings undergoing all deformation modes in space by the Special Cosserat theory of curved rods. The specialization to extensional-flexural-shearing, then to extensional-flexural, and finally to purely flexural planar motions is illustrated. Free undamped extensional-flexural nonlinear motions involving the mth mode and its companion mode are investigated via a direct asymptotic approach based on the method of multiple scales applied to the geometrically exact equations of motion and it is shown that these motions are softening for linearly elastic rings while there are thresholds in the constitutive laws separating softening from hardening behaviors.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the entanglement between individual field theory modes in finite-density systems of interacting relativistic and non-relativistic fermions in one spatial dimension. We calculate the entanglement entropy {{for a single}} field theory mode and the mutual information between any two modes. The calculation is perturbative in the four-fermion (two-body) coupling, with the leading contribution at order lambda^ 2 log(lambda^ 2). At this leading order, the perturbative expression for the entanglement entropy of a mode diverges logarithmically as {{the momentum of the}} mode approaches the Fermi surface from above or below. The mutual information between modes is largest for pairs of modes just above and below the Fermi momentum. The entanglement properties of modes near the Fermi surface are qualitatively the same if the field theory is cut off to eliminate <b>modes</b> <b>away</b> from the Fermi surface.

40|$|Helminths are {{the largest}} and most complex {{pathogens}} to invade and live within the human body. Since they are not able to outpace the immune system by rapid antigen variation or faster cell division or retreat into protective niches not accessible to immune effector mechanisms, their long-term survival depends on influencing and regulating the immune responses <b>away</b> from the <b>mode</b> of action most damaging to them. Immunologists have focused on the excretory and secretory products that are released by the helminths, since they can change the host environment by modulating the immune system. Here we give a brief overview of the helminth-associated immune response and the currently available helminth secretome data. We introduce some major secretome-derived immunomodulatory molecules and describe their potential mode of action.

40|$|Nonlinear wave {{propagation}} in parity-time (PT) symmetric localized potentials is investigated analytically near a phase-transition point where {{a pair of}} real eigenvalues of the potential coalesce and bifurcate into the complex plane. Necessary conditions for phase transition to occur are derived based on a generalization of the Krein signature. Using multi-scale perturbation analysis, a reduced nonlinear ODE model is derived for the amplitude of localized solutions near phase transition. Above phase transition, this ODE model predicts a family of stable solitons not bifurcating from linear (infinitesimal) modes under a certain sign of nonlinearity. In addition, it predicts periodically-oscillating nonlinear <b>modes</b> <b>away</b> from solitons. Under the opposite sign of nonlinearity, it predicts unbounded growth of solutions. Below phase transition, solution dynamics is predicted as well. All analytical results are compared to direct computations of the full system and good agreement is observed.
