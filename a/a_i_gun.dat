5000|$|In 1971, Moullet {{made his}} first color film, Une aventure de Billy le Kid, also known by its English title, <b>A</b> Girl <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Gun.</b> A {{psychedelic}} Western starring French New Wave icon Jean-Pierre Léaud, the film was never released in France, but was instead shown abroad in an English-dubbed version. The dubbing, conceived by Moullet {{as a tribute to}} the [...] "shabbiness" [...] he always admired in American genre films, is intentionally bad, and the short, slight Leaud is given a mismatched deep voice.|$|R

60|$|Somehow I {{expected}} Steele {{to arrive}} at that moment, and his step did not surprise me. He came round the corner as he always turned any corner, quick, alert, with his hand down.
