500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, it was like I was looking <b>at</b> <b>somebody</b> else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E
500|$|Jarrold {{sought to}} make Becoming Jane [...] "look and feel" [...] {{realistic}} [...] "so everything is not lit in a very glamorous Hollywood way." [...] According to him, [...] "One of the key ideas in the film was {{to get away from}} the old, stuffy costume drama kind of feel of what Jane Austen is and to look <b>at</b> <b>somebody</b> before she becomes a genius, when she is in her early twenties and on the verge of writing her great thing; she had a real exuberance for life, intelligent and independent and a sort of outsider in rural Hampshire, more intelligent than the people around her and kicking against all those pressures." [...] To further set his film apart from other costume dramas, American actress Anne Hathaway was cast as the title character. A fan of Jane Austen since she was fourteen, Hathaway immediately began rereading Austen's books, conducting historical research including perusing the author's letters, and also learned sign language, calligraphy, dance choreography, and playing the piano. She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent, and attempted to stay in character throughout filming, the first time she had done so for a movie.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{has been}} {{embroiled in a}} feud with veteran rapper Lil' Kim since her success with Pink Friday. Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, [...] "If {{you are going to}} steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's how it goes to me." [...] Minaj's single [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with Eminem was {{believed}} to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, [...] "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' <b>at</b> <b>somebody!</b> Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch." [...] Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called [...] "Tragedy" [...] was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track [...] "Stupid Hoe" [...] may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with 105's Breakfast Club that the song [...] "Automatic" [...] was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj [...] "obnoxious" [...] and [...] "catty".|$|E

500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. I think of all the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig <b>at</b> <b>somebody</b> just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look <b>at</b> <b>somebody</b> else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E

M.B. also said that when he lay in Clementi's bed, he heard people joking and laughing in the courtyard, and it [...] "seemed like the jokes were <b>at</b> <b>somebody</b> else's expense".

2500|$|A major {{difference}} between Seinfeld and sitcoms which preceded {{it is that the}} principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous towards the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show's producers was: [...] "No hugging, no learning". Entertainment Weeklys TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as [...] "a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings".

On 28 August he suspended his tour, after being hit by an egg in Kirkcaldy, resuming his public speaking again on 3 September. Murphy said that he had been subjected to [...] "co-ordinated abuse" [...] from Yes supporters and pointed to evidence on social media to support this. Better Together released footage of events in the tour where he was heckled by members of the public, some of whom called him a [...] "traitor", [...] "parasite", [...] "terrorist" [...] and [...] "quisling". David Cameron said that [...] "there's nothing wrong with a bit of heckling, but throwing things isn't necessarily part of the democratic process".
