40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a three-dimensional combustor model for predicting the performance of full-scale tangential fired (TF) boiler and to determine the flow patterns of the gas and coal particles, with an emphasis on formation mechanism of gas flow deviations and uneven temperature on the super-heaters, re-heaters and divisional super-heater sections of the furnace. The importance of these simulations is to identify the locations of optimum <b>additive</b> <b>injection</b> ports to achieve maximum impact of additives in the combustion process to minimize the temperature deviation and reduce ash-related issues. This study is a classic example of numerical investigation into the problem of turbulent reacting flows in large scale furnaces employed in thermal power plants for the remediation of ash deposition problems. Present work also provides an investigation of the influence of number of tripped burners on the characteristics of the flow and thermal fields. Excellent agreement between the simulation results and key boiler design values and available site operation records following full-scale trials indicate that the calculations are reliable. The results obtained from the present work are directly relevant to coal-fired utilities for not only demonstrating the effectiveness of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based tools in combating operational issues but also provides an alternative to conventional remediation strategies.

40|$|Electrostatic charge {{generation}} is unavoidable in gas-solid fluidized beds {{due to the}} repeated particle-particle and particle reactor wall contacts and separations. In industrial operations such as in polyethylene production this phenomenon results in the significant problem of reactor wall fouling, known as “sheeting”. To better understand the underlying charging mechanisms involved in gas-solid fluidized beds {{in an attempt to}} eliminate and/or reduce the effect a novel on-line electrostatic charge measurement technique was developed, which concurrently provided information on both the degree of fluidized bed electrification and reactor wall fouling. A Faraday cup replaced the windbox of the fluidized bed while another cup was placed {{at the top of the}} column. The distributor plate was uniquely designed for the systematic removal of bed particles and those adhered to the column wall for their charge measurement with the bottom Faraday cup, and the charge of the entrained particles was measured by the top Faraday cup. This is the first study which allowed the charge measurement of particles in the bulk of the bed, particles adhered to the column wall, and those entrained, simultaneously. In addition, this method uniquely permitted the evaluations of the degree of reactor wall fouling under different operating conditions. An experimental program was designed to investigate the influence of bed hydrodynamics (fluidizing gas velocity and particle size), fluidization column wall material, and the addition of different solid additives. Fluidizing particles were polyethylene resin from an industrial reactor. Bi-polar charging was observed where the elutriated particles were oppositely charged compared to those in the bulk of the bed and those adhered to the column wall. Particles within the wall coating were also found to be bi-polarly charged. With the resin tested as received, a certain sized particles (350 - 575 µm) adhered to the column wall. The specific charge of the particles near the column wall was found not to be a definite indication of the amount of wall fouling. Increasing the gas velocity promoted wall fouling and elevated the charge density of the particles within both bubbling and slugging flow regimes. The effect of solid <b>additive</b> <b>injection</b> was examined with two static drivers known to reduce wall fouling in industrial operations, a deactivated catalyst, and the catalyst support.

40|$|The Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) {{was asked}} by PPL Montana LLC (PPL) to provide {{assistance}} and develop an approach to identify cost-effective options for mercury control at its coal-fired power plants. The work conducted focused on baseline mercury level and speciation measurement, short-term parametric testing, and week long testing of mercury control technology at Colstrip Unit 3. Three techniques and various combinations of these techniques were identified as viable options for mercury control. The options included oxidizing agents or sorbent enhancement additives (SEAs) such as chlorine-based SEA 1 and an EERC proprietary SEA 2 with and without activated carbon injection. Baseline mercury emissions from Colstrip Unit 3 are comparatively low relative to other Powder River Basin (PRB) coal-fired systems and were found to range from 5 to 6. 5 g/Nm 3 (2. 9 to 3. 8 lb/TBtu), with a rough value of approximately 80 % being elemental upstream of the scrubber and higher than 95 % being elemental at the outlet. Levels in the stack were also greater than 95 % elemental. Baseline mercury removal across the scrubber is fairly variable but generally tends to be about 5 % to 10 %. Parametric results of carbon injection alone yielded minimal reduction in Hg emissions. SEA 1 injection resulted in 20 % additional reduction over baseline with the maximum rate of 400 ppm (3 gal/min). Week long testing was conducted with the combination of SEA 2 and carbon, with injection rates of 75 ppm (10. 3 lb/hr) and 1. 5 lb/MMacf (40 lb/hr), respectively. Reduction {{was found to be}} an additional 30 % and, overall during the testing period, was measured to be 38 % across the scrubber. The novel <b>additive</b> <b>injection</b> method, known as novel SEA 2, is several orders of magnitude safer and less expensive than current SEA 2 injection methods. However, used in conjunction with this plant configuration, the technology did not demonstrate a significant level of mercury reduction. Near-future use of this technique at Colstrip is not seen. All the additives injected resulted in some reduction in mercury emissions. However, the target reduction of 55 % was not achieved. The primary reason for the lower removal rates is because of the lower levels of mercury in the flue gas stream and the lower capture level of fine particles by the scrubbers (relative to that for larger particles). The reaction and interaction of the SEA materials is with the finer fraction of the fly ash, because the SEA materials are vaporized during the combustion or reaction process and condense on the surfaces of entrained particles or form very small particles. Mercury will have a tendency to react and interact with the finer fraction of entrained ash and sorbent {{as a result of the}} higher surface areas of the finer particles. The ability to capture the finer fraction of fly ash is the key to controlling mercury. Cost estimates for mercury removal based on the performance of each sorbent during this project are projected to be extremely high. When viewed on a dollar-per-pound-of-mercury removed basis activated carbon was projected to cost nearly $ 1. 2 million per pound of mercury removed. This value is roughly six times the cost of other sorbent-enhancing agents, which were projected to be closer to $ 200, 000 per pound of mercury removed...|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{amounts of}} money are spent each year on {{cleaning}} up ground water contaminations that were caused by historical industrial site activities. Too often, however, remedial objectives are not achieved within the anticipated time frame. Moreover, remedial budgets which were estimated {{prior to the start}} of remediation turn out to be largely insufficient to meet the remedial objectives. This situation, very common, creates significant troubles for all the stakeholders involved in the remediation project. The reason for not meeting remedial regulatory closure criteria or exceeding remedial budgets is often due to an incomplete conceptual site model. Having conducted high resolution site characterization programs at numerous sites where remediation was previously conducted, ERM has found several recurring themes: • Missed source areas and plumes; • Inadequate understanding of source area and plume architectures (i. e., three-dimensional contaminant distribution); • Inadequate understanding of the effects of site (hydro) geologic conditions on the ability to access contamination (i. e., via remedial <b>additive</b> <b>injections</b> of groundwater/soil gas extraction). This paper explains why remediations often fail and what the alternatives to prevent these failures (and exceeding remedial budgets) are. More specifically, it focuses on alternative investigation methods and approaches that help to get to a more complete (high resolution) conceptual site model. This more complete conceptual site model in return helps a more focused remedial design with a higher remedial efficiency. As a minimum, it will take away a lot of (financial) uncertainty during the decision making when selecting a remedial alternative. Contaminants that have a greater density then water are known to have a greater complexity in terms of both investigation as well as remediation.

40|$|Abstract—We model a {{degraded}} {{image as}} an original image {{that has been}} subject to linear frequency distortion and <b>additive</b> noise <b>injection.</b> Since the psychovisual effects of frequency distortion and noise injection are independent, we decouple these two sources of degradation and measure their effect on the human visual system. We develop a distortion measure (DM) {{of the effect of}} frequency distortion, and a noise quality measure (NQM) of the effect of additive noise. The NQM, which is based on Peli’s contrast pyramid, takes into account the following: 1) variation in contrast sensitivity with distance, image dimensions, and spatial frequency; 2) variation in the local luminance mean; 3) contrast interaction between spatial frequencies; 4) contrast masking effects. For additive noise, we demonstrate that the nonlinear NQM is a better measure of visual quality than peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and linear quality measures. We compute the DM in three steps. First, we find the frequency distortion in the degraded image. Second, we compute the deviation of this frequency distortion from an allpass response of unity gain (no distortion). Finally, we weight the deviation by a model of the frequency response of the human visual system and integrate over the visible frequencies. We demonstrate how to decouple distortion and additive noise degradation in a practical image restoration system. Index Terms—Computational vision, human visual system modeling, image quality.

30|$|Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer {{flooding}} (ASP) is a {{tertiary recovery}} method designed to lower interfacial tension (IFT) and decrease water mobility to produce residual oil (Wyatt et al. 2002). ASP flood uses {{a combination of}} alkali, surfactant, and polymer to achieve these results. The purpose of the surfactant in an ASP flood is to lower the IFT between the residual oil and the injected fluids. However, the alkali reacts with acidic components of the oil to form additional surfactant within the formation to further lower the IFT. The use of alkali is much less costly than equivalent levels of surfactant, allowing for a more cost-efficient flood (Demin et al. 1997). The polymer is used for better sweep of the reservoir due to its ability to increase the viscosity of the fluids. This allows for better mobility control.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. In the past few years, research has been conducted at Texas A&M University on steam-propane injection to enhance oil recovery from the Morichal field, Venezuela, which contains 13. 5 ?API gravity oil. Experimental results show that a 5 : 100 propane:steam mass ratio efficiently accelerates the beginning and peak of oil production by 20 % and 13 % pore volume steam injected (cold water equivalent), respectively. This experimental study was undertaken to better understand the role of propane in accelerating oil production and to compare the performance of steam-propane injection versus steam injection alone on an intermediate crude oil of 21 ?API gravity. Eight experimental runs were performed: three pure steam injection runs, three steam-propane injection runs with 5 : 100 propane:steam mass ratio, and two steam-methane injection runs with 5 : 100 methane:steam mass ratio. Main findings of this study may be summarized as follows. First, propane used as an <b>additive</b> in steam <b>injection</b> accelerates the start and peak of oil production by about 12 % and 13 % of the steam injected pore volume respectively, compared to steam alone or steam-methane injection. Second, propane behaves as a miscible solvent reducing the produced oil density. It appears to act as a carrier gas by picking up the lighter oil fractions and transporting them ahead of the steam front where they condense, lowering the viscosity of the oil. Third, as an <b>additive</b> in steam <b>injection,</b> methane has a low miscibility with the oil. From the analysis of the produced oil samples, it appears that oil density and viscosity {{are similar to those of}} the initial oil in the steam-methane runs. Fourth, oil recoveries for the runs were in the range of 52 - 59 % of original oil in the cell, based on the 150 minutes run time.

Given the large energy requirements and volumes of emitted greenhouse gases from SAGD processes, {{there is a strong}} motivation to develop enhanced oil recovery processes with lower energy and emission intensities. In this study, the addition of solvents to steam has been examined to reduce the energy intensity of the SAGD process. Higher oil recovery, accelerated oil production rate, reduced steam-to-oil ratio, and more favorable economics are expected from the addition of suitable hydrocarbon additives to steam. A systematic approach was used to develop an effective hybrid steam/solvent injection to improve the SAGD process. Initially, an extensive parametric simulation study was carried out to find the suitable hydrocarbon <b>additives</b> and <b>injection</b> strategies. Simulation studies aim to narrow down hybrid steam/solvent processes, design suitable solvent type and concentration, and explain the mechanism of solvent addition to steam. In the experimental phase, the most promising solvents (n-hexane and n-heptane) were used with different injection strategies. Steam and hydrocarbon additives were injected in continuous or alternating schemes. The results of the integrated experimental and simulation study were used to better understand the mechanism of hybrid steam/solvent processes. Experimental and simulation results show that solvent co-injection with steam leads to a process with higher oil production, better oil recovery, and less energy intensity with more favorable economy. Solvent choice for hybrid steam/solvent injection is not solely dependent on the mobility improvement capability of the solvents but also reservoir properties and operational conditions such as operating pressure and injection strategy. Pure heated solvent injection requires significant quantities. A vaporized solvent chamber is not sustainable due to low latent heat of the solvents. Alternating steam and solvent injection provides heat for the solvent cycles and increases oil recovery. Co-injection of small volumes (5 - 15 % by volume) of suitable solvents at the early times of the SAGD operation considerably improves the economics of the SAGD process...|$|R

40|$|Plastic {{injection}} molding is a versatile process {{and a major}} part of the present plastic manufacturing industry. Traditional die design is limited to straight (drilled) cooling channels, which don 2 ̆ 7 t impart optimal thermal (or thermos-mechanical) performance. Moreover, reducing the cycle time in plastic {{injection molding}} has become significantly important to the industry nowadays. One approach that has been proposed is to use conformal cooling channels. With the advent of <b>additive</b> manufacturing technology, <b>injection</b> molding tools with conformal cooling channels are now possible. However, optimum conformal channels based on thermo-mechanical performance are not found. This study proposes a design methodology to generate optimized design configurations of such channels in plastic injection molds. Numerical models have been developed here to represent the thermo-mechanical behavior of the molds and predict the stress and cooling time. The model is then validated experimentally and used in conjunction with DOE (Design of Experiments) to study the effect of different design parameters of the channels on the die performance. Design of experiments (DOEs) is used to study the effect of critical design parameters of conformal channels as well as their cross section geometries. These DOEs are conducted to identify optimal designs of conformal cooling channels which can be incorporated into injection molds that are used to manufacture cylindrical and conical shapes of plastic parts.

40|$|Abstract A {{research}} activity was recently {{started at the}} University of Napoli Federico II on the unusual application of permeation grouting to low permeability soils and rocks. The project is aimed to find a remedial mean {{to some of the}} geotechnical hazards which involve the subsoil of Napoli, mostly made in its upper part of collapsible unsaturated pyroclastic silty sands (pozzolana). This paper refers on the results obtained by treating pozzolana with sodium silicate solutions made of water with a rather little percentage of silicates and of an inorganic <b>additive.</b> Laboratory <b>injection</b> tests and numerical simulations of the permeation process were first carried out, showing that the permeation times for the adopted grouts and soil are reasonable. Notwithstanding the low permeability of pozzolana, in fact, the typical unsaturated site conditions help in making permeation grouting possible if very low viscosity grouts are adopted. To fit this severe viscosity constraint, very diluted solutions have to be used. Because of the well known chemical activity of pozzolana grains, grouting can be effective even with such diluted grouts. Chemical tests were carried out in laboratory on both grouts and grouted materials: the influence of the percentage of additive on grout gelification time and the evolution of the reticulation process within the grout were carefully analysed, as well as the chemical and physical interaction between pozzolana and grout. Mechanical laboratory tests were carried out on specimens of grouted pozzolana to quantify the effect of grouting. The results clearly indicate that the very diluted silicate grouts adopted are effective in this case, improving mechanical properties of pozzolana not only from a physical point of view, that is by building up a polymeric net within the voids, but also with a direct chemical interaction among the grout and the soil grains. The mechanical properties of grouted pozzolana depend on curing time, grout content and surrounding moisture conditions. In the lowest moisture curing conditions, the largest mechanical strength are reached in no more than 30 days, while much longer curing times are needed in very humid curing conditions. All other factors being the same, the strength of the grouted material increases as the amount of retained grout increases. Whatever the grout content and curing moisture conditions, grouting increases the cohesive strength component. As a consequence, it helps in mitigating the hazard posed by the collapsible behaviour of the untreated pozzolana. The reduction of permeability was not a goal of this research, and so no specific analyses where carried out to check the reduction of such parameter upon treatment. However, the available SEM pictures indicate that some reduction must be expected, because both the porosity and the dimensions of the voids decrease upon grouting...|$|R
40|$|One titrimetric and two {{spectrophotometric}} {{methods are}} described for the assay of prochlorperazine mesylate(PCPM) in bulk drug and in injection using N-chlorosuccinimide(NCS) and two dyes, methyl orange and indigo carmine as reagents. In titrimetry, aqueous solution of PCPM is titrated directly {{with a standard}} solution of NCS in acid medium and {{in the presence of}} potassium bromide(KBr). Spectrophotometric methods entail the addition of a known excess of NCS to a solution of PCPM in acid medium and in the presence of KBr followed by determination of residual bromine by reacting with a fixed amount of either methyl orange and measuring the absorbance at 520 nm (method A) or indigo carmine and measuring the absorbance at 610 nm (method B). In all the methods, the amount of NCS reacted corresponds to the amount of PCPM. In titrimetry, the reaction stoichiometry was found to be 1 : 1 (PCPM: NCS) and is applicable over 3. 5 - 20 mg range. In spectrophotometric methods, the absorbance was found increase linearly with PCPM concentration with the correlation coefficients of 0. 9986 and 0. 9993 for method A and method B, respectively. The systems obey Beer's law for 0. 25 - 3. 0 µg/mL (method A) and 0. 5 - 8. 0 µg/mL (method B). The calculated apparent molar absorptivity values are 1. 11 x 10 (5) and 4. 49 x 10 (4) L/mol/cm for method A and method B, respectively, and the corresponding Sandell sensitivity values are 0. 005 and 0. 013 ug/cm². The limits of detection and quantification are reported for both spectrophotometric methods. Intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy of the methods were evaluated as per ICH guidelines. The methods were successfully applied to the determination of PCPM in injection, and the results were statistically compared with those of a reference method by applying Student's t- test and F-test. No interference was observed from common <b>additives</b> found in <b>injection</b> solution. The accuracy and reliability of the methods were further ascertained by performing recovery test via standard addition metho...|$|R
40|$|Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) of dye- and {{semiconductor}} sensitized {{solar cells}} is studied. In the first part, the structural effect of terpyridine (tpy) and dipirazinilpyridine (dpp) sensitizing dyes {{on the performance}} of solar cells is investigated. Mesoporous thin films of TiO 2 on conductive glass are sensitized with carboxylic or ester functionalized tpy and dpp ruthenium dyes. The solar conversion behavior of all dyes is investigated based on the results obtained from PEC, incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE), electrochemistry and also optical techniques such as FTIR, UV-Vis and fluorescence. PEC efficiencies of up to 1. 56 % are achieved by tpy dye named H 2 when used in a cell with a plain l-/l 3 - electrolyte. The effect of the additives in the electrolyte on the behaviour of the dyes is also studied and it is shown that due to the change of the location of the conduction band (CB) of TiO 2 in the presence of these <b>additives,</b> the electron <b>injection</b> efficiencies of the dyes changes and directly translates in to lower efficiency values. In an independent but related study on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), a new class of siliconized triaryalmine compounds are used as hole transport material (HTM) to replace the conventional l-/l 3 - electrolyte. These compounds increase the gained photovoltage (Voc) of the device up to 1 V which is an exceptional development in the field of DSSCs based on HTMs. Open-circuit photovoltage decay studies are employed to address the issues with respect to large recombination with these compounds in a solar cells. In the last part of my research, the effect of the preparation techniques of cadmium seleno-sulfides (CdSeS) {{on the performance of}} semiconductor-sensitized solar cells (SSSCs) is studied. TiO 2 films are sensitized with different compositions of CdSexS 1 -x where x stands for the molar ratio of Se {{in the structure of the}} sensitizer. The sensitization is performed by chemical bath deposition in NH 3 and sodium trinitriloacetate (NTA) solution and the effect of the performance of the resulting cell is related to the structure of the sensitizer deposited through each chemical bath.

40|$|Simulation {{study has}} shown oil {{production}} is accelerated when propane {{is used as}} an <b>additive</b> during steam <b>injection.</b> To better understand this phenomenon, distillation experiments were performed using San Ardo crude oil (12 oAPI). For comparison purposes, three distillation processes were investigated: dry-, steam-, and steam-propanedistillation, the latter at the propane-to-steam mass ratio of 0. 05 at steam injection rate 0. 5 g/min. Two sets of the distillation experiments were carried out. In {{the first set of}} experiments, the distillation temperatures ranged from 115 ????C to 300 ????C. Distillation pressures ranged from 0 psig to 998 psig for steam- and steam-propane distillation. The temperature-pressure combination used represented 15 ????C superheated steam conditions. In the second set of experiments, the distillation temperatures ranged from 220 oC to 300 oC at 260 psig. The temperature pressure combination used represented field conditions for crude oil. For both conditions, the cell was kept at each temperature plateau (cut) until no increase occurs in distillation yields. Distillation yields were collected at each cut, and the volume and weight of water and hydrocarbon measured. Based on these experiments, a thermodynamic modeling framework was developed that describes distillation effect and oil production for steam distillation experiments. The model is based on composition of crude oil, molecular weight of heavy fraction. The analytical model results are compared against the experimental data for synthetic crude and crude oil to verify the validity of the model. Main results of the study may be summarized as follows. The yields for steam distillation for saturated conditions of Tsat+ 15 o C and Psat is 10 % and with addition of 5 % of propane to steam no significant increase occurs in distillation yields. The yields for steam distillation for field conditions of 260 psig and temperature range (220 ~ 300 oC) is 18 % and with addition of 5 % of propane to steam no significant increase in distillation yields. The results indicate that propane has minimal distillation effect on the heavy oil. This occurs possibly because of lesser amount of light fractions in the heavy oil that enhance the separation of components in the oil caused by the concentration gradient...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} and simulation studies -conducted at the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University - confirm oil production is accelerated when propane {{is used as}} an <b>additive</b> during steam <b>injection.</b> To better understand this phenomenon, distillation experiments were performed using seven-component synthetic oil consisting of equal weights of the following alkanes: n-C 5, n-C 6, n-C 7, n-C 8, n-C 9, nC 10, and n-C 15. For comparison purposes, three distillation processes were investigated: dry-, steam-, and steam-propane-distillation, the latter at a propane:steam mass ratio of 0. 05. The injection rate of nitrogen during dry-and steam-distillation {{was the same as}} that of propane during steam-propane distillation, 0. 025 g/min, with steam injection rate kept at 0. 5 g/min. The distillation temperatures ranged from 115 ?C to 300 ?C and were increased in steps of 10 ?C. The cell was kept at each temperature plateau (cut) for 30 minutes. Distillation pressures ranged from 0 psig for dry distillation to 998 psig for steam-and steam-propane distillation. The temperature-pressure combination used represented 15 ?C superheated steam conditions. Distillate samples were collected at each cut, and the volume and weight of water and hydrocarbon measured. In addition, the composition of the hydrocarbon distillate was measured using a gas chromatograph. Main results of the study may be summarized as follows. First, the hydrocarbon yield at 125 ?C is highest with steam-propane distillation (74 wt%) compared to steam distillation (58 wt%), and lowest with dry distillation (36 wt%). This explains in part the oil production acceleration observed in steam-propane displacement experiments. Second, the final hydrocarbon yield at 300 ?C however is the same for the three distillation processes. This observation is in line with the fact that oil recoveries were very similar in steam- and steam-propane displacement experiments. Third, based on the yields of individual hydrocarbon components, steam-propane distillation lowers the apparent boiling points of the hydrocarbons significantly. This phenomenon may be the most fundamental effect of propane on hydrocarbon distillation, which results in a higher yield during steam-propane distillation and oil production acceleration during steam-propane displacement. Fourth, experimental K-values are higher in distillations with steam-propane for the components n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, and n-nonane. Fifth, vapor fugacity coefficients for each component are higher in distillations with steam-propane than with steam. Finally, Gibbs excess energy is overall lower in distillations with steam-propane than with steam. The experimental results clearly indicate the importance of distillation on oil recovery during steam-or steam-propane injection. The experimental procedure and method of analysis developed in this study (for synthetic oil) will be beneficial to future researchers in understanding the effect of propane as steam additive on actual crude oils...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 113 - 116). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Experimental studies were carried out to compare the benefits of propane as an <b>additive</b> in steam <b>injection</b> and in lean gas injection to enhance production for the Minas light crude oil (34 ?API). The studies on steam-propane were specifically conducted to better understand production mechanisms involved in steam-propane injection and to investigate effects of expected field pressure and temperature conditions on steam-propane injection for the light Minas crude oil. The steam-propane experiments involved injecting steam or a mixture of steam and propane into a cell in which was tamped a mixture of sand, oil and water. The cell was placed inside a vacuum jacket set at a reservoir temperature of 200 ?F. Superheated steam at 490 ?F was injected at 4. 5 ml/min (cold-water equivalent) while the cell outlet pressure was maintained at 450 psig. A total of four runs were successfully performed with two different propane:steam mass ratios, namely, 0 : 100 (pure steam) and 5 : 100 (steam-propane). Produced liquids were collected {{from the bottom of the}} cell and analyzed to determined oil and water volumes as well as oil density and viscosity after being treated to break the emulsion. The gas injection experiments involved injecting reconstituted Minas field production gas or Minas gas enriched with propane into a cell saturated with live Minas oil. The live oil was prepared in an oil-gas recombination apparatus, and closely replicated oil properties at current reservoir conditions (solution GOR of 134 SCF/STB, bubble-point pressure of 280 psig.) Minas gas was injected at 500 ml/min into the cell set at reservoir temperature of 200 ?F. A total of four runs were successfully performed with two different propane:gas mass ratios, namely, 0 : 100 (pure lean gas) and 5 : 100 (enriched gas). The main results of the study are as follows. First, with steam-propane injection, no improvement on production acceleration time, oil recovery or steam injectivity was observed compared with pure steam injection. Second, with enriched gas injection, oil recovery increased from 61 % OOIP with lean gas injection up to 74 % OOIP with enriched gas (5 : 100 propane:gas mass ratio). Analysis of produced oil gravity and viscosity indicate little change in values compared to that of the original oil. Of the processes investigated (pure steam, steam-propane, lean gas, and enriched gas injection), enriched gas injection appears to be technically the most feasible EOR method for Minas field. It is recommended therefore to conduct research on possible application of water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection with propane-enriched Minas gas to enhance production from the Minas field...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was pointed at exploring technical feasibility of castor biodiesel with and without diethyl ether <b>additives</b> in direct <b>injection</b> compression ignition engines without any substantial hardware modifications. In this work, the methyl ester of castor oil with and without additives was investigated for its performance as a diesel engine fuel. Fatty acid methyl ester was produced via transesterification process using potassium hydroxide as a catalyst and purified castor oil which is extracted from the castor seed was used.   To obtain a high quality biodiesel fuel that comply the specification of standard methods, some important variables such as reaction temperature, molar ratio of methanol to oil and mass weight of catalyst were selected and studied. At the following optimum conditions; 60 °C of reaction temperature, 6 : 1 methanol to castor oil molar ratio, 1 % catalyst concentration wt/wt%, reaction time of 90 minutes and 600 rpm agitating speed, an optimum fatty acid methyl ester yield of 92. 08 % was obtained, indicating that potassium hydroxide has the potential as a catalyst for the production of fatty acid methyl ester from castor oil.   The fuel samples were prepared by blending castor ethyl ester with diesel in the composition of B 0, B 10, B 15, B 20, B 10 DEE 5, B 15 DEE 5, and B 20 DEE 5. Moreover, after preparation of the tested fuels only the kinematic viscosity were measured and the measured results were changed. For instance, kinematic viscosity changes in percent were 23. 5 %, 22. 5 % and 18. 7 % for B 10 DEE 5, B 15 DEE 5 and B 20 DEE 5 respectively.   The performance parameters evaluated were break thermal efficiency (B. Th.), torque and power. The results of experimental investigation with biodiesel blends were compared with that of methyl ester and baseline diesel. The results indicate that the torque percentage variation of fuels with DEE additive increase with increase engine speed, this shows the percentage change of torque at lower speed is small, because even though the fuel has higher viscosity than B 0 it has sufficient combustion time. At higher engine speed the percentage torque variation is higher; {{this is due to the}} high reciprocating motion of the piston the fuel cannot get sufficient time to be evaporated and combusted due to pure atomization.   The comparing power percentage difference between fuel with and without DEE to the neat diesel fuel, with DEE is less power difference than without DEE, this is due to DEE the fuel has less viscosity than without DEE, this increase atomization of fuel to easily burn in the combustion chamber.   The BSFC percentage difference which is compared to fuels with and without DEE to the neat diesel fuel,from this figures the difference between diesel fuel and with DEE adding fuel is smaller than without DEE fuels, this is due to DEE the fuel is atomized and easly burned this decreased the fuel consumption.    Furthermore, a single cylinder compression ignition engine was operated successfully using ethyl ester of castor oil as the soul fuel with acceptable performance.
