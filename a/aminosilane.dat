50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) in 1970 for the replacement of hydroxyl groups with fluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride was the reagent most commonly used to accomplish this transformation. However, sulfur tetrafluoride only reacts with the most acidic hydroxyl groups (its substrate scope is limited), and is difficult to handle, toxic, and capable of generating hydrogen fluoride upon hydrolysis. Thus, aminosulfurane reagents such as diethylaminosulfur trifluoride have largely replaced SF4 as the reagents of choice for replacement of hydroxyl groups with fluoride.Aminosulfuranes are usually prepared by reaction of the corresponding dialkylamino(trialkyl)silanes with SF4. When the aminosulfurane is exposed to a second equivalent of <b>aminosilane,</b> bis(dialkylamino)sulfur difluorides result. Tris(dialkylamino)sulfonium difluorotrimethylsilicates such as tris(diethylamino)sulfonium difluorotrimethylsilicate (TASF) have achieved synthetic utility as reagents for the fluorination of halides.

50|$|Solution-phase {{reaction}} {{has historically}} been the method that has been most studied, and a general consensus that has evolved {{with regards to the}} conditions required for the formation of smooth <b>aminosilane</b> films includes the following: (1) an anhydrous solvent such as toluene is required, with a rigidly controlled trace amount of water to regulate the degree of polymerization of aminosilanes at the surface and in solution; (2) formation of oligomers and polymers is favored at higher silane concentrations (>10%); (3) moderate temperatures (60-90 °C) can disrupt non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, leading to fewer silane molecules that are weakly tethered to the surface. Additionally, condition (3) favors desorption of water from the substrate into the toluene phase20; (4) Rinsing with solvents such as toluene, ethanol and water following the silanization reaction favors the removal of weakly bonded silane molecules and the hydrolysis of residual alkoxy linkages in the layer; (5) drying and curing at high temperature (110 °C) favors the formation of siloxane linkages and also converts ammonium ions to the neutral amine, which is more reactive.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} part in a biosensor is to attach the biological elements (small molecules/protein/cells) {{to the surface of}} the sensor (be it metal, polymer or glass). The simplest way is to functionalize the surface in order to coat it with the biological elements. This can be done by polylysine, <b>aminosilane,</b> epoxysilane or nitrocellulose in the case of silicon chips/silica glass. Subsequently, the bound biological agent may be for example fixed by Layer by layer depositation of alternatively charged polymer coatings.Alternatively three-dimensional lattices (hydrogel/xerogel) can be used to chemically or physically entrap these (where by chemically entraped it is meant that the biological element is kept in place by a strong bond, while physically they are kept in place being unable to pass through the pores of the gel matrix). The most commonly used hydrogel is sol-gel, a glassy silica generated by polymerization of silicate monomers (added as tetra alkyl orthosilicates, such as TMOS or TEOS) in the presence of the biological elements (along with other stabilizing polymers, such as PEG) in the case of physical entrapment. [...] Another group of hydrogels, which set under conditions suitable for cells or protein, are acrylate hydrogel, which polymerize upon radical initiation. One type of radical initiator is a peroxide radical, typically generated by combining a persulfate with TEMED (Polyacrylamide gel are also commonly used for protein electrophoresis), alternatively light can be used in combination with a photoinitiator, such as DMPA (2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone). Smart materials that mimic the biological components of a sensor can also be classified as biosensors using only the active or catalytic site or analogous configurations of a biomolecule.|$|E

The nature of the surface functional groups of the silane layers prepared by solution phase deposition in aqueous and anhydrous solvents were studied using various techniques including ellipsometry, goniometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). The XPS analyses revealed the presence of various oxygen functionalities on the plasma activated thermoplastics. Considerable differences were observed for the structure of <b>aminosilane</b> depending on the solvent used for the reaction. Deposition from aqueous solution resulted in relatively flat and smooth surfaces with consistent thickness compared to the anhydrous solution deposition.

The ultimate goal was to obtain a smooth, well-organized and stable siloxane film with suitable surface energy. Such films are expected to perform well in adhering resins to dental metal alloys when the films contain reactive functional groups. <b>Aminosilanes</b> were prepared as 0. 5 vol. % solutions in dilute ethanol (50 vol. % ethanol in deionized water), with their natural pH of ∼ 9. The substrates were silanized in two ways: silane was allowed to react at room temperature or was cured for 1 h at 110 °C. The surface characterization was carried out by reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (RA-FTIR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurement and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Siloxane film thickness measurements were not made. According to spectral analysis, all silanes indicated covalent bond formation with titanium. ≡Si-O-Ti≡ and ≡Si-O-Si≡ bonds were clearly seen in the spectra, suggesting that chemical retention had taken place. After curing at elevated temperature, the spectral bands seemed to be stronger than those on samples cured at room temperature. Curing of hydrolyzed silanes at elevated temperature seemed to enhance the siloxane layer formation, derived from <b>aminosilanes,</b> on the Ti substrate.

50|$|Vapor-phase {{silanization}} {{has been}} approached {{as a way}} to circumvent the complexities of trace water in solution and silane purity. Since oligomers and polymers of silanes have negligible vapor pressure at the reaction temperatures commonly used, they do not reach the surface of the silicate during deposition.

In this work, we have inves- tigated the passivation ability of porous oxidized silicon multilayered structures by two <b>aminosilane</b> compounds, 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane and 3 -aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane (APDMES), for optical label-free ON biosensor fabrication. We have also studied by spectroscopic reflectome- try the hybridization between a 13 bases ON, directly grown on the <b>aminosilane</b> modified porous oxidized silicon by in situ synthesis, and its complementary sequence. Even if {{the results show that}} both devices are stable to the chemicals (carbonate/methanol) used, the porous silica struc- ture passivated by APDMES reveals higher functionalization degree due to less steric hindrance of pores...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis of {{monodisperse}} silica {{was performed}} in a precipitation reaction from aqueous solution of sodium metasilicate using hydrochloric acid in an emulsion system. Effect of N- 2 -(aminoethyl) - 3 -aminopropylotrimethoxysilane was studied on surface and morphological properties of the precipitated silica. Particle size and polydispersity were measured using the technique of dynamic light scatter (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The extent of surface modification and its type were evaluated using FTIR spectroscopy. Moreover, adsorptive properties were characterised by estimation of specific surface area (BET) and of macroporosity. The XPS technique permitted to quantify the amount of modifier deposited on silica surface. Alterations in surface charge were studies by estimation of isoelectric point by direct testing of electrophoretic mobility and, indirectly, by calculating zeta potential. <b>Aminosilane</b> modification of SiO 2, formed in emulsion medium, results in extensive changes in surface character and in morphology of the particles. Already {{at the time of}} silica preparation surface silanol groups become markedly reduced and, in addition, <b>aminosilane</b> chemisorption results in augmented hydrophobicity. Increased particle homogeneity has also been obtained and a decreased value of polydispersity due to <b>aminosilane</b> interactions with the surface of examined silica...|$|E
40|$|An {{organometallic}} sol-gel {{route is}} presented for {{the synthesis of}} concentrated 12 - 16 - and 6 - 16 -semiconductor cluster assemblies embedded in patternable organosilicate-copolymer films and mnoliths. Bifunctional spacers such as <b>aminosilanes,</b> isoeugenol or phosphines have been employed successfully to both control the CdSe and WSe 3 nucleation processes and protect the formed clusters from attack by silanol groups of the matrix lacquer. The size-dependent spectral response of the clusters may be tuned by careful choice of processing parameters. For example, in combined amino-silane/phosphine cluster sols, reversible spectral changes in the UV/Vis spectra are observed due to a ligand exchange induced growth and decomposition of the cluster aggregates. Alternatively, thermal treatment of CdsE-Organosilicate films allows control of the optical absorption oneset without matrix damage. Furthermore, we wish to report {{the development of a}} new class of functional optical materials such as NIR-fluo rescing Er 3 +/ZnO/organosilicate-hybrids...|$|R
30|$|To {{improve the}} thermal {{stability}} and amine {{efficiency of the}} composite adsorbents, a monolayer or less of CO 2 affinity sites is formulated via grafting of <b>aminosilanes</b> onto the support materials based on their co-condensation reaction, which has been extensively studied adopting 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS), 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propylethylenediamine(diamine) or 3 -[2 -(2 -aminoethylamino)ethylamino] propyltrimethoxy-silane (triamine), etc. [2, 10 – 12]. These kinds of grafted composites show lower diffusion limitations and superior stability, even though {{there may be an}} upper bound of CO 2 adsorption capacity as it is assumed that two moles of exposed amine groups were demanded to capture one mole of CO 2 molecules according to the zwitterion mechanism [13, 14]. Nevertheless, the chemical nature of support materials could also affect the CO 2 adsorption performance. The contributions of surface hydroxyls to CO 2 capturing either through their direct weak physical force [15] or via its hydrogen bonding with the grafted amines [13, 16] on silica-/titania-based adsorbents have been investigated.|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of phosphine or amine structural units into dendritic polymers offer significant potential in building macromolecular species with desired properties for heterogenizing homogeneous catalysis. To this end, synthetic methodologies {{based on the}} chemistry of acid-base hydrolysis of <b>aminosilanes</b> with molecules possessing hydroxyl end groups, and that of phosphorus halides/amides with alkynyl/alcohol monomers were explored as approaches to construct phosphorus(III) - and nitrogen-containing dendritic polymers. Attempted implementation of a three-step, divergent synthetic methodology led {{to the discovery of}} two new phosphorus(III) -based compounds, P[O(CH 2) 2 C≡CH] 3 and P[O(CH 2) 2 C≡CSn(CH 3) 3] 3. Efforts to execute a two-step, divergent synthetic route to nitrogen-containing dendrimers afforded first- and second-generation dendrimers, N 4 and N 10. Attempts to adapt this methodology to one-pot procedures for hyperbranched polyamines show promise. Finally, single-step and pseudo-single-step procedures for synthesizing hyperbranched polyphosphines were employed in the preparation of several phosphorus(III) -containing macromolecules. These materials were successfully functionalized with Rh(I) organometallic complexes...|$|R
