True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly <b>are</b> <b>not...</b> <b>There</b> are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{paralysis}} is when, during awakening {{or falling}} asleep, one is aware {{but unable to}} move. During an episode, one may hear, feel, or see things that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there.</b> It often results in fear. Episodes generally last less {{than a couple of}} minutes. It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent.|$|E
25|$|Beauty {{contests}} {{have been}} criticised for reinforcing {{the idea that}} girls and women should be valued primarily for their physical appearance. This is an especially sensitive issue for naturists as being contrary to the naturist philosophy of body-acceptance of all body types, and that women <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> to be looked at. Beauty contests are no longer as common {{as they were in}} the 1950s and 1960s in mainstream naturist venues.|$|E

The Spanish <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there,</b> but Rear Admiral William T. Sampson orders the city bombed anyway. Numerous civilians die. Major General Wesley Merritt is appointed commander of the American force which will invade the Philippines. Merritt is eventually given more than 20,000 regular army and volunteer troops and told to occupy the entire Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} {{in people}} with DLB most commonly involve perception of people or animals that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there,</b> and may reflect Lewy bodies or AD pathology in the temporal lobe. Delusions may include reduplicative paramnesia and other elaborate misperceptions or misinterpretations. These hallucinations are not necessarily disturbing, and in some cases, the person with DLB may have insight into the hallucinations and even be amused by them, or be conscious they are not real. People with DLB also may have problems with vision, including double vision, and misinterpretation of what they see, for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet for the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of comics streaming {{into the country}} made many ask the question: why <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> individual comic book series published? (N.B. {{at the time the}} main field of Hungarian comics were still newspapers, magazines.) The Ministry of Culture, the Office of Information and the General Directory of Publishing previously never authorized such attempts. The less harsh tone of the mid- and late-eighties (see Glasnost) brought some changes in the field of comics. Some foreign comics were allowed to be published in Hungarian, not just comics from the Eastern Bloc (e.g. Mozaik) or comics from communist French publisher L'Humanité (Vaillant, Pif Gadget), but some politically 'harmless' series as Asterix and Lucky Luke (as Wilám Will) in Alfa, Tom and Jerry (as Tom és Jerry since 1987), Mickey Mouse (as Miki egér from 1988) and Swedish Bobo and Góliát (both from 1986), Tumak, Pink Panther, Nils Holgerson, etc. One of the most important magazines of the era was Kockás, that selected stories from Pif and its predecessor Vaillant.|$|E

25|$|The Challengers, Ray Palmer, Firestorm, Una, Harley, Holly, and Mary Marvel {{attempt to}} figure out what to do about Karate Kid, who lays dying from the virus he's carrying. Solomon, the Monitor of Earth-8, arrives and sends {{everyone}} back to Earth. Jason leaves the group upon their arrival. Soon after, the group discovers that no one recognizes them, and that their homes and headquarters <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there.</b> The group goes to see Dubbilex for help with Karate Kid, only to learn that he has already died. When Karate Kid's autopsy is performed, Morticoccus is accidentally released, grows and attacks the Challengers. The virus is captured by Rayner and explodes. However, it is discovered that the virus began spreading across the planet before the autopsy, causing infected humans to devolve into animalistic savages and infected animals to gain human-like traits. Una helps Buddy Blank reach his daughter's apartment and the two locate Buddy's daughter, who has been infected by the virus, and his grandson, who is immune. Una dies while protecting Buddy and his grandson from a swarm of rats, and gives Buddy her Legion Flight Ring, which he uses to take him and his grandson to Cadmus's Command D facility. The Challengers then leave the reconstituted Earth-51 and return home. After witnessing Darkseid's death, Jason returns to being a solo anti-hero while Donna, Kyle, Ray Palmer and Forager, along with the Monitor Nix Uotan, reform the Challengers and watch over the other Monitors.|$|E
500|$|UK Prime Minister David Cameron and the White House {{condemned}} the violence, and the US State Department called for restraint. US President Obama {{also said that}} the transition [...] "must be meaningful, it must be peaceful and it must begin now". German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle and French President Nicolas Sarkozy asserted the right to march peacefully, while Erdogan called for democratisation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed concern over a new government saying: [...] "I am convinced that the forces that want to bring change and democratization in Egypt will also enhance peace between Israel and the Arab world. But we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> yet. The struggle has not been decided... We need to do everything to make sure that peace endures." ...|$|E
500|$|Descartes' {{argument}} crucially {{depends on}} the premise that what Seth believes to be [...] "clear and distinct" [...] ideas in his mind are necessarily true. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this. For example, Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. Freud claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.|$|E

500|$|The Blattodea {{include some}} thirty species of {{cockroaches}} associated with humans; these species are atypical {{of the thousands}} of species in the order. They feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor. They can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces, particularly in environments such as hospitals. Cockroaches are linked with allergic reactions in humans. One of the proteins that trigger allergic reactions is tropomyosin. These allergens are also linked with asthma. About 60% of asthma patients in Chicago are also sensitive to cockroach allergens. [...] Studies similar to this have been done globally and all the results are similar. [...] Cockroaches can live for a few days up to a month without food, so just because no cockroaches are visible in a home does not mean they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there.</b> Approximately 20-48% of homes with no visible sign of cockroaches have detectable cockroach allergens in dust.|$|E

He also argued directly that the Bill was needed to overcome the Supreme Court's opposition to the New Deal, stating that the nation had {{reached a point where}} it [...] "must take action to save the Constitution from the Court, and the Court from itself".|$|E

2500|$|Sciences Po {{has also}} {{been accused of being}} unduly helped by the media. [...] "Almost every French {{newspaper}} is run by an almunus of Sciences Po", and most of the journalists in France are alumni from Science Po, so it would give the school [...] "a mediatic cover without equivalent" [...] and permit it to [...] "cultivate a culture of secrecy" [...] about its internal affairs. [...] "Sciences-Po is under-criticized," [...] analyzes a professor. Former students are unlikely to criticize it. [...] "Those who teach there have no interest, and not necessarily the urge, to do so. Those who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there</b> can hope to be there one day." [...] The journalist Ariane Chemin stated in 2013 that, because so many journalists come from Sciences Po, the school has an undue good public reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Autism Speaks has {{produced}} three major films, each met with strong {{opposition from the}} Autistic community. Autism Every Day is a documentary featuring interviews of parents with mostly negative opinions about autism and their situations. It has been criticized due to parents speaking about their children as if they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there.</b> [...] In one interview, former board member Alison Singer, mother of a daughter with autism, reveals she contemplated murder-suicide with her daughter in the same room. I Am Autism is a short video that personifies autism as a narrative voice, which compares itself to several diseases and makes the false claim of causing divorce. Sounding the Alarm is a documentary exploring the transition to adulthood {{and the cost of}} lifetime care. It was criticized for being [...] "full of dehumanizing rhetoric" [...] and portraying ignorance of nonverbal communication.|$|E

My learned friend must not use words such as 'Communist' lightly, when he refers to Kantor. Kantor is not a Communist. My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. I think, with respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>there.</b> His complaint in count one is not that they found files with evidence. Oh not, he says that 'we found files with nothing in them', not in Kantor's office, but in the office of Wolpe. Then my learned friend [...] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor. It is not Kantor! Why I say it is so difficult to be restrained, is that my learned friend has thrown in everything that concerns every accused in this case, and says 'that is why I don't want Kantor to get bail.|$|E
