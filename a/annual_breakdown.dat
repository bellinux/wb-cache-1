Epidemiological {{studies have}} demonstrated a decline in caries intensity in schoolchildren, although a simultaneously increasing polarization of the disease has been observed. Objectives. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the appearance of caries in the permanent dentition of 8 - to 12 -year-old children living in Lodz. Material and Methods. A group of 700 children (385 boys and 315 girls) attending randomly selected public primary schools in Lodz were examined. The children were subdivided into 5 age groups, with an <b>annual</b> <b>breakdown</b> (8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 -year-olds). An intra-oral examination was conducted to assess dental caries in permanent dentition. Caries diagnosis was based on the WHO recommendation. The prevalence and intensity of caries, as well as the Significant Caries Index (SiC) were calculated based on the obtained data. Results. The prevalence of caries in the permanent dentition of the examined population was 58 %. It was the highest (70 %) in children aged 10. The mean DMFT for children 8 years of age was 0. 9, and increased to 2. 4 in 12 -yearolds. In all age groups, DMFT mainly consisted of untreated caries. Also the SiC index increased with children’s age (from 2. 42 in 8 -year-olds to 5. 56 in 12 -year-olds). Conclusions. The results of the study revealed high SiC values, which indicates the necessity of introducing intensive preventive programs for schoolchildren, especially for the one third with the highest DMFT values, to increase the possibility of achieving the WHO oral health goal for the year 2015 in children aged 12.

40|$|An early {{detection}} of caries allows for introduction of minimally invasive treatment and has additional significance in preventing serious caries sequelae such as pulp or periapical inflammation, and even loss of teeth. Screening of oral health should form a part of routine medical care in children. Aim of the study. To evaluate the state of dentition and treatment needs in 3 to 7 year-old children. Materials and methods. The study covered 731 children (388 girls and 34 3 boys) living in Lodz, who were subdivided into 5 age groups, with <b>annual</b> <b>breakdown</b> of age: 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 -year-old children. An intra-oral examination was conducted to asses dental caries in deciduous and permanent dentition. Caries diagnosis {{was based on the}} WHO recommendation. Caries prevalence, intensity and treatment index were calculated {{on the basis of the}} obtained data. Results. The prevalence of caries in the examined population was 72. 2 %. It was the lowest in 3 -year-old children (43. 6 %) and the highest (85 %) in those aged 7. Caries intensity in deciduous teeth (dmft) for children aged 3 was 1. 53 and it increased up to 4. 07 in 7 year olds. The average dmft in 3 - 7 years old was composed mainly of untreated caries, and the treatment index in the examined group was low (0. 32). Mean score of the DMFT was 0. 07 in 5 -year- olds, and increased with age, up to 0. 73 in children aged 7. The average treatment index for permanent dentition in this age range was 0. 22. Conclusions. The low values of treatment index and the findings that the average dmft in 3 - 7 year-old children and DMFT in 5 - 7 - year-olds were mainly determined by the presence of untreated caries, indicate that dental care for this group is not well provided. It is necessary to introduce health education programs that promote proper health behaviours and increase parental awareness of the need for deciduous teeth treatment, and for regular assessment of the status of newly erupted permanent teeth.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is introduced {{to study the}} accelerating impact of HIV infection on the incidence rates of tuberculosis (TB) disease. A sexually active population (15 — 49 years) is followed cross-sectionally {{over a period of}} time. Beginning with the year in which HIV infection was probably first present in the population, the model calculates the growing yearly incidence rates of new TB disease in HIV-positive and in HIV-negative individuals. Model equations, derived by an actuarial method, are developed recursively. Input information required for the calculations includes the age distribution of the study population, pre-HIV annual TB infection rates, annual HIV infection and mortality rates, and estimates of <b>annual</b> TB disease <b>breakdown</b> rates in the absence and in the presence of HIV infection. With correct input data, the model provides a useful blueprint for health agencies in designing effective programmes for curbing the future course of these dual epidemics in the population...|$|R
40|$|Abundant {{emergent}} plant litter {{produced in}} the interior of dense emergent stands in wetlands may influence abiotic conditions and biota but litter accumulation and its effects are seldom studied. This dissertation investigated the direct and indirect influences of litter on the structure and distribution of invertebrate communities and examined the processes controlling litter accumulation through modeling. Within emergent cattail stands, the impact of litter on the invertebrate community was studied through transect studies and an interior litter manipulation study. Anoxia was present at high litter treatments, while moderate and low litter treatments showed prolonged hypoxia. Lemnid densities were much lower in the high litter treatment. Quantitative invertebrate samples at lower litter conditions in the interior were dominated by hypoxic-tolerant nektonic species. Activity traps showed the emergent interior experienced increased Hyalella azteca (Saussure) (Amphipoda) abundance with more individuals inhabiting the top portion of the water column. Vertical compression increased with increasing litter. Invertebrate abundance decreased and the invertebrate community was dominated by semi-aquatic species and very hypoxic-tolerant taxa under high litter conditions in the interior. Litter accumulation within emergent macrophyte marshes may significantly influence abiotic conditions and biota but the process of litter accumulation is rarely considered in emergent macrophyte studies. The process of litter accumulation includes a species 2 ̆ 7 spatial extent, its annual production, and its <b>breakdown</b> rate. <b>Annual</b> production and <b>breakdown</b> rate can be combined for emergent species to estimate accumulated litter using litter breakdown rates from litter bag studies or a mass balance approach. Litter bag breakdown rates consistently overestimated litter accumulation for Phragmites, Typha, and Scolochloa. Mass balance derived rates for Phragmites and Typha tracked observed values and the breakdown rates but the mass balance approach was not suitable for Scolochloa which breaks down quickly. Litter bag studies may not be suitable to predict litter accumulation while the mass balance approach can provide more reliable estimates of litter accumulation for emergent species with recalcitrant litter. The mass balance breakdown rates were then combined with a spatial distribution model that included both dominant and subdominant species and a production model. Subdominants were included to better predict emergent distributions and expansion in mixed stands following a drawdown. The combined models were used to predict Typha litter accumulation as Typha stands developed after a drawdown. In areas where Typha was classified as subdominant {{at the start of the}} model, Typha often became dominant as less flood-tolerant dominant emergent species died out. Predicted Typha and Scolochloa distributions had greater spatial extents than observed distributions prior to the drawdown. Phragmites distributions, however, were underestimated by the model and neither the observed nor the predicted distributions reached pre-drawdown coverage. Predicted Typha litter accumulation reached pre-disturbance levels 5 - 6 years after the drawdown. Litter mass increased quickly in areas of Typha expansion with moderate increases in areas of the wetland where stands were 3 ̆e 2 years old. According to the model, litter also persisted for several years in areas where Typha was extirpated. The plant distribution model illustrates the importance of including subdominants and understanding persistence when studying emergent expansion. The implications of Typha litter accumulation, its interaction with water levels, and its potential effects on wetlands are also discussed...|$|R
