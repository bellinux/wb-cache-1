2500|$|In 1887, Weinhold {{modified}} the Leyser machine {{with a system}} of vertical metal bar inductors with wooden cylinders close to the disk for avoiding polarity reversals. M. L. Lebiez described the Lebiez machine, that was essentially a simplified Voss machine (L'Électricien, April 1895, pp.225–227). In 1893, Bonetti patented a machine with {{the structure of the}} Wimshurst machine, but without metal sectors in the disks., à l'extérieur." [...] ( [...] … Wimshurst's machine could, in effect, be constructed with plain glass plates and with combs in place of brushes at the ends of the diametrical conductors. [...] The initial charging could be done with the aid of an external source placed, for example, opposite and outside of [...] A1 [...]) [...] Pellissier then states that [...] "the role of the metallic sectors of the Wimshurst machine seems to be primarily, in effect, to facilitate its <b>automatic</b> <b>starting</b> and to reduce the influence of atmospheric humidity." [...] This machine is significantly more powerful than the sectored version, but it must usually be started with an externally applied charge.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to different model names and marketing concept, the Mexican versions also adapted AMC I6 engines to local conditions. They also came with more upscale interiors compared their counterpart models {{sold in the}} United States and Canada. The standard engine was the [...] I6 with two-barrel carburetor from 1967 through 1969, even though the Rambler Classic SST {{had the option of}} VAM's own [...] I6 early in 1969, which became standard equipment several months late in the year. Since 1970, both versions were equipped with VAM's [...] I6 with two-barrel Carter carburetor, 9.5:1 compression ratio and 266 camshaft from the factory. The cars were restricted to a three-speed manual transmission in 1967 and 1968, but were available with an optional column mounted three-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>starting</b> in 1969, making the Rambler Classic the second regular production VAM to offer an automatic transmission after the Javelin the year before. Rear gear ratios included a 3.73:1 for 1967 and a 3.54:1 {{for the remainder of the}} run. External cosmetic changes over the years in VAM Rambler Classics were mostly the same as in the U.S. and Canadian market Rebels.|$|E

Units larger than about 1 kW rating often have a battery and electric starter motor; very large units may start with compressed air either to an air driven starter motor or introduced directly to the engine cylinders to initiate engine rotation. Standby power generating units often include an <b>automatic</b> <b>starting</b> system and a transfer switch to disconnect the load from the utility power source {{when there is a}} power failure and connect it to the generator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For vessels with dynamic {{positioning}} system, diesel-electric propulsion is often used. At all time the vessel {{should be able}} to withstand any single point failure without loss of position. This paper studies the use of simulation of worst-case failure to decide which configurations of the power plant are sufficient for the current operation. The loss of position due to reduced power to the thrusters is simulated and compared with the safety requirements. This method gives both a practical approach to implement the safety requirement and information which {{can be used as a}} decision support system or for <b>automatic</b> <b>start</b> and stop of generator sets. The operational cost is also optimized by using the results from the simulations. 1...|$|R
