The authors reviewed the abuse reports {{submitted by the}} staff of The Children’s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, to determine the incidence and types of injuries inflicted to children’s hands. The authors did not study hand injuries in children who were not reported as physically abused. The authors examined two time periods to ascertain changes in injury severity. Of the 631 abuse reports submitted from 1980 to 1982, there were 52 injuries (8. 2 %) involving the hands. From July 1987 to July 1988 there were 42 hand injuries (13. 4 %) among 313 reports. In the 94 total cases, 19 (2 %) children sustained injury to the hand only, including eight with burns, two with bruises, two with human bites, two with erythema, two with fractures, and one with a laceration. Children with burns to the hand alone were significantly younger than those {{with other types of}} injuries. Of the 94 children with hand and other injuries, 18 (20 %) required hospital <b>admission.</b> <b>Of</b> the 19 with injuries to the hand only, five required hospital <b>admission.</b> A <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> instruments were used to injure these children.

[Purpose] The {{extent of}} {{functional}} independence ultimately achieved {{by an individual}} patient will be influenced by a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> medical and non-medical factors. [Subjects and Methods] this study included 419 patients with spinal cord lesions treated in the Clinic for Rehabilitation “Dr M. Zotovic”, Belgrade, Serbia, from January 2000 to December 2009. The patients were divided in two groups according to achievement of increase in Func-tional Independence Measure (FIM) score of more than 13 at discharge compared to <b>admission.</b> A <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> clinical variables were followed in both groups. [Results] one hundred twenty-one patients (28. 9 %) showed improvements in FIM score of ≤ 13, while 298 (71. 1 %) patients showed an increases in FIM score of> 13 at discharge compared to admission. Better functional recovery was observed in patients with non-traumatic spinal cord lesions, lower neurological levels of the lesion (OR = 6. 07), and in patients treated surgically, but {{the level of the}} spinal cord lesion was the most influential factor affecting outcome. [Conclusion] the patients with spinal cord lesions should not only be grouped by traumatic and non-traumatic lesions only, but also sub-categorized, according to the etiology, level of injury and treatment method...|$|R
