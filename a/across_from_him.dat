25|$|Standing {{in a large}} atrium, Roberts {{first opened}} fire at the mall's food court that was <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> at his left. The first to be shot was 54-year-old shopper Cindy Ann Yuille, a hospice nurse {{and mother of two}} who was shot in the back; she died despite efforts of {{bystanders}} to treat her wound. 15-year-old Kristina Shevchenko, who was walking through the mall with her friend to reach the Town Center MAX station, was the second person to be shot; she received a bullet to the chest, but she survived and made it out of the mall, where she was treated for her gunshot wound. The final victim was 46-year-old father of two and youth sports coach Steven Forsyth, who was sitting by a rented kiosk and talking with his father on his cell phone when he {{was shot in the head}} and killed.|$|E
60|$|As {{the moon}} crossed {{the opening of}} the shaft its light flooded the whole interior, and then Tarzan saw {{directly}} <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> another opening in the opposite wall. He wondered if this might not be the mouth of a passage leading to possible escape. It would be worth investigating, at least, and this he determined to do.|$|E
60|$|The Pole gulped down a hasty meal, {{talking as}} he ate. Cole sat silently <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> not eating or speaking. His old {{clothing}} {{had been taken}} away and new clothing given him. He was shaved and rubbed down. His sores and cuts were healed, his body and hair washed. He looked much healthier and younger, now. But he was still stooped and tired, his blue eyes worn and faded. He listened to Sherikov's account {{of the world of}} 2136 AD without comment.|$|E
60|$|Istra {{was always}} <b>across</b> the room <b>from</b> <b>him</b> somehow. He found himself glad. It made their parting definite.|$|R

60|$|Because Reddy Fox is {{the largest}} {{he was given the}} place of honor {{at the head of the}} table under the Lone Pine. On his right sat Little Joe Otter and on his left Jerry Muskrat. Shadow the Weasel was next to Little Joe Otter, while right <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> was Jimmy Skunk. Peter Rabbit was next, sitting {{opposite}} his cousin, Jumper the Hare. At the extreme end, facing Reddy Fox, sat Billy Mink, with the plump duck right under his sharp little nose.|$|E
6000|$|The companions for {{a little}} seemed to stand {{together}} in this element; after which the elder turned once more away and appeared to continue to walk in it. [...] "Poor Nanda!" [...] then, in a far-off sigh, came <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> to Mitchy. Mitchy on this turned vaguely round to the fire, into which he remained gazing till he heard again Mr. Longdon's voice. [...] "I knew it of course after all. It was what I came up to town for. That night, before you went abroad, at Mrs. Grendon's--" ...|$|E
60|$|The warning did {{not seem}} {{justified}} {{in view of the}} attractive table--candles, cut glass, a mound of flowers on a beveled mirror, silvery linen, and grape-fruit with champagne. Carl was at one side of Aunt Emma, but she seemed more interested in Mr. Winslow, {{at the end of the}} table; and on his other side Carl had a safe companion in Olive Dunleavy. <b>Across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> were Florence Crewden, Phil, and Ruth--Ruth shimmering in a gown of yellow satin, which broke the curves of her fine, flushed shoulders only by a narrow band.|$|E
5000|$|Joey Lauren Adams as Grace - Johns friend, {{who lives}} <b>across</b> the hall <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> She is {{slightly}} nerdy, but is cheery and supportive of Johns acting career.|$|R

60|$|<b>Across</b> {{the room}} <b>from</b> <b>him</b> Tarzan saw Olga seated before a little desk on which stood her telephone. She was tapping impatiently upon the {{polished}} {{surface of the}} desk. She had not heard him enter.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{his home}} coming {{proved to be}} a happier event than he had ever dared to hope for. Lucy was quiet and ate but little. At times Pan caught her {{stealing}} a glimpse at him, and each time she blushed. She could not meet his eyes again. Alice too stole shy glances at him, wondering, loving. Bobby was hungry, but he did not forget that Pan sat <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> Mrs. Smith watched Pan with an expression that would have pained him had he allowed remorse to come back then. And his father was funny. He tried to be natural, to meet Pan on a plane of the old western insouciance, but it was impossible. No doubt such happiness had not reigned in that household for years.|$|E
60|$|The black {{shook his}} head. There was no canoe and the {{crocodiles}} made it equivalent to suicide {{to enter the}} water {{in an attempt to}} swim across. Just then the fellow chanced to glance downward. Beneath him, wedged among the branches of a tree, lay the canoe in which Meriem had escaped. The Negro grasped Baynes' arm and pointed toward his find. The Hon. Morison could scarce repress a shout of exultation. Quickly the two slid down the drooping branches into the boat. The black seized the paddle and Baynes shoved them out from beneath the tree. A second later the canoe shot out upon the bosom of the river and headed toward the opposite shore and the camp of the Swede. Baynes squatted in the bow, straining his eyes after the men pulling the other canoes upon the bank <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> He saw Malbihn step from the bow of the foremost of the little craft. He saw him turn and glance back across the river. He could see his start of surprise as his eyes fell upon the pursuing canoe, and called the attention of his followers to it.|$|E
6000|$|All {{of which}} {{foregoing}} makes, I grant, a long parenthesis in my {{recovery of the}} more immediate Cambridge impressions. I have left them awaiting me, yet I am happy to say not sensibly the worse for it, in their cluster roundabout Miss Upham and her board of beneficiary images; which latter start up afresh and with the softest submission to any convenient neglect--that ineffably touching and confessed dependence of such apparitions on one's [...] "pleasure," [...] save the mark! for the flicker of restorative light. The image most vividly restored is doubtless that of Professor F. J. Child, head of the [...] "English Department" [...] at Harvard and master of that great modern science of folk-lore to his accomplishment in which his vast and slowly-published collection of the Ballad literature of our language is a recognised monument; delightful man, rounded character, passionate patriot, admirable talker, above all thorough humanist and humorist. He was the genial autocrat of that breakfast-table not only, but of our symposia otherwise timed, and as he comes back to me with the fresh and quite circular countenance of the time before the personal cares and complications of life had gravely thickened for him, his aspect all finely circular, with its close rings of the fairest hair, its golden rims of the largest glasses, its finished rotundity of figure and attitude, I see that there was the American spirit--since I was [...] "after" [...] it--of a quality deeply inbred, beautifully adjusted to all extensions of knowledge and taste and, as seemed to me, quite sublimely quickened by everything {{that was at the}} time so tremendously in question. That vision of him was never afterwards to yield to other lights--though these, even had occasion for them been more frequent with me, couldn't much have interfered with it; so that what I still most retain of him is the very flush and mobility, the living expansion and contraction, the bright comedy and almost lunar eclipse, of his cherubic face according as things appeared to be going for the country. I was always just <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> as my brother, beside whom I took my place, had been, and I remember well how vivid a clock-face it became to me; I found still, as in my younger time, matter enough everywhere for gaping, but greatest of all, I think, while that tense season lasted, was my wonder for the signs and portents, the quips and cranks, the wreathèd smiles, or otherwise the candid obscurations, of our prime talker's presented visage. I set, as it were, the small tick of my own poor watch by it--which private register would thump or intermit in agreement with these indications. I recover it that, thanks to the perpetual play of his sympathy and irony, confidence and scorn, as well as to that of my own less certainly directed sensibility, he struck me on the bad days, which were then so many, as fairly august, cherubism and all, for sincerity of association with every light and shade, every ebb and flow, of our Cause. Where he most shone out, indeed, so that depression then wasn't a gloom in him but a darting flame, was in the icy air of the attitude of the nations to us, that of the couple, the most potent, across the sea, with which we were especially concerned and which, as during the whole earlier half of the War and still longer it more and more defined itself, drew from him at once all the drolleries and all the asperities of his sarcasm. Nothing more particularly touched me in him, I make out--for it lingers in a light of its own--than the fashion after which he struck me as a fond grave guardian, not so much of the memory and the ashes yet awhile, as of the promise, in all its flower, of the sacrificial young men whom the University connection had passed through his hands and whom he looked out for with a tenderness of interest, a nursing pride, that was as contagious as I could possibly have wished it. I didn't myself know the young men, save three or four, and could only, at our distance, hold my tongue and do them homage; never afterwards (as I even then foreknew would be the case) missing, when I could help it, or failing to pick up, a single brush, a scattered leaf, of their growing or their riper legend. Certain of them whom I had neither seen nor, as they fell in battle, was destined ever to see, have lived for me since just as communicated images, figures created by his tone about them--which, I admit, mightn't or needn't have mattered to me for all the years, yet which couldn't help so doing from the moment the right touch had handed them over to my restless claim.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes! Do!" [...] he begged, and she {{sat down}} <b>across</b> the table <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "I'm ashamed to make this trouble for you," [...] he added. [...] "I didn't know it was so late." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He didn't offer to," [...] Whitwell explained. [...] "I got {{it out of}} him {{in spite}} of him, I guess." [...] He had sat down with his hat on, as his {{absent-minded}} habit was, and he now braced his knees {{against the edge of}} the table. Cynthia sat <b>across</b> it <b>from</b> <b>him</b> with her head drooped over it, drawing vague figures on the board with her finger. [...] "What are you goin' to do?" ...|$|R

5000|$|In August 2012, Parry accused Governor Mark Dayton of popping pills at meetings, saying [...] "When you sit <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> and {{you watch}} him pop 15 to 16 pills when you're having a meeting, it's scary." [...] The claim was refuted by Dayton and Republican legislators.|$|E

60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later, with the three money-sharks still at the mast- heads, Charles Stough Greenleaf was seated in the cabin and sipping a highball, and Dag Daughtry was {{standing}} <b>across</b> the table <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> drinking directly <b>from</b> a quart bottle of beer.|$|R
50|$|Brian Aubert met Nikki Monninger in 1994 on {{a flight}} from Los Angeles to London. Both of them were headed to Cambridge for a school {{exchange}} program.

50|$|Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, for example, makes {{frequent}} use of eyeline matches. The main character, played by James Stewart, is confined to his apartment and often looks out its rear window at events in the buildings <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> Hitchcock frequently cuts from Stewart looking off-screen to various people and events that {{are assumed to be}} the focus of his gaze.|$|E

50|$|His wife's family, the Peglers, came to Canada {{separately}} from Meredith and farmed <b>across</b> the river <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in Westminster Township, Ontario. On December 1, 1835, {{one year after}} what is generally supposed to be his arrival in Canada, John Meredith married Sarah Pegler (1819-1900), {{a few months after}} she had turned sixteen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, really," [...] he answered, {{glancing at}} {{her where she}} sat erect <b>across</b> the table <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> with {{her hand on the}} lid of the coffee-pot, and her eyes downcast; it was the face of silent {{determination}} not to be put off, which he knew. [...] "I don't suppose you care, mother," [...] he added pleasantly.|$|R
5000|$|When he {{returned}} to the horseshoe-shaped bar, the man <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> smiled broadly. He was a kid really, not more than eighteen or nineteen, and his skin was the same shade as the dark ale he was drinking. His hair was the startling part - soft brown ringlets that glinted with gold under the light, floating above his mischievous eyes like ... well, like the froth on his ale.|$|E
50|$|A gask or a ball usually {{starts with}} a sittning and then {{continues}} on with a party after the sittning is over. Usually there is dancing, either to live music or a DJ, and a pub. Formal etiquette suggests that a gentleman at a ball with a sittning should dance the two first dances with his table partner (the lady on the right), the following two dances with the lady who was on his left, and finally two dances with the lady sitting <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{song was}} {{promoted}} with a music video directed by Phil Joanou. The video {{takes place in}} a restaurant. The screen is split horizontally, showing Bono in the top half and the person sitting <b>across</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in the bottom half. The lighting brightly lights up each person's face (in contrast to the dim backgrounds). As Bono sings the song, numerous different people sit down at his table, talk for a while, and leave (including the three other members of the band at one point).|$|E
2500|$|Williams won an {{architectural}} competition at age 25, {{and three years}} later opened his own office. Known as an outstanding draftsman, he perfected the skill of rendering drawings [...] "upside down." [...] This skill was developed so that his white clients (who might have been uncomfortable sitting next to a black architect) could see the drawings rendered right side up <b>across</b> the table <b>from</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|As Gideon is {{traveling}} {{back to the}} states, he does not notice that Astoroth {{is also on the}} plane <b>across</b> the aisle <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> watching him.

6000|$|About {{ten o'clock}} the next morning, as Hypatia, worn out with sleepless sorrow, {{was trying to}} arrange her {{thoughts}} for the farewell lecture, her favourite maid announced that a messenger from Synesius waited below.
