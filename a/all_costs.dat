5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. The few remaining Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica with its artillery support, and it remained in the town during the night. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at <b>all</b> <b>costs,</b> Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can {{become the focus of}} public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at <b>all</b> <b>costs,</b> even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the changes}} to the design and its growing costs, {{construction}} of three DDLs {{was approved by the}} Liberal Party McMahon Government in August 1972. At this time, the total project cost was estimated at A$355 million; this figure included <b>all</b> <b>costs</b> associated with building three ships and operating them for ten years. The ships themselves were expected to cost approximately $210 million. All three ships were to be built at Williamstown Dockyard, with construction of the first ship beginning in 1975, followed by the other ships at two-yearly intervals. The initial DDL was to be commissioned in 1980, and the third in 1984. Further DDLs may also have been ordered over time to replace the Navy's destroyers as they reached the end of their service lives.|$|E

The pincharratas won their first title in 1968 by defeating Palmeiras. They successfully defended the title in 1969 and 1970 against Nacional and Peñarol, respectively. Although Peñarol was the first club to win three titles, Estudiantes were the first to win three consecutive titles.|$|E
5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, {{and from a}} Swedish point of view it was {{essential}} to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide {{to intervene in the}} conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to defend it at <b>all</b> <b>costs.</b> Should he fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E

5|$|Louisy {{had become}} Prime Minister {{thanks to a}} secret {{agreement}} with Odlum that he would resign, allowing Odlum to take over, within 6 months. When the time came Louisy refused, backed by the Americans, who wanted to keep Odlum out of office at <b>all</b> <b>costs.</b> This saw Odlum turn against his own government and even vote against the budget. A second proposal that Louisy resign was rejected on 30 December 1980, with the power struggle continuing despite his agreement to hand over some of his portfolios. The dispute continued into 1981, with Odlum attracting controversy by announcing on 3 March {{that he had not}} ignored the possibility of his grouping within the Labour Party splitting and joining the United Workers Party.|$|E

5|$|The IOC also {{required}} that the long-track speed skating be done indoors. Hamar was awarded the venue, Vikingskipet, after Hamar Municipality guaranteed to cover <b>all</b> <b>costs</b> exceeding NOK200 million. This provided sufficient leverage for Hamar to host additional events. LOOC approved the construction of Vikingskipet in on 15 December 1989 {{and at the same}} time supported proposals to renovate Storhamar Ishall to host Olympic ice hockey matches. A second, temporary training rink was also planned built in Hamar. In addition, the Hamar venue would be used for short track speed skating, while figure skating would be run in Lillehammer. In March, the plans were changed, so Hamar would receive an all-new ice rink in addition to a renovation of Storhamar Ishall.|$|E
5|$|The Mingshi – the {{official}} {{history of the}} Ming dynasty compiled by the Qing dynasty in 1739 – states that the Ming established itinerant commanderies overseeing Tibetan administration while also renewing titles of ex-Yuan dynasty officials from Tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of Tibetan Buddhist sects. However, Turrell V. Wylie states that censorship in the Mingshi in favor of bolstering the Ming emperor's prestige and reputation at <b>all</b> <b>costs</b> obfuscates the nuanced history of Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming era.|$|E
5|$|The {{field at}} Waterloo was 5.5km wide, with two {{parallel}} ridges running west to east, creating a shallow valley 1.4km across. On the allied right lay the chateau of Hougoumont, {{a collection of}} walled farm buildings lying closer to the French line than the Allies' line. Recognising its defensive importance, Wellington ordered Hanoverian and Nassau troops to occupy the farm. In allied hands, it would provide cover for flanking fire against any French assault of the main allied line; in French hands, it would provide a bastion from which they could launch attacks. Since it defended the Nivelles road {{as well as the}} Allies' right flank, Wellington ordered that it was to be held at <b>all</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
