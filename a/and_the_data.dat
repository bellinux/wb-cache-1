5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, German {{experiments}} with gold at a current of only 10µA demonstrated a relative uncertainty of 1.5%.

5|$|She {{enrolled}} at Cornell University, {{and earned a}} master's degree in 1951. During her graduate studies, she studied the motions of 109 galaxies and made {{one of the first}} observations of deviations from Hubble flow (how the galaxies move apart from one another). She worked with astronomer Martha Carpenter on galactic dynamics, and studied under Philip Morrison, Hans Bethe, and Richard Feynman. Though the conclusion she came to - that there was an orbital motion of galaxies around a particular pole - was disproven, the idea that galaxies were moving held true and sparked further research. Her research also provided early evidence of the supergalactic plane. This information <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> she discovered was immensely controversial, and after fighting to be allowed to present her work at the American Astronomical Society despite being pregnant, she was summarily rejected and the paper forgotten.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
