5|$|After the Restoration in 1660, {{there was}} a fashion for grand private houses in designs {{influenced}} by the Palladian style and associated with the architects Sir William Bruce (1630–1710) and James Smith (c. 1645–1731). After the Act of Union in 1707, the threat of Jacobite Rebellions led to the building of military defences such as Fort George near Inverness. Scotland produced {{some of the most}} significant <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century, including Colen Campbell, James Gibbs and William Adam, who all had a major influence on Georgian architecture across Britain. The influence of Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{takes place}} {{approximately}} 100,000 {{years before the}} present day in the Halo universe, {{telling the story of}} the Forerunners before their disappearance. It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas and Morning Riser, and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The Forerunners are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; they can build artificial planets and control stars. Forerunners are divided into classes by occupation, they are (in order of rank): Builders, the <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts in medicine and biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an entire planet. Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E

5|$|Milner and British {{official}} Lionel George Curtis {{were the}} <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Round Table movement, {{a network of}} organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self-governing colonies. To this end, Curtis founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God, began advocating {{for the creation of}} an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of the Christian God to elicit their support. The Commonwealth of Nations was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner and Curtis.|$|E
5|$|Not only is {{the park}} historic, {{but so is the}} mostly {{residential}} surrounding neighborhood. Many architectural works line the streets facing the park, designed by some of the most famous <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century, including Henry Hobson Richardson. At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston-based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{produced}} {{some of the}} most significant <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early eighteenth century, including Colen Campbell (1676–1729), James Gibbs (1682–1754) and William Adam (1689–1748), all of whom were influenced by Classical architecture. Campbell was influenced by the Palladian style and has been credited with founding Georgian architecture. Architectural historian Howard Colvin has speculated that he was associated with James Smith and may even have been his pupil. He spent most of his career in Italy and England and developed a rivalry with fellow Scot James Gibbs, who trained in Rome and also practised mainly in England. Campbell's architectural style incorporated Palladian elements, as well as forms from the Italian Baroque and Inigo Jones, but was most strongly influenced by Sir Christopher Wren's interpretation of the Baroque. William Adam, the foremost Scottish architect of his time, designed and built numerous country houses and public buildings. Among his best known works are Hopetoun House near Edinburgh, and Duff House in Banff. His individual, exuberant, style was built on the Palladian style, but with Baroque motifs inspired by the work of John Vanbrugh and Continental architecture. After his death, his sons Robert and John took on the family business and became the leading British <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second half of the century.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{plans for the}} station called for a clean utilitarian structure typical of metro stations of that period. Due {{to the efforts of}} the city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov, the design was scrapped in favor of one that resembles an ancient Kievan Rus' temple by Borys Zhezherin, Vadym Zhezherin, and Zharikov himself. Such a design was a particularly risky feat, since Ukraine {{was a part of the}} secular Soviet Union at the time of the station's construction. Vadym Zhezherin and Mykola Zharikov, among the other artists and <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, were bestowed the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture for their work in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The two {{principal}} drafters and <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covenant of the League of Nations were Lord Robert Cecil (a British diplomat), and Jan Smuts (a South African statesman). Smuts' proposals included {{the creation of}} a Council of the great powers as permanent members and a non-permanent selection of the minor states. He also proposed {{the creation of a}} Mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side, and proposed annual Council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.|$|E

5|$|The £3million {{refurbishment}} by Fry, {{the most}} extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels, complete refurbishment of the bars {{and the creation of}} The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of The Garrick's Head pub, and redecoration of the auditorium. Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new fire alarm systems, air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.|$|E
5|$|Antoni Gaudí {{started his}} {{professional}} career while still at university. To {{pay for his}} studies, {{he worked as a}} draughtsman for some of the most outstanding Barcelona <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, such as Joan Martorell, Josep Fontserè, Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, Leandre Serrallach and Emili Sala Cortés. Gaudí had a long-standing relationship with Josep Fontserè, since his family was also from Riudoms and they had known each other for some time. Despite not having an architecture degree, Fontserè received the commission from the city council for the Parc de la Ciutadella development, carried out between 1873 and 1882. For this project, Gaudí {{was in charge of the}} design of the Park's entrance gate, the bandstand's balustrade and the water project for the monumental fountain, where he designed an artificial cave that showed his liking for nature and the organic touch he would give his architecture.|$|E
5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{churches have}} existed in Greater Manchester since the Anglo-Saxon era, but no {{significant}} Saxon features remain in its listed churches, {{and the only}} Norman material {{is to be found}} in StLeonard, Middleton. The churches in this list fall into two main groups: those originating mainly from the medieval period, which are in Gothic style, and churches built during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly in Gothic Revival style, with only a few churches created between these periods. Gothic churches originating from the medieval era include Manchester Cathedral, StMary, Radcliffe, and StWerburgh Old Church, Warburton. Churches from the 19thcentury include some of the finest works of the leading <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period: George Gilbert Scott (StMark, Worsley), Alfred Waterhouse (StElisabeth, Reddish), George Frederick Bodley (StAugustine, Pendlebury), and Charles Barry (All Saints, Whitefield). Built between these periods was the Neoclassical church of StAnn, Manchester. All the above examples are Anglican churches. There are two Roman Catholic churches in the list: Joseph A.Hansom's Holy Name of Jesus, Manchester, and E.W.Pugin's All Saints, Urmston, and one church built for the Christian Scientists, the Edgar Wood Centre.|$|E
5|$|Most {{buildings}} in Bath {{are made from}} the local, golden-coloured Bath Stone, and many date from the 18th and 19th century. The dominant style of architecture in Central Bath is Georgian; this style evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular in the early 18th century. Many of the prominent <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day were employed {{in the development of}} the city. The original purpose of much of Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era before the advent of the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants. The masons Reeves of Bath were prominent in the city from the 1770s to 1860s.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} of these among the wealthy {{patrons of the}} day was the four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell. Campbell was both an {{architect}} and a publisher. The book was basically a book of design containing architectural prints of British buildings, which had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio; at first mainly those of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. These four books greatly contributed to Palladian architecture becoming established in 18th-century Britain. Their three authors became the most fashionable and sought after <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era. Due to his book Vitruvius Britannicus, Colen Campbell was chosen as the architect for banker Henry Hoare I's Stourhead house (illustration above), a masterpiece that became the inspiration for dozens of similar houses across England.|$|E
