5|$|Australian forces also {{defeated}} {{an attempt}} to capture the strategic Milne Bay area in August 1942. During the Battle of Milne Bay two brigades of Australian troops, designated Milne Force, supported by two RAAF fighter squadrons and US Army engineers defeated a smaller Japanese invasion force made up of Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces units. This was the first notable Japanese land defeat and raised Allied morale <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At {{cruising}} speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines. This was {{particularly important for}} navies which required a long range at cruising speeds—and hence for the US Navy, which was planning {{in the event of}} war to cruise <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> and engage the Japanese in the Philippines.|$|E
30|$|During 1965 to 1967, {{detailed}} stratified zooplankton samplings {{from the}} surface to the deep sea (maximum depth 2, 615  m) were made <b>across</b> <b>the</b> North <b>Pacific</b> (0 ° to 56 °N), and the collected calanoid copepods were identified to the species level. In this study, we analyzed the calanoid copepod community down to great depths <b>across</b> <b>the</b> entire North <b>Pacific.</b> Based on this analysis, we discuss what determines the structure of calanoid copepod communities <b>across</b> <b>the</b> North <b>Pacific.</b>|$|R

5|$|A deep low {{pressure}} system (with a pressure of 977mbar at its peak) moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Coast on October 15 and then crossed the Rockies {{during the following}} day and touched out some moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, major source for storm development and intensification. Not part of the main outbreak, 3 tornadoes were reported, during the overnight hours of October 16 towards October 17, across Randall County, Texas south of Amarillo on October 16 with 1 of them confirmed as a high EF1. That tornado caused damage to trees, fences, power poles, steel pipes, trailers and barns.|$|E
5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, accompanied by three light cruisers and several colliers, sailed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean—in the process evading the various Allied naval forces sent to intercept them—before arriving off the southern coast of South America. On 1 November 1914, Scharnhorst {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron encountered and overpowered a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel. The stinging defeat prompted the British Admiralty to dispatch two battlecruisers to hunt down and destroy von Spee's flotilla, which they accomplished at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914.|$|E

5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> and were {{especially interested in}} securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, had accepted {{an invitation to a}} three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. The result was a treaty that created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Created {{following}} World War I, {{the corps}} was not activated for use {{until just before}} World War II almost 20 years later. The corps spent most of World War II in charge of defenses on the West Coast of the United States, before moving to Hawaii and Leyte to plan and organize operations for US forces advancing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific.</b> Following {{the end of the}} war, IX Corps participated in the occupation of mainland Japan.|$|E
5|$|Hasekura {{stayed for}} 5 months in Mexico {{on his way}} back to Japan. The San Juan Bautista was waiting in Acapulco since 1616, after a second trip <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> from Japan to Mexico. Captained by Yokozawa Shōgen, she was laden with fine pepper and lacquerware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. Following a request by the Spanish king, in order to avoid too much silver leaving to Japan, the Viceroy asked for the {{proceeds}} to be spent on Mexican goods, except for an amount of 12,000 pesos and 8,000 pesos in silver which Hasekura and Yokozawa could bring back with them respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Spedding {{was awarded}} a Guggenheim Fellowship, {{allowing}} him to study in Europe. To save money, Spedding and his wife travelled to Europe by heading westward <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific.</b> His intention was to study in Germany under James Franck and Francis Simon, but they fled Germany after Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} March 1933. Instead he went to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, where he was welcomed by Ralph H. Fowler. Spedding worked with John Lennard-Jones, and attended lectures given by Max Born. He paid a visit to Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, and gave a lecture in Leningrad.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Sverdrup became {{involved}} {{with the construction of}} a chain of airstrips <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean to enable heavy bombers to be delivered to the Philippines. He was re-commissioned in the US Army as a colonel in 1942 and became Chief of the Construction Section in General MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area. In 1942 he made three treks across the Owen Stanley Range in Papua and New Guinea on engineer reconnaissance missions into enemy-occupied territory, for which he was decorated with the Silver Star and the Distinguished Service Medal. In 1944 he became the theater's Chief Engineer.|$|E
5|$|Manila {{became famous}} during the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade, which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe, Africa and Hispanic America <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Islands to Southeast Asia (which was already an entrepôt for goods coming from India, Indonesia and China), and vice versa. Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru was {{exchanged}} for Chinese silk, Indian gems and the spices of Southeast Asia. Likewise, wines and olives grown in Europe and North Africa were shipped via Mexico to Manila.|$|E

5|$|Settled {{by people}} from Micronesia and Polynesia c 1000 BCE, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire {{in the late}} 19th century. After World WarI, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate {{administered}} by Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. During World WarII, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, who were bypassed by the Allied advance <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific.</b> After the war ended, the country entered into UN trusteeship. Nauru gained its independence in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the private}} sector, {{military}} weather forecasters present weather conditions to the war fighter community. Military weather forecasters provide pre-flight and in-flight weather briefs to pilots and provide real time resource protection services for military installations. Naval forecasters cover the waters and ship weather forecasts. The United States Navy provides a special service to both themselves {{and the rest of}} the federal government by issuing forecasts for tropical cyclones <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> and Indian Oceans through their Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish started trans-Pacific voyages between New Spain (Mexico {{and present}} U.S. California) and the Philippines in 1565. The famous Manila galleons carried silver from Mexican mines westward to the entrepôt of Manila in the Spanish {{possession}} of the Philippines. There, the silver was used to purchase spices and trade goods gathered from throughout Asia, including (until 1638) goods from Japan. The return route of the Manila galleons, first charted by the Spanish navigator Andrés de Urdaneta, took the ships northeast into the Kuroshio Current (also known as the Japan Current) {{off the coast of}} Japan, and then <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> to the west coast of Mexico, landing eventually in Acapulco.|$|E

40|$|The Chilean jack {{mackerel}} Trachurus murphyi, is a pelagic {{fish from the}} Carangidae family that is distributed in <b>the</b> South <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. Because this species constitutes an important economic resource <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Pacific</b> and plays an important ecological role in this ecosystem {{there is a growing}} interest in determining its population structure. In this study,we used molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellites) from Chilean {{jack mackerel}} samples to investigate its genetic population structure <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. <b>The</b> mitochondrial DNA did not detect a genetic structure in T. murphyi populations in <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean, but revealed very lowhaplotype diversity and a short genealogy history compared to other small-pelagic species. The same general pattern of a lack of genetic structure was found with microsatellite loci; however, a large genetic diversity was revealed with microsatellite markers. The present results did not support the existence of different stock units for T. murphyi <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Pacific</b> Ocean but a more holistic approach will be necessary to determine an adequate management strategy for this fishery...|$|R

5|$|The first {{scientist}} to extrapolate the current {{motions of the}} continents was Canadian geologist Paul F. Hoffman of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue to advance <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean, pivoting about Siberia until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, Amasia. Later, in the 1990s, Roy Livermore calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and Madagascar would move across the Indian Ocean to collide with Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} {{subsequently}} visited by many government and whaling ships sailing between New South Wales and Norfolk Island and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific,</b> including many from the American whaling fleet, so {{its reputation as}} a provisioning port preceded settlement, some ships leaving goats and pigs on the island as food for future visitors. Between July and October 1791 the Third Fleet ships arrived at Sydney and within days the deckwork was being reconstructed for a future in the lucrative whaling industry. Whale oil was to become Australia's most profitable export until the 1830s, {{and it was the}} whaling industry that shaped Lord Howe Island's early history.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Guillermo's track, {{the storm}} never {{threatened}} any major landmass, resulting in {{little impact on}} land. However, because of its extreme intensity, it produced large swells <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean, affecting areas from Hawaii to coastal Mexico. Along the American Pacific coast, three people drowned amid high waves, two in Baja California and one in California. At its peak, Guillermo was the second strongest known Pacific hurricane on record; however, it has since been surpassed by seven other storms, including Linda later that year. The effects of Guillermo were not deemed severe enough to justify retirement of its name.|$|E
5000|$|Heterospathe {{species are}} {{relatively}} widespread <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific's</b> western edges with several in New Guinea, the Philippines, the Solomon Islands, eastern Indonesia and Micronesia.
