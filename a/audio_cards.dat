500|$|The studio's basic {{equipment}} consisted of [...] "two analog 24-track machines, a Studer A80, and a Studer A80 shell {{that had been}} modified by a local electronics wizard, with its own <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> and transport controls". To record vocals a Neumann U47 tube microphone and a Decca compressor were used without equalization. All of Sos songs were made in a similar format. Gabriel would record a piano demo on a modified [...] "B machine" [...] and play this to the band. During rehearsals, the band would listen to the B machine through headphones and record their output onto the [...] "A machine"; parts of Gabriel's demo would also {{be transferred to the}} A machine at this stage. Subsequent takes of the song were then put onto the B machine in order for the band to hear what they had played with the demo, as well as the song's new and old takes.|$|E

40|$|Step-Motor {{is a kind}} of {{important}} drive element in automatic control of machines (NC machine tools etc.). Many researchers have pointed out that the <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> could be applied in many fields such as data acquisition, motor control etc. Its advantages: no driving program needed to write, good compatibility with operation system and no update problem of the driving program etc. The important characters of the <b>audio</b> <b>card,</b> continuity and synchronism, are important in data acquisition and also in the lead control of the step motor. The output of the DA <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> could be used to produce the lead control signal for the step motor. In this paper the CMI 8738 chip is used as an example to show the principle and the method to produce the impulse frequency, port circuit and correspondent programming. The experiment has proved that it could be used to lead control synchronously a six-channel step motor, the maximum impulse frequency of each channel could be reached to 24 kHz. At last the problem to use directly the usual <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> for lead control was discussed...|$|R

We recorded respiratory audio from 1630 subjects and 11 positions from each patient, totaling to 17, 930 audio clips, each 10 -s long.|$|R
50|$|The <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> was {{designed}} with standard CMOS logic ICs and used hardware {{to perform an}} audio data compression algorithm named ECAM, based on the critical bands masking principle, a property of the human ear. Today the same principle is used in all major lossy audio compression codecs. The <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> was plugged into an ISA slot of the PC and worked using direct memory access to the host memory. The driver and the client application were developed by Gustavo Pesci, while the hardware {{was designed}} by Ricardo Sidoti and Elio Demaria.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the Company {{introduced}} its first commercial product, The CAT, a peripheral device which provides audio capability for personal computers. In 1993 and 1994, the Company introduced additional products, including CATBoard, a full duplex <b>audio</b> <b>card,</b> an internal <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> that provides high level compression. Net sales {{of these products}} totaled approximately $0.3 million, $0.4 Million and $0.2 Million in 1993, 1994 and {{the first nine months}} of 1995, respectively, and the Company did not expect to recognize significant revenues from sales of these products in the future.|$|R

50|$|In {{the period}} from 1985 to 1995 when Amiga audio (which was {{standard}} in Amiga computers) was of greater quality than other standard home computers, PC compatible systems began to be equipped with 8-bit <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> inserted into 16 bit ISA bus slots. Soundtracker Module files were used on PC computers and were considered the only serious 8bit audio standard for creating music. The worldwide usage of these programs {{led to the creation}} of the so-called MOD-scene which was considered part of the demoscene. Eventually the PC world evolved to 16-bit <b>audio</b> <b>cards,</b> and Mod files were slowly abandoned. Various Amiga and PC games (such as Worms) supported Mod as their internal standard for generating music and audio effects.|$|E

50|$|Another unique {{feature of}} the TTM 57SL {{is that it can}} also be used as a {{standalone}} sound card, also known as an <b>audio</b> <b>card.</b> The TTM 57SL has a sound card integrated that can be used through the USB cable when not using Serato.|$|R
5000|$|Early PC {{games were}} {{distributed}} on floppy disks, {{and the small}} size of MIDI files made them a viable means of providing soundtracks. Games of the DOS and early Windows eras typically required compatibility with either Ad Lib or Sound Blaster <b>audio</b> <b>cards.</b> These cards used FM synthesis, which generates sound through modulation of sine waves. John Chowning, the technique's pioneer, theorized that the technology would be capable of accurate recreation of any sound if enough sine waves were used, but budget computer <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> performed FM synthesis with only two sine waves. Combined with the cards' 8-bit audio, this resulted in a sound described as [...] "artificial" [...] and [...] "primitive".|$|E
50|$|Nowadays with {{invention}} of the MP3 bit compression technology and standard <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> {{there are a lot}} of automation software providers at the market. Some systems includes Administration facilities for the traffic department, Disc Jockey schedule, Live Assist windows and even Artificial Intelligence automation control.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, the AICC {{produced}} a digital audio interoperability specification for DOS based platforms. This specification allowed multiple CBT vendors {{to use a}} single audio card. AICC audio drivers were produced for Elan, SoundBlaster(tm), WICAT, and other <b>audio</b> <b>cards.</b> A large number of older legacy CBT applications still use this specification today.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, THX {{was owned}} by sound card {{manufacturer}} Creative Technology Limited, which held a 60% share of the company. The company {{has had a long}} history with Creative, which was responsible for the creation of the first THX-certified <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> for computers, the Sound Blaster Audigy 2.|$|R
5000|$|Reasons {{for that}} might have been the lack of {{standardized}} and fully functional <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> standards by 1997 (AC'97 was not standardized yet, and most sound cards were partially functioning [...] "Soundblaster clones" [...] which lacked even full duplex capabilities) and the lack of CPU power on entry-level PC's.|$|R
25|$|DirectSound3D (DS3D) is an {{extension}} to DirectSound introduced with DirectX 3 in 1996 with the intention to standardize 3D audio in Windows.

50|$|Support for {{third-party}} <b>audio</b> <b>cards</b> was vendor-dependent, {{until the}} creation and adoption of AHI as a de facto standard. AHI offers improved functionality, such as seamless audio playback from a user-selected audio device, standardized functionality for audio recording and efficient software mixing routines for combining multiple sound channels, thus overcoming the four-channel hardware limit of the original Amiga chipset. AHI can be installed separately on AmigaOS v2.0 and later.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, Ensoniq was {{struggling}} financially. Their cards were very popular with PC OEMs, but their costs were too high and their musical instrument division was fading in revenue. Pressure from intense competition, especially with the dominant Creative Labs, was forcing <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> makers to try to keep their prices low.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983 Oscar Bonello a radio {{automation}} pioneer, and Engineering {{professor at}} the University of Buenos Aires and Fellow of the AES (USA) start researching about using the recently developed IBM PC computer. The problems that he faced were: 1) Create an <b>audio</b> PC <b>card</b> of good <b>audio</b> quality; 2) Create a bit compression algorithm; 3) Create the Automation software to be run from the PC. The <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> was designed with standard CMOS logic ICs and perform by hardware the ECAM bit compression algorithm {{based on the principle}} of Critical Bands Masking a property of the ear (see a brief History at MP3 [...] ). Today the same principle as the one used by Bonello is used in all the lossy audio bit compression systems, included MP3. The <b>audio</b> <b>card</b> was designed for the old ISA slots of the PC and works using direct access to PC memory. The driver for this software was developed by Gustavo Pesci, a young software engineer, formerly a pupil of Bonello at University. The card hardware was designed for Ricardo Sidoti and Elio Demaria, both brilliant electronic engineers.|$|R
