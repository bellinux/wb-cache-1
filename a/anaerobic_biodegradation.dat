25|$|Biodegradation {{can be seen}} in {{some studies}} that {{biodegradation}} accounts for the absence of creosote preservatives on the initial surface of the sediment. In a study from Pensacola, Florida, PAHs were not detected on the surface on the aquatic sediment, but the highest concentrations were detected at a depth of 8-13 centimeters. A form an <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of m-cresol was seen in a study using sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing enriched environments. The reduction of m-cresol in this study was seen in under 144 hours, while additional chemical intermediates were being formed. The chemical intermediates were formed in the presence of bicarbonate. The products included 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzoic acid and acetate compounds. Although the conditions were enriched with the reducing anaerobic compounds, sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria are commonly found in the environment. For further information, see sulfate-reducing bacteria. The type of anaerobic bacteria ultimately determines the reduction of the creosote preservative compounds, while each individual compound may only go through reduction under certain conditions. BTEX is a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, that was studied in the presence of four different anaerobic-enriched sediments. Though the compound, BTEX, is not found in creosote preservatives, the products of creosote preservatives' oxidation-reduction reactions include some of these compounds. For oxidation-reduction reactions, see the following section. In this study, it was seen that certain compounds such as benzene were only reduced under sulfate-enriched environments, while toluene was reduced under a variety of bacteria-enriched environments, not just sulfate. The biodegradation of a creosote preservative in an anaerobic enrichment depends not only on the type of bacteria enriching the environment, but also the compound that has been released from the preservative. In aerobic environments, preservative compounds are limited in the biodegradation process by the presence of free oxygen. In an aerobic environment, free oxygen comes from oxygen saturated sediments, sources of precipitation, and plume edges. The free oxygen allows for the compounds to be oxidized and decomposed into new intermediate compounds. Studies have shown that when BTEX and PAH compounds were placed in aerobic environments, the oxidation of the ring structures caused cleavage in the aromatic ring and allowed for other functional groups to attach. When an aromatic hydrocarbon was introduced to the molecular oxygen in experimental conditions, a dihydrodiol intermediate was formed, and then oxidation occurred transforming the aromatic into a catechol compound. Catechol allows for cleavage of the aromatic ring to occur, where functional groups can then add in an ortho- or meta- position.|$|E

We combined mathematical modeling with laboratory experimentation to investigate the effects of aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> chelate <b>biodegradation</b> on actinide [Np(IV/V), Pu(IV) ] speciation. Under aerobic conditions, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) biodegradation rates were strongly influenced by the actinide concentration. Actinide-chelate complexation reduced the relative abundance of available growth substrate in solution and actinide species present or released during chelate degradation were toxic to the organisms. Aerobic bio-utilization of the chelates as electron-donor substrates directly affected actinide speciation by releasing the radionuclides from complexed form into solution, where their fate was controlled by inorganic ligands in the system. Actinide speciation was also indirectly affected by pH changes caused by organic biodegradation. The two concurrent processes of organic biodegradation and actinide aqueous chemistry were accurately linked and described using CCBATCH, a computer model developed at Northwestern University to investigate the dynamics of coupled biological and chemical reactions in mixed waste subsurface environments.

40|$|Fuel oxygenates, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and {{tert-butyl alcohol}} (TBA), and {{chlorinated}} ethenes (TCE, cis-DCE and VC) are {{two groups of}} contaminants prevalent in groundwater systems. Fe(III) reducing conditions are dominant in many sedimentary environments. However, the effects of Fe(III) reduction on biotransformation of MTBE/TBA and chlorinated ethenes are not well understood. This research investigated the biodegradation of these contaminants and related microbial ecology under Fe(III) -reducing conditions in both sediment microcosms and enrichment cultures. The primary limitation to understanding <b>anaerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> {{is the lack of}} liquid cultures with consistent activity. This study enriched three distinct MTBE-degrading, anaerobic cultures from contaminated aquifer material, and they use anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonate, sulfate and fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16 S rRNA gene suggested novel microorganisms involved in <b>anaerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation.</b> These cultures are the first stable, sediment-free anaerobic MTBE-degrading cultures, which provide model systems for mechanistic studies of <b>anaerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation.</b> Substantial [U- 14 C]-TBA mineralization occurred under Fe(III) -reducing conditions. The TBA biodegradation activity was correlated with the abundance of one dominant clone, which is closely associated with organisms belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria. The results provide the original evidence of the stimulative effect of Fe(III) reduction on anaerobic TBA mineralization, and give initial insight to the organisms that may catalyze the anaerobic TBA mineralization reactions. The experimental study on the effects of Fe(III) reduction on reductive dechlorination demonstrated that Fe(III) reduction did not inhibit complete dechlorination, which is in contrast to the common opinion that TCE dechlorination will be inhibited wherever there is bioavailable Fe(III). Fe(III) speciation has an impact on daughter product distribution and dechlorination kinetics. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that Dehalococcoides and Geobacteraceae organisms were enriched concurrently in the dechlorinating Fe(III) -reducing sediments/cultures; Dehalococcoides abundance in the presence of Fe(III) was not significantly different from that in the cultures without Fe(III), meaning Fe(III) reducers would not outcompete and inhibit Dehalococcoides growth. Also, Fe(III) reduction may stimulate growth of G. lovleyi like organisms and contribute to TCE dechlorination to cis-DCE. Enrichment culture study demonstrated that Fe(III) reduction poised the hydrogen concentration at an appropriate steady-state that is within the ideal range for reductive dechlorination when acetate was amended as the sole electron donor. 10 X excessive electron donor addition did not facilitate chlorinated ethene dechlorination, but led to considerably high methane production and enrichment of methanogens. The results suggest that adding surplus electron donor will not only cause substrate wastage and unnecessary cost in bioremediation, but also have adverse effects such as enhanced methane release...|$|R

Under Fe(III) reducing conditions, ethylbenzene was the compound that degraded at the faster rate of 0. 19 µmol l– 1 d– 1.

The (14) C-MTBE radiorespirometry studies demonstrated widespread potential for aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> in the aquifer. However, delta(13) C compositions of MTBE in groundwater samples from the plume showed no significant (13) C enrichment that would indicate MTBE biodegradation at the field scale. Carbon isotope enrichment during MTBE biodegradation was assessed in the microcosms when dissolved O(2) was not limiting, compared with low in situ concentrations (2 mg/L) in the aquifer, {{and in the absence of}} O(2). The microcosm experiments showed ubiquitous potential for aerobic MTBE biodegradation in the aquifer within hundreds of days. Aerobic MTBE biodegradation in the microcosms produced an enrichment of 7 parts per thousand in the MTBE delta(13) C composition and an isotope enrichment factor (epsilon) of 1. 53 parts per thousand when dissolved O(2) was not limiting. However, for the low dissolved O(2) concentration of up to 2 mg/L that characterizes most of the MTBE plume fringe, aerobic MTBE biodegradation produced an enrichment of 0. 5 - 0. 7 parts per thousand, corresponding to an epsilon value of - 0. 22 parts per thousand to - 0. 24 parts per thousand. No <b>anaerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> occurred under these experimental conditions. These results suggest the existence of a complex MTBE-biodegrading community in the aquifer, which may consist of different aerobic species competing for MTBE and dissolved O(2). Under low O(2) conditions, the lower fractionating species have been shown to govern overall MTBE C-isotope fractionation during biodegradation, confirming the results of previous laboratory experiments mixing pure cultures. This implies that significant aerobic MTBE biodegradation could occur under the low dissolved O(2) concentration that typifies the reactive fringe zone of MTBE plumes, without producing detectable changes in the MTBE delta(13) C composition. This observed insensitivity of C isotope enrichment to MTBE biodegradation could lead to significant underestimation of aerobic MTBE biodegradation at field scale, with an unnecessarily pessimistic performance assessment for natural attenuation. Site-specific C isotope enrichment factors are, therefore, required to reliably quantify MTBE biodegradation, which may limit CSIA as a tool for the in situ assessment of MTBE biodegradation in groundwater using only C isotopes.

If moisture content is high enough, microbiological activity is enhanced, whereas if moisture content is too low, micro-organisms activity is inhibited. Therefore, managing waste moisture content in landfill cells is the key point of bioreactor landfill technology. Chenu et al.

This model is used to study leachate re-injection strategies. A bibliography review shows that many different strategies and processes have been used to re-inject leachate within landfill cells. For instance, re-injection devices could be vertical wells, horizontal wells or blankets (composed of horizontal wells connected to a porous blanket able to drain re-injected leachate in a horizontal plane).

Due to its toxicity and carcinogenicity, much recent attention has been focused on benzene biodegradation, especially in the absence of molecular oxygen. However, the mechanism by which <b>anaerobic</b> benzene <b>biodegradation</b> occurs is still unclear. This is because until the recent isolation of Dechloromonas strains JJ and RCB no organism that anaerobically degraded benzene was available with which to elucidate the pathway. Although many microorganisms use an initial fumarate addition reaction for hydrocarbon biodegradation, the large activation energy required argues against this mechanism for benzene. Other possible mechanisms include hydroxylation, carboxylation, biomethylation, or reduction of the benzene ring, but previous studies performed with undefined benzene-degrading cultures were unable to clearly distinguish which, if any, of these alternatives is used. Here we demonstrate that anaerobic nitrate-dependent benzene degradation by Dechloromonas strain RCB involves an initial hydroxylation, subsequent carboxylation, and loss of the hydroxyl group to form benzoate.

Biodegradation kinetics monitored by high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography showed that the acclimated consortium is {{able to carry out}} the biodegradation of 20, 50 and 100 mg L - 1 of Sumithion, respectively in 15, 25 and 45 days. The end products of sumithion biodegradation were gases. Such as CO 2, N 2, CH 4 and H 2 S. Isolation and partial characterization of a strain able to degrade Sumithion were realized. This strain named SY can be easily produced and used for the bioremediation of waters and soils contaminated by Sumithion...|$|R
40|$|Alkanes {{comprise}} a substantial fraction {{of crude oil}} and refined fuels. As such, they are prevalent within deep subsurface fossil fuel deposits and in shallow subsurface environments such as aquifers that are contaminated with hydrocarbons. These environments are typically anaerobic, and host diverse microbial communities that can potentially use alkanes as substrates. <b>Anaerobic</b> alkane <b>biodegradation</b> {{has been reported to}} occur under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions. Elucidating the pathways of anaerobic alkane metabolism has been of interest in order to understand how microbes can be used to remediate contaminated sites. Alkane activation primarily occurs by addition to fumarate, yielding alkylsuccinates, unique anaerobic metabolites {{that can be used to}} indicate in situ anaerobic alkane metabolism. These metabolites have been detected in hydrocarbon-contaminated shallow aquifers, offering strong evidence for intrinsic anaerobic bioremediation. Recently, studies have also revealed that alkylsuccinates are present in oil and coal seam production waters, indicating that anaerobic microbial communities can utilize alkanes in these deeper subsurface environments. In many crude oil reservoirs, the in situ anaerobic metabolism of hydrocarbons such as alkanes may be contibuting to modern-day detrimental effects such as oilfield souring, or may lead to more benefical technologies such as enhanced energy recovery from mature oilfields. In this review, we briefly describe the key metabolic pathways for anaerobic alkane (including n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and cyclic alkanes) metabolism and highlight several field reports wherein alkylsuccinates have provided evidence for anaerobic in situ alkane metabolism in shallow and deep subsurface environments...|$|R
