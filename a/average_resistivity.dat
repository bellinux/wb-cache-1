The van der Pauw Method employs a four-point probe placed {{around the perimeter of the}} sample, in contrast to the linear four point probe: this allows the van der Pauw method to provide an <b>average</b> <b>resistivity</b> of the sample, whereas a linear array provides the resistivity in the sensing direction.

50|$|The {{improvement}} in conductivity in going from earlier aluminium to copper based conductors was modest, {{and not as}} good as to be expected by a simple comparison of bulk conductivities of aluminium and copper. The addition of barrier metals on all four sides of the copper conductor significantly reduces the cross-sectional area of the conductor that is composed of pure, low resistance, copper. Aluminium, while requiring a thin barrier metal to promote low ohmic resistance when making a contact directly to silicon or aluminium layers, did not require barrier metals {{on the sides of the}} metal lines to isolate aluminium from the surrounding silicon oxide insulators.Therefore scientists are looking for new ways to reduce the diffusion of Cu into Si substrates without using the buffer layer. One method is to use Cu-Ge alloy as the interconnect material so that buffer layer (e.g. TiN) is no longer needed.

30|$|A {{resistivity}} log {{is controlled}} by the electrical conductivity of the fluid contained in the rock porosity and by the electrical properties of the rock. Resistivity decreases in formations containing water and is even lower for conductive fluids that contain salts, such as brines. Similarly, resistivity is low for clay minerals, pyrite, and hematite, which are conductive minerals. Laterologs and focused resistivity arrays are common data acquisition tools for hydrocarbon wells carried out in sedimentary formations to find caprock or permeable zones containing oil or gas and to evaluate hydrocarbon saturation (Serra 1984). It is not possible to use the same petrophysical parameters to directly interpret laterolog resistivity in granite environments, because the contributions of matrix and fracture conductivities can vary by several orders of magnitudes among unaltered and altered granite zones and areas with different clay contents and fracture densities, whether or not sealed. Resistivity was measured with five electrode configurations, yielding five apparent resistivity values (RLA 1 – 5) (Schlumberger 2018).

The fabricated materials were characterised using powder x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, resistivity, V-I traces, a. c. magnetic susceptibility and d. c. magnetic hysteresis. A new approach for measuring the resistivity of grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials is presented. The <b>average</b> <b>resistivities</b> of the grain boundaries ρ_GB in micro- and nanocrystalline YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 are much {{higher than that of}} the grains (ρ_G) which leads to huge ρ_GB/ρ_G values of 2 × 10 ^ 3 and 1. 6 × 10 ^ 5 respectively. For nanocrystalline Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 and both micro- and nanocrystalline Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 samples, ρ_GB/ρ_G is at least 10 ^ 3. Only microcrystalline Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 has a very low ρ_GB that is similar to ρ_G such that ρ_GB/ρ_G≈ 1. The values of grain boundary resistivity measured in our samples were used in conjunction with a theoretical framework developed in Durham, to quantitatively calculate how high grain boundary resistivities must be to account for the decrease by several orders of magnitude in transport critical current density J_c in polycrystalline YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 and Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10. We conclude that the significant effort made by the research community in texturing samples and removing the grain boundaries is well-founded. For low-temperature superconducting intermetallics such as Nb 3 Sn, we demonstrate that increases in J_c by two orders of magnitude is still possible by completely removing the grain boundaries from these materials and incorporating additional artificial pinning. Only large-grained polycrystalline Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 has sufficiently low grain boundary resistivity, that cost constraints for applications may yet lead to high J_c polycrystalline materials that have artificial pinning sites or pinning produced by irradiation...|$|R
40|$|A {{chemical}} vapor deposition reactor {{has been}} designed, built, and optimized for the deposition of copper thin films. The single wafer, stagnation point flow reactor features: six inch substrate capacity; direct metering and vaporization of liquid precursor; reactant introduction into the reactor chamber through a multi-zone precursor injection manifold; optional variable power (0 - 300 W) RF plasma assist; manual loadlock; and, a computer control interface. Substrate temperature uniformity has been measured {{to be better than}} 1 % across the substrate over a wide range of temperatures. The injection manifold was designed for precise tailoring of gas flow characteristics across the substrate, incorporating four concentric, independently adjustable zones, each of which is controlled by a metering valve. Both Cu(I) trimethylvinylsilane hexaf luoroacetylacetonate (tmvs hfac) and Cu(II) hfac precursor chemistries have been used. Film properties were determined by four-point probe, surface profilometer, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The Cu(I) tmvs hfac chemistry yielded the best results with deposition rates exceeding lOOOA/min, <b>average</b> film <b>resistivities</b> below 1. 80 ^Q*cm, excellent step coverage, and complete gap fill...|$|R
40|$|Tin {{sulphide}} {{films have}} been grown by spray pyrolysis technique at different precursor concentrations varied in the range, 0. 01 – 0. 2 M keeping other deposition parameters constant. The physical {{properties of the}} deposited films were systematically studied {{in relation to the}} precursor concentration. The studies indicated that the films grown in the precursor concentration range, 0. 09 – 0. 13 M were nearly stoichiometric with the Sn, S ratio of 1. 06 and exhibited only SnS phase with a strong (1 1 1) preferred orientation that belongs to the orthorhombic crystal structure. These single-phase films showed an <b>average</b> electrical <b>resistivity</b> of 32. 9 Ω cm, Hall mobility of 139 cm^ 2 V^- 1 s^- 1 and carrier density of ∼ 10 ^ 15 cm^- 3. These films had an average optical band gap of 1. 32 eV with an absorption coefficient greater than 10 ^ 4 cm^- 1. These properties demonstrated that single-phase SnS films could be used as an absorber layer in the fabrication of heterojunction solar cells...|$|R
