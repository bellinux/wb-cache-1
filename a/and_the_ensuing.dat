5|$|After Egypt's central {{government}} collapsed {{at the end}} of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensuing</b> food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes. In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.|$|E
5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ensuing</b> Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby {{did not agree with}} some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.|$|E
