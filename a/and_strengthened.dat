5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} and disturbed weather, possibly {{related to}} outflow from Hurricane Isidore in the Atlantic basin, developed a circulation on September 23 and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 25. The depression headed northward <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> into {{a tropical storm}} that same day. Julio turned to the northwest and peaked in intesty as a minial tropical storm near Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. On September 26, Juli made landfall. The storm rapidly dissipated over Mexico.|$|E
5|$|An eastern {{extension}} of the monsoon trough south of Hawaii organized into Tropical Depression Two-C on August 27 <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> into Tropical Storm Ele six hours later. Despite the nearby presence of Alika, Ele developed rapidly <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> into a hurricane on August 28. After contributing to the dissipation of Alika, Ele continued intensifying. It reached Category2 intensity late on August 28 and quickly became a major hurricane six hours later. The hurricane then crossed the International Date Line and became a typhoon in the 2002 Pacific typhoon season. Typhoon Ele turned to the northwest after crossing the dateline and continued to strengthen. It reached Category4 before turning north and weakening again. After briefly restrengthening back into a Category4, the typhoon weakened {{and turned to the}} northwest. Ele was downgraded to a tropical storm on September 7, a depression on September 9, and then dissipated shortly afterwards. Ele did not affect land.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Humberto {{formed from}} an area of low {{pressure}} generated by Hurricane Gabrielle.

Humberto headed over the colder waters of the far north Atlantic Ocean, and dissipated quickly on September 27.|$|E

5|$|The Allies possessed little {{intelligence}} on western New Britain's terrain and {{the exact location}} of Japanese forces, so they flew extensive air photography sorties over the region, and small ground patrols were landed from PT boats.

5|$|Tropical Depression Fourteen {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave 1100 statute miles (1,770km) {{east of the}} Leeward Islands on September 1, <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> to Tropical Storm Maria the next day.

5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl was {{the third}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season.

After turning to the northeast, Beryl weakened over cooler waters. On July 21 it struck the island of Nantucket, and shortly thereafter it became extratropical.

5|$|A {{few years}} later, the current {{fortress}} was built {{close to the}} desert edge by the Zengid–Ayyubid lord Shirkuh. The latter's descendants held al-Rahba as a hereditary fief granted by Saladin until 1264. One of them, Shirkuh II, oversaw a third major reconstruction in 1207. Through the early Mamluk era (late 13th–14th centuries), the fortress was continuously restored <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> {{as a result of}} frequent sieges by the Ilkhanid Mongols of Iraq. Al-Rahba was the most important Mamluk fortress along the Euphrates, an administrative center and the terminal stop on the sultanate's postal route. It fell into disuse during Ottoman rule (1517–1918) and from then until the early 20th century, the fortress primarily served as a shelter for local shepherds and their flocks. Excavations were carried out at the site between 1976 and 1981.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed over the southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first depression of the year on May 2. The depression intensified {{under the influence of}} a high-level anticyclone and became a cyclonic storm the next day. The storm then turned to the northeast <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a well-defined eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on September 9 and became Tropical Depression Fourteen-E later that day. The cyclone moved northwest <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> into {{a tropical storm}} on September 10. Linda then rapidly intensified, reaching hurricane intensity the next day as an eye formed. On September 12, Linda reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of —making it a Category5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale—and a minimum pressure of 902mbar (902hPa), making it the most intense Pacific hurricane ever recorded until Hurricane Patricia surpassed it in 2015. However, Linda soon moved over cooler waters, and began to weaken, falling below hurricane intensity on September 16. It then slowly weakened and dissipated on September 17.|$|E
