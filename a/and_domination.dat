5|$|Halo Wars 2 {{features}} {{a number of}} multiplayer modes that can be played online with up to six players. Skirmish is a cooperative or solo play mode against AI opponents. Deathmatch involves eliminating the opponent's army. Stronghold <b>and</b> <b>Domination</b> are territorial modes centered around controlling bases or nodes on the map. Blitz is a mode that combines elements from collectible card games with RTS gameplay by replacing the base building and resource management with a card-and-deck mechanic for unit deployment. Players create decks from card packs that are earned by playing the campaign mode and completing daily challenges. Each card {{features a}} unit that is deployed on the battlefield. Energy is the resource for using cards; more powerful units have a higher energy cost. Energy generates automatically throughout a match and more can be collected as additional energy supplies are dropped onto the map periodically. There is single-player and cooperative variant of Blitz named Firefight, which pits players against waves of AI enemies.|$|E
5|$|Operation Restore Hope was an American {{military}} operation {{with the support}} of the United Nations that was formed to deliver humanitarian aid and restore order to the Northeast African nation of Somalia, which was suffering from a severe famine, anarchy, <b>and</b> <b>domination</b> by a number of warlords following the collapse of Siad Barre's Marxist government and the outbreak of the Somalian Civil War. On January 30, 1993, Private First Class Domingo Arroyo, Jr. (1979–1993), a Marine from Puerto Rico, became the first of three Marines of Hispanic descent to die in what is known as the Battle of Mogadishu from a total of 45 American soldiers killed during the operation. The other two were Sergeant Lorenzo Ruiz and Lance Corporal Jesus Perez. Ruiz was ambushed in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, by Somali warlords. Perez was killed in a training accident involving an 81mm mortar.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began work}} on the {{expansion}} in summer 1998, but the task became complicated by Epic's organizational structure. During the development of Unreal, the team members at Digital Extremes were working in Ontario, Canada, while the members at Epic were based in North Carolina, United States, requiring regular travel to Ontario. To remedy this, Epic decided to centralize the teams in Raleigh, North Carolina, and by September, work on the expansion could begin. Lead programmer Steve Polge set about laying the foundations for the new game types, such as Capture the Flag <b>and</b> <b>Domination,</b> and level designers created {{the first round of}} maps for testing. The content grew quickly, and soon the team realized that it had underestimated the task. In November, after a meeting with publisher GT Interactive, Mark Rein suggested releasing the work as a standalone game instead of an expansion. The team was reticent at first, but soon accepted the idea, and in December the game became known internally as Unreal: Tournament Edition.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{following}} {{sequence of}} inequalities is well-known in domination theory: ir ⩽ γ ⩽ i ⩽ β 0 ⩽ ⌈ ⩽ IR. In this chain, ir and IR are the irredundance and upper irredundance numbers, respectively, γ and ⌈ are the <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> upper <b>domination</b> numbers, <b>and</b> i and β 0 are the independent <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> vertex independence numbers. In this paper we investigate the above chain of inequalities for cubic graphs, i. e., regular graphs of degree 3. We attempt {{to extend the}} above chain for cubic graphs by including the parameters γ−, ⌈−, γs and ⌈s, where γ− and ⌈ are the minus <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> upper minus <b>domination</b> numbers, respectively, <b>and</b> γs and ⌈s are the signed <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> upper signed <b>domination</b> numbers, respectively...|$|R

These generalisations {{are based on}} the probabilistic method and they imply new upper bounds for the {k}-domination and total k-domination numbers. Also, we study threshold functions, which impose additional restrictions on the minimum vertex degree, and present new upper bounds for the aforementioned numbers.

25|$|Occupied {{from the}} Jemdet Nasr period, about 3000 BC, Eshnunna {{was a major}} city during the Early Dynastic period of Mesopotamia. Beginning {{with the rise of}} the Akkadian Empire, Eshnunna oscillated between periods of {{independence}} <b>and</b> <b>domination</b> by empires such as the Third Dynasty of Ur and Isin. Because of its promise of control over lucrative trade routes, Eshnunna could function somewhat as a gateway between Mesopotamian and Elamite culture. The trade routes gave it access to many exotic, sought-after goods such as horses from the north, copper, tin, and other metals and precious stones. In a grave in Eshnunna, a pendant made of copal from Zanzibar was found.|$|E

25|$|Caroline Owens, Anna Marie West, {{and several}} other {{survivors}} of sexual assaults at the Wests' hands each testified at Rose's trial {{that she had been}} by far the more calculating, aggressive and controlling of the two, with Owens also stating that, at one stage in her ordeal, Fred had confided that Owens had been abducted primarily for Rose's gratification. It is possible Rose's increasing family size, plus the fact she and her husband had, by the mid-1970s, begun seeking avenues to exploit girls from care homes in addition to acquiring contacts—willing or unwilling—to submit to their fetishes, may have led Fred and Rose to decide that these avenues of control <b>and</b> <b>domination</b> were sufficient for their satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{efforts and}} fervor of the {{erstwhile}} Anti-colonial {{leader of the}} Dervish state of Somalia, who {{by the time of}} his death had reclaimed and united large swathes of the lands historically territorial to the Somali peoples, to this day inspires and mobilizes the autochthonous peoples of Somalia to form a consolidated bulwark against imperialism (namely that of Ethiopia) as captured in the struggles of the Islamic Courts Union, the Ogaden National Liberation Front, and the former Western Somali Liberation Front. Hassan has thus become more than just a token of pride for the various sectional groups in Somalia, but has also been seen by some as icon of Pan-Somalism, at times even distinguished as one of the great revolutionaries of the turn of the 20th century by notable Pan-Africanist movements, who led the Senussid resistance against the Italians.

25|$|Proletarian internationalism saw {{itself as}} a {{deterrent}} against war, because people with a common interest {{are less likely to}} take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the ruling class. According to Marxist theory, the antonym of proletarian internationalism is bourgeois nationalism. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view nationalism, racism (including anti-Semitism) and religion as divide and conquer tactics used by the ruling classes to prevent the working class from uniting against them. Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up anti-imperialist positions. Anarchism has developed a critique of nationalism that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power <b>and</b> <b>domination.</b> Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by Rudolf Rocker in Nationalism and Culture and by the works of Fredy Perlman, such as Against His-Story, Against Leviathan and The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} was the liberation of the socii from the perpetual intertribal warfare of the pre-hegemonic peninsula. Endemic chaos {{was replaced by the}} pax Romana. Each socius' remaining territory was secure from aggression by neighbours. As warfare between socii was now prohibited, inter-social disputes were settled by negotiation or, ever more frequently, by Roman arbitration. The confederation also acted as the peninsula's defender against external invasion <b>and</b> <b>domination.</b> Gallic invasions from the North were, from 390 BC when the Senones Gauls destroyed Rome, seen as the most serious danger and continued into the 1st century BC. Many were so large that they could only realistically be turned back by a common effort of all Italians, organised by the confederation. The Romans even coined a specific term for such a mobilisation: the tumultus Gallicus, an emergency levy of all able-bodied men, even men over 46 years of age (who were normally exempt from military service). During the 3rd century BC, the confederation successfully repulsed the invasion of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal, which threatened to subject the whole peninsula to Greek and Punic domination respectively. The last such levy was as late as 60 BC, on the eve of Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul itself.|$|E
