Collecting fees from the public can <b>aid</b> finance <b>for</b> improving <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> service. This study evaluates willingness to pay (WTP) by 401 households, selected using a stratified sampling method from all 15 wards of Gorkha municipality of Nepal <b>for</b> improved <b>waste</b> collection service and the factors influencing it. We employed a contingent valuation method to elicit households’ WTP, logit regression model to determine factors influencing WTP and tobit regression model to determine factors influencing the maximum amount households {{are willing to pay}} <b>for</b> improved <b>waste</b> collection service. Majority of households (61 %) are willing to pay an average amount of NRs. 73. 38 (0. 72 US$) per month. Factors that significantly influence households’ WTP are monthly household income, education of household head, environmental awareness and waste collection service. Except for education of household head, all these factors significantly influence the maximum amount of money households are willing to pay. Concerned stakeholders and policy makers should consider these traits of households before enforcing a waste collection fee...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This {{purpose of}} this paper is {{concerned}} with the issue of designing and operating a sustainable <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> system, in rapidly growing urban areas. Some existing models <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> and the extent to which they could be applied in a specific environment - Cairo for example - are discussed. An integrated framework which can serve as a basis for the development of a sustainable <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> system is proposed. Sustainability of the system, opportunities and challenges, material re-use and recycling, composting, incineration and energy production and land-filling are examined. Relevant <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> and cost sub-models inherent to the system are discussed. In addition, some other environmental and social aspects are also debated. The main focus of this paper is to provide some insights into the design of a more effective and integrated sustainable <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> system applicable <b>for</b> developing economies. Design/methodology/approach - An in-depth analysis is carried out for the existing models and approaches <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> This has led to the development of a framework which can be implemented. Findings - A comprehensive conceptual framework <b>for</b> a <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> system is developed. The major inputs and expected outputs are clearly identified.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the topic {{integrated}} waste from each household, {{all the way to}} the centres <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> Purpose of this study was to obtain information on waste separation in individual households as well as information on whether individuals are aware of the importance of a proper segregation of waste. With this research I wanted to determine whether it is possible for an individual household to collecte seperate waste and whether respondents are aware of the role and activities of the centers <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> I was also wondering what respondents think about <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> in the context of the sustainable development concept. The survey involved 102 respondents between the ages of 12 and 74 years. The results showed that people are aware of the issue of inappropriate waste treatement, as well as awareness that as consumers they can affect the daily accumulated amounts of waste. Despite good awareness of people about proper waste separation there is still too little awareness about the work of the centres <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> In addition to waste collectioning the work of centers <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> is also sorting of waste, composting, mechanical biological treatment, treatment of bulky waste, sorting of mixed waste and separately collectioning of fractions, removal of recyclable materials in the reprocessing and waste disposal.

40|$|During recent decades, <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> has {{gradually}} shifted focus, from waste disposal to integrated <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> of potentially valuable resources and residues. The number {{and variety of}} waste streams to handle is large, {{as well as the}} diversity of treatment options available. This makes finding cost-effective and environmentally acceptable <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> solutions a complex task. Moreover, recovering resources from waste leads to interaction with sectors beyond <b>waste</b> <b>management,</b> such as the markets for material and energy, which increases the scope to analyse when looking <b>for</b> new <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> solutions. Systems engineering models <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> can serve as tools to assist decision-makers in the planning of <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> A systems engineering model for strategic planning of national <b>waste</b> <b>management,</b> NatWaste (National <b>Waste),</b> is presented in this thesis. NatWaste is a tool <b>for</b> finding synergistic <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> solutions and analysing the potential effect of different policy instruments and uncertainties in the system environment on a national level. Economic and environmental aspects are addressed. Decision-makers in strategic planning of national <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> are the potential target audience for the NatWaste model. A <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> study, performed in a real planning context in a Swedish region, provided important knowledge for developing NatWaste. Within the study, a decision basis that the region could use <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> planning was also developed. The use of the NatWaste model is demonstrated in studies of current issues in Swedish national <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> Technical options <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> and the potential influence of <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> policy on the choice of these options were central in all applications. The economic and potential global warming implications of recovering energy from waste in Sweden were analysed and compared from two perspectives - the <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> and the district heating perspectives. The effect of including indirect environmental impacts on the choice of <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> solutions on a Swedish national level was demonstrated. The studies show that the economic and environmental viability of <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> solutions are not only issues {{from the point of view}} of <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> Knowledge about the sectors that interact with <b>waste</b> <b>management,</b> such as district heating, power and material, and how they might develop can be crucial. This indicates that there is a potential for co-ordinating interacting sectors in both economic and environmental aspects. Systems engineering models <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management,</b> like the NatWaste model, are tools that can assist in planning of such strategies. However, information from these models needs to be complemented with that of tools addressing interacting sectors...|$|R

The alternatives involve facilities to be used for treatment, storage, and disposal of various wastes generated from DOE environmental restoration activities and <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> operations. The evaluation includes five types of waste (four types of radioactive waste plus hazardous waste), 49 sites, and numerous cases associated with each alternative <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> In general, the alternatives are evaluated independently for each type of waste and reflect decentralized, regionalized, and centralized approaches. Transportation of waste materials is an integral component of the EM PEIS alternatives <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> The estimated impact on human health that is associated with various waste transportation activities is an important component of a complete appraisal of the alternatives. The transportation risk assessment performed for the EM PEIS is designed to ensure through uniform and judicious selection of models, data, and assumptions that relative comparisons of risk among the various alternatives are meaningful and consistent. Among other tasks, Argonne National Laboratory is providing technical assistance to the EM PEIS on transportation risk assessment. The objective is to perform a human health risk assessment for each type of waste relative to the EM PEIS alternatives <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> The transportation risk assessed is part of the overall impacts being analyzed for the EM PEIS to determine the safest, most environmentally and economically sound manner in which to satisfy requirements <b>for</b> <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> in the coming decades...|$|R
