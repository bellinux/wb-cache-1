40|$|Old <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> in Europe: a {{comparative}} assessment of economic performance, Regional Studies. Recent academic and policy discourses on regional development in Europe promote {{the expansion of}} 'knowledge-based' economies and learning regions. The assumptions underpinning the new regional policy are cast into sharp focus by the experiences of old <b>industrial</b> <b>regions.</b> The paper engages with these issues through empirical research into the recent fortunes of old <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> in Western Europe, drawing upon material from the Eurostat database. The findings highlight diverse experiences among these old <b>industrial</b> <b>regions.</b> This {{raise questions about the}} role of different national varieties of capitalism in shaping regional trajectories and the different mechanisms of regional adaptation promoted in the different countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the article is to {{validate}} the mathematical models describing the innovative response in the <b>industrial</b> <b>regions.</b> The article gives a deep analysis of trends {{in the development of}} the Russian <b>industrial</b> <b>regions,</b> puts forward and tests the following hypotheses: the hypothesis of uneven economic development of different types of <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> (<b>regions,</b> strengthening its <b>industrial</b> status, new <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> and regions of deindustrialization), the hypothesis of the development identity of certain types of <b>industrial</b> <b>regions,</b> the hypothesis of the catalytic role of the state in the dynamics of innovation, the hypothesis of the existence of the resonance innovation in the economic system. The authors propose the innovative resonance methodology, show the conditions for the resonance in the economic system, describe the types of resonant response. The main methods used are: resonance effects, reproductive techniques and methods of economic-mathematical modelling. In the paper, the authors propose a mathematical formalization of the innovative resonance mechanism in the regional industrial system, which includes: a) the development model of investment by industry and reproductive sectors; b) the dynamic diversified (multi-sectoral) model of reproduction; c) the model of the adaptive management of the innovative self-development of regional industrial system; d) the model of the stability of innovation dynamics and extended reproduction. The authors study the innovative response in the <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> of Russia. In the context of innovation resonance, the authors examined the functional industrial policies of a typical <b>industrial</b> <b>region</b> and the resonant responses associated with its implementation. The results of the study presented in the paper can be used in the justification of the mechanisms of the regional industrial policy, as well as for the assessment of the regulatory impact of the existing legal acts...|$|R

In this paper we study the case of Twente and show how a well-networked university, the University of Twente (UT), has served as a focal point for both industrial and institutional attempts to promote regional upgrading. We conclude that for old <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> a university might be an essential driver of regional innovatio...|$|R
