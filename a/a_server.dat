5|$|Watson {{is based}} on commercially {{available}} IBM Power 750 servers that have been marketed since February 2010. IBM also intends to market the DeepQA software to large corporations, with a price in the millions of dollars, reflecting the $1 million needed to acquire <b>a</b> <b>server</b> that meets the minimum system requirement to operate Watson. IBM expects the price to decrease substantially within a decade as the technology improves.|$|E
5|$|All {{programs}} that wish to provide services-as-files to other programs speak a unified protocol, called 9P. Compared to other systems, this reduces {{the number of}} custom programming interfaces. 9P is a generic, medium-agnostic, byte-oriented protocol that provides for messages delivered between <b>a</b> <b>server</b> and a client. The protocol is {{used to refer to}} and communicate with processes, programs, and data, including both the user interface and the network. With the release of the 4th edition, it was modified and renamed 9P2000.|$|E

5|$|Freelancer {{features}} a multiplayer mode, allowing up to 128players to play {{together in a}} game. Multiplayer games are hosted on game servers; personal computers that meet the requirements for the game can act as <b>a</b> <b>server.</b> Gameplay {{is similar to the}} single-player mode, but is absent of story-driven quests. The server keeps individual records of the players' progress, and they can resume their game on their next log on to this server. A persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them.|$|E
5|$|Gundamma Katha {{is based}} {{partially}} on William Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew. It {{focuses on a}} widow named Gundamma and her two daughters. The film's main theme is the step-daughter Lakshmi facing problems because of the widow, and the former's suitor teaching the latter a lesson. Using the first conversation between Gundamma and Lakshmi, in which the former abuses the latter for disturbing her sleep, Narasaraju introduces Gundamma's mindset and behaviour. Further incidents include the dismissal of <b>a</b> <b>server</b> fired from a hotel after refusing {{to work as a}} servant in Gundamma's house, and Ghantaiah explaining Gundamma's character to Ramabhadraiah.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment America {{released}} {{news that}} PlayStation 3 consoles {{would be used}} as the dedicated servers for Warhawk. A photograph was released which showed <b>a</b> <b>server</b> room with several PlayStation 3 consoles in racks. Each server is able to support 32 players. The games developers have commented that the engine used in the game features technology which could not be easily implemented on any other platform, such as procedurally generated water and waves, as well as volumetric clouds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the release, Howse worked on updates {{to stabilize the}} game and provide a better experience for players. In addition, he plans to add new features, such as a friendly mode; another mode that allows people to set up teams; and {{a way for the}} player to choose <b>a</b> <b>server</b> to play on. Howse said that two major gaming companies had approached him to buy Slither.io. He had considered the idea, since he felt that it was stressful to maintain the game.|$|E
5|$|SAM {{has been}} used as a source of {{alignments}} for protein structure prediction to participate in the CASP structure prediction experiment and to develop a database of predicted proteins in the yeast species S. cerevisiae. HHsearch is a software package for the detection of remotely related protein sequences based on the pairwise comparison of HMMs. <b>A</b> <b>server</b> running HHsearch (HHpred) was by far the fastest of the 10 best automatic structure prediction servers in the CASP7 and CASP8 structure prediction competitions.|$|E
5|$|The DDoS {{attacks were}} at first {{carried out with}} the Gigaloader and JMeter {{application}}s. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood <b>a</b> <b>server</b> with TCP or UDP packets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead {{to a number of}} arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses. Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.|$|E

5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, removable media, etc.) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to <b>a</b> <b>server</b> program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E

He was hired as a draftsman at a local small business near Purdue. As a junior, he was hired as a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department to teach classes to freshman students.

5|$|Varma chose Raghuvaran to {{play the}} local crime boss, Bhavani. Varma wanted him to underplay the character, {{which was based on}} real life. Before {{accepting}} the role, Raghuvaran studied the mannerisms and lifestyles of mob leaders and criminals in Mumbai for 20 days. Varma wanted to name the characters played by Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran as Bhavani and Siva respectively. At Nagarjuna's request, he reversed the names. Varma chose newcomers Chakravarthy, Jithendra, and Ramjagan to play J. D., Chinna, and Naresh after auditioning them at Annapurna Studios. Uttej, one of Varma's assistant directors, played a comic role of <b>a</b> <b>server</b> in the college canteen. He recommended Varma to cast Sushma for Keerthi's role.|$|E

5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be <b>a</b> <b>server,</b> whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the client computer and players are recommended to choose <b>a</b> <b>server</b> in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push Notification Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and authenticate unique identifiers (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and responds with the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to <b>a</b> <b>server</b> owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request. If the authentication succeeds, the data to be transmitted is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E
