Firstly, {{relative}} to APS and TZPS, after 2015,with post- 1990 s and 2000 s baby busters successively entering into labor market and post- 1960 s baby boomers just now starting to reach the age of receiving pension, the PAYGS of current young people supporting current old people will make pension outlay of Chinese economy <b>already</b> <b>lack</b> of labor force more bigger, reduce household savings and social investment, which {{will lead to the}} decrease of capital stock; secondly, relative to APS and TZPS, the pension of PAYGS does not take part in future production and increase capital stock. Therefore, its output and per capita output is more lower than that of TZPS and APS. Why gross output and per capita output of TZPS is lower than that of APS? TZPS is a pension system dominated by PAYGS, compared to APS. Its cumulative effect and capital increase effect is weaker than that of TZPS. In the case of same number of labor population, TZPS has lower capital stock, so gross output and per capita output of TZPS is lower than that of APS.|$|E

Newborns wore either light clothing (bodysuit and a light wrapping) or heavy clothing (pyjamas, cardigan and sleep-sack). The percentages of time each subject spent in different postures were compared between clothing situations. Arm and hand postures differed in relation to clothing: babies bent their arms more and held their hands nearer their heads when in bodysuits than when in sleepwear. Consequently, babies in bodysuits spent more time touching their body or their environment whereas the others generally were touching nothing. Self-touch is an important way to comfort one's self.

40|$|In a May 19, 2008 {{interview}} on the Voice of America INTSORMIL scientist Mitch Tuinstra, a Purdue University sorghum breeder, reported on sorghum seed {{that he and}} his colleagues have produced that can protect sorghum crops from a weed called Striga. Although their target weed has a pleasant looking purple flower it’s action is far from pleasant. Striga causes six or seven billion dollars in crop damage every year to African grain sorghum. Striga, called ‘witchweed’ in Africa, is parasitic on sorghum, stealing water and nutrients from sorghum roots. Witchweed has an unusual quality, it requires chemical signals from sorghum seeds to grow. The minute witchweed seeds (less than 0. 5 mm) can lie in the soil for years and begin to grow only when they receive the needed chemical signals provided by the presence of sorghum roots. Thus, a fallow period does not control witchweed. Tuinstra warns that if you see witchweed on your farm, you are in trouble because the plant can completely destroy vast areas of sorghum, is very difficult to remove and it often strikes farmers who work the poorest land. This means disaster for people who <b>already</b> <b>lack</b> enough to eat. To deal with witchweed, researchers developed special sorghum-seed genes which allow these seeds to accept certain herbicides without being harmed and these herbicides on the sorghum seed kill the witchweed as the sorghum grows. Greenhouse tests of the seeds in the Netherlands, and similar studies in sorghum fields in Mali and Niger, showed the treatment to be effective, low cost and safe to farmers...|$|E

Participation in the survey was voluntary, and it might be argued that managers who care more about compliance are both, more likely to comply with company regulations and more likely to participate in the study, so the compliance reported might be overestimated. Unfortunately, there is little to be done about it. Further, one might argue that, if managers who are more sensitive to compliance themes participated more often, the estimated effect of codes might be affected, too. This may imply two things: first, the effect of codes is overestimated, because the sample reacts more sensitive to a code. But this argument is not in line with the finding that not all codes matter but only some. Second, the effect of the code is underestimated, because it is of less relevance for a sample of managers who behave correct <b>already.</b> <b>Lacking</b> the data on the degree to which self-selection occurred, there is little definitive to be said about this problem.|$|R
40|$|Cilia are {{multifunctional}} organelles {{implicated in}} many human diseases. Cilia project from the cell surface {{and thus are}} well-situated for roles both in motility and sensory reception. The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a useful model system for studies of cilia due to its combination of genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. At the base of cilia are modified centrioles called basal bodies, which are connected with cilia via a transition zone. Ciliary assembly and disassembly must be co-ordinated with cell cycle progression because the basal bodies must be freed in order to organize the mitotic spindle. Ciliary disassembly can occur either by deflagellation, a drastic stress response, or resorption, a gradual process normally occurring before cell division. I hypothesized {{that there might be}} commonality between the two pathways for ciliary loss. I discovered that cells with mutations in ciliary assembly invoke deflagellation in some circumstances, and resorption in others. Deflagellation mutants also exhibited resorption defects, supporting my hypothesis. To further explore the relationship between deflagellation and cell cycle, Qasim Rasi and I examined katanin, a microtubule-severing protein implicated in deflagellation in Chlamydomonas, and in mitosis in mammalian cells. A reverse genetics approach revealed that the only cells that can survive knock-down of katanin are mutants which <b>already</b> <b>lack</b> cilia. This led us to form the hypothesis that the role of katanin in the cell cycle is related to its cilia-severing activity. In support of this idea, I observed that wild-type cells entering mitosis sever their cilia to free the basal bodies. Katanin-mediated deflagellation is defective in fa 2 mutants, and FA 2 {{is a member of the}} Nek family of mitotic kinases. The Neks are a large family of kinases and through evolutionary analyses, Brian Bradley and I discovered that the family expanded early in eukaryotic evolution and it is likely that Neks co-ordinate the cycle of ciliary assembly and dissasemby with cell cycle progression. This study also identified the Chlamydomonas Nek CNK 3 as an orthologue of the human disease gene Nek 8, suggesting an avenue to further disease-related research...|$|E

By year 2100, the global human population is expected to grow to 10. 4 billion under median fertility variants or higher under constant or higher fertility variants (Table 6. 1) with over three-quarters living in developing countries and in regions that <b>already</b> <b>lack</b> the capacity to produce enough food. With current agricultural practices, the increased demand for food and nutrition would require about 2 billion hectares of additional cropland, about twice the equivalent to the land area of the United States, and lead to significant increases in greenhouse gas productions associated with agricultural practices and activities (Tillman et al., 2011). For example, during 1960 – 2010, world population more than doubled from 3 to 7 billion. The nutritional demand of the population also grew swiftly during this period from an average of about 2000 calories per day per person in 1960 to nearly 3000 calories per day per person in 2010. The food demand of increased population along with increased nutritional demand during this period was met by the “green revolution,” which more than tripled the food production, even though croplands decreased from about 0. 43 ha per capita to 0. 26 ha per capita (FAO, 2009). The increase in food production during the green revolution was the result of factors such as: (1) expansion of irrigated croplands, which had increased in 2000 from 130 Mha in the 1960 s to between 278 Mha (Siebert et al., 2006) and 467 Mha (Thenkabail et al., 2009 a,b,c), with the larger estimate due to consideration of cropping intensity; (2) increase in yield and per capita production of food (e. g., cereal production from 280 to 380 kg/person and meat from 22 to 34 kg/person (McIntyre, 2008); (3) new cultivar types (e. g., hybrid varieties of wheat and rice, biotechnology); and (4) modern agronomic and crop management practices (e. g., fertilizers, herbicide, pesticide applications) [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{respond to}} {{an article in the}} February 2008 issue of 2 ̆ 7 Teacher 2 ̆ 7 by Jeffrey Hodges, {{entitled}} 2 ̆ 7 Think critically: against mandatory ICT 2 ̆ 7. (1) Peter Kent argues that ICT amplifies quality teaching and improves student learning. Equally, it has the capacity to amplify poor teaching - but that is no reason to resist it. It is almost clichéd to say that ICT is just a tool, but that is all it is. ICT can make good practice inspired and mediocre practice dreadful. Either way, it is the practice, or the uses of the tool, that are relevant, not so much the tool itself. Of course ICT for ICT 2 ̆ 7 s sake will rarely be successful, and if teachers are to take advantage of ICT they need to know what quality teaching and learning with ICT looks like. And of course classrooms need to be equipped with sufficient ICT to make it practical to integrate as well. It {{is fair to say that}} these factors are not present in all schools. While we can have a debate about the place of ICT within the curriculum and schools more generally, let us move the debate on, asking not whether we should or should not integrate ICT but how we should integrate it. (2) Rob McEwan argues that if education is to include opportunities to learn with and through technology, and not just about technology, teachers need to be competent in the use of ICT across the curriculum. We need to think of ICT as a technology just like a book or even a stick drawing in sand. Just as children learn to read in the early years of schooling and then use this skill across all curriculum areas, students and teachers need to develop a high level of competence in ICT that they can then transfer. ICT in schools has enormous potential for education. At its best, ICT can enhance student learning and engagement across all curriculum areas while also developing student competence in the essential skills for the 21 st century. The question facing teachers is not whether to use ICT in education, but how well ICT is being used. If educators are not able to reconceptualise pedagogy and successfully integrate ICT as a learning tool in an information age where technology pervades almost all aspects of life, teachers risk disaffecting a generation of students for whom schooling may <b>already</b> <b>lack</b> relevance.

The advent of an oxygen-rich atmosphere proved detrimental to ferredoxin owing to iron limitation and oxidative damage to the iron–sulfur cluster, and many microorganisms induced flavodoxin expression to replace ferredoxin under stress conditions. Paradoxically, ferredoxin was maintained throughout the tree of life, whereas flavodoxin is absent from plants and animals. Of note is that flavodoxin expression in transgenic plants results in increased tolerance to multiple stresses and iron deficit, through mechanisms similar to those operating in microorganisms. Then, {{the question remains open}} as to why a trait that still confers plants such obvious adaptive benefits was not retained. We compare herein the properties of ferredoxin and flavodoxin, and their contrasting modes of expression in response to different environmental stimuli.

Geographical distribution of phototrophs shows a bias against flavodoxin-containing organisms in iron-rich coastal/freshwater habitats. Based on these observations, we propose that plants evolved from freshwater macroalgae that <b>already</b> <b>lacked</b> flavodoxin because they thrived in an iron-rich habitat with no need to back up ferredoxin functions and therefore no selective pressure to keep the flavodoxin gene.
